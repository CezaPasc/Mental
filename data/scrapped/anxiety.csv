Does anybody fear getting to bed due to spiraling into thoughts for hours,"So for a while now, whenever it's bedtime and I lay down to sleep, my mind kinda starts to panic and basically develops a mind of its own.

It stops happening if I start doing something like I'm writing this post now but eventually you have to stop doing anything to fall asleep.

At this point, I just know that as soon as I'm gonna hit the bed, this is going to be waiting for me. The mental torture I have to go through is something that I can't even begin to describe. Not just due to this thinking, but also because I'm so tired physically and I just have to go through this till my body gives up, which can be a few hours and sometimes takes till the morning.

So I just hate/fear the night now and I just don't wanna lay down and stop doing anything, till my body allows me to, but I still try as I have this slight hope that I might be able to avoid it today if I dont think about it. 

Honestly, I don't know. Idk whether I cause it myself by thinking that it's gonna happen or this is just how it is now?

Ik its probably a little too specific, but has anybody else ever experienced it? If so, any tips?",1
Anyone experience more physical anxiety than emotional?,"I have generalized anxiety disorder (who doesn’t). I find my anxiety to be always more physical. Rather than usually feel nervous or doom, I feel lightheaded, dizzy, tight muscles, pains, fatigue, etc. That’s not to say I never experience the overthinking, anxious feelings, nervousness, etc. but about 75% of the time it’s physical symptoms. This naturally leads to health anxiety which is a delightful travel companion who was never invited. 

Anyone else have more physical symptoms than emotional?",1
I feel like I’m dying every day,"Big sufferer of health anxiety. I feel like I’m dying every day w crazy symptoms like fatigue, tiredness, random pains or feelings all over my body, headaches, dizziness, feeling like I can breath or my throat is closing, rapid hr, heart palpitations, chest discomfort, jitters literally it’s something different every single day I’d love to know if anyone else is on the same boat as me and how you cope?",1
fear of fainting,"I developed a stronggg fear of fainting since passing out during a blood draw. I have fainted 3 times in my life all due to medical stuff. But now i am so scared I will just faint from anxiety/panic. I am not hyperventilating, but i still feel really faint/on the verge of fainting when i am panicky/anxious. My brain gets super overstimulated. Does anyone relate??? Support please!!",1
Anyone else feel like their anxiety gets worse after a good day,"I'm so sick of this happening, I'll have a good day where I get along with people. I'll have fun, be able to talk to people without my anxiety butting in. Then I'll go home and suddenly every little thing dumps onto me and I'm convinced everyone is so tired of me, are too nice to tell me I'm annoying I'll stress over everything I did wrong. I'll want to cry and shut myself off again and not speak to people ever again.

Everything was going so good, but then I've ruined the day for myself and I wish I had never gone.  


Curious if anyone else has the same problem.",1
I just got palpitations from anxiety. Anxiety is worsening.,"I feel like I am having a heart attack, I can literally feel my heart in my butt and my entire back. My pulse is currently at 115-125 I am a 15 yo healthy male. Since the day of elections, my anxiety is skyrocketing. I am on prozac 20 mg but it doesn't help anymore. I also can't eat properly because I suddenly got sensitive to lots of things. Should I ask my doctor about benzodiazepines, I really need some support. I can't do my work properly at the moment. I will see my doctor 6 days later as scheduled.",1
I can’t cope anymore,"Good evening everyone, I don’t know where to start.

I can’t do this anymore.

Long story short, I have social anxiety and I always overthink.

I am a college student in a business school (I finish in a year) and I have 0 friends.

What I’m about to describe always happens to me ever since high school but today I’m just wondering why this keeps happening to me.

We often have teamwork during classes. When I’m in teams with other students, I feel very uncomfortable, especially around girls my age. I don’t come from a nice background and I feel so fucking worthless in front of these people. They all seem to be doing better than me in every spheres of life and that directly affects me. When we do group work, I have a hard time speaking up because I feel so uncomfortable around them and I feel like I can’t speak. I kid you not I panic so much i can’t talk.

Then when i do talk, I’m not even joking people ignore me and don’t even make eye contact, as if I were a ghost. I am never acknowledged and seen by people and it really is hurting my mental health. Can you imagine the courage it takes for me to speak up and then be fucking ignored by 4 people?

Whenever I’m in class i can’t concentrate as my mind is always thinking about how ugly and how useless and inferior i am to the rest of these people. 

I feel like a loser whenever I’m in class. I feel worthless. I feel that all these other students are far better than me in every aspects of life. And they probably are. They’re all good looking people while I’m the most ugliest guy out there (I’m 23 y/o and still never had a gf, it’s a me issue at this point). 

I really want to get a girlfriend who will be there by me and from who I’ll learn things and possibly improve my wellbeing. I just want to have a shoulder on which I can rest my heavy head.

I just can’t no more guys.

Idk what’s so bad about me that people feel disgusted about to treat me in such a way.

I’m often tired and when I do feel energized, I get totally overwhelmed by the way people treat me. I see all these other students talking with other students they never met, smiling and laughing and no soul even dares to ask me my pathetic name.

Wishing the best to the rest of you all.

Peace",1
Lack of understanding,"Been feeling quite anxious today but it’s been bearable, until I got online. 

Jumped on reddit and saw a post on r/AITA where some dude was complaining about how his girlfriend was introverted & didn’t like to socialise with anyone including his friends (she would not stop him from doing his own thing with his friends and socialising with whoever, she just didn’t want to partake)  so he staged an ambush on her where he invited her around to his house and then invited his friends as well without her knowing. She tried to be amicable with his friends but was obviously anxious, became “mute” as he put it and snuck out the back door 30 mins later. He then goes on to say how childish she is for not being able to deal with 1hr of talking. The general consensus was that he was the asshole for staging an ambush on her BUT she was the asshole for not wanting to socialise with anyone and that she should be socialising with him & his friends for the sake of the relationship. 

I really couldn’t believe that people were saying she was an asshole for not wanting to socialise with people. Honestly reading those comments made my anxiety skyrocket. They all had thousands of upvotes too meaning people agreed… now I can’t help but think that I am even more of a piece of shit for having anxiety and not being able to socialise. Whatever i guess. Just ranting. That whole thread reinforced my negative beliefs.",1
Anyone help with my current anxiety,"I usually am good about this, but I an anxious over something I never have been before.

I live with other people, and I noticed that the room beside me has a light on and the door is open a little bit, and the person that sleeps in that room should not be here today so either I didn't notice that during today or he came home and is in there. I want to check for intruders, but I don't want to knock on the door because it's very late at night and I may wake him if he is in there and I'm anxious about bothering him so late. If I don't check I'll be bothered all night and not be able to sleep.

I just need to check if anyone is in the room and if I can shut the light off because I am also anxious of it over heating and starting a fire if its been on all day. But I don't want too invade his space without permission.",1
My heart rate is stucked on fast mode for the past couple of years,Why is this,1
anyone else or am I just crazy?,"So I have this weird thought when I feel anxiety attack coming. I say to myself ""stop that's childish"" or ""that's immature"". And so I don't have an anxiety attack. I know they are not childish or immature or stupid. Like say a friend came to me having an anxiety attack  I wouldn't say ""get over yourself "" or ""that's childish"" wtf? I would never say that, yet I tell myself that. Wtf is wrong with me. Btw I was diagnosed with anxiety years ago and used to take meds and should but I do have and have been diagnosed, just to clear things up if anyone is wondering. I mean this could be truma . When I lived with my parents my dad was emotionally abusive and he told me I didn't have anxiety and I would ""know"" if I had anxiety. It could be that. Idk. I just don't know and I feel like I'm so messed up and like seriously what is wrong with me?! Some ever experience this?",1
I'm afraid my anxiety is going to ruin my relationship.,"This was a bit lengthy, so thank you to those taking the time to read this, apologies in advance!

\*\~**Possible trigger warning** I do talk about specific behaviors and I do not know if that will be triggering. More context may be added as well.\~\*

Note: This may count as an update to a previous post.

For context, me and this guy decided to rekindle our relationship, and are attempting to take things slow. A lot happened between us, and he seems to be doing better now.

But, my anxiety is and has always been really bad, and I'm afraid it will push him away. From thinking he's ignoring me when he doesn't text, to wondering if he'll find someone else, someone better, you name it. But rest assured, none of this is his fault. He is a very sweet guy, never cheated, very honest, always reassures me when I need it, and above all he's never harsh or rough to me during a disagreement. All in all, a good guy. He's not perfect, obviously, but who is?

However, my anxiety gets to me fairly often, which causes me to overthink. I do my best to push it aside or distract myself, but of course, it gets to me. Unfortunately, I have a hard time communicating to him that something is wrong. He might ask if I'm okay if I seem off, and I'll say ""I'm fine."" ""Don't worry."" Don't get me wrong, I am well aware why I tend to do this, and I will add that context, and more if needed. So I'll move on with the big question.

How do I deal with anxiety? Does anyone have tips? Anything is appreciated, thank you in advance.

Note: Not sure if I need to say this, but this is a repost, I thought it might be better posted here.",1
idk how to deal with this,"ever since a couple months ago, I've felt that my anxiety has worsened. Back then, like a year ago or so, it had been bad on some days but overall I could force myself through them. However, recently I've felt that it's become unbearable. 

I constantly feel this tight grip on my heart and I feel like puking and I get trembly and blurry visions occasionally. I dreaded living as a whole. While there were those minute moments where I've forgotten about my fears and paranoia, I feel that every hour of every day I feel this terrible feeling in my chest. I can't exactly describe it but it's this uneasy feeling and it's just bad. so so bad. It makes me lose my appetite and I don't like how things have gotten for me.

I used to really enjoy doing my hobbies like learning the guitar and drawing but nowadays even doing those things is difficult because my mind's always in a state of worry and I can't stop it.

I try to calm myself by depriving myself of my senses which used to work wonders but I just can't stop it. Its the fact that it's everyday for the past few months I've felt like this makes it terrible.

I hate going to school. I hate seeing people. I hate leaving my room.

At first I thought I could ride this one through, that it'd end soon but no it hasnt.

It's to the point where I actually really can't talk with people and I'm alone in school. I feel that I've avoided my friends to hide away in toilet stalls because the sight of so many people has become so sickening that I tend to panic so much that I have to isolate myself. As bad as it seems, I feel like isolating myself somewhat helped me through some bad times.

I'm constantly in fear of people and all I want is to hide away and live life invisible. I don't know why I'm this way and I don't know how to stop it.

and now that I've got group projects where I need to partner up with people, it's a pain for me since I don't have anymore friends and everyone else does.

I've got no one to talk to and my parents don't believe in mental health being such a big issue and once I told my mum and she said it'll pass. 3 years later and it's gotten worse so!

Does anyone have any advice?",1

Feeling extremely overwhelmed right now. I have fuck ton of pending work left and I'm just frozen I have palpations almost all the times I think. I've even started losing hair because of it.
I really don't know what to do I'm just sitting here rn, anxious, not even able to think straight.
I do meditate but even that helps only as long as I'm meditating and I'm taking therapy and meditation but my psychiatrist is not willing to prescribe anti anxiety medicine probably because you get used to it or something and I haven't gotten around to discuss this anxiety issue with my therapist.

Please help",1
Bottom of foot twitching,"It's been a few days at this point. Has anyone ever experienced this and does it go away? How long did it take? Is there anything I can do to cope with it in the meantime? I don't have any pain, weakness, or mobility issues. I don't think it's due to any health problem. It's just a very persistent little muscle twitch in the bottom of my foot. The issue is that no matter what I do, it just commands my entire attention and sets off my fight or flight response knowing that it's still happening. Honestly I'd be fine with the twitch if I didn't get so obsessed about it. I could really use some reassurance that it WILL go away eventually or techniques to stop focusing so much on it.",1
I’m anxious about my little sister,"Hello.. It’s my first time using this app to ask for advice because I seriously do not know what to do. I’m a sister (20) who has a little sister (16). My little sister is diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder and was doing therapy session and taking antidepressants. She was doing so well for 2 months after she decided to stop her medication. She stopped it without consulting her therapist. I didn’t realise this until she started withdrawing heavily from it.
She is currently feeling really sad and having mood swings. The thing that triggers her withdrawal symptoms is her being at school.

These past few weeks, she had a difficulty waking up to go to school and my mother gets mad at this. She wouldn’t wake up when my mom is trying to wake her up. She would groan and doesn’t get up. My mom (58) gets pissed because she cares about my sister’s education and feels like she would fail as a mother if she doesn’t have her daughter continue school.
My mother is also diagnosed with depression but takes her medication
however, I don’t think she understands what my sister is going through and can say things that I’m sure she doesn’t mean to.

I’m honestly really scared on what my sister is going to do.

She used to self-harm too but now she is doing it again..
she is also having suicidal thoughts and I’m worried she might take action.

What can I do to make her feel better but still proceed to going to school 
I know that it’s best for someone who has depression and having withdrawals to stay at home and heal better
but it is also an issue if she falls behind in her classes 
The school doesn’t seem to care either about it. I live in the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and mental health is not cared about in high school.
So I genuinely do not know what to do.

The plan so far is that she is booked again to see her therapist but it is next week and idk what i should at the moment.

I have a not a specific question to provide for you to answer. I just would like to know what someone would do if you are going through the same thing as me.",1
I feel heavy weight on my chest when I get tensed is it just normal or should I get checked,"Hello, 6 months ago I had to drop out of my college. I disliked the course and hated the atmosphere. The stress caused me to pass out. My pressure levels plummeted deep down due to that. 6 months later I'm now about to enroll in an another course in a different college, but I'm scared. Whenever someone mentions about it, I get this pain in my chest and it gets difficult to breathe. I even stop eating for the whole day. I get really scared and I keep thinking that I will mess it up again. I cannot sleep at night. Even if I sleep the moment I wake up the pain in my chest grows bigger. It's like a heavy rope around my chest, it hurts. I cannot talk about it to my family as they are not very keen on my mental health and will tell me that I'm just weak. I was wondering if it could lead to anxiety disorder or is it just like any normal stressful situation.",1
Everything Feels Hopeless,"It feels like the world is quickly declining.  The United States is becoming a hellhole, with Florida being the seventh ring, filled with insanity, ignorance, and hatred.  All of our leaders are old men who pine for days gone, or slightly younger old men who pine for the ""good ol days"" and ""christian values.""  We're on what feels like the verge of a third world war, and even if we weren't, climate change is going to change the world for the worse.  Even if every single person on this tried to make a change, we wouldn't be able to because corporations and celebrities would make any contributions towards fixing climate change worth nothing.  I went from having $5,000 in my bank account four years ago to having less than $200 because I lost my job to the pandemic and college sapping me dry.  I work at two dead-end part-time jobs because apparently my associates in science doesn't matter here.  I've got a mountain of student loan debt I'll be paying off for the rest of my life, and I can't even begin to try and pay it off because the cost of living is so high.  It feels like the world is collapsing in around me and there's nothing I can do to stop it.",1
Noise anxiety,"Hello, hope all are doing well 

I am wondering if anyone on here experiences anxiety triggered by noise, specifically at night and when trying to sleep. 

The sounds that trigger me are neighbours who are loud, even unintentional. These people are usual nice and respectful but I can’t help but be filled with anger and frustration when I’m exposed to these sounds or the expectation of them. 

I’ve been dealing with it for years and my last marriage ended because I just could not deal with kids noise at night from around the house even if it was reasonable. 

Has anybody found anything that helps? 

Thank you!",1

Unemployment/work anxiety,"I hate this so much, I feel embarrassed for being unemployed. Everybody else my age has amazing jobs and everybody else is working really hard progressing in their career and making money and building families. Meanwhile I'm jobless af. I have had various jobs in the past.... In high school, I worked as a cashier and stayed there for 4 years. I had a few other part time jobs during college as well.

I graduated college with my bachelor's degree at the height of covid in 2020, and had the hardest time finding any employment. I remember spending entire days applying for jobs and just never hearing anything. I some interviews here and there, would study my ass off about the company and interview skills and make absolute sure I did my best, would send thank you letters and the whole nine yards, but would get ghosted every time. I would even be applying for jobs thousands of miles away just hoping anyone would take me. Eventually I landed one job.....a minimum wage barista position at Starbucks. It was the worst job I ever had, I was mistreated by manager and shift leads every day, vastly overqualified with a degree, got paid so little and the work was so strenuous. I ended up putting in my notice, and then getting fired one day before my last day because I just couldn't keep up and my manager just had it out for me. I got another job later on, but it was also very low pay and the work environment was so horrible and the commute was so bad, that I didn't even last beyond my first week.

I continued to apply for hundreds of jobs and never got any callbacks. On top of my dad constantly hounding at me for being unemployed and struggling with horrible depression and anxiety, eventually I got so burnt out and couldn't stand the thought of applying for jobs anymore. I had just been through 20 years of school and spending the last 10 of those working shitty minimum wage jobs at the same time, stressed out applying for hundreds of these jobs, writing endless cover letters, dressing up for interviews....and going nowhere. I just got so burnt out because of it. I'm currently living mostly off of an inheritance that my grandparents left me and my siblings.

I feel guilty that I don't have a job. But I just feel so anxious around the thought of applying for jobs and also getting trapped in a bad environment where I'll be mistreated again. I feel so anxious of giving up all of my days to work for a company that doesn't respect me, underpays me and could easily replace me. I feel anxious about learning the ropes at new jobs as most companies I worked for had horrible training and the first 3 months were always hell. And in general I feel so aimless because my degree isn't even what I want to do with my life. I feel that I also wasted my youth, I wanted to do so much more while I was still young. I wanted to travel and make friends and have fun experiences but I basically have to give all of those dreams up to work some underpaying job with back breaking hours for the rest of my life. It sounds like my definition of hell. I just keep waiting for the day where I'll have some revolutionary idea that will save me from this, but it never comes.",1
Involuntary breath holding,"Recently I’ve noticed that I hold my breath with out realising that I’m doing it. I only know I’m doing when my chest hurts and feels like I’m going to pass out. I think this is a stress/anxiety response I do.

My life is crumbling away and I feel so scared..,"Hi everyone. I would like some support and advice as I feel like my life is at its end right now. I've been put into a very bad financial spot recently and it's put me at my wit's end. I've been unemployed to study and now all of the sudden, all of the financial burden has been put on my shoulders.

I've been applying to every job listing that I see have been relevant to my previous line of work, but the response time from companies is so agonizing. I don't know if they'll contact me back, let alone give me a chance at an interview. I can manage to get by for another 2 months from savings and I honestly don't know if I'll get anywhere before my savings run dry.

My biggest issue with anxiety at this moment is my inability to sleep and wake up peacefully. For these past two weeks, I've been heading to bed with a giant pit in my stomach and it haunts me to the point where I can't sleep. When I do sleep, it'd be from pure exhaustion of trying to fight the sense of doom. Even still, I would only sleep for 1 to 3 hours at a time. I'd wake up with the pit in my stomach feeling like it became a giant crater. I'd wake up sweating and frantically trying to seek the presence of others because I feel so alone. Often times no one else is home and my friends are still asleep, there's no one for me to cry to. I'm fairly new to feeling like this, is this what it's like to have a panic attack? It feels so terrible and it puts me on edge every morning.

This is certainly putting a strain on my friends and relationships. I've cried to them so many times already and I feel like at some point, everyone will understandably become tired of me and I'll lose my line of support. I don't know what to do. If anyone out there can share a piece of their story on how they overcame this terrible time, or how they're coping, please talk to me. I don't know what to do about this pit in my stomach and I just want to be able to sleep again.

EDIT: To clear the air, I am not asking/begging for money. I would just like some advice on how to overcome this and to hear everyone's story. I appreciate those who have made it this far into the post.",1

"Exercise brings on Physical Anxiety symptoms, anyone else?","Hi Folks.  
Last July i woke up in the middle of the night not feeling quite right, bit dizzy etc. I then proceeded to freak out and have a panic attack. Over the next 6 or so months i was constantly worried i was ill, to the point where i now have GAD regarding health.  


I've since had a whole load of tests done which are all clear, this plus the scattergun nature and fluctuation of my symptoms, confirms to me anxiety.  


I feel like i am turning a corner and getting better (started sertraline 3 weeks ago) but i am still having issues when exercising. An example of this would be a simple short, easy cycle/run bringing the onset of physical symptoms such as dizziness, tight chest, blurry eyesight etc. Before all this started i was quite fit and have ran marathons in the past so i have a decent idea how exercise feels and how my body should react to it.  


The only thing that makes sense to me here is that the stress caused by exercise tips my already quite high level of stress just over the edge and into a place where physical symptoms occur. Does this make sense and importantly, has anyone else been through this? It's frustrating to have been so active and now face this, especially when 95% of anxiety and exercise material is about the postive side effects.  


I also experience the onset of symptoms if i have caffeine, or sometimes during other controlled stress actions like, cold bath/shower, wim hof breathing  


Also, tired anxiety legs suckkkkkkkkk",1
I don't know if this is anxiety or an intellectual problem?,"I didn't go to pre-K, I did go to a morning class but I never went to pre-k. In 1st grade I went half days, and my mom would take me out in the afternoons. I did go to a homeschooling teacher for a little while, I can't remember how I did. Then 2nd through 4th grade I went normally. Then, she took me out to homeschool me, it didn't work out so she stuck me back in later in the year. 

I surely fell behind because I couldn't stay focused on my schoolwork at home, that's why my mom put me back in public schooling. Which I'm thankful for. I missed a lot of school through my education years, due to an illness I had which had me vomiting quite frequently. They took me out of class for math because I fell behind, and I had comprehension issues due to my ADHD. I have attention deficits. But, now it's gotten better. In 5th grade towards the end of the year they brought up to my mom they would like to place me on an IEP due to falling behind in a few subjects; Reading and Mathematics.

Fast forward to current time, given I was in an IEP I feel like I'm intellectually or developmentally delayed. I feel like I'm slow, I currently live at home and work in the hospital as a certified nursing assistant. I work full time, but I feel dumb. I pay rent at home even though I'm so bad with money it's insane. I'm impulsive with money especially, I prioritize things badly. I know I'm doing it too, it's just like impulsive. It's weird. I have bad anxiety, social anxiety as well.. anxiety for every situation it seems like. I've gone to therapy for it, because I feel like I'm existing... not living. My therapist says that given that I was able to pass my CNA state certification I'd have to be average or above average in intelligence to even pass it. 

I feel like everyone around me knows something is ""off"". Even though I haven't heard it, I'm sure they talk? I don't really care about anything else anyone has to say BUT the thought of them thinking that I'd be slow or intellectually delayed bothers me. As a kid I walked and talked on time, and passed my childhood milestones. It wasn't ever indicated I was intellectually delayed. 

I got employee of the month 2 months being in the hospital, but I've made big mistakes no one got hurt. I've been a CNA 4 years prior. These nurses are my age and younger and they seem so mature. I feel like sometimes I feel dumb and inadequate. I'm quiet, but I want to be smart and an intellectual. They always say how a hard job I do. These nurses hangout and are friends with each other. I feel out of sorts here. There's been times where they come sit by me cause I sit away from them. Do you think they think something is off? They seem to like me and keep me included. THEY are articulate, I think I'm articulate online but offline it's bad.

I am on all these meds and it’s still so bad. I was told my anxiety would improve with age, but it hasn’t so far, and I am in my mid 20’s. 

I have tried different types of therapy, multiple antidepressants. The only thing that really works is Klonopin. But it works so well I am scared of it, so I asked my doctor to not to prescribe it to me anymore. I am so tired of my brain never shutting up. :((",1

Huge fear of home invasion,"So I use to live in a Caribbean island where crime isn’t too good. Like you hear wild things. A innocent jewelry man was followed from his job and the robbers blocked the road, told him to leave his car at gun point, robbed him, and murdered him. A girl was driving with a friend when someone tailgated and bumped her car. She came out the car to investigate and she got kidnapped, raped, and dropped off. Imagine women being targets in their CARS. 

These crazy news got me paranoid thinking I’ll get a home invasion. Both of my parents are  in poor health so they can’t defend themselves. 

What makes me fear that I’m a high risk of home invasion is that we live in the rainforest alone with no neighbors and we have no security system. We have a vicious dog that hates strangers so I hope that can deter them. However I cant escape and hide in the bushes because the dog may attack me (The dog doesn’t recognize me since I live in the states). Whenever I hear all my dogs barking outside I get extremely anxious thinking someone is coming to harm us all. I even called the cops once and my mom got mad saying it’s the deer that the dogs are barking at. 

I really wanna visit my family more often but the fear of home invasion makes me not stay as often and only stay for a week.

Is there any advice or support you can give me to not fear of home invasion. I just fear a whole bunch of guys come and held us on gunpoint and I then get raped, and they leave with valuables and possibly our lives",1
"I've just graduated college, but I'm scared for my future.","I graduated from college on May 6th, and after 5 years, I got my Bachelors of Science in Management Information Systems (MIS).

After getting my new car last week (my last one got totaled in a fender bender) while staying with my parents, I came back home to my apartment. I began my job search today, but I only managed to get 3 applications out. 

I'm scheduled to be moved out of my apartment by July 1st, and I haven't even found a job yet to move into the next apartment complex I'm planning on going to.

There is just so much going on. Truthfully, all the uncertainty of my life going forward has me terrified.

I don't know how long it will take me to find a job. I have a feeling it'll take much longer than I thought, and I'm not sure what I'll do if I can't find one in time for me to leave and move. I can't even enjoy my free time because the uncertainty just clouds my mind so much.

Idk if anyone else felt this way, but it's an awful feeling. I feel helpless and scared, and all I can do is hope that things will fall into place.",1
Anxiety about being heard,"I don’t even know how to explain this. I recently moved into one half of a duplex, the other half is occupied by a couple and their dog. I get anxious walking around, thinking I am making too much noise and they can hear me. 

I feel like I can’t even enjoy my own space and live. I’m constantly on edge when I make any noise at all. I wonder if they are thinking about me, what im doing, etc. 

I honestly just want to tell myself to MIND MY OWN BUSINESS and forget they are even there but I just can’t… I don’t know what to do! I wish it was a separate house so I could feel like I really do have my own space",1
What to do if doctors aren’t taking me seriously (may have triggers from discussing my symptoms and worries),"Hey all, I have an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow and I’m so nervous. For a while my primary care physician has been prescribing my anxiety medication but none of it seems to help and I don’t feel like I’m being taken completely serious. My anxiety is making my life miserable. I have nausea and digestive issues almost daily(all day), no appetite, back pain, fatigue, and headaches. I constantly feel anxious with a pit in my stomach and all of these other symptoms. I’m also being treated for ADHD with a stimulant.

I desperately fear being labeled as drug seeking and not being taken seriously. I’ve been severely struggling for the last year and I’ve spent a lot of time trying out a couple meds but I’m still miserable.

I can’t even practice the breathing techniques or grounding exercises because most of the time idek what I’m anxious about OR I panic from holding in my breath.

What should I do if I’m not being taken seriously? I cannot do this anymore, my quality of life is awful.",1
Already ruining my summer.,"Thursday I bumped my head, basically on a scale of 1 to 10 maybe a 3. 
I had a terrible headache the next day and I ended up at urgent care, they did a head ct all clear. Ended up feeling ok by Sunday had some wine and got to enjoy a concert. 
I've had a lingering headache on and off since and some pain in my neck. Im a bit anxious about a slow bleed. The dr wasn't super worried but of course she said there can be a slow bleed that we wouldn't know about until symptoms show up. Im unfortunately on a blood thinner so that made them initially worried to do the scan and just being on these pills have given me anxiety. Id love to get an idea when I can relax a bit more. I've been pretty nauseous since and I had a few moments of dizziness.  No one could give me a solid answer on when i could potentially be in the clear and and i keep questioning if i I need to go back and get yet another scan and im constsntly checking for symptoms and every headache or bout of nausea freaks me out.  Im now worried about too many scans and wasting my life in a hospital. I have camping trips this summer and I just know this anxiety from stuff like this will ruin it. Anytime im too far from a hospital I instantly get panicky. How do you guys manage that? Im in therapy but doesn't work overnight. Sorry for the rant, needed to vent. Hope everyone is feeling ok tonight.",1
Adrenaline and cortisol?,"Lately my anxiety has worsened. Last 2 weeks consisted of a continuing bounding pulse and whooshing in ear coupled with chest pain,back pain,numbness,shortness of breath and more tachycardia then usual. I went to ER over the weekend and all was good with exception of high hr and bp at first and only this out of whack with bloodwork was high glucose. Last 3 days I have forced myself to walk 2 miles each day as well as some other physical activities. I feel 90% better. I'm sleeping now and I haven't had any weird symptoms except the bounding pulse. Were all my symptoms really due to excess built up adrenaline/cortisol that I wasn't releasing?",1
TW/ existential thoughts (the odd writing style is because it's taken from part of a book I wrote),"I feel as though I am using sex as a distraction. My feelings of impending doom slip through, but I hastily usher them away with more oxytocin and serotonin. When I am alone I feel restless, as though I must be doing something that I am not. This feeling seems a moot point because when I am alone all I have the energy to do is sit, dissociate, and find ways to not be alone. I wish to be healthy, I feel a sense of dread when I take my medication, remembering how unhealthy I've become. No amount of health will prevent what befalls us all in the end, so what is the point? These thoughts make me anxious, they make me wish I were a character in a story, timeless, ageless, immune to the depravities of the world and of what comes after. Sex is a great distraction, when I am embraced I do not remember I will die, but then he/she/they leave and I am then left with myself, my reality.  I daydream the what ifs and sometimes almost forget they aren't real. I live pleasure to pleasure, what will give me enough pleasant chemicals in my brain to get me through the foreseeable future? What will distract me to the extent that I forget what it is I am anxious about or that I am anxious at all? If there is a cure please let me find it.... Perhaps this existential awareness and dread is what it means to be human? I am not sure if this is ""normal"" or if I will ever feel ""normal."" I just know I am exhausted and tired of being anxious.",1
I am going through it!,"Hey everyone, just need to vent.I have had an immense amount of stress compounded on me in a very short time frame:

1. My wife said she wanted a divorce and then changed her mind but is in limbo on her decision. That whirlwind alone is stressful
2. Said wife got a job, which leaves me at home watching our child full time while also working remotely full time (breadwinner by 4x her income)
3. My buspar increased intrusive thoughts and some deeply repressed memories surfaced
4. My mom apologized for everything she ever did and the way she let my dad abuse us, which is great but while I am trying to work on a relationship now, I can't forget all the pain that was caused during my whole childhood  


Here are my symptoms (keep in mind I am also quitting buspar, 2 days off):

1. Intense anxiety
2. Irritability
3. Dissociation
4. Panic
5. Head feels very full and on fire
6. Visuals (light tracers, road looks like it's stretching at stoplights
7. Emotional flashback (feel 16 again like I did after my first and only drug induced dissociative episode and panic spree)  


Any similar experiences or just encouraging words would be so appreciated. Thanks",1
I get anxiety waiting for him to come back to me after an argument,"My boyfriend and I got into an argument, and I admit it was my fault. I acknowledged my wrongdoings, and I apologised to him. We tried to talk about it, but then he said:  
""I'm already under a lot of stress at work. I don't want to talk about this right now."" - It's a rough translation.  
I couldn't sleep that evening, so I wrote him a paragraph explaining how sorry I was and if he needed time and space, I'd give it to him.. Because he has every right to feel upset towards me. But I did mention not to stay away from me for too long, because I'd miss him.  
I took the advice of people on Reddit to ask him how much time/space he'd need.  
He replied saying (rough translation): ""I don't know. Please stop nagging/pushing me."" Something like that...  
I don't know what to do. I get anxious because I don't know if he will come back anytime soon. I want to reach out to him and ask him if he is okay, but I don't want to bother him. I'm trying my best to communicate with him, but I don't want to force him to come back.  
Honestly, I'm having a hard time. I know it's my fault, but I just want us to be okay...  
Our biggest argument caused him to not really speak to me for 4 days. I'm scared that this time it will last longer than that, or maybe he wouldn't come back. I trust him, and I believe him that he will come back, but I can't help but feel like this.",1
Do I actually have anxiety??,"I visited my doc because I am suffering with something. Something feels off about me and I cannot figure it out. I think I started feeling it worse immediately after 2020. I went to a large concert and immediately had a panic attack. It wasn’t so much as I was scared of Covid I was well vaccinated by then but it was weird. 

Flash forward about two weeks after my grandma passed and I felt weird and so fatigued. More sleepy than ever. In fact I slept an entire 24 hours. Weird for me. Ever since then I’ve been dizzy and really feel out of place almost like I’m always out of body. Doctor ran blood tests, all came back normal. I’m not sure if I have everyday anxiety but I do have health anxiety. 

Should I ask for more tests if I think it’s a cancer? Haven’t lost any weight. I don’t feel depressed. My legs feel like they’re gonna cave at any moment because they feel unsteady. In my mind I’m thinking brain tumor. 

But, I’m only 23. Doc prescribed me Wellbutrin and it hasn’t helped at all. What do you guys think?",1
I'm tired of living with anxiety (tw/),"So sick and tired of dealing with everlasting anxiety. Why do I have to deal with this everyday, what's the point of keep going? It haunts me really bad specially on summer. Everybody seems so happy, thinking free-ly while I'm having attacks at home like crazy. This doesn't sit right with me. If there is a god, why I am getting suffered to live... Ofc I have  no friends, just 1-2 fake ones and a family. I'm so grateful about my family, if they weren't I would've done with everything. Im just wasting my life to my anxiety. I get bit better at winter but enter this loophole once its summer. Im so tired.",1
This is dang-near crippling me,"I've been having anxiety for the last 8-9 years of my life, but the last 1-2 years have been over the top.

I started Lexapro 10 mg about 1.5 years ago, and it has definitely helped a little bit, but I still have 1-2 week periods of excessive, bed ridden, over the top anxiety.

My biggest struggle is obsessing over certain thoughts.

I'll be 100% normal for 3-4 weeks. Living great, going out, spending time with my gf and my family, but then something will happen and I shut down.

I'll get sick, and I'll convince myself I'm dying.
A simple chest pain and I'll literally be stuck to my bed for a week checking my pulse and blood pressure 20 times a day.

I just can't keep going on through life with these crazy 1-2 week periods. I can't keep putting my girlfriend through this.

I just can't get my mind to stop thinking. It makes me feel like I'm crazy. I know I'm not crazy, I just struggle

The constant fear physically makes me feel horrible too. The headaches, vomiting, upset stomach. 
This is brutal",1
Feelings,"Do you ever feel like your missing something? It makes a pit in my chest that makes me anxious. It happens to me everynight when im tired, when im alone, when I dont know what I'm doing.. well it happens alot of the time.. it keeps me awake at night. Weeks pass and I go on 3 to 4 hours of interrupted sleep every night.
My concept of time is non existant, and I'm basically waiting for the oceans to swallow me.",1
Bad Experience With My First Psychiatrist,"About two months ago I finally sought out professional help to alleviate my anxiety. I went on ZocDoc and after some time, narrowed my choices down and picked at what I thought at the time was a good psychiatrist.

My first visit was very brief and she put me on medication which I thought was odd at the time. That visit was over the phone but she told me to physically go to her office for the next visit. Our second visit started out a little shaky. I went to the office as she told me to, but she wasn't there so I had to do the visit over the phone again while I was in her office. Aside from that it was great!  I felt like I got a lot off my chest and I felt like I finally had someone looking out for me. Our third visit was brief again and she didn't seem to remember or bring up most of what was discussed in our last meeting. I began to realize that she was very forgetful. Our fourth and probably last visit was awful. She couldn't remember basic details about me, couldn't remember what meds she prescribed me and sounded generally uninterested the entire time. At the end she told me they were having ""technical difficulties"" with scheduling appointments and would call me later to book an appointment.

That was over a two weeks ago and they still haven't called me back. I don't even want to waste my time calling them to see what the deal is. It all felt so directionless. She'd prescribe me medications then tell me essentially to figure it out and I've been trying to figure it out by myself my entire life. No guidance, insight, or any form of advice to help me improve my life as if the medications would suddenly fix all my issues. I'll take my losses and find a new psych.

I know this journey won't be perfect, but it was very disheartening to finally tell someone all the struggles I have dealt with my entire life only for them to give me subpar care and treat me as if I'm some annoyance. I did net some good from the visits. I was finally put on some medications that have greatly helped in reducing my anxiety. I also have a renewed initiative to work on improving my mental health.",1
"Has anyone who smokes/vapes tried nicotine patches, do they also reduce anxiety?","My friend suggested that I quit smoking and consider using nicotine patches along with nicotine gum for a month to help with my anxiety. I'm curious to hear if anyone has tried this approach, especially if you have experienced high levels of anxiety like I do without my vape. If you have tried nicotine patches or gum, how was it for anxiety, I would appreciate hearing about your experiences. Thank you all!",1
Insane Anxiety,"I (M,22) have been diagnosed with panic disease a couple months ago, since then something really went wrong inside me.

I had my first panic attack, when I was 18 by smoking weed with my friends. I was in an insanely bad shape, cuz my gf just  broke up with me, so when we were smoking, I had a panic attack. 
Since then I’m not finding back to myself.
I have extreme depersonalization, derealisations, which makes my joyful life really tough. I have been to many many psychologists without any success. I recently started seeing a psychiatrist, so I had antidepressants prescribed. Since I started taking Scippa, an SSRI for about 3-4 weeks now, my life really went for a downfall. I feel incredibly stressed, nervous all the time. I am unable to desensitize myself or to even leave our home ( I live with my mom, she is a huge supporter of mine) since a week now. I don’t want anybody to sort out my problems, just want to hear some helpful thoughts,suggestions, ideas what should I try.
Thanks for checking in, have a nice one!",1
I’m 17 and i am always afraid of making the wrong decision,"There’s this constant fear that one day the decisions I make will affect my future in a bad regretful way, this constant fear/anxiety stops me from enjoying.

Social Anxiety in Sales,"I have been working in Sales for coming up to 10 years now. During that time i have struggled with Social Anxiety and Imposter Syndrome to varying degrees. At its best, i can just about manage to control it, at its worst it severely impacts my ability to articulate myself, communicate with colleagues/customers and focus on what i need to get done in any given day (I procrastinate a lot through the overwhelming feelings of the tasks at hand). I foolishly believed at certain milestones in my life/career that i would reach a point where my anxiety would dissipate but this is yet to happen for me. 

I am at an Industry event tomorrow where there will be lots of my current colleagues, people i know from other companies in the industry and of course prospective customers. 

My anxiety is playing havoc at the thought of this as i hate the expectation to ‘perform’ that these events bring. I feel like i am not good at small talk or that people won’t want to listen to what i have to say. I overthink what i want to say (i almost always play conversations out in my head) and think that the people who do speak to me are judging me and end up inevitably losing interest.

Having said all of the above, i am trying to get better at managing these feelings of anxiety and reframing my perception of them (It won’t be the end of the world, if i f**k up, will it?) to try and control it to the point where i can get by. 

Any words of advice/encouragement ahead of tomorrow to help me through?",1
panic attack and i called 911,"3 days ago i called 911 during a panic attack. I coughed really bad and then i noticed my feet were really red and i thought i was dying, then next thing my left arm and left chest felt extremely fuzzy tingly and numb and my chest wad extremely red and blotchy, i never felt this before. Then i thought i was dying no one was helping so i called 911 and a ambulance came i feel so embarrassed the paramedics thought i was crazy or something he was just taking my vitals asking if i took any drugs and giving me a attitude while we were on the way the hospital, i kept asking what was happening and why this feels so physically and they just kept ignoring me, I  also asked the paramedics for water they say they couldn’t give me any until i see the doctor idk why. i felt absolutely horrible and dissociated and dehydrated and so my mom end up taking me home since the doctor was going to take a while and she stopped by the gas station to get me water. I am just going to follow up with my primary care doctor. Im so stressed and embarrassed over this.",1
Difficulty understanding emotions/feelings?,"I have a hard time understanding how i’m feeling, for instance the past few weeks, i’ll have moments throughout each day where I feel tired/bored/sleepy? I can never tell wether or it’s one or the other, for one i’m not a napper. 
I hate taking naps, even far before my anxiety has become a regular thing, I always hated the feeling of waking up and feeling confused and tired all the same. 
In the morning typically I have the most energy depending. I’ll get up stretch do my morning routine eat, then play some games if I have nothing to do starting out the day. After a good hour or so of playing i’ll get this overwhelming sensation of tiredness or something. Most people seem to be able to recognize the way they feel and go and do something to counter act that feeling. I usually spend too much time trying to identify why I feel that way. 
If I attempt to lay down and watch a movie with my family i’ll also get this feeling halfway through the movie of just some sensation of tiredness, and it seems to take a while to shake it off. 
The only time I don’t overthink as much as to why i’m feeling this way is at work, I work in retail on the sales floor and I close. So usually i’m recovering and moving quite a lot, I often don’t feel the tiredness until i’m on my break sitting down for the first time in hours. I don’t tend to overthink it though because it seems to be the only logical time to feel that tired, so I guess the reassurance works easier there. 
Does anyone else get this problem? Not knowing wether or not it’s normal to feel these random tired/bored/whatever spells in the middle of the day for no significant reason? and if so perhaps some advice to help please. :)",1
I can't stop thinking and can't stop feeling guilty because of it,"I just got out of todays therapy session. Last week I actually got a lot out and felt good about myself for once. Today I barely said anything. I couldn't. I just kept thinking in my head about all these things and situations and overthinking and analyzing and deducing. I tried to tell her that this was happening but it was like there was a wall. I would think in my head of what to say but nothing would come out, like when i thought about the words it was like i was mentally putting them on some high up pedestal that I just couldnt reach. This happens all the time and it's led to me being extremely reserved. I barely talk to anyone and I hate myself for it because I want to be able to make friends and whatnot but i can just never reach the words. There's a girl i like and so when I get the chance ill try to to talk to her. its like i have to drain my entire battery life so to speak in order to make conversation with her, but i try anyway. it works but the second i start thinking about confessing my feelings the wall comes up again and i just can't speak and have to talk about something else or tell her that i have to go. this has gone on since about halfway through our senior year, and it's funny because the other day we were chatting in the parking lot of our school and one of her friends came up to her and she introduced me to them and described me as being ""kind and super sweet"" and the three of us talked for a good while longer. She's called me cute before and has complimented my outfits a lot, too. I know i should feel good about these things but for some reason when I think about it I get angry, because it takes so much effort for me to speak to her at all. My anxiety flares up and I feel my chest squeezing and compressing the whole time, and i hate it so much. i genuinely love talking with her and i hate that it's almost painful to do so. 

after the botched therapy session today i seriously have started to feel scared of myself because i've been considering harming myself. and i hate that because i feel like i don't deserve to feel so bad. i live in a nice house with successful parents and go to a nice school. i should have everything i need to succeed too, but here i am. i can't focus on my work and i am a completely average student academically and am even may be at risk of not meeting one of the graduation requirements with only 10 days left..

my therapist took note of how i was behaving today and suggested i increase my dosage or change medication. i am on two medications at high dosages already and i've tried many, many different meds and dosages. nothing has truly helped with my anxiety and constant racing thoughts. its hard not to feel like i'm unfixable.

i know this is the internet and most people aren't going to care but my therapist is going to be gone next week and i don't feel comfortable talking about my mental health with anyone else in my life and just needed to vent. if anyone has read this far i could really use some sort of response, some sort of advice. please and thank you",1

What is happening,"I had an anxiety attack about whether I have derealization or not a few weeks ago maybe 5 weeks ago. And it was basically me over thinking and worrying that i can’t tell the difference and I have psychosis/Schrizophenia. After that I was anxious for a couple of days/on fight or flight. After that I frequently started having intrusive thoughts about stupid things like forgetting my memory or existential thoughts. Also fears on having mental illnesses this went on 24/7. Sometimes I could eat sometimes I can’t. But the negative thoughts replayed in my head all day. But life felt weird after the anxiety attack like I was in a different dimension and the vibes of the days changed. I’m also getting random memory pop-ups, and random vibes or sensations. (I have a post about the sensations) like my environment feels weird or has an unfamiliar sensation. And it feels like it isn’t my life. I don’t know if it’s depersonalization or derealization because sometimes I get it and it feels worst. I feel like something bad is going to happen or  I’m going to die. And sometimes I can’t remember things or write things well or write sentences well. The worry and weird feeling has been going on for 5 weeks. Honestly sometimes it goes away or gets better but comes back worst. I’ve already talked to a therapist and she says it’s just anxiety, but it hasn’t gotten better. I honestly feel like giving up at this point because life feels so weird like I’m floating or stuck in a box. It doesn’t even feel like life. And I can’t tell if im dissociating or not sometimes and that worries me",1
Anxious overthinking mess regarding daily messages from friend,"I’m feeling overwhelmed and fixated on this recent source of anxiety - something a “normal” person would probably not think twice about. 

I’m a pretty low-maintenance friend when it comes to communicating, I’ll provide tons of support and words of affirmation etc but I’m not one that needs to be in contact daily. Me and my best friend have this wonderful setup where we both know we adore each other, yet we can go up to 5 days without responding to each others messages, then when we do, we always do it lovingly (with voice notes and pics of our kids and news and thoughts from the past week). We always understand that not answering immediately is not personal, nor does it impact our relationship negatively. It did take years to build this sort of peace / not feel guilt over not immediately responding. 

Now, I have another lovely friend, whom I have recently gotten closer to (we grew apart after high school but in the last few years we’ve started talking again, I think because we both became moms, and have had some nice points of connection again. She is absolutely lovely and I even got the honor of being the godparent to her third kid.). She’s someone who messages almost daily, and whenever I message her (usually in response to something), she will message right back. I’m having trouble with this since I don’t feel like I have space/energy for daily messaging so I sometimes wait a day, or half a day to answer, and then boom she answers again. 

How do I navigate this? My problem is mainly the guilt I feel when I don’t respond immediately and the slight annoyance I feel for “having to” be in contact daily. My ideal situation would be that we write to each other a couple of times a week with no stress or pressure about response times. I’m a recovering people pleaser and it pains me to not immediately respond, but I want nothing more than a little less contact. Does anyone have any advice? 


For background, back in high school (15 years ago) this same friend had the habit of wanting to talk on the phone in the evenings after school. This was a huge source of anxiety for me, and I hadn’t been in therapy at that point, so I sort of did this combo of trying to please her while also feeling enraged and stressed whenever my phone rang. I have gotten better at setting boundaries now but I think that same “trauma” is now resurfacing and I’m worried I’m going to be in the same situation as before. 

TLDR: old friend and I have been reconnecting but she wants a lot more contact than me, how do I maintain my boundaries without hurting her?",1
My neighbor yelled at me,"I was outside cleaning my car and my dog was next to me. He wasn't chained up or anything and when a kid walked by he started barking then the kid ran and my dog chased him. He stopped once I called out his name, he didn't go far just down the driveway. But the kids dad was outside and yelled at me to control my dog. And he's right I should. My dog doesn't bite but I should know better. I thought I was fine and continued cleaning my car but then I started replaying what he said and how he said it and I've been crying in my bed since. I'm afraid to show my face or even go outside. I hate how I feel",1
Anxiety out of nowhere ??,"Hello everybody, I am M 21  
This is my first post on this sub and I think its going to be a long one. I think I am starting to develop some kind of social anxiety or something similar, let me tell you how it all started. I was always a very outgoing person, never really had trouble with meeting new people or finding myself in a new crowd. I could even say I was life of the party many times. But lately, circa half a year ago I started to feel anxious when I was having lunch at work. Which was weird because I never had anything similar happen to me. I just ignored it and carried on like nothing is happening. Then I started having the same feeling when I was having lunch with my friends, but the feeling went away as soon as I left the table so I didn’t worry about it that much. Until one day, I call the breaking point, I was taking an midterm and was doing fine, I knew the answers, but in the middle of it I started feeling nauseas and went to the toilet to clear my head, hopping I could finish my exam, but to my surprise I just couldn’t concentrate anymore. And since the breaking point I am starting to feel anxious in many more situations, like presenting in front of the class or even just sitting in the classroom and listening to lectures. I still can not pinpoint the source of the problem, my main suspect is stress, because I do have I very busy life juggling job, college and my semi-professional sport career, maybe it all just came chorusing down on me lately I really don’t know…  
I am really afraid in what ways will this affect my life… But I decided to fight and overcome some of the fears which are totally new to me, I find it scary and at the same time a bit shocking how fast anxiety took over my life

Can't relax during time off work,"My work is contract based. Since I started working 8 years ago, I've never had a break. Since our contracts end a few weeks apart we decided to take 3 months off work this summer. 

I finished work a few weeks ago and I am struggling to relax and enjoy myself. Activities I find fun (painting, drawing and other creative things I enjoy) and want to do feel so overwhelming and make me anxious. I also am finding it hard to sleep. The first few days off I only slept 4 hours.

I want to get stuff done around the house but I can't and I just don't have energy. But when I try to relax, watch some Netflix or go for a walk I get this panicked and stressed feeling.

If anyone has been through this I'd love to hear your experience or if anyone has anything that worked for them. 

Thanks",1
Am I overthinking this? Probably.,"Hi everyone. 

This might take a bit to explain so bare with me here. 
My boyfriend left for Basic Training for the army 2 weeks ago, and my anxiety has been off the rails - always assuming worst case scenarios. I was able to get a few calls while he was waiting to start, and it put my mind at ease a lot for a few days. 
When he actually started basic, his parents weren’t able to write down his mailing info for letters. 
Well, my sister is friends with a lot of people at the base he’s training at. Her ex husband is a captain there as well. I mentioned to her that we didn’t get his info, and she ended up asking her ex husband to get it. 
Ever since then, I have been spiraling about if that impacted him and made him stand out (which in this situation is not necessarily a good thing). And then, I talked myself down from that ledge, because with how things work there they’re not allowed to only focus on one person… and why would they, they don’t even know him. 
I did, however, write in one of my letters to him a brief explanation of what happened and that I’m sorry if it DID cause any issues for him briefly. 
Now… I’m spiraling thinking what if he reads that and gets mad that something COULD HAVE happened and blames me for any issues or thinks I’m the reason for any of the attention he gets? I don’t think it even makes sense after typing it all out but I’m still concerned I shouldn’t have even said that in the letter. Ugh. How can I get out of this negative thought spiral? 
Did apologizing before even knowing if anything happened potentially make the situation worse?! Help!",1
Is this feeling here to stay or will it subside when the major trigger is gone from my life?,"I've been having anxiety attacks about 6 months now, and it's taken some getting used to hehe. I'm much better at calming myself down during one and it's become this manageable pain in the ass. I even go 2 - 3 days with no attacks nowadays, which makes attacks even more annoying and scary, cus I'll think ""I thought we over this."" 

Now the trigger is my ex, who I won't need to worry about for the next couple months since I won't be on campus for a semester. I have anxiety attacks about other things too, but it's mostly the ex. So will it subside? Or should I not hold out hope and accept that this is how I'll be for the foreseeable future?",1
School is just stress,"So i have to try speech part for the exam and its tomorrow. The thing is that i didnt even read the text for a second time, because when i think about it, it gives me so much stress that i start crying, so i dont even want to think about it.
There was a chance to not do that part if i got a note from  probably some psychology specialist  idk  but my mom said i dont need that
So i have to learn it by tomorrow morning and its night time already

Anxiety about my appearance,"Advice and also discussion:

I'm convinced that people think I'm bad looking or plain.

Looking at people who look how I want to look makes me feel so sick that it stops me from leaving the house sometimes. When I do go out, I tend to keep my hood up and not wear my glasses so people can't see me and I can't see people.

I've tried to talk about it with my closest friend and my elder sibling but both of them told me that the looks I'm seeing on instagram are 'unattainable' and that 'we can't all be models'. I just felt like they were calling me ugly, or at least, not beautiful. I want people to think I'm beautiful so, so, so badly.

I also do have a therapist but I don't seem to be making progress regarding this source of anxiety. 

I have really bad anxiety about this and it's making it harder to make friends. Every time I think about it too hard I have to spend hours calming myself down to get on with my day.

Does anyone else feel this way? How have you coped? Does it get better with time? What do you advise?",1
i just don’t want to be friends with someone,"i told him i wanted to be friends because he was hitting on me so i wanted to let him down gently, and he said that was fine. but actually i really fucking don’t want to be friends either. i’m at the stage where i have a support system that doesn’t cause me huge amounts of anxiety to be around but it’s taken me YEARS to build this system, and this guy talking to me has really put a huge damper on all of that. we’re just not compatible as friends, we don’t think the same way or have similar interests, and he always gets upset when i don’t reply quickly (my slow replies are a problem, but one that all my friends know about it - i have really bad executive dysfunction when it comes to texting back, it sometimes takes me weeks or months just to get back to the people I love and i hate when new people think they’re entitled to my quick replies. it takes a massive amount of mental energy from me). i know it’s my fault for telling him i want to be friends instead of just saying i don’t want to talk but 1) how the hell do you tell someone you see around that you don’t want to be even friends? 2) i still feel the need to be liked and 3) its silly but i believe all men are out to kill me so i didnt know how else to reject him. 

i just want to be left alone with the people i love, this is why i usually isolate myself, i wish id never spoken to him. i feel like i sound like a massive asshole because a lot of people would love more friends but im a huge introvert and the people i do let into my life, i let into my life because they’re incredibly compatible with me and i love spending time with them and they EASE my anxiety. 

i don’t want to be friends with someone who wants to make small talk and wants me to make it back and now i don’t know what to do and i have an anxiety attack every time he texts me. it’s not even his fault (im just mentally fucked) but he’s ruining my summer already",1
Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with somatic symptom disorder?,,1
Extreme anxiety and panic over my graduation ceremony,"I'm so frustrated. I graduate with my master's degree in a week, and I am having crippling anxiety over the ceremony. I normally wouldn't, but for the past 10 months, my anxiety has been causing me to dry heave. I'm severely emetophobic (afraid of throwing up), so this symptom is my biggest nightmare. No other anxiety symptoms scare me, but this one terrifies me. I've still managed to live a somewhat normal life, but it's considerably limited compared to what it used to be. 

I have a big family/friend graduation party over the weekend - I don't want to do that because I'm terrified of dry heaving during it and ruining my whole day. It's even worse for my actual graduation ceremony. My boyfriend is flying in from 1,000 miles away to come see me, and I don't want to make his trip pointless if I panic during the ceremony or I'm not able to actually participate because I'm too anxious. I don't even want him to come because I'm so panicked. I'm afraid of disappointing my parents by panicking and not going to the ceremony (they're also traveling to come see). If it were up
to me, I would be able to skip this all and just move on. I still have an entire week until the ceremony, but for the past 3 days, I've been waking up with a horrible racing heart, nausea, and I feel like dry heaving all day. Xanax helps, but I don't allow myself to take it more than 1-2x per month. Hydroxyzine and propranolol don't touch it. 

I don't have social anxiety, I normally love big events. I love parties and ceremonies. I'm not scared of the social aspect, I am just terrified of gagging and being trapped in the ceremony/grossing people out/looking like an idiot. I haven't been able to find a single thing that stops the gagging - not water, not other drinks, not mints or gum, nothing. The fact that I can't prevent it is what scares me most. I've tried positive visualization, but all I can visualize is me getting all done up for graduation, getting to the ceremony, and either dry heaving in my seat or worse, walking across the stage. It's so irrational, but it feels so real. The *only* reason for the dry heaving is anxiety, so you'd think that if I knew I could stay calm, I wouldn't worry about the dry heaving - but nope. 

I don't know what to do. I'm considering just not going so I can stop being this anxious. I'm so angry that I can't just enjoy exciting, happy life moments like most other people can. No one in my life even gets why I'm so anxious because I should just be ""happy and proud"" instead.

How can I live in the moment despite anxiety? Mentions of death. Please avoid if it will upset u,"Hi, so I have anxiety, bpd and ocd, and one of my issues is paranoia of death. This can be related to contamination and such, but in this instance a few deaths have a happened around me in life the past few weeks. These people aren’t close to me however they are close to my friends and family. These events have triggered this fear again, of myself or my family dying. It’s so bad that it is stopping me from functioning, I won’t go out in the car, fly, do any everyday or “once in a lifetime” things. I’m just so scared even in my own home. I need advice on how to let go of this fear that’s making me feel sick every day. Because surely I’m not living like this. I am full of Brain fog too.

My anxiety is currently bad at my job.,"Hi, all! Long time lurker here. I was formally diagnosed with anxiety 6 years ago. Had it through high school, college, and my previous jobs. Currently, I'm on my third job at a bank and it has been the best employment I ever had so far. The pay, benefits, and workmates are all great. It has been 6 months since I started, but I have been failing and experiencing a lot of small mishaps due to my anxiety.

Everytime I have a bit of inconvenience, I have a small outburst of frustration, anxious during my daily tasks, and just on the verge of having a mental breakdown at my desk. Having my manager sit beside me does not help either, and I get berated over the smallest mistakes. I took a sick leave today for my mental health, and all I got was a bombardment of questions from my boss regarding the reports I submitted and got even told that we would have a 1-on1 talk tomorrow, so my mental health day off wasn't utilized properly enough.

I am starting to doubt myself if I can keep this up or whether I have to transfer to a different job with a fitting environment for my mental condition and forte. That is all. Thank you for taking the time to read my venting out.",1
Choking / tight throat sensation,Hi !! For background I suffer with anxiety ocd and panic attacks. Since I went through a traumatic experience in the new year my anxiety has worsened and I have started to feel a new symptom that is a tight throat/choking feeling but it only happens for a split second or so and can happen one after the other. I can’t work out if it happens because I’m having a panic attack or I’m having a panic attack because it happens. It does cause my stress because I’m worried it’s my heart.

New to the kind of anxiety that simmers all day and eventually comes to peak at night,"I have always had anxiety, but it’s always been because of specific things i.e. social events, public speaking, driving, confrontation. As soon as the task is complete, my anxiety is gone. However, I recently weaned off Bupropion under the supervision of my psychiatrist because it was causing random severe panic attacks and all day anxiety that would last weeks at a time with no clear trigger or cause. The first two weeks I was fully off Bupropion were magic. Clear thinking, no anxiety, no panic or paranoia. All of a sudden, the last two days I have been having the same simmering anxiety that just pokes at me all day and eventually turns into an anxiety attack in the afternoon/evening after work. I feel so discouraged because I thought that it was only an issue while I was taking Bupropion, and there’s is absolutely nothing I can think of that is causing it. It’s so foreign to me, to be struggling with anxiety like this. It affects my job, my free time, wears down my emotions. Any and all advice is welcome. I am already in therapy, and have helpful tips for when I’m having an actual attack, but I’m at a loss with what to do about the anxiety that seems to just sit quietly in my body, almost like it’s just waiting and biding time to attack. I don’t want to have the mindset that there is a singular solution, and I want to better equip myself in case this is something I have to just get used to.",1

Physical symptoms of anxiety without “anxious thoughts”,"Hi everyone!
So i have suffered from anxiety for many years now and i usually fell into anxious thought cycles that i struggled to get out of and these caused sometimes physical symptoms as well (especially i felt a pressure on my throat). The anxiety was much better until few months ago, where i’ve started getting physical symptoms of anxiety (feeling dizzy, feeling like i can’t get enough air & being hyper aware of my body) randomly and without them being triggered by anxious thoughts (after i get these symptoms i start worrying whether it is normal though). I am struggling to cope with these symptoms and breathing techniques make it somehow all worse…
Any advice to how to manage these symptoms and whether it is normal that they come without anxious thoughts? Thanks!",1
I’ve been having what feel like heart palpitations for a couple weeks now,"I’ve experienced heart palpitations before, a few years ago. I remember at that time I mostly felt them at night when I was going to bed. They only lasted a few days and then they disappeared. 

This is the second time I’ve experienced them and they’ve been happening for at least 2 weeks now. This time, I notice them more so during the day and evening. I don’t really feel them when I’m in bed. I can be waking around or sitting and I will feel a sudden “thump” and then it goes away. 

I’ve had the worst health anxiety of my life lately and so I’m not totally surprised I’m having palpitations. 

The time before, a few years ago, I also think I was going through an anxious time. 

What concerns me is that 1) this is the longest I’ve experienced them and 2) they seem to be happening even when I’m not necessarily feeling anxious. 
They aren’t happening a lot, maybe 5-10 times per day (at least when I notice them). 

I have felt them when laying on my stomach or bending over. I’ve noticed them after I eat too. (I have some digestive issues, at times.)

I thought they were going away a few days ago because I barely felt them at all, maybe 1-2 times, and then the next day I was noticing them more again 😑",1
How can I tell if specific thoughts have brought on my sudden anxiety or if it is simply other stressors in my life that have made my thoughts seem like the cause?,"TW: panic attack  
Like the title says, I've recently been dealing with a sudden bought of anxiety the last handful of days which culminated in a panic attack (after almost 2 years without one) and I'm trying to figure out if it was the repetitive thoughts (worries about the future, etc.) or the fact that I've been under stress the last few weeks that caused it. I know it can be difficult to separate, but is there any way to know? I feel like I may be blowing the worries out of proportion, but because of the panic attack they do feel very real and concerning to me. It would be easier to write them off as illogical if I could just say it was just from a buildup of physical stress from other things. Thanks in advance.

How do I stop being so sensitive?,"Trigger warnings: True crime mention

For background, I've had anxiety since I was a child that manifested itself into a very bad anxiety disorder due to childhood trauma and chronic pain/health issues. 
Before, when I wasn't working on my anxiety and my issues, I was able to do a lot of stuff without worries. Watch scary movies, go on the big rollercoasters, drink more than one glass, listen to true crime, etc. But after finally going through and processing my trauma and opening up and working on my mental issues I have become way more sensitive. I have always been sensitive and emotional, I wear my heart on my sleeve, but now I am extra sensitive to everything bad/sad/scary. 
For example, if I watch a documentary on a serial killer I worry and fear that one day I am going to ""snap"" and become a killer and I obsess over the possibility of this happening to me. 
Because of this I don't make certain decisions that I feel like are affecting my life too much. Another example: I watched a video of a mom that went into postpartum psychosis and killed her baby, and now I am never gonna have kids out of fear. 

I do see a therapist and I have been taking medication for 12+ years, I just wanted to see if anyone feels the same way I feel and what tips and tricks they do to help.

Weight: 60kg
Height: 5’6”
Medications: None
Medical History: Diagnosed with cervical disc desiccation 
Duration: 2 months
Location: right bottom eyelid

Hello everyone! For the past 2 months, I started having eyelid twitching particularly on the bottom of my right eyelid. I have observed that sneezing, touching the area, and blinking hard would trigger the spasms. No drooping of the eyelid. No other vision changes. It’s only the eyelid spasm that I am really concerned about. I have read online (which was probably not a good idea) that the causes might be from absolutely nothing to a dreadful brain tumor. I do not know how to function normal anymore. It’s really taking a toll on me.

Is this becaus of anxiety? or is it something else?,"

Sometimes, I will doubt my ability to think about things. For example, I might try to analyse what is wrong with me and then I doubt my analysis. I doubt everything I am thinking. I doubt my ability to think. I think I may be biased. At that time I feel very disconnected from myself like I have lost control of myself. WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THIS? 

Once, back when I was a kid I had this episode the day before one of my exams. My mind was saying some stuff i.e. I was thinking about things. I was panickimg and telling my mom "" Mom my mind is saying things and not letting me study. I cannot concentrate. It will not let me study"" I was crying vehemently. I was inconsolable and I thought I'd fail. But I passed with flying colours. I WAS NOT HALLUCINATING. I WAS NOT HEARING VOICES IN MY HEAD. This episode shook me to my very core and had instilled in me a fear of exams. For the next few exams I told myself ""this is your own mind speaking to you. You can ask it to quieten down. It will listen because this is your own mind"" 
For more clarity, I would like to tell you I never prepare for my exams beforehand so it could have been stress. But this was just a one time thing. To this day I do not know what had happened to me that night. WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

Background information about me: I suffer from OCD. I have never suffered from a head injury. I am a procrastinator. I am high achieving and have always gotten good grades without even properly studying ( because of the procrastination ) I had an emotionally unavailable father growing up. I donot hallucinate. I do not hear voices in my head. I am a maladaptive daydreamer.


PLEASE ANSWER MY TWO QUESTIONS.",1
Did I mess up? Or have I just chosen the wrong people throughout my entire life?,"Content warning: Mentions VERY sensitive topics like sexual tendencies. Read full story before commenting.

I've always been a pretty anxious person, however, anxiety has started being a bigger problem when I joined university for the first time in 2020. However, life was somewhat good I gotta say, I was on a relationship with someone I liked for a long time (long distance relationship, not relevant in this topic) and I had just joined a SFW roleplay server (not gonna mention which game or name of the server) which I really liked and had made a couple of really good friends on.

But, in 2021, things started to change.
First noticeable thing that happened, is that I joined a very toxic friend group from that same server which also was a bit influential on me. This group was affecting my mental health because of how abusive they were... however, i tried to forget about so, since i liked roleplaying with them. Besides this, I have to mention that this group had tendencies to be very sexual, something that I definitely was NOT at the time - I had barely turned 18.

Second, my relationship ended for a really shitty reason. My ex started ignoring me for days, weeks... eventually I noticed it wasn't working so... I broke it off. Loneliness started to hit, and because of this friend group, and also my natural growth as a human being, so were my sexual tendencies. 

Third, I was on a university course I was not sure I wanted to be in. I had chosen Architecture because I've always seen people choosing hobbies as their jobs and deeply regretting it... so I tried choosing something different... it clearly didn't work.

Well, things weren't going great for me in 2021... and especially after my break up.
I started hanging more with said toxic friend group since the roleplay helped me forget the bad aspects of my life... that also didn't help.
In this group, mainly with people that were 18 or older, there was a younger person (around the age of 15-16). This person was a really good friend of mine and we helped each other in hard times.

After a few months of being friends with said person, I shared my thoughts for the other people in the friend group, saying i didn't think they were good influences and that they'd be better off not talking as much to them.

For some reason, they decided to share this with the other people in the group, and those people said the things I said were very 'groomer-like' and that I was backstabbing them. Sure, I admit to the backstabbing part but... grooming? When? How? What?
On a Monday morning after 3 hours of sleep I get a text from one of those toxic friends saying 'we need to have a talk'.
They added me to a GC on discord where we went through the whole thing and they basically convinced me that I was a groomer.

I felt destroyed. Was I really that bad?
I shared all the screenshots with my real friends, and none of them felt like I had done such thing. They were essentially guilt tripping me.

A few days after this drama happened I was banned from the server... the admins thought I had done actual grooming so I got permanently banned.

This... is when things started getting worse.

As a way to escape the server, I started burying myself in NSFW discord servers, trying desperately to find a way to get some 'fun'... you get what I mean.
Eventually, I started messaging my ex as well, deciding to give her another chance, thinking I had thought of her the wrong way.

Why? You must ask.
Well, she was going through exam season when we broke up. And basically even though I understood all her dedication to studying and everything, she never took 1 minute of her day to message me 'good morning' or anything at all... but maybe I was just too harsh.

Eventually, we broke up again. Because, she was having trust issues with me apparently? Complicated case, so I won't get too much into it.

After breaking up I started burying myself in NSFW servers again. I had some friend that found out about this that got really mad at me because she caught feelings for me...

After all this, I thought it was time to move on from those discord servers and appeal for my ban on the server. I did so, and it got accepted.

Fresh start, I thought.

And indeed it was... I mean not everything was perfect, but i felt a little better.

I got on another relationship with a girl I met on there but it lasted for about... 2 weeks? Essentially she said she had some problems with her ex that she had to take care of and said she needed a break. Obviously as any decent human being, I understood, so I let her go.

After 4 weeks of the break, I found out she was dating someone else. She implied she still liked me but the dude asked her for a chance so she decided to give him one.

Whatever... kinda forgot about her for a while.

During that time, I had finally quit Architecture and decided to work on a local factory - around May / June 2022 (19 y/o) - while I didnt into another course I could finally save some money.

Said girl has been on and off with me ever since... we had a stupid fight during that same summer and stopped talking for a few months, but eventually started talking to each other again. She said she still had interest in me however... at that time I was talking with someone else already.

I know I have a problem.... at least with her. I know I'm being manipulated or something but... how can I not know she's not being fake?

Either way... the other person I was talking with was 2 years and 6 months younger then me (I was 20 and they were 17, almost 18 - this will come in handy later in the story). Eventually we started talking and they said they weren't resdy for a relationship which I totally understood at the time. Relationships are hard.

However, we both had already confessed to each other, and, since I had someone going around on the server saying shit about me and other people (basically any adult dating anyone under 18 - no matter the age gap - gets banned) I thought it would be best to let them know we should probably keep things a secret for a bit at least until they turned 18 or things calmed down in the server.

I was on a good spot on the server... i was part of the Event Team of said server and was an active member overall. However, as you may have guessed, things didn't end so well.

After a while, me and said person had a fight. They were thirsty for attention and I couldn't give them it since I was busy with university and other things of the server (by this time I had already joined Computer Engineering at my local Uni) so they got mad at me. Eventually, I blocked them since I had enough of their stupid comments...

So, essentially what happened was I got banned, again, for the same reason. Do you guys think I groomed them? I mean I never once forced them on a relationship... we just genuinely liked each other but they used this as an opportunity to get me banned.

Since then I started burying myself in NSFW servers again. Apparently a lot of people are spreading shit about me on the server... and even though I still have a lot of friends on there, I've pretty much lost contact with them since I was banned almost 2 months ago.

Besides this, a lot of my game accounts were hacked so I lost a lot of shit...

The other girl that also supposedly still liked me basically doesnt give a shit anymore and I also have no one, and I mean almost no one to talk to on a daily basis so I just feel lonely but can't help but question if there's something wrong with me... i feel anxious everyday and I cant help it since I have no real place to make friends anymore... I am 20 and I feel hopeless, whether we're talking relationships or friendships in general...

Give me your thoughts if you have reached this far.

Edit: forgot to mention. The first person that i supposedly 'groomed' eventually came out to me saying sorry that I shouldn't have gotten banned for that reason since I didnt actually do anything like so .",1

How do I ease my performance anxiety on the spot?,"I have a high stress career that's fast pace. I know this isn't my dream career but at the moment I have a contract I can't get out of. I have to perform just about every week day and when I don't do something right I fail and have to redo it again the following day. The thing is, it is different per instructor I perform with. For example, the guy next to me made a mistake that would cause a fail,  but he did not fail the student, the instructor either completely missed it or let that go without saying anything. I, however, failed my ride, and it wasn't until I felt dead inside when I started to perform better and without the anxiety. I ended up being the only person who failed in my class.

I can't continue failing. It is exhausting. How do I ease my performance anxiety on the spot? I study, I practice, and I don't do well while other people don't practice or study and do well.",1
I got asked out and I don’t know how to handle it…,"
	After being in college for two years I have been asked out three times. In the past since I was asked out over text I would sort of avoid the question and change the topic, but most recently I was asked out by someone I see very frequently as we are both in a relatively small major and typically have lots of classes together.

	Him and I have literally never held a conversation and I really don’t know what to do. He’s sweet but not really my type, but more importantly I have absolutely no interest in dating, and hanging out with people one-on-one is a literal nightmare for me. I don’t think I have ever hung out alone with a guy in my entire life. I don’t talk to people often in class and I never hang out with people outside. I’m basically a shut in…

	He has texted me every day for the past week and I had been able to put off agreeing to hang out with him because of legitimate reasons, but now it’s just getting too much, and I’m running out of excuses. In the past when I guess I essentially ghosted people, I always felt like shit because I know if I were In their position I would be really upset. 

	I know the easiest thing would be to just say I’m not interested but the fear of awkwardness of seeing him every day for the rest of my time in college is overwhelming. When I asked my friends (who don’t know about my anxiety issues) for advice they said I should just hang out with him once so he’ll stop asking. But I just know I’ll be awkward and probably end up having a panic attack when I come home. Plus what if he ends up asking again? My friends think it’s stupid that this is even a concern of mine and I can’t really turn to them anymore for help because I’m worried they think I’m trying to boast or something 

	Sorry this post is a bit of a mess but every time I think about the situation ship I feel like I’m five seconds from a panic attack. And sorry if this seems like a stupid worry, I guess that’s sort of the point though",1
How do you write (book/story) with severe anxiety?,"I realized recently how bad my anxiety has gotten over the last few years. And I have realized that in order for me to try and get better, I need to try and do things that help me feel like me again, and not like a shell. I have wanted to write a book for a very long time. I have loads of ideas but when I try and actually write them down and have a story progression I get overwhelmed by the amount of choices the characters have. Who will fall for who. Who will have tragedy. Who will have joy. So many choices and I understand that in order to write you need to write. But, my thoughts consume me and then I stop. So what I'm asking is, how do people with anxiety keep the story they want to tell straight in their mind. How do you not get overwhelmed with choices? How do you not get burdened by the want of your story to have universal themes and undertones and depth? I would truly appreciate any advice. From writer to... one trying to become the writer they want to be.",1
Can’t get calm,Does anybody have anything that keeps them calm it used to be my room close everything off and watch a movie but the last few weeks I’ve been having pretty bad panic Attacks and it’s really throwing me off everything I can’t seem to find anything that keeps me calm I’m really struggling so any help appreciated as im back in work soon,1
final exam anxiety,helloo i have a final exam this week but i have a history of having panic attacks before tests. does anyone have some advice on how stop this from happening? i have studied really hard for this exam and would like my grade to be a reflection of my hard work and not my anxiety. thanks!,1
I haven’t gone to work in weeks cause I’m so anxious. I know I can find other means of making money but insurance and other bills make it hard,I hate work I hate waking up to work. I want to go back to school and do my art. I’m a customer service agent and I work from home. It’s not a hard job! Like at all! But I haven’t been to work in 2 weeks cause I’ve been off and on sick and cause I’ve been sick I have the worst anxiety making it nearly impossible to make myself get up for work. It’s crippling. Idk what to do. I want to just straight up quit but that would leave my mom in an awful spot cause she doesn’t have a job right now either. I want to cry. I hate it here. UGH. I don’t mind any advice or suggestions or just kind words. Honestly I could use it :’),1
How to start fixing my anxiety,"How to fix myself

I know the title is somehow misleading,  but this issue is a fundamental one in my life rn, one that I always push and postpone..
I cannot with certainty diagnose myself, but I think I have been suffering with anxiety for a long time, at every major event I would say ""it will get better after that"" ,  and now I'm finishing my graduation internship and I suffer and struggle everyday to keep my mood neutral at best, I act fine with my family and my friends cause no one wants to hear whining and I know I will get told the same shit : chne9sek, e7med rabi etc and believe me I tell myself that too at everytime my mind starts wondering and I feel overwhelmed or anxious and sad and scared .. I went through so much and I thought it would make me stronger and carefree but it didn't .. I'm not asking for a magical solution obviously and believe me I am not in a position where I can seek professional help for this (even tho it was suggested to me in both serious/sarcastic ways because I'm such a nervous wreck) , I fucking wish with all my heart that I wake up tomorrow with a new chemical composition in my brain that lets me feel joy and safety and contentment... I am so scared that I will live the rest of my life like this,  I am religious and I try to feel that peace everytime I pray and it does help to a certain degree but I feel like this rot dark negative energy is so deeply rooted within me no matter what I try and how I act on the outside, I  would still feel it .
So now after I know for sure my moods and depressive episodes are not because of academic pressure but because of life in general,  how can I start fixing this? At least untill I'm able to get a therapist to sort my shit out.",1
doesn't everyone else love having anxiety?,"like it's so fucking awesome right?!!!

like almost cause great relationships to end because of thoughts :D!!

the tag should really be Progress! because i'm actually doing soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo well :)",1
Survival mode,"I’ve struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember. I see a therapist weekly, have tried meds but wasn’t a fan, take my vitamins, and workout. 

I feel like I’m constantly living in survival mode with a racing heart and stress and it’s so draining. It’s heightened when I PMS for two weeks. 

Running late is a huge issue for me and I’m in control of it so it’s extremely frustrating. Sometimes I feel like I’m living the same morning over and over again…didn’t get up for first alarm, running late, can’t find shirt, no gas, slow moving car in front of me, etc. The flight mode is so strong when I’m late and it takes a toll on the whole day, and my attitude towards myself. 

I always feel a step behind calling back friends/family, making plans with them, getting all my work done, focusing on my mental health and self-care routines, cleaning, etc. How do I stop living every minute like this. I want to be present and enjoy",1
Health anxiety is taking over my life,"I can't do anything, literally anything, without the fear of suddenly having some sort of serious medical episode and dying. It interferes with everything I do.  
  
I can barely sleep. Whenever I try to sleep I suddenly start to feel dizzy and get jolted awake. Or I'll feel a random pain and start to actually believe that I'm dying. It doesn't matter if I'm tired or not my mind will just not let me sleep. Trying to take my mind off of it by doing things I enjoy like playing video games, watching YouTube, or going on walks doesn't work. The thoughts are still there. I'm constantly checking my pulse. Constantly googling symptoms. Constantly fighting the urge to go to the ER. I can't stop it and nothing I do helps.

I feel like I'm not myself. I was perfectly fine until 3 months ago. I can't afford therapy and all of my doctors appointments are so far from now. My mental health is the worst it's ever been.",1
IM DONE I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENING AND NO ONE WILL BELIEVE ME,I'm tired of this I'm tired of everything. For weeks I have had this heaviness lightheaded feeling and a slight dizziness and when I lay down it goes away my doctor says it's just anxiety so do my parents bullshit is at this point idk what to do I feel like I might have a brain tumor or an anyersum growing  I just van take it it's like torture what did I do to deserve this I really can't take it anymore I feel like an insane person who is going to a doctor that has something but no one believes me even those closest to me just said the doctor would've caught something at this point idk what to do it's so frustrating at this point...,1
Can brain be rewired back to normal?,"My mental health problems started 4 years ago when I woke up in the middle of the night with my first massive panic attack. That night something happened in my brain and I'm still not well to this day. My main symptoms are - occasional panic attacks at night, random anxiety and derealization (the worst), I haven't been happy for years and everything is kind of ""dark"", I often have nightmares, and I feel like I'm dead inside. But I have no reason to feel this way, my life is fine.  
I've tried almost everything - vitamins and supplements (vit B, D, C, magnesium, omega3, green juices, St. John's wort, rhodiola, ashwaganda, maca, creatine, tianeptine, Lthryptophan...), yoga, meditation, relaxation, books, positive thinking, gratitude, walks, nature, fasting, cold showers... I also exercise 4-5 times a week, sleep 8 hours every day, eat healthy, I do not drink alcohol and go to therapy. I recently tried antidepressants but had a bad reaction.  
I think I've already tried almost everything, but there are probably people here who have more experience and know more than I do. I can function, but I feel like shit, every single day. 

  
I just want to be normal again and enjoy life. Can the brain be rewired back to normal? Is there anything that helped you that I haven't tried yet? It doesn't matter if it's supplement, medication, some technique or anything else.",1
I cant do this anymore. It’s too much.,"

I feel like i’m getting worse and worse. I feel like i’m losing my mind. I have constant thoughts in my head that never stop. I constantly tell myself i’ll never be the same, i’ll never get better, I can’t do this or that because i’ll get really anxious. I feel like my mind controls me. I try so hard to fight back but it always wins. everything makes my anxiety go crazy. If I hear a loud noise or if something is unexpected I get so anxious. I’m scared of my anxiety. something simple that makes me anxious makes me nauseous, heart race, feel like I can’t breathe, feel like I need to run away. I haven’t left my house in months. sometimes I cant even go outside. I constantly feel overwhelmed by everything. anytime I imagine myself going out to do something I imagine myself panicking. I never feel calm or relaxed. I feel emotionless all I feel is sadness and anxiety. I miss feeling happy and feeling excited. I feel like I don’t even feel love anymore. I miss my old self so much. and knowing the only way to get better is to do it myself is so scary. I don’t know how to get better. I feel like i’ll never get better. I want my life back. I miss the things I used to do. I feel so useless now. I don’t understand why i’ve gotten so bad. I feel so trapped in my head. I’m so negative all the time because nothing seems worth it anymore. I just feel so alone. I’m quite honestly scared.",1
Fake Scenarios,I have catastrophized to the point of delusion over a fake scenario for almost two years. I can’t break it. And I react as if it is a real situation. How do I stop this?,1
What do you think,"I started having anxiety in November of 2022. It all started with having negative thoughts about my relationship. Which I tried to hold it in and deal with it myself. Which didnt work, around March was when I brought it up to my girlfriend. We did what everyone else has done and we work through it. She's extremely supportive, it was very hard on us. But we've got through it. I'm starting to believe. Holding in my extreme anxiety for months on end, has lingered into my day to day. I randomly get anxious now, busy restaurants and movie theaters, sometimes when I wake up, or through out my day it hits me instantly and it lasts  for a while. The anxiety now isn't about relationship issues. It's just random and about nothing. I feel it in my chest. I've brought up to my mother that I want to go see a specialist. But all she does is try to blame the anxiety on my daily use of nicotine. Which is annoying, I'm sure it slightly could be negative. But I've used nicotine for 5 years, and I've never experienced this. I'm 22, what would yall reccomend I do?",1
So much trouble with medications,"I've been on paxil, parnate, effexor, zoloft, auvelity, and wellbutrin. Not in that order. I haven't been able to handle the side effects well. Everything from a 4 day long panic attack, blood pressure constantly dropping and passing out, tinnitus, vision issues, adrenergic reactions, severe seratonin syndrome, etc. I'll put up with side effects and for a couple I'll get a day or 2 of feeling good and then something happens and I'm worse than before I started. I'm frustrated, tired, and disappointed.",1
"Why should someone who is said doesn't deserve happiness, strive to be happy?","Since I was young, I have constantly turned to the internet as a form of judgment of my character. The most important thing in my life (And still is today) is being a good person. And the only way to decipher who a ""Good person"" is, would be the majority of people online (Twitter, redder, any social media). And at 25 years old, I feel like I have failed that task.  
  
With this, I am in a constant state of guilt over my past actions. I constantly scour the internet, reading over other people's opinions on how they judge others in specific situations (Think about the comments reacting to a cancel culture scene). It makes me think, ""What if that were me?"". These people who have done bad things in the past are permanently exiled from communities; is there something I have done in my life that would get me canceled (Assuming I was an influencer)? It makes me sad thinking that even if they were to have changed and genuinely become amazing people, these past actions will forever label them as unredeemable.  
  
The most disheartening part of it all is reading about someone being compassionate for someone who is guilty of something, only to sprinkle on an ""Unless you did something REALLY bad, then you deserve the misery"". And of course, everyone has a different definition of something that is really bad or not…  
  
An example of this type of behavior would be Atrioc. Someone who for all intents and purposes, was a very stand-up citizen. Hundreds of thousands of people looked up to this gentleman, for it all to be stripped away from one mistake. Does all the good he has done, and all the good he will do in the future, not mean he is able to recover from one bad action that he regrets? Even if he came back in the future, I can assuredly see hundreds of people raising their pichforks in anger over his return.  
  
I am 25 now, with a decade of self-hatred. Every day it grows, knowing I have wasted a beautiful day on this planet being miserable. I want to feel better, and I want to be happy more than anything. But then I see posts of people who have made mistakes in the past, with people replying to them on how they don't deserve to be happy regardless of the good they do.  
  
Today my therapist had me choose if I wanted to continue our sessions. Asking if I truly thought I could envision myself improving, and wanting to improve. But as someone who is guilty of past actions, of course, I don't think that. Because I don't believe I deserve happiness. So, that was the end of it, and I have never felt so alone. I want to be happy, but that is a selfish thing to ask for someone who doesn't deserve it. So I won't beg for something I don't deserve. There are too many good people out there, who have never harmed anyone in the slightest, that deserve happiness over me  
  
.  
  
Even if someone does comment on this post with a kind-hearted message (Which I am sure someone will, as there are lots of wonderful people out there) it is much easier to be kind to someone when you don't know the full details. If I was a truly evil person, who did terrible things, would you still be as compassionate? Would you still think I deserve happiness? I am willing to bet the majority of people wouldn't. So why should I forgive myself?",1
I hate getting told to Practice. It doesn't help,"I keep getting the advice of ""oh, if you just practiced, your social anxiety would go away.""  No, no it won't. I feel like people either don't know what social anxiety actually is or they're using the term in a very mild way. When I tell people I HAVE practiced and it's done nothing, I feel like they think I'm not applying myself hard enough.

I took a public speaking class where I had to present regularly. I got better at acting like I had it together, I suppose. I got feedback that I was improving, but I never *felt* any better. I was always anxious and always relieved when it was over. And our presentations always had a time limit because it was large class. When I've had to give presentations or talks at work that last longer than 10 mins, my hands start shaking and my voice starts shaking, and if I keep pushing it, I'll lose my voice altogether and not be able to speak. Even when I tell myself ""you've got this"" and ""it's not a big deal"" and even if I feel calm, the physical stuff starts happening, and I can't control it. The only way I've found to sort of manage it is take a few seconds to grab water and breathe, but I'm always worried that tactic will give out eventually.

I can practice in front of a mirror, but all I'm doing is staring at myself. Where's the fear in that? I can practice the *words* but that doesn't prepare me for the *environment*. I can practice in front of family and friends, but they aren't people from work who will be judging my performance on a different level.

I fidget and get very uncomfortable during job interviews (I'm back on the job hunt), and it's the same problem. I can practice interview *questions*. But I can't practice sitting at a table surrounded by people I don't know who are judging my physical appearance and job history in a very de-humanizing way.

I was encouraged to sign up for a leadership course (""to build confidence"") where they're supposed to teach you all those great leadership skills. And I suppose they did, but I can't say I got anything out of it. It was absolute torture. I was highly anxious the entire time, and I hated every second. Threw all my learning materials in the trash when it was over and ran as fast as I could from there.

I've spoken to a therapist who suggested MORE public speaking, and I stopped seeing him (he also tried to suggest certain traumas happening in my past that didn't, so he had other issues). I feel like people aren't getting it. Repeatedly putting me in stressful situations again and again doesn't relieve the stress. I can develop skills to *mask* it, I guess. But it doesn't make me hate the situation any less. It still feel constant anxiety, and eventually, I will do whatever I can to not be in the situation anymore because no one likes being that stressed out all the time.

I have several years of customer service on my resume. *Can* I work with clients? Sure. Can I do it *confidently*? You're going to have to tell me because inside I am screaming the entire time about how much I just want the situation to end. I've also worked as a receptionist, and I left that job fast. I got a lot of good feedback from my supervisor about it, but I could *not* handle the stress of picking up the phone and not knowing what I would encounter for 8 hours straight. 

I just started with a new therapist, and I'm *hoping* she's going to have something useful for me other than what I've been told my entire life because it doesn't work. And I am so tired.",1
I can’t do anything about it,"Im not sure if this goes here but I just wanna vent a little bit, I have OCD and for the last year my thoughts have been making me anxious but lately I’ve been just accepting them, and It feels like my future and although it really makes me anxious and it makes me wanna bawl my eyes out because I never thought my life would end up like this I just can’t do anything about it, and sometimes I feel at peace because carrying with OCD is just too much and I feel like I give up, I can’t do anything about it, I can’t change my thoughts or the way I feel about them, I can’t do anything and it hurts me but deep down I know I have to accept it, this doesn’t make any sense but I just needed to vent, this is how I feel",1
"Was anxious before getting the internship, and now anxious after getting it. Never feeling truly happy.","I'm a third year, computer science student. Last summer (2022), all I ever wanted was to get an internship this summer(2023). I felt like a failure and the weight of not getting an internship loomed over me, as my brother had gotten an internship when he was in my year. It also didn't help, that I was checking linkedin and feeling sad as my other classmates had internships that summer. Everytime I thought about the fact of not getting am internship my heart would start beating so fast, I had to calm myself many times doing breathing exercises.

Fast forward to now. I got an internship as a software developer, if I were to tell myself this last summer I would be ecstatic, thinking, god has finally heard me. Now, don't get me wrong I am grateful for being able to get an internship, I know the feeling of thinking it's not possible. But, as I've gotten it, I thought my life would be complete in terms of the summer but clearly I feel the opposite. It's funny because as of right now in terms of work - it's pretty light. The guidance/mentorship in the internship lacks but that's pretty much it. What's getting to me is, the future. Even after my work is done I think of what might come tomorrow - What if they give me something big to do? What if I don't know how to do it at all? What if I won't get the help I want? What if it's really hard? All these questions + probably million more follow me like a cloud as soon as I close my laptop and until I open it the next day. I'm just so tired of these constant thoughts. I want to feel truly happy.",1

How to get people to understand Anxiety & Depression?,"I was going to try and make this short but it probably needs a bigger explanation. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for 5 years. 5 months ago I had a mental breakdown where I tried to hurt myself (I am not in that position now so don’t worry) 

Anyway I have been off work since then and am due to have a sickness meeting with my manager and HR  to see how they can ‘support me back to work’. My work place has an Occupational Health department who have been very supportive and helpful and have been liaising with my manager instead of me having to do it. 

My manager is new, and from conversations before I have come to realise he doesn’t know what we go through with anxiety and depression, you don’t really know unless you suffer yourself or are a trained profesional. 

So about going back to work, I am worried that I am going to go back whilst in a good phase then drop back to rock bottom and my manager think I am trying to pull something. I often have a good couple of weeks then drop to rock bottom and it takes me a month or so to come out of it and that happens in cycles. 

How do I get my manager and HR to understand this and to understand that just because on was on top of the world one day doesn’t mean I’ll be like that the day after? 

I am scared of going back to work and this happening and then being penalised for something I can’t control. 

How can I get them to understand or even jus accept this is what happens?",1

Advice on what I can do about a wedding?,"I was very flattered to be asked to be a bridesmaid (one of six) to my mother-in-law who is remarrying. She see's me as a daughter and wanted me to me part of the very special day.

I have various anxiety disorders, which make it difficult for me to do, well, anything. It is extremely debilitating. I barely leave the house. Can't get into other people's cars. Can't go into public places (other than a supermarket), don't see friends etc. I see a psychiatreist and a therapist weekly, and we have been working on a plan and doing exposures to help.

When she originally asked me a few months ago, I initially said that I do not think it was a good idea, due to my mental health. I said I did not want her to be worrying about me, as the day is all about her, so I am happy to be in the background, unnoticed. She said that I do not have to partake in any activities that I will not feel comfortable doing, and I do not have to match dresses or walk down the aisle etc.

Well, this has now all changed, and before I knew it, I had an invitation to a dress try on's, booked to see a hair stylist, makeup etc. All, I suppose, are normal for a wedding (so yes, stupid for me to assume that I wouldn't do this). I have said that I can't really do these things, but I keep getting booked on to do it. I have only managed to do the dress try on. But, I have been trying to find the bravery to book to see a dressmaker to make alterations, and just can’t face it. And, even though it’s well known I can’t get into a car, I’m getting picked up by a bus to take me there. Something I just cannot do.

I managed to get a dress second-hand very cheap (less than £30). I bought my own shoes and jewellery, so, the brides hasn’t paid for a lot. 

There are now several months until the wedding. And although I have been doing a lot to try and get myself into a position where I could walk down the aisle with her, do a speech etc., but, I just don't think I'm there yet. So I am wanting to back out of being a bridesmaid, and just attend as a guest, where I can sit at the back near an exit and be more of a fly-on-a-wall.

I want to know if I’m going to be a horrible person if I back out. I'm so nervous to even speak about it with her, because I cant stand that I'll be upsetting someone, or ruining their plans. This is THEIR wedding, and they must be so nervous as it is and I really really do not want to add to it or cause any unnecessary stress. I'm just so worried that it'll come to the day and I just won't be able to leave the room, and by then, it's too late. It’s horrible that my anxiety affects others and not just me.",1
Emetophobia triggered anxiety,"I’ve had anxiety for two years now. It’s on an off so I don’t constantly suffer with it ( at least not extreme anxiety). Usually I do not pass out, throw up or any other extreme things like that but two nights ago I was sick due to an anxiety attack. This has never happened before and now I’m terrified of it happening again. The slightest bit of anxiety and I’m like “oh no I’ll be sick”. It only happened a few nights ago so I need time to put things into perspective and calm myself down but I really don’t like this.",1
How to seek help,Lately I’ve been experiencing panic attacks at least twice a week for no reason. The symptoms from the panic attacks are lingering and it is impacting my quality of life. I literally just want to stay home all day. A family member recommended I get help but I’m not sure how to go about this. Do I just call a psychiatrist or psychologist and set a appointment? Do I need a referral? Can someone explain this process and what exact doctor should I see? I’ll do anything to just few normal again. I live in North Carolina and my insurance is tricare reserve select(not sure if that’s important),1
Has anyone else had this pooping/farting feeling from anxiety?,"So my anxiety used to make me pass gas a lot and because I got bullied for it, I developed this really odd feeling whenever I get anxious or generally throughout the day. Basically, it feels really tense in my lower area (stomach, butt) and it feels like I'm constantly farting? Like theres constantly gas flowing out of my butt even though that's impossible I think, or almost as if there's poop at the entrance of my butt even though when I move to a quiet area or less populated place the feeling disappears. I genuinely do not know if this is anxiety causing this sensation or I am actually farting, because I am on anxiety meds and taking gut health supplements plus I eat a pretty healthy diet avoiding lactose and gluten foods. Because of this I've been interpreting everyone's actions around me as if they've smelled me, if they scratch their nose, move away from me, stare at me etc. it feels like they're doing so because they've smelled me. Has anyone else had a sensation like this before, or have any experience with this?",1
Consistently almost passing out in different situations?,"I has finally accepted it was all anxiety and it would eventually go away. Saturday, I was driving and almost passed out in traffic. Today, I jogged for a good 10 seconds, stopped and almost collapsed on the ground. 

Im convinced there's more to this than meets the eye. I don't know what to do now. Im not anxious, I just know somethings wrong",1
Anxiety about my teeth,"Not sure how this fits into this subreddit but I am insecure about my teeth. I had braces a few years ago but I was too young to understand the seriousness and I neglected using my retainers and they became bucked with a tooth gap on my front. Well fast forward today, I got a job at a company and had to trial some products for them. One of which were teeth whitening strips. My manager asked me to show her my teeth and I politely declined and said I’m insecure about them but she was persistent and I almost broke down because everytime anyone talks abt anything teeth related I get so anxious and do everything I can to move away from the convo. Eventually she said just take an image of your teeth before you use the strips and document the process because they want to post it on social media. I am genuinely pissed and I have this anxiety in me now because I’m really not comfortable with showing my teeth let alone send it to my manager to post it online. Eventho I’m only in this job temporarily for 3 months and prob will never see them all again. I’m still so anxious and I’m thinking of ways to tell them I don’t want to do it.",1
Agression at the grocery store,"You guys I’m heartbroken - it’s no big deal but I’m having a full on meltdown… I was at Walmart and there was a couple, the lady was looking at some rugs and her husband/ the guy was leaning against the opposite isle. I just slid right between them and the woman turns around and yells at me “are you ok??” I didn’t understand why she’d say that I assumed she was talking to her husband- I kept going she followed me and goes “hey pregnant lady, you ok? Screws a little loose up here?” (Pointing at her temple, also I’m not pregnant, I just carry my weight in my midsection). It is sooo difficult for me to get out of the house and today I showered and put on these clothes that I thought I looked good in. I just froze from the shock of this interaction. She mumbled something and left. 

I never even touched her or her partner or their carts even. I believe she assumed I bumped into them or that I got too close? Idk. I’m crushed.",1
I need help for my health anxiety. I dont know if I should go do hipnose therapy or a psychatrist. Any experiences ?,,1
Deep fear of night,"A few days ago, and since I was a little girl, I have been through many situations, such as sexual assault, deaths and etc usually at night. For some days I was fine. But since I began working home, I've lost all my confidence ig idk, a few days ago another harassment happened with me and my friend and since then I've been so scared. Today my vehicle got punctured at night and I had another male friend with me, but it was past 10:30 PM AND I was freaking out in ways I've never been. I think my fight or flight kicked in and I had to come home, take a cold shower and somehow drink cold water and stomach it to calm myself down. I really don't know how to cope. What to do. No matter what happened in the past, before lockdown and that relationship with my ex, I was confident and I was never afraid. Idk why.",1
I don’t know how to deal with the anxiety.,"So i’ve dealt with anxiety for a good portion of my life but never realised it was anxiety. It got bad a few years back when I recalled some intrusive thoughts and dreams I had when I was younger and since then it’s been a constant feeling of dread and it won’t leave me. No matter what I do I seem to get drowned in thoughts I don’t want and can’t escape from. 

I’ve tried all sorts but it just feels like i’m fighting against the world and when there’s no thoughts at all that sense of anxiety in the chest is always there and it causes me to overthink and feel like somethings gonna happen, like a bad thought or intrusive thought or worry that a bad dream will repeat and I don’t know what to do to stop that. 

So i’m looking for advice and opinions on what should be done and the best advice that may help overcome this sense of anxiety and dread.",1
How to stop anxiety/anticipatory fear of my cat dying?,"My Kitty (named Kitty, by my grandfather) is the only pet I’ve ever had. She is very very old for a cat (20yrs +) and will die eventually, and probably soon. 

She is the last thing I have left of my two grandparents who have passed. She has lived in so many houses, met so many loving people, and been taken care of to the absolute complete extent of my ability. I love her so much, she has been my true and only best friend my entire life, and I recently came to realize that in times of abuse and fear where I was helpless (and even times of happiness but where I had no one to share it with), she was there. She could have even been in the room when some things happened to me. This has helped me cope with those traumas, and helped me feel strong. 

She will die someday and soon. I don’t know how. But I analyze her every behavior, I check if she is breathing every single time I see her across the room. It keeps me awake at night looking for her again and again to check, it makes my heart race when I’m not home with her. I have a stomachache 12 hours a day wondering about it. This has gone on for years. 

It’s all consuming, stressful, to a terrible point where I fear I’ll be relieved when she does pass, and that is somehow worse. How can I accept the possibility and truth that she will pass, and how can I know I will be able to handle it right when she does? I haven’t lost a pet in 19 years. 

TL;DR: How do I accept the truth that my elderly cat will die, and stop letting the crippling anticipation of it take away from my life?",1
will i always have anxiety?,"a little brief background about me. i feel like i always had anxiety growing up. at the time, i didn't know what it was nor i was familiar with terms such as *depression, anxiety, mental health, etc.* so it didn't occur to me that i had anything of that nature. i wouldn't say i had intense moments of anxiety, so much that i couldn't live out of my life, but definitely abnormal tendencies, though not to the extreme.

after a very traumatizing part of my life at the age of 19, i have since noticed more of this. i could feel a big jump from the anxiety i had before, after, and in present day. before, i had a little bit of it, but it was manageable. after, it was like i was constantly on anxious mode all the time (heavy breathing, instantly triggered, weird feeling of scaredness/worriedness/on-the-edge every second of the day). after 3 years of having CBT, working it out with therapists, gaining more experience, and time, i am in a much better place, though i do feel like NOW i am not directly affected by anything, but more so still dealing with the reminiscences and habits that i had gained from these past experiences. for example, sometimes i get anxious for absolutely no reason. i just wake up one day and boom, anxious. it's happened so often that i can sort of estimate when i'd have my next anxious day because it happens almost so consistently. another example would be my fear of men. 19-22 year old me was absolutely scared of men, and although i have come a long way, i still feel uncomfortable around men. i identify men as men. the first thought i have when i am interacting with men is that they are men, *what if they this and that*, *what if he asks me something that makes me uncomfortable* and i don't say no, or, *can i trust myself around him?* i definitely brought this up to my therapist. unfortunately, we only had 12 weeks together, for it was free and based on a study, but due to limited time we weren't exactly able to work on it.

anyways, what i am trying to get at is that i am definitely getting better. i am seeing the changes, but... will i always be this way? is this who i will be like for the rest of my days? am i never actually gonna defeat anxiety?

i want to add that i am in no way trying to minimize real individuals with real experiences of anxiety. i know that there are a lot of people in this world who deal with severe anxiety so i don't mean to offend anyone. i am hoping to look for some clarity with all of this and to rant as well.

Edit: after doing some more research, i can confirm that i am at a healthier place with my anxiety! that is to say that i believe that my anxiety is more or less of the normal ""quantity"" that all humans are innate with. i think what makes me slightly ore anxious than the average human is that because i have experienced intense moments of anxiety in my past, i get a little more anxious due to the anxiety because it takes me back to a place that i do not want to remember. however, there are other parts of my life like my fear towards the presence of men that are a constant in my life, and some might categorize that as an interference in my regular and everyday life. i hope that makes sense.",1
Extremely anxious about starting a new relationship.,"So, I've had GAD for about 15 years and it affects every aspect of my life, it's is especially heightened when I get into either romantic or platonic long term relationships.

As a result, I (35f) try to avoid them as much as possible or else I get into a pattern of thinking too much about the future, self sabotaging behaviour and how I'm coming across to them. Despite this, I decided to get back on Hinge and luckily met someone who I'm beginning to like. He's easygoing, self aware, understanding and kind. I haven't told him I have anxiety yet.

I rarely get past the first date and we've had four now. I'm pretty scared that I'm going to ruin it with my overthinking and ruminating over whether I'm good enough for him. How can I stay in the present moment and try to dial down the anxiety about the potential of a new relationship?",1
Multiple day anxiety episode,"TW!!! Throwing up / nausea 

Currently on the second full day of constant anxiety and I can’t take it much longer!! It started after me and my flatmates hosted a small Eurovision party + bbq at our house, it was 7 people altogether and I had an amazing time. At the end I started to get really tired, partially from the alcohol but also socialising for 6+ hours. When me and my boyfriend got to my room I felt nauseous and threw up, since then I’ve been extremely anxious. I woke up in the middle of the night with my heart racing and my brain telling me really horrible things about my relationship, I ended up doing breading exercises with my bf and ranting to him about how insecure I am in our relationship. Since then I’ve just had a tight chest (not in the heart attack sort of way), a sense of fear, and random bouts of crying CONSTANTLY for the past two days. I’ve tried to brush it off as a period mood swing sort of thing but this has never happened before. I feel absolutely horrible and the anxiety is constant. I just want to go outside and see my bf but I’m too anxious to leave my house. I’m also scared that if I’m with my bf I’ll just break down in front of him or do something stupid like break up even though I love him. I’m hoping it’s just my period and that it will go away in a few days but I just can’t take it much longer.",1
"How do I stop worrying about being expelled from school for a false SA rumour? I feel hopeless and worthless, my grades have been slipping, and I have no internships or research projects at all. It's very serious.","Skip until you see a hyphen - between lines, to skip past the context that's been the root cause of the issue.

emotional downpour

High school junior here.  A false sexual accusation rumour about me spread to my only group of friends.  They all gave me the cold shoulder. Later I find that this girl had essentially assimilated into the friend group I was once in. WTF? The popular guy that she cosied up to as well is showing no restraint and blabbering the rumour to all his friends. 

About the accusation - something did happen but it was all consensual and very minor. However I have gotten into trouble for something similar but more severe, and I am worried that the school will side with the girl no matter what as a result, and that I could get expelled and my life simply ruined.

But I know that it's simply not sexual assault (not willing to share details unless via PM, if you really doubt that I am not an abuser). I've asked my scenario to friends and anonymous online users, making myself sound as horrible as I can with wording, from both perspectives, and yet without fail, every single time, they agree that I am not in the wrong, or at least, that the girl was overreacting. I did manage to win a few friendships from that group back, but things will never be the same :/

The group cut me off at the end of February. The incident happened in early October. She acted like nothing was wrong until the start of 2023. Why did she act like that, so strangely? I feel so betrayed...

Nothing has happened since then, but my loneliness and paranoia can't help but get the best of me - what if I get expelled? What if I never even get to graduate? What the hell is going to happen to me... I'm constantly anxious and jumpy on the inside. I swear, if I even had a semblance of a support group, I'd have gotten over this ages ago. But instead I'm still spreading negativity and have become my own ticking time bomb counting down to my next collapse of despair.

It feels so weird... why does she get to interact with so many of her friends as if nothing happened while I roam this school as a loner, without camaraderie? It's almost like the roles are reversed. As much as I hate it when people call themselves the ""victim""/partake in victim-blaming, I genuinely feel like I'm the victim here more than anyone else in this situation is. Surely I don't deserve whatever situation that has befallen me?

...and no this isn't simply me ""facing the consequences of my own actions."" Read above again. Please be kind and civil, I have already had enough negativity in my life.


- No mentions of SA below. Context above.
------- -- - - hyphen hyphen HH -  -  -- ---- 


Now to get onto the title. The issue is that I've been so stressed by above ^^ that I'm almost incapable of making decisions for the long-term. I used to have many university plans and different programmes, internships, and research projects that I wanted to go for.

But now I can't even think of making it past junior year (we end in November). I can only plan for two weeks ahead at a time to keep myself from internally combusting, collapsing onto myself.

I get a sense of dread whenever people talk about school or exams or education things in general, despite my relatively high GPA in a prestigious high school. I feel like all that could be stripped away from me in a blinding flash, and I'd be reduced to less than mere nothing. I have so much to lose

This has been affecting me by rendering me unable to work on larger projects myself unless given strict deadlines. (Studying for exams, finishing homework assignments/projects, etc.) If it's for my compulsory graduation project that needs to be done before the end of 2023, then good luck to myself meeting the graduation requirements! I have simply lost motivation to work on anything unless motivated by external stressors...

Because, what's the point? These things don't have any meaning if I get expelled anyway. On the other hand, if I have strict upcoming deadlines, I know that it's relatively likely that I won't get expelled within that timeframe and will actually work hard on them, almost (80-90%) normal, back to my old efficiency, speed, and amount of work done.

I also can't make plans for the future at all. I hear my girlfriend talk about her plans for college, the coding projects and paid internships she's been taking up, and I can't help but feel inadequate to her. Everything good in my life is just me riding the old wave of my successes from a previous era in my life, a time when I was less depressed and pathetic. They're not even that much. It's just going for math competitions that I know I won't win, and chemistry competitions I know I  have much to learn.

I haven't done anything noteworthy this year, neither have I worked on anything due further than a few weeks away, nor having done anything optional but helpful for my future, like additional research projects and internships. I have no research projects, internships, or notable extracurriculars. And I can't even bring myself to gun for them. I'm probably going to graduate with the bare minimum if my outlook on my future is so bleak and hopeless. I don't want that to happen. But I still can't stop worrying about myself getting expelled, and all my effort now to be naught. It's irrational. I'm irrational.

I'm falling far, far, behind. Augh...

I haven't even made any additional plans for my second semester. All I planned for was to just do the bare minimum and get through school without any problems or breaking down. All the people around me are so ambitious, I used to be like them, but now I don't think I can. It's not like I couldn't even handle it. Thanks to this great fear of expulsion, I find it a terrible struggle to function anymore.

it's weird. like i have ambition but i don't have drive. yet i have a lot of pent up energy. it's so weird.

It's like my ADHD symptoms have been amplified by an order of magnitude or two. Ugh... How do I stop these treacherous, onerous thoughts?

sorry for the long text and rambling, I've had a lot on my mind and no one to tell it to",1
I didn’t realize it was this bad. (Narcissist family verbal abuse),"Yesterday I had a constant high level of anxiety that was so crippling I thought I was losing control and lost my mind and losing my life. I also had poor stomach health, and felt so nauseous, weak and sick. 

I’m on meds for stomach (IBS) etc so I thought it was the meds that gave me anxiety and that it was just my stomach displeased with the foods I ate. I sleep it off and I’m ok, had a pleasant day. 

At night after decorating cakes my narcissist grandma hurls some passive aggressive insults that sent me spiraling. It hurt me so bad, and then I felt nauseous as hell and I kept feeling light headed, dizzy, faint conscious and like puking. I’m sure she knew what she was doing.

Then I recalled an art TikTok where the commenters were bashing a beginner artist with things like “are u 8 drawing like that” and I clicked on their profiles and I laughed thinking THEY WERE THE 8 Y/OS, with their appearance being literal children and felt so bad thinking they must be parroting awful things they’ve heard from people and when my grandma said this I was haha. So there’s where those children are coming from.

I’m usually able to withstand the bullshit she is pulling. But I really couldn’t today. And I got paranoid asf after she left, and I kept checking around to see if she was still there and looking for my other narcissist family member who traumatized me so much I don’t want to mention him. They weren’t but I felt like I would black out if I was there any longer so I trooped to my room",1
Anxiety triggers from a coffee nearly a week ago,"Hi everyone, I am looking for abit of advice. 

I have social anxiety and currently taking 20mg Fluoxetine for over 6 months now and everything has been great. 

Last week I stupidly had a pretty strong coffee which gave me the usual coffee gitters. Usually this passes after a few hours once I’ve had something to eat and some water. 

It seems my anxiety is high ever since. The feeling of nerves are constant. It was fine until I had that coffee. Any ideas? Anyone had caffeine do this to them for nearly a week after consumption?

Any help would be awesome. Thanks",1
Traveling to Europe on my own in 6 days!,"So I’m travelling on my own for the first time. I’ve flown by myself several times but always had someone to greet me on the other side. This time I’m flying ten hours to join strangers for a group tour of Italy and Croatia. I am so excited and this is definitely something I want to do, but now that it’s less than a week away, I’m getting really f*cking anxious! Part of me wishes the trip got cancelled… but then I would be really sad!

I wake up feeling sick and anxious and I can’t stop worrying. Last time I flew, I puked on the plane twice and I’m scared thats gonna happen again. I also have long layovers in airports I’ve never been to before. And I have a few days in Europe to myself and I’m anxious about that too.

How do you get through hell when there’s no support whatsoever?!,"I struggle with severe anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, C-PTSD, and panic disorder.  I’m in my 40’s and single.  I feel completely alone. I have no one to turn to for support.  My family, friends, and others just don’t give a shit about what I’m going through even when I opened up to some of them and told them how suicidal I am.  They don’t get it! Most of them have actually abandoned me as soon as I opened up about my mental health issues.  I’ve seen psychiatrists and therapists for years and I’m still on meds but nothing has worked.  I’m actually way worse today than I have ever been.  I just recently quit my toxic job because I can’t function anymore.

Advice to move on,"Hi fellow anxious people. I’m in a time now that I’m seeing the fruits of my labor, in that I have created a life that I’m really proud of. I’ve spent the past five years in therapy, been taking my meds, quit my stressful job for a better job, have an amazing relationship and have build a wonderful community of friends. But I’m still anxious. If it’s not one thing to be anxious about, it’s another, and I’m learning that in the quiet times in my life I become the most anxious. And I reflect back and see that through every season, my anxiety has been there. Sometimes steering me and sometimes just in the backseat.

Long term abdominal pain due to stress,"I’m going through probably the most stressful and anxiety inducing time, considering this is my last school year and I have to think about how to manage finding a job with the disabilities I have and everything…

I got a stomach infection in February and ever since then I haven’t really been able to fully recover. I have this constant mild stabbing pain in my lower abdomen, mostly around my uterus that also affects my guts and my lower back and it gets worse before my period. I’m quite sure it’s because of hormonal imbalances because of all the stress but I’m struggling to heal.

Anybody know what I could do?

I can’t tell if I have a potential serious health problem or just really bad anxiety,"
So a few nights ago I had a bit of a headache but thought nothing of it, I get headaches pretty often. All of a sudden thought I had this crushing sensation in my head like it was being squeezed, and then when I went to move my head it felt difficult and I had intense pain shoot behind my eyes unlike any headache pain I’ve had before. It freaked me out and I ended up phoning NHS24 (UK’s 24 hour health hotline) to describe it to them and ask if they thought I should go to the hospital. They told me if the pain subsided after those few seconds and pain relief helped I should be fine, which put my mind at ease a bit. 

The next day I didn’t even think about it whatsoever really, but yesterday I was back to work and halfway through my shift I started getting pain in my chest, struggling to catch my breath, tingling in my limbs and around my lips, feeling faint, nauseous and extremely agitated. My mind instantly jumped to that headache a couple of nights before and I started convincing myself I was gonna die and that I’d had a bad brain bleed and that the symptoms had been delayed. I felt so on edge and looking back irrationally anxious. It was mild as far as I’ve seen panic attacks go, and I might be an anxious person, but I’ve never had a real panic attack hit like that.

I told my parents and they sounded concerned but told me there was nothing physically wrong with me. I phoned the doctor’s today and when I described just the symptoms, without mentioning that I thought it was a panic attack, the receptionist’s immediate response was ‘you need to go to the hospital’. I explained that I thought yesterday was a panic attack rather than physical (although I have no way of knowing this for sure and don’t trust my panicked opinion at the time and so would have loved a doctor’s opinion), and she is instantly changed her tune and told me I’d have to wait a couple of days for an appointment, because if it is anxiety it isn’t urgent enough.

I feel like I’m going insane. Last night I almost had another panic attack cause I’m so hyper aware of my body now and it feels so weird. I know I might be irrational but I’m not worried for nothing here am I? Sure, panic attacks make you have crazy thought loops, but the crazy headache and crushing, followed by chest pain, limb numbness, trouble breathing, etc. a couple of days later with no previous experience of panic attacks is objectively concerning. Like yes, I might not be thinking straight and it’s hard for me to have an unbiased opinion, and it’s probably about a 99% chance that I just had a panic attack, but i don’t like how my symptoms are clearly concerning and seem to just be putting down to a panic attack with little follow up just because I mentioned the anxiety possibility. I already felt like I was going crazy from my panic attack and it doesn’t help that everyone’s acting like I’m unhinged for wanting to take precautions with my health when weird out of character shit starts happening to me.",1
Does anyone gets physically spacey before a panic attack?,"I always think I’m breathing normal and then all of sudden I feel like my entire body has no internal organs just a tube of space and it’s full of air, like I’m breathing too much air and my entire body feels spacious. My throat and nose becomes over saturated with oxygen. I’m just confused why this happens even when I’m not hyperventilating or just breathing normal?",1
Anxiety suddenly becoming unmanageable after medical experience,"Just a warning I’m going to talk about a medical experience which honestly would be very triggering for me to read, if I wasn’t the one writing, so please skip if it might cause distress. 

For context I was diagnosed with anxiety and have been seeing various therapists and psychologists since I was around 12 years old. 

Because I was lucky enough to get some kind of treatment (even if half of them were unhelpful) I have learned strategies to manage my anxiety over time and it does not usually dominate my life. Full blown panic attacks have been very rare for the last 8 years or so.

I used to have severe medical phobia as a kid (throwing up & hyperventilating over something as simple as an x ray) but I became a lot more comfortable as an adult with these strategies, even getting blood tests and such on a regular basis. I discovered I have a high pain tolerance, and that I can go through lot more than I thought possible.

Two years ago however, I had an IUD insertion done as it is a highly recommended birth control. Before the insertion I was told to just take an ibuprofen on the day, but reassured that it wouldn’t be too uncomfortable and no further pain management was necessary. I should have suspected something was up when started panicking while signing off all the waivers in the waiting room… the procedure was very painful but almost nothing compared to the painful side effects that would last almost a year afterwards. Not only did I have trauma from the procedure, but the way I was brushed off, or made to feel like I was over reacting by almost every doctor I saw while trying to fix the damage (and put an end to the constant pain) made me absolutely mental. 

Now I have meltdowns even thinking about having to go in for a physical exam, or Pap smear in the future. I try to control my anxiety but it’s also fuelled by the fact that I’ve experienced how women’s pain is not considered, barely even researched in the medical world. I keep panicking, just thinking about what will happen to me if I need to go in for ANY medical check up or procedure. 

I don’t know how to overcome this medical fear when it feels so realistic. Tonight I accidentally read a post  about colposcopies and I immediately was shaking and crying, couldn’t control my breathing just thinking about how I might need this procedure one day. I’m still in pain but scared to get checked out in case I need a test like this.",1
im worried i might have brain damage - please read,"tldr or smthg : scared i might have tbi/brain damage due to concussive state in year 9, minor incidents in year 5 and year 10. high results all round, never really study too much.

&#x200B;

**Experiences**

When I was in YEar 2 - Year 4 I was very bright, smart child and commended by my parents, teachers and other specialists. In year 5, I got in a fight and someone hit me in the back of the head with small fists around the back of my head (the area where hair usually ends after a fresh cut), and the area had swollen parts to it for a while that hurt to touch. I don't remember having bad symptoms or any head aches necessarily, but remember crying and having enough capacity to tell teacher and stuff. 

After than incident I have done still really well in schooling with scholarships everything etc and NAPLAN up until Year 9, where I fell hitting the topish of my head, I think i got a minor concussion as my walking was very fuzzy and weak, I still remember everything that happened clearly on that day and even remarking to my friend about it, also I had bad headache that day that went away. stupidly, i didn't tell others in my recollection and didnt get help, just slept it out.  After that incident, I still did very well in school, but had a study slump where I had bad mental health etc that could've impacted it but i thugged it out, and got really high grades that matched my previous performance and even better in the circumstances. 

Fast forward to Year 10, my brow bone where my eyebrows are got hit by cricket ball with helment, that didn't do anything as it hit up rather than straight at my head, and this unlucky happened 6 times over two months, but it definitely wasn't forceful hits just stung. The last two hits led me to feel little tired but nothing out the normal, i definitely think that it was just my mind making it up as i was worried about it.  

Tbh after these incidents my year 10 is of to very strong start with math and science, so idk.

**Reaasoning**

TO these events, Im scared something could've impacted my intelligence and cognitive ability. reasonig for this is that i feel my memory decreased, it could be attributed to my constant fatigue sometimes, mental health sadness and that i've stopped reading. 

Also, i don't have proper reasoning for my iq reducing as my scores are high and my school results are constantly competitive with top 3 at shcool but i did completely flunk NAPLAN which i didn't try and was late to as I got high Band 9 for math, and some band 10s for english when in year 5 i got decently higher (yr 7 skipped due to covid). However, like im not sure with my worry and anxiety over this i started picking up when I forget things, and its worrying.

If worse comes to worse, Ill thug it out, it gets better eventually.

&#x200B;

**Background context etc**

Ive done IQ tests including Italian one that had large sample data, MENSA norway i think and the psychometrics test by WASIQ i think it was, and I got 133, 118 (very tired on that day and distracted and under stress pressure), 135 respectively. Im not sure if it really has been impacted however.

For some reason, in maths I always find myself performing bad on NAPALN and stuff as such for some reason but do very very well in other tests with minimal practice.

I procrastinate a lot in my studies but still manage to memorise when it matters and do pretty welll (A - A+), sometimes i start studying 5 days into a two topic test for example.

I struggle with mental health, dont have any bad thoughts but when i do struggle i thug it out, shi but thugging it means i get brain fog and just fatigue with the sadness.

Im 15, year 10.

I have a lot of test anxiety and make silly mistakes that take away marks and never that I don;t understand a topic in tests.

I am studying to be a doctor, im afraid this could impact my ucat.

Breathlessness and Pulsoxineter fluctuating,"Hey guys,

my anxiety hit me again after having a somewhat calm phase.

Now I'm dealing with feelings of intense breathlessness and the fear of passing out or suffering damage from low oxygen levels.

During those moments I check my oxygen levels and they fluctuate quite a lot, jumping back and forth between 95 and 98%. Sometimes even dipping even lower than 95% for a few moments.

When I'm somewhat calm my oxygen levels are kinda steady around 98%, only sometimes dipping to 97, 96ish and quickly getting back up again.

Not quite 2 years ago I had an X-ray done, when having similar symptoms, with the report showing no acute pathological findings. 

Went to the pulmonologist who told me my lungs look fine.

And here I am still breaking my had over those oximeter readings, thinking there might be something serious going on, and maybe low oxygen is triggering my anxiety.

Anyone else notice oximeter readings going 'bad' when you are anxious? 

Thanks in advance guys",1

"Unexpected panic attacks, first in my life","Hey everyone,

I'm feeling quite lost and anxious right now, and I'm hoping to get some guidance from you all. Recently, I've been hit with panic attacks for the first time in my life, and it's been a real shock to me. I've always been a calm person, so this is completely new territory for me. During the first attack, I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack and ended up calling 911. They helped calm me down, but I'm still shaken.

The panic attacks seemingly comes out of nothing, during the first one I was alone in my bed and during the last one I was enjoying myself at a barbecue with friends. 

I want to regain control of my mental health and minimize the impact of these panic attacks as much as possible. Can you help me with a few questions?

What are some initial steps I can take to manage and reduce the frequency of panic attacks?
If you've been through something similar, what self-help techniques or coping strategies have worked for you personally?
Should I seek professional help? If so, what type of healthcare provider should I reach out to?
I would really appreciate any advice, experiences, or suggestions you can share. This is all new to me, and I'm open to any recommendations. Thanks in advance for your help!",1
Anxiety has been getting WORSE at night,"Since the end of the school semester my anxiety has been getting worse at night. Probably because I’m less busy and not much is on my mind.

I’m losing sleep and getting headaches from it. 

I’m a 20F living in a student living apartment complex and it is a busier street. But the apartment has a deadbolt, my bedroom has a deadbolt, and we put a security door stopper under the front door handle. I know that I’m safe, but I cannot stop the anxiety.

I try so hard to fight back but it always wins. everything makes my anxiety go crazy. If I hear a loud noise or if something is unexpected I get so anxious. I’m scared of my anxiety. something simple that makes me anxious makes me nauseous, heart race, feel like I can’t breathe, feel like I need to run away.

I miss my old self so much. and knowing the only way to get better is to do it myself is so scary. I don’t know how to get better. I feel like i’ll never get better. I want my life back. I miss the things I used to do. I feel so useless now. I don’t understand why i’ve gotten so bad. I feel so trapped in my head. I’m so negative all the time because nothing seems worth it anymore.

When my wife is going out of town for the weekend, even if my kids might be around I get anxiety. I get it a week before it is even happening. I get anxiety about the anxiety I imagine i'm going to feel when i'm alone. Thing is, i'm not already so bad when I'm alone. I used to be. These days it can be ok. But yet I still worry and get a lot of anxiety just thinking about being alone.

Even if it's just the thought of I might be on my own in the evening, or maybe I might working at home on my own (my wife and I both work from home, but she goes out to meetings often during the day).

I am, and have been, in therapy - and we focus on how I can rewire my thought about being scared. Is that how you get over it? Or is there a way to figure out why I feel this way? And if it's just about replacing the negative thoughts, the fear, with positive ""it's going to be ok, there is nothing to worry about"" thougths, what's the best way of doing that?   I also exercise, i run.

i’m exhausted.,"i’m exhausted of being myself i’m exhausted of being stuck in my head nothing i do works and i am only ever thinking bad thoughts— everyone hates me and i’m the most annoying person in the world 99.9% of the time. i used to have safe people that i knew i would never bother and never feel like i was being a nuisance all the time and now even those people don’t feel safe anymore. i feel like my family hates me too, and the only reason they put up with me at all is because they have to. i know i annoy my mom. i never feel okay with myself. any small change in behavior from anybody makes me spiral and im so tired. im just fighting my own brain every day. trying to convince myself every day that i am loved and i am cared for but i don’t believe it even a little bit. i don’t know how to. i hate that im like this i hate trying different medicines i hate not being able to have creative thoughts anymore because im always thinking about the bad things— im always contemplating my own existence and sometimes it just feels like it would be easier for me if i just wasn’t here. but i don’t want to die but sometimes i wonder if i need to. 

i don’t get excited for the future anymore i just get scared. everything scares me. i feel like half a person all the time— and i always feel like i’m making all this up. idk if this is even the right sub to post this in but i’m just having a really hard time. i know that i need help, but i feel like nobody takes me seriously. every professional help i’ve had has failed me— my psychiatrist made me feel like i was lying and being dramatic and all three past therapists eventually just stopped seeing me. they literally would ghost me after a few months of seeing me i just would never hear from them again. 

i want to grow old, i want to be here but everything scares me. i am scared of my own existence and my place in this world. i am scared to lose my mom, i am scared that people will find out i’m a fraud. i’m just rambling now. i’m just so tired",1

Tody 2 friends asked me to hang out with them at theor place. And while i really love to, i always fear that i do sth wrong and stuff and they hate me then ladadadada... and that makes it extremely hard to hang out. Though hanging out somewere else and woth other people not only them is better, but not free of anxiety.

Anxiety remembering friend estrangement,"A couple years ago someone who I considered a close friend of over a decade blocked me on all forms on contact seemingly out of nowhere after moving to live with his gf. Today I happened to notice one of his social media accounts is active again and the two have gotten married. I don’t use social media much and it never really impacted me negatively but but seeing this brought up so many hard emotions. I’m re-living all this anxiety… like what if I was a bad friend and I caused our relationship to end? What if my current friends don’t actually like me? What if the people around me get sick of me and leave me?

Being ghosted and not being able to ask why, or to try to fix anything, it felt as if he was saying it was a lost cause to work on our relationship. It was painful as any romantic break up and I kind of had to accept that I’ll never get to know why.

I have talked to my therapist about it before when it had happened. I thought I was over it, but I’m aware that I now carry this anxiety and self-doubt with me in the back of my mind… always.

Idk I guess I’m just venting and it’d be nice to hear from anyone, maybe if anyone has been through something similar.",1

Should I try Anxiety Medication?,"This is my first time in this community, but I figured this would be the best place to ask.

I have had anxiety and panic related issues for as long as I can remember. I have put a lot of effort into trying to maintain it and live normally, breathing exercises and whatnot. However, somewhat recently, I have begun to have vivid, memorable nightmares. I won't go into detail about them, but its gotten to the point that I've been often sleep depriving myself just so I don't go to sleep. Its hard for me to call them nightmares because, I used to have nightmares, but never ever to this degree of intensity. I tried explaining this to my roommates, but they didn't really seem to understand it as a problem, saying ""that just sounds like a bad dream"".

My doctor recommended that I should probably start taking anxiety medication, but my (also quite anxious) mom is very against it, saying she has had nothing but bad experiences with anxiety meds. I also worry how the medication would clash with marijuana use, as that is currently how I manage stress, which has been pretty helpful for whenever I've been too stuck in my own thoughts.

I'm incredibly indecisive, but I know something has to be done, because I have to sleep in order to work. So, should I ask my doctor to start me on medication? Or perhaps there is something else I could be doing to help   myself out? I also want to start therapy, but I don't know if I can afford to cover it, even with insurance.

Any advice helps :)",1

Please help with my Anxiety/What has worked for Others,"Alright i will start by giving you a little bit of background info, and as much info as i can so you can fully understand. I'll try to make it as short and to the point as i can. I am 33 yrs old now and from 22 to like 25 i was addicted to heroin, i got clean from heroin but then started doing a lot of coke and crack. I then got clean and straightened out my life. once i got clean i had terrible anxiety to the point where my face would turn red and my pupils would get huge and i would have this look of fear or paranoia on my face and i could tell cuz when other ppl looked at me it made them uncomfortable or have anxiety themselves. my heart would b racing and i would sometimes shake like my hands would shake. i then went to my doc and told him everything that was going on and from like 26 to now 33 i have tried damn near everything out there to try and help my anxiety. i got on suboxone to get off heroin and while on it my anxiety was gone but once i got off subs ive tried sertraline, trintellex, venlafaxine, buspirone, propranolol, atenolol, citalopram, xanax, clonazepam, mirtazapine, fluoxetine. The benzo's worked great for my anxiety but i don't wanna have to take that forever or a long time nor should anyone since there not a long term treatment. 

My anxiety has gotten better over the years, like my face doesn't turn red anymore, but i still feel like i am missing out on life. i also never had anxiety before my drug use. In highschool i played sports and was constantly go go go. I had no problems in social situations, everything was good. I now don't like to do anything except have sex, masturbate or do, extremely fun or adrenaline fueled things like driving dirt bikes, atv's, motorcycles and snowmobiles. I don't like to go anywhere out of fear or im scared i guess i dont really know y. I don't like talking with ppl because it's usually about dumb shit i don't care about, the only time i usually don't mind talking is when its about something im genuinely interested in. Im basically a hermit and it really bothers me cuz i never use to b like this and im missing out on life. 

In the past i have dated some very attractive women and the women in my life that i have dated have been a big part of what motivates me in various ways. Now that im not in a relationship or have a woman in my life i find it very difficult and to b motivated to do things for me. I currently take Buspirone, Trintellex, Seroquel for sleep and 25mg during the day to help with anxiety, and adderall which i don't always take cuz it can make my anxiety worse sometimes and i might have my dosage reduced or stop it all together. I don't notice any changes or improvement from taking the Buspirone and Trintellex 20mg and the seroquel 25mg during the day kinda helps. At a random time in the day usually at evening, my brain or body like releases a chemical that makes me feel really anxious, like my pupils get big and its hard for me to look ppl in the eyes. Thats the best way i know how to explain it, i don't really know what's going on or why it does that. At work i usually start walking around or start doing something like cleaning up while my boss is talking to me, cuz i dont want to look him in the eyes or stand still and have a face to face conversation with him. I do Carpentry/Remodeling BTW. 

Im writing this because i don't know what to do anymore and wanted to see if other ppl have gone thru similar situations and what worked for them as far as anxiety or how i can get my life back. I want to want to do things even if there little things or enjoy the little things, i want to fall in love again and share memories and experiences with someone, i want to enjoy life and not just feel like im going thru the motions everyday, like go to work come home eat go to bed and repeat. My life use to b the complete opposite of what it is now and i know im the only one that can change that and there is 1 thing ive been struggling to do or get motivated to do is working out and going to the gym which i think will help a lot. When i look at my life from the past i was extremely active, played soccer so i ran alot, i also played other sports. I was just all together physically active. Working out cuz i wanted my body to look good for my partner and myself. When you look good you feel good or at least thats how i felt. And please do not judge me on my drug use im not proud of that section of my life and it is behind me, im ashamed of myself cuz thats not who i ever was i was raised better than that.

Has anybody ever switched beta blockers?,"Reposting due to my wording not being right on the first post I made. 

For those of you on beta blockers, have you ever had to switch meds?

My doctor wants me to switch from Atenolol 50 mg to Propranolol 120mg and stop taking Atenolol. I’m been nervous and a bit scared to make the switch because of any withdrawals or reactions that I’m unaware of. 

And I wanted to hear anybody’s experiences with having to switch from one blocker to another. Because I genuinely don’t know what to expect and I really would appreciate it to ease my worry and nerves. Thank you.",1

feeling like i want to sleep/leave places and be home all the time,"I am in such a weird state. when i am at work i love it and i am so busy - my days go by really fast. 

however, when i spend time with my mum at her house, when i socialise with my friends and when i’m at other peoples houses - not doing anything just chilling - i feel like i constantly want to go home. i have felt like this before when i was at sixth form (7 years ago). i feel dying to be out the house and then also desperate to be home in bed. 

i am on sertraline 100mg and have been for 6 months. i constantly feel tired all of the time and very unmotivated and lethargic. i also feel like i can’t relax. i also have no sex drive since being on sertraline.

Bathroom Anxiety when traveling,"So I've been struggling recently with feeling anxious and having the urge to go the restroom when I'm traveling for long distances away from home. My brain tends to resort to thinking I need to use the restroom while on the road, but when I actually do go I hardly do. This seems to only happen when I'm traveling, but occasionally when I'm just in an area where there's no restrooms nearby.   


Does anyone else suffer from something similar? and if so what methods do you use to handle it?.",1

Somebody help a brother out,"I never post anything like this or even use Reddit but anyways. I’m 24, I’m a recovering drug addict I have a year sober and clean. I’m posting this because of the empty void and the intense anxiety I experience that progressively gets worse. I take care of my grandma with Alzheimer’s, my best friend past away a few years back, and I left my girl of 3 years that I loved because she was no good for me. All these misfortunes and others that I haven’t named replay in my mind on top of not knowing my direction in life. I used to be extremely extraverted now I’m the opposite, it’s hard for me to answer people back, I don’t like going out anymore, even though I want companionship and I do want to be how I was but I’m just lost. I’ve had a crazy life so far and I know I have alot more in store but I’m scared and I get sinister thoughts that start to take over me and a big part of it is not knowing my purpose or forgetting what my purpose is. I have two things in my life that I’ve always loved and that I’m passionate about, but they’re not lucrative unfortunately.. those two things are watching movies/writing movie scripts and bodybuilding and dieting. I been working dead end jobs and end up leaving one to another from lazy and incompetent employees. I haven’t had a job within the past 2 months which doesn’t help with what I’m going through. but anyways, I’ve always got vanity in my mind motivating me, getting an attractive girl, a nice car, keep improving my body, still have drug fantasies even though I will never go back to that life. I’m an attractive guy so I’m not always worried about not getting another girlfriend but I do get very lonely. I believe in god but my heart isn’t fully there at times and I know that’s a life long journey and my take is the reason why I feel like this is not having faith at all times and not knowing my purpose which creates constant lows and highs. I get so anxious sometimes that my brain feels like a carbonated drink and I feel like I’m about to pass out and my heart races through the roof. I used to not get like this often but now it happens regularly.

Intuition versus anxiety,"How do you know when you're making a decision based on gut feelings versus the anxiety that lives in your gut?

I hate the things that have happened in my life and I think I'm too conditioned by fear to change them,"I just want to start by saying I don't really feel that my life has been terrible as far as it goes, but I can't help but feel like nothing ever quite went the way I hoped it would. I turned 30 recently and the realization about where I'm really at hit me like a truck. I don't have many happy memories from childhood up until I was about 23-24 years old because everything I did had the shadow of my parents looming overhead. They fought a lot as long as I can remember and wanted to control my every move. My dad is addicted to pills because of a problem that caused him a lot of pain. My mom had a heart attack when I was 13 that couched her indefinitely because she was too afraid to move. When my brother passed away everything in the house got worse. Every conversation became about death and loss. All of their expectations crashed down on me and I was intimately aware of how short I fell of them. I got bullied a lot in school up until I got expelled. I just sat in my room, never really left except to get weed and then I just smoked and wasted time until I could go back to sleep, the one time I wasn't looking over my shoulder.  I missed everything from the ""golden years"" of high school, and I miss everything now because being in uncontrollable social situations fills me with dread. Now I'm dealing with my own daily physical pain from a vague condition my doctors can't pinpoint. The sole saving grace in my life is my wonderful partner. I love her, but I feel more and more every day that I'm robbing her of a fulfilling life because of the demons in my heart that I can never seem to grapple with. It's always one step forward, two steps back. I can't ever finish what I set out to do because there's a titanic fear of failure on my back. What the fuck do you do when you feel like you can't change anything, but you hate damn near everything about the life you wasted all by yourself? I used to think I wasn't depressed, that I was just being a pussy, but damn man. I might just be really depressed.",1

Can Anxiety Trigger Tingling Itching And Burning?,"Recently agreed to take a drug that can cause peripheral neuropathy generally only seen in prescriptions longer than twenty eight days.

No idea what’s going on,So I’ve been severely depress before but it all kind of faded away when I started realizing how stupid it felt for me to hold my own self back from living life. I’ve hurt myself before but only when I was really low in life. But I’ve been fine for almost a year and then all of a sudden after reading a chapter in a book about abuse I felt like I was dying and couldn’t breathe and then passed out and my blood pressure dropped pretty low. Ever since all I can think about is hurting my self again. I don’t feel depressed like how I was before I feel fine and only sometimes feel like my body is not my own. But these thoughts about mutilating myself and doing awful things to myself are in my mind on loop. It was especially intensified after I started talking to this guy I really like. Thoughts like committing suicide together and or being hurt by him or vise versus roam my head. I don’t know how to feel or what to do about these thoughts. I just think them but I don’t think anything of it until recently. Now I feel like I might actually try something. But I’m not scared. Maybe it’s because I’ve hurt myself already and I remember the burning I felt. Maybe I’m just crazy. I decided to post this here because I was diagnosed with pretty bad anxiety and have been taking meds but I don’t really feel different. I just figured maybe I was stressed.,1
Trying to stave off anxiety/depression while ill. Tips?,"Hi, all. And happy Mother’s Day to all you US moms! I’ve come down with a bug, thanks to my handsome, devilish nephew. I guess catching children’s vomit in your hands will make you sick? Go figure!

Anyway, when I experience periods of high anxiety, I often find myself bedridden. I’m now stuck in bed due to the illness I have. My mind is having a tough time realizing I’m not anxious, that I’m just sick.

I’m finding myself the last few hours slipping into a mental slump. Light depression, and lots of rumination. (“What if this turns into an anxiety spell? You’ll be bedridden for days!”)

Any tips on combating this mindset while ill?

Not feeling hungry,"I'm pretty sure I am depressed and I'm looking into therapy right now. I've recently lost my appetite over these past 2 weeks. I was having some serious anxiety last week but it's pretty much gone besides the random anxiety when I'm chilling. I don't know if I'm stressing subconciously.

Usually I have a big appetite and can eat large amounts. It's starting to concern me now. Now I'm usually forcing myself to eat something so I have some food in my stomach but my stomach starts to ache later. I noticed I can go 24 hours without eating and still won't feel hungry. Could depression be playing a part in this? I recently just started taking Magnesium Citrate and Vitamin D supplements if that has any effect. I think I'm gonna go to my doctors tomorrow when it opens but does anyone experience this? It's worrying to me especially since I usually have an appetite.",1
Relieving acute anxiety post (possible) seizure,"I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but... I'm at my wits end.

&#x200B;

Two days ago, I suffered what is possibly a seizure in the morning, and although I am already dealing with that with my neurologist, and my psychiatrist knows about these too, I don't know what to do now.

For the two days since, I've been beyond myself anxious, like... I have this feeling in my gut telling me like something terrible is going to happen. I feel like my body wanted to quiver. I feel like I almost want to cry, and I have no idea what to do.

I'm already pretty well versed with anxiety, been on meds since 18 YO (26M rn), and am taking 225 mgs of venlafaxine (For anxiety) and 600-900 mgs of valproate (for the epilepsy) + have clonazepam 0.5mg tablets on hand.

Had one pill of the clonazepam I keep for acute anxiety attacks, but... I guess, I'm asking -- How do you people deal with these anxiety episodes like this? I'm literally worried of everything, and nothing seems to be able to distract me. I'm worried I won't be able to fall asleep, that I'll be tired, and that might lead to further seizures. 

It always takes me about a week to get back to normal after a seizure, but after the last one, I think it's the worst it has ever been and I'm just lost of how I could calm myself down T-T",1

And just the fact there are people out there that are so rich like celebrities that don’t need to be doing these things and live these seemingly great lifestyles where every day is some sort of adventure whereas I’m just walking around shopping with a bunch of people doing the same thing. I know how ridiculous it sounds. We’re normal people all doing normal people things but it makes me feel so sick for no reason?

I have no friends. They could try to fight me and then convince everyone I did something wrong. I feel like a joke and an idiot. Why did I have to see them today in the spot I chose.

Severe belly fullness caused by anxiety?,"I have been suffering for over three years from back pain and belly fullness. My belly becomes extremely bloated visually.

At risk of losing job due to panic attacks,"For the past 5 years my employment has been extremely inconsistent due to a panic disorder. I was first put on medication ( Zoloft w/ xanax for breakthrough anxiety) at 14 (25 now). Got off all meds at 19. Since then, it's been a total rollercoaster of panic attacks one month, depression the next, and so on.  
  
Should I get back on the meds if that was the only thing that helped? Therapy (CBT, EMDR, Hypnosis, Exposure-Response) didn't help. I can't even exercise anymore without having a panic attack from my heart rate increasing. Even getting excited about positive things can throw me into a panic. My digestive system is in shambles from the constant anxiety, and I am at risk of losing my job. I'm a substitute teacher and a uni student and this condition is sucking the life out of me. The way I see it, I can stay off meds and lose it all, or take them as needed and keep my job.

Forgot to mention that SSRIs didn’t do much for my panic attacks. I was constantly having breakthrough anxiety and the only thing that quelled the panic was Xanax. I can manage baseline anxiety just fine, it’s the panic attacks that mess me up. I’ve been fighting getting back on benzodiazepines as I know how addictive they are.   
  
What should I do?",1
How to Navigate Anxiety Associated with Allergies?,"Hello everyone,

I want to say that I appreciate you taking the time in advance to read this and for giving any feedback.

From birth, I have had severe food allergies, some of which I have developed later in life. I am currently allergic to several of the most common allergies recognized in North America. Navigating these food allergies has presented its unique set of challenges throughout the years, but none of which I have not been able to navigate and overcome. Although, there is one challenge in particular which I have not been able to deal with and it has been progressively consuming more of my daily life.

Over the last several years I have experienced what I would best describe as anxiety attacks, although I have never discussed this with a medical practitioner. The anxiety is perpetuated by an underlying fear of having an allergic reaction but it often lacks any basis for being concerned. Whether eating something new for the first time, sitting on a bench outside, or driving home from work; there is no one trigger which causes the anxiety attack to occur.

To describe the way that I feel during these situations, I will experience a variety of allergy-related symptoms that can be associated with my anaphylaxis. Some of these symptoms which occur either simultaneously or on their own include: irritation or swelling in the throat, swelling in the face, difficulty breathing through the mouth or nose, difficulty swallowing, and swelling in the tongue or irritation in the mouth area. There have been other less common symptoms but are not as associated with anaphylaxis.

Although I experience what I believe to be anaphylactic symptoms, none of these have ever actually happened. Everything which I have felt has been perpetuated through the anxiety of having a reaction and therefore I am made to believe that it is happening at the moment. I have never had an allergic reaction and therefore only understand what the symptoms look and should feel like.

These anxiety attacks have been affecting my ability to focus and live life without an underlying fear embedded in all of my actions. I know that when these scenarios occur that I have nothing to worry about, and am able to recognize that in the moment. Yet, I am unable to control the situation and the only thing that resolves it is a prolonged period of time to pass to indicate there is in fact no issue.

When this occurs it creates an immense amount of fear and stress that I can no longer handle. It has been approximately ten years of getting worse and upon recognizing that this is an issue that I need to address I would like to seek help. I plan to discuss these concerns with a medical practitioner, but until such time, I would like to hear if others have shared a similar experience and how they have navigated this challenge. Any suggestions or comments are appreciated.

Thank you in advance.",1
I'm tired of all of this,"I'm so tired of everything I just want everything to stop for at least a minute. This is so annoying. Nothing is going right and nothing is going back to normal. I am not able to feel like a normal person anymore. I'm going to be like this forever. I hate how could I keep going like this. No one is helping. I wish I could know what I've done wrong. I just want someone to tell me. I want to be freed from this torture. I hate this I feel disgusting and I'm in pain constantly. I'm going insane. I just want to be hugged again. I want to be happy. No one is helping me I feel so helpless. I feel like a toddler who cant do anything. I'm filled with guilt, my head is always racing how much longer till enough is enough?",1
Just a thought I wanted to share with someone,"I live a life where fortunately my problems are nothing compared to the ones of more unfortunately people. I spend 3-4 months not even knowing what anxiety is and laughing when talking about it, and then I start a period in which it seems like it is everything that exists for me. Right now I'm in one of those low periods, and even though I'm almost sure that it'll pass, it looks like it's eternal. Some moments I'm so stuck thinking about the past and the future that I don't feel like myself anymore, I feel like I'm living my life in third person. And more than everything else I really feel alone: I'm almost 19 and I never experienced real love and almost no relationships. I think that this affects my situation in a major way, because even though often times I like being alone (especially during one of those ""high"" moments), during these worse moments from the first second I'm left alone it's like my mind falls in a black hole of negative thoughts and the spiral begins. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this thought and take care everyone",1
"I'm new to Reddit, and I'm nervous about something here and need advice.","I got an email this morning saying someone mentioned me in u/ (their name), along with another person in their mention... But when I checked to see what they mentioned about me, neither or their accounts showed up. The account was only a few days old...

Advice would be appreciated

I kind of made a long detailed post last night about my personal struggles, and I posted it in a subreddit of a mental disorder I seem to resonate with...

I'm not exactly ready to come out to everyone about feeling I have this disorder because I fear it will be used against me... 

I haven't shared my location or name... Just a very specific situation.

Auditory hallucinations versus intrusive thoughts - How are they distinguishable?,"Hey.

So, I've always had OCD, but ever since my first panic attack last year, I've had this issue that during high anxiety moments, I start 'hearing voices'. The thing is-... I know it's in my mind. I have a lot of trauma, and generally, the voices tend to be of the people that have caused me that trauma-.. for example, them yelling at me in my mind, et cetera. I can't tell if it's an intrusive thought because of that trauma, or if I am really hallucinating? Something important to add here is that my OCD bases itself around my fear of losing my identity / going insane / losing control of my mind. 

Last night there was a completely new problem with that, too. I'm usually at home a lot and can relax and take the day for myself. I don't have many classes this semester so I'm pretty chill most of the time. Yesterday, I had a 12h seminar that went from the morning to the evening, and my OCD exploded a little in the early hours of the seminar. It calmed down after I chilled out, though, and then I managed the rest of the day-... until the night. In the evening, we went to check a theater play (an opera) and it went completely fine! I really liked it, et cetera. My health anxiety spiked a little because I got dizzy, but other than that I was fine. I took a bus, walked the way back home, and immediately laid down into bed. 

That's where everything went wrong. Out of nowhere, I was not falling asleep. Adrenaline was rushing up into my body each time I was about to nod off, and it kept me awake. I was falling asleep multiple times, but waking up with nightmares relatively swiftly, and that's when I noticed I was also hearing things again. I was hearing the singers of the opera in my mind, and I also heard some weird brushing noise. The brushing noise, admittingly, sounded very real and could have been a real noise (my apartment complex can be very noisy), but because I was already scared I thought I was finally going insane. I did, eventually, fall asleep, but I didn't get much sleep before I woke up. I am a lot more relaxed today, but I am still extremely hyperaware about all my bodily sensations, and a little on edge.",1

"People with anxiety, how do you cope when witnessing gruesome/shocking scenes?","Hello everyone,

I'm looking for help and advices and I apologize for the long message, will add a TL;DR 

Yesterday, as i was walking on a crowded street full of families and people enjoying the Sunny day, I saw a group of 10 young guys suddendly run towards a guy to beat him up (I think it was a targeted revenge thing, but nevertheless very shocking) the guy was still running from the group when I tried to get myself away from the scene (felt really helpless and anxious, how can I, a single woman, handle 10 angry guys?) but 10 seconds later I heard a woman scream her lungs out and two guys starting to run towards the concussion which I hope was to help ? 
A few moments later I saw an ambulance emerge from the street, but I don't know if it was related or not.
 I know nothing happened to me, but this got me on edge all day, squirming at any fast moving people, loud noise or gathering of people and looking out for any potential danger.

It made me feel trapped in a city where there was no way to escape senseless violence that litteraly happens in front of everyone, with nothing we can do, and I know that much more horrible things happen in so many places, which also spiked my anxiety and I even caught myself thinking that I can't wait for this life to be over to not witness such horrible things, as if I had entirely forgotten that life is also about beautiful moments.

I tried to ""make sense out of it"" with my partner and my parents and they basically told me to get over it, and it didn't bring me any comfort
how do you manage to calm yourself, find a reason and see the light in this darkness?

Thanks so much for reading this and for your help!

I've been experiencing extreme anxiety, despite medication, in the fact that I constantly feel scared/paranoid about making others uncomfortable or acting weird around others or just generally saying something weird around my friends or coworkers, online friends or anything really. 

OCD doesn't make it any better, because I tend to obsess over these thoughts and seek reassurance by asking 

•""Hey um, are you ok?""
•""Hey just an odd question but have I ever done anything to make you uncomfortable?""
•""Hey um have I ever done anything to annoy you or maybe bothered you at some point?""
•""Hey we're cool right? Just asking""

And I just
It's suffocating at times because I constantly feel afraid of doing something wrong or accidentally saying something off or making someone feel weird around me and I try to correct it at any moment, it's getting to the point where I just feel paranoid of others feeling like there's something wrong or off with me, especially when they seem tired or preoccupied, and part of me knows ""hey they might be tired or just worried about something else it's probably not me"" but that feeling of doing something wrong or making them think badly of me or think I'm weird or uncomfortable is so overwhelming and I guess I'm wondering if anyone else ever feels that lingering paranoia and it's just

I dunno, even feeling this way and asking them to make sure just makes me wonder if I look even worse or weirder or even suspicious or like I'm hiding something and it starts to delve into a spiral of ""what if they think I'm some weirdo?"" Kind of thing or ""am I doing something wrong?""",1

At the moment, I'm having to physically see or deal with him, I'm just having anxiety about him in general.","My belief/thinking is that it's my general anxiety, which I have, looking for something to latch onto and it's latched onto the above thoughts.

health anxiety turns into death anxiety to the point that i dreamt of it,"before i start, sorry for my bad english

for the record, i (17F) recently graduated high school and is going to college this year. i'm healthy aside from cptsd and chronic gerd

as the title suggests, i have been having health anxiety for the past month now, and it now spirals down to death anxiety

yesterday i was in the car with my family on my way home from a neighbor's wedding and an ambulance passed by

fast forward to last night and i had a dream where my friends and i were just hanging out where all of a sudden an ambulance went by. not long after that, we heard a death announcement and the name they said was mine (though they pronounced my name wrong). we all looked so confused, and then we saw one of our teachers standing across from us. we then ran towards her and screamed saying how they got the name wrong. she then calls out towards the people announcing... and then i woke up at 4am

idk this all feels sooo weird. i'm not religious at all but looking thru the interpretations according to ibn sirin just fuels my anxiety even more...

i really dont know what to do i dont want this to spiral into something worse :/

thanks for reading👍",1
advice needed,"i just wanted to ask if anyone is similiar too this : so is it weird or odd to be extremely sexual and constantly horny for someone you’re in love with ??

Delusions and anxiety,"Hi all, I was curious if anyone has had delusional behavior with just an anxiety diagnosis. The reason I ask is because I have always felt that there is something more going on with me than just anxiety. But, anxiety is very strong so I thought I'd ask. My delusions happen when I go off my antipsychotic medication. An example of one is I thought poison was in my food which was a really intense delusion. Usually they are a bit more mild, like suddenly being religious when I have no religious beliefs on my medication. Going down rabbit holes like alien encounters or near death experiences, believing everything I hear/read. I have been in psychosis before but it was due to a drug withdrawal so I don't believe I have a psychotic disorder but I don't know. Please let me know if you experience anything similar. Thank you sm!",1
Feeling like crap after almost passing out,"I was driving to my parents house (20ish minute drive) and my car doesn't have AC. About halfway there, I almost passed out in traffic. I managed to make it there but have felt like shit ever since, even standing up I get uncomfortable and dizzy. 

Usually when this happens, it goes away pretty quickly and I feel okay again. But it hasn't gone away at all. I feel like absolute shit. I drank two glasses of water and had some food, I feel a little better now, but still not great. I'm holding off on going home because I'm too nervous to drive home and have that happen again.

Just so everyone knows, I've been checked by a cardiologist, ER visit several times, they never found anything. I've gotten a lot better recently but this is kind of a newish symptom that made me very uncomfortable and I still feel very uncomfortable and wanted to ask about it and if anyone has felt similar. 

It is pretty hot outside and I do notice my heartbeat more when it gets hot but I've never had this happen before.",1
I can't take trains without feeling extremely anxious after a near-incident,"Even as i type this I am feeling anxious. I've been missing classes and have dropped a couple of shifts at work because I found it near impossible to take a train without feeling really anxious, needing to vomit and have a bowel movement.

Around 1-1.5 months ago the near-incident i am talking about was basically me needing to immediately have a bowel movement while taking the train. Now, I can get off on a lot of stops, there are shopping centers nearby the stations so it shouldn't be a problem? Yeah, it isn't, however, I don't know if I had something bad, or if it was just my diet as a whole (I went on a healthy diet, got sick, ended up on a crappy diet for a bout a month and a half, back on healthy diet now)  but I had one of those really, really ""emergency need to evacuate bowels RIGHT NOW"" situations.. while the train experienced a FAULT in the middle of two stations not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES. We were stuck for about 15-20 minutes and judging by how I feeling at the time and what my experience was like, I'm pretty sure I had a panic attack.

Ever since that experience, each time I went onto the train I've always experienced abdominal cramps even if I've had bowel movements in the morning (I made sure to wake up an hour earlier to get everything out of the way) and then I started experiencing nausea ontop of that. I keep 3 water bottles in response to the near incident because it barely manages to keep me from wanting to vomit. Then eventually I just couldn't stay on trains and caught ubers to my classes. I get really nauseous in the mornings and it gets even worse if I see someone with a coffee cup or even a small snack like a chocolate bar.

I've gotten a blood test and stool test done but I still need to wait for results. Is there any techniques that I can use apart from breathing/meditation (which is the first thing I focus on if i feel uneasy) that can make my experience bearable until I get over this? Because I feel like I have no option but to drive to the city and pay $20 for the entire day.",1
What should I do if my depression/anxiety prevents me from working?,"I'm an entrepreneur, and after a couple of years of burnout, my condition has significantly worsened two months ago, and I've been diagnosed with moderate/severe clinical depression. I've been having an indescribable feeling of sorrow, anxiety, apathy and helplessness, whenever I think about work, I experienced an immense sense of anxiety, fear and anger, as well as physical symptoms, such as massive headache, body tremors, and faster heart beats (and one time, almost hyperventilating). As a result, I've not been productive at work and of course found it extremely difficult to work, or even think anything about work.

Setting personal boundaries with my brother (TW Verbal abuse),"I was recently playing a tabletop RPG, playtesting my own system I'm working on. While playtesting a new rule I had added, my brother got very frustrated about the new rule after losing a roll to another player. He claims I interrupted him. I'm not sure if I did before he started yelling, as I was trying to explain that the changes he was recommending were something we already tested and rejected in a session he didn't attend.

I definitely interrupted him as he was yelling, asking him ""Will you listen?"" I raised my voice slightly in exasperation and to be heard, but didn't approach his volume. I don't think it's disrespectful to interrupt someone shouting to intimidate you to ask them to calm down, though it probably isn't effective. His response was to get louder, shouting ""NO I WILL NOT LISTEN"" and continuing on a tirade that lasted maybe 30-40 seconds. Myself and the other five players went deathly silent. When he finally stopped talking, I said I'd have to reconsider that part of the system and moved on to something else because I could see that everyone was uncomfortable and just wanted to get back to the gaming.

The next week, I wrote him a note expressing how unacceptable that was to shout me into silence. I tried to set a personal boundary in that note, and it enraged him. He called it an ultimatum (pasted word for word below this paragraph), and I can see why he might call it that. It was my first attempt at a personal boundary, so I don't have a lot of experience with this.

*If another such outburst occurs in any game in the future, that will be the last game I play with you. I’m playing to have fun, hang out with friends, tell an interesting story, and in the case of last week’s playtest, I wanted to try out various systems and changes for my own game. Outbursts like that make all of those things impossible.*

Of note, he declared angrily many years ago that we would never play a competitive game together again after I beat him in a game of Dominion. He claims I gloat when I'm winning and whine when I'm losing, but I think that's more of a product of his perception than my behavior, as no one else has ever raised this concern. We still play cooperative games, but I often find if we start struggling or lose the game, he starts criticizing my gameplay, either immediately or in the car ride home.

He has interpreted the above italicized statement in two ways. First, he accused me of trying to dictate what he could do and deny his rights. I view it as telling him I won't put up with being silenced, and he has no right to do that to me.

Second, he hasn't said this out loud, but I believe he interpreted this as me trying to kick him out of our gaming group. If I wanted to do this, I could have simply called for a vote to kick him out over the shouting. Instead, I suppressed my desire to immediately declare I would not play with him any longer, and thought about it for six days before writing my letter. I asked several of the players later, and they were all deeply uncomfortable.

He's gone on the offensive because of the note. He didn't even talk to me about the letter I wrote, bringing it to the next game session and forcing a two hour discussion about it with the others. I had no idea he was going to do this. He had what I can only describe as a predatory glare when he brought out the letter, stared at me, and said something along the lines of ""You think you can make an ultimatum to me? I'll show you what happens when you make ultimatums."" He hadn't said a word to me about the letter yet at this point, choosing instead to pop it on the entire group and try to paint me as the bad guy.

This is the second time he's had an outburst like this. He did it in a previous game, but because it was the first time it ever happened, I didn't know what to do, and we moved past it without a consequence.  There was no letter or even discussion about it, we just moved on. That was four years ago. I still didn't know what to do the second time, so I'm trying to put together a personal boundary statement to prepare for this in the future. He's only ever shouted at me, but I've seen him take an annoyed/angry tone in other games and our writing group if people contradict him. He hasn't shouted them down, but it wouldn't surprise me if those other folks had felt intimidated.

This is what I came up with after watching some videos and reading some mental health webpages. This is my first time ever having to do something like this, so any advice would be appreciated.

*This is me setting a personal boundary for my own health and safety. When you shout me into silence, I feel disrespected and intimidated. I cannot control your behavior, only how I react to your behavior. When you shout me into silence or otherwise intimidate me, I will repeat this boundary and ask you why you feel it is okay to silence my voice. I also reserve the right to walk away if I don’t feel safe or capable of engaging in respectful conversation.*

I appreciate your input. Thanks.",1
Palpitations..please help,"Hello...I'm sure people post about this a lot but this has really been bothering me...I've been getting palpitations recently and went to the doctor and then this morning I had one while I was putting laundry in the machine and I felt like I couldn't breathe for about 2 seconds. The doctor said I shouldn't worry, and I do have health anxiety but idk I'm sitting here really stressed because it happened for no reason and I wasn't stressed or anything like that and I really just don't want anything bad to happen...I'm wondering if maybe like being hungry/not eating yet might have contributed or something but I can't get it out of my mind and it makes me anxious and I'm trying not to panic. I was in hospital a couple of months ago for a vitamin deficiency thing and everything was tested for, I don't have an abnormal heart rate or beat or anything and logically I know it's some kind of idk subconscious anxiety or whatever but it's just...really scary and uncomfortable and I don't want to die",1

I feel like i’m drowning,"
I don’t want to do this anymore. I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore. my anxiety is so bad that anything small that makes me anxious makes me feel like i’m going to have a panic attack. I haven’t left me house in months because of my anxiety. I have constant depersonalization that makes it hard to do anything. I’m scared of my own anxiety essentially. if I know something’s going to make me anxious I simply avoid it. and by doing that I avoid pretty much everything. I haven’t felt happy i’m months. I never feel calm, relaxed, or content. I feel so trapped in my head with no way out. I just want to feel like me again and do the things I used to. I used to work and go out and drive around for fun. now the thought of getting in a car scares me. how did this happen? who even am I? I’m so tired. I feel like i’m grieving myself. my mom told me i’m not depressed because I get out of bed everyday. but all day long I can’t wait till it’s nighttime so I get to sleep again. I feel like I’m getting worse and worse. I don’t know how to help myself. i’m scared of the path i’m going down. my father took his life when I was 11. I don’t want to end up like him. I want myself back. does she even exist anymore i’m not sure. I feel so alone. I have no one. even if I feel like people are there for me it doesn’t make me feel better I still feel so down and alone. I feel like my anxiety will never get better and i’ll be this way forever. I don’t want to have to fight through it. I want just be like I used to be. I get that mentality isnt the best but truthfully that’s where i’m at. i’m tired of fighting.",1

My doctor said that I’m okay and that I was just only anxious when I told them that I struggle with heat intolerances and agoraphobia.,"I started to had this issues since August of 2022, last year, and I’ve never had this problem in the past. I went to the doctor recently and they check on me and said I was fine with all their testing. They just said I needed to eat and stay hydrated and that I’m only anxious because of the pandemic which doesn’t make sense because this issue that I’m dealing with is recent..? I don’t have social problems but instead my issues is more physically. Whenever I go somewhere especially in more hotter climates, I tend to get heat exhaustions or the urge to vomit and having the feeling of fainting (I’ve never faint before).",1
Odd fears I remember having as a kid,"I remember being upset at the playground whenever someone left the swing swinging after they got off it. I needed it to sit still otherwise I was anxious.

If my mom ran over the cord when vacuuming, I would scream and cry. This was terrifying to me. I still feel like vacuuming is uncomfortable for me today and I hate when the cord is in danger of becoming caught or rolled over.

My older brother had a computer game that taught you about the human body - what a skeleton was, what hands were, what an eye was. When it showed an eye opening, it made this creaky opening sound effect that caused so much terror in me that I had to run to the other side of the house and close my ears. My brother would sometimes repeat it to mess with me. 

I guess I'm saying this because I don't really understand where these fears come from. Or what they might indicate about me. I often don't remember these small terrors I used to have and I'm sweaty typing about them. 

Today I live with an ever present feeling of wrongness in the pit of my stomach and hypervigilance of my surroundings. My eyes scan things quickly and I find myself becoming quickly fatigued when they dart around back and forth too quickly. I find that I'm very good at competitive games where awareness and reactivity are a strong suit. I'm excellent at my career and fast on a computer, but it is a double edged sword as my brain overheats (sometimes physically, it feels like) as it takes too much information in.

I was playing the new Zelda game, and while those games are generally enjoyable to me, walking through vast environments with numerous paths and options available to me at once is incredibly exhausting. I need to walk through every nook and cranny and find every collectible before I can move further, and my eyes are constantly scanning and looking for hidden things. It's incredibly fatiguing. On top of this, there's a voice telling me I need to be doing something else, but I can never figure out what that is. I can't just sit down and enjoy something. 

So yeah, I think I just needed to say some of this stuff. I don't really know why any of this is the way it is for me, but sometimes I forget the reasons *why* I'm anxious and it's all just a confusing abstract jumble. So I turned my thoughts into words this time.",1
Relationship anxiety,How do I overcome relationship anxiety? I’ve been with my partner for 5 years and as of the last two years I’ve noticed I’ve struggled with relationship anxiety. Is he the one? Am I settling etc? I also struggle with day to day anxiety and when I started the job I’m at I was extremely anxious about being nice and joking around with my male co worker because I was super afraid of accidentally cheating or flirting. To this day I’m still afraid I must have done something wrong not Intentionally. I get afraid of wanting attention from people and then accidentally doing something flirtatious. Idk my anxiety is just going crazy. Advice please ?,1
Long bout of anxiety triggered by (what might as well be) opiate withdrawal. Curious as to others’ experience with SSRI meds,"Before age 23, I never struggled with anxiety. And then I started my first real job and was absolutely crippled by it out of nowhere. That was July 2021. I talked to my doctor, got prescribed SSRI meds, had an AWFUL adjustment period of mood swings and at least one panic attack for 2 weeks, and then on day 14, boom. Anxiety gone. What a bizarre little pill. Stayed on them for a month or two longer, got used to my job, tapered off, and I was good. 

Well now my anxiety is back again and it feels distinctly different. I used this herbal supplement called kratom for a long time. It’s a powder made from a leaf from a tree that grows in southeast asia. It’s completely unregulated even though it’s pretty much an opiate. It heightens your mood, kills pain and makes you feel motivated and happy for an hour or two. It does this by reacting with your opioid receptors. So it makes sense to say it’s as physically addictive as painkillers. 

I took one 5 gram dose of it once a day. For about three years straight. I thought I wasn’t developing dependency because I was taking so little, only once a day. 

Well I decided to stop taking it a month ago and now I have anxiety, but it’s not the same as before. It’s like my base level of anxiety is slightly heightened, and it only becomes really bad if I use marijuana, nicotine, drink coffee, or eat too much sugar. When I’m dehydrated I feel it too. None of these things ever used to make my heart pound and give me that tight feeling in my chest. And sometimes it feels like I’ll get a wave of anxiety for no reason.

There is a subreddit for quitting kratom but I feel out of place there. Everyone there was using 10, 20, 30, 40 grams of kratom a day, dosing throughout the day. When THEY quit, they get cold sweats, restless lags, GI issues, brain fog, depression, it’s like quitting heroin, and a lot of them also report anxiety symptoms, and these same sensitivities to THC, caffeine, nicotine and sugar that I’m feeling. 

So I’m hoping this is just my brain’s reaction to not getting that hit of Euphoria for 1/2 hours once a day, and this is temporary. Today is day 26 without kratom. Never taking that stuff again. But I thought I’d be feeling a little better by now. Every day is pretty bad. No signs of improvement. But other kratom addicts have said it can take two or three or six months to feel like your normal self again. For some it can take a year or more, but that seems to be very severe kratom addicts. 

I started the SSRI meds that fixed me up last time. First day of taking them was yeaterday. I do NOT feel good on them. It’s going to be another BAD 2 weeks. But fingers crossed that I have the same experience with them and they just suddenly cure me like last time. I just have a bad feeling it’s not going to be so easy this time.",1
Journaling to solve worries?,"I kinda wanna use journaling as a method to untangle my mind but all I end up doing is complaining to myself and I'm not sure if it is helping. A lot of the time I forget any interesting ideas/ positive thoughts by the time i want to write them down.

&#x200B;

I wonder if writing down all that worries me just creates more focus towards the negative and reinforces it.

Maybe I've gotten so used to worrying and thinking negatively that saying anything positive feels uncomfortable and fake.

How do you guys think I should refocus my journaling?

Irrational Fear of Getting Arrested,"I’ve somehow just recently realized that almost all of my anxiety comes from the fear of getting arrested. To preface, I almost never break the law. A few examples of this are: I used a copyrighted image on my blog so I’m going to get sued for $150k, I dressed up as a police officer for Halloween so I’m going to prison for three years etc etc. These fears will pop up out of no where and can last for days and almost always involve me becoming an absolute legal expert in the area.

Anxiety is ruining my life and I don’t want to do anything but sleep so I don’t have to feel this way,"Just venting. 
Anxiety is causing me severe stomach issues to the point I’m just laying in bed constantly. I’ve no appetite from the pain, which leads to more pain/dizziness/fatigue/weakness from not eating. I’ve to force myself to eat anything at all, and it’s never a full meal. Currently on vacation for the next week and I’m just laying in bed being absolutely miserable and just wanting to go home. I know I’ve to work on reducing stressors and telling myself I’ll be ok, but it’s hard to feel like I’ll be ok when my stomach is hurting this much. I’ve tried 4 kinds of antidepressants and all of them gave me horrible side effects to the point I actually had increased anxiety while taking them. I’ve tried scheduling appointments with therapists but pretty much no one in my area is wanting to take a patient who isn’t wanting to also take medication.

Anxiety that suddenly vanishes at random times?,"So my anxiety consumes and covers me like a veil just randomly comes and go as it pleases. But the problem is, when it’s present I am often unaware. My thinking patterns do not change and my world just slowly feels heavier. Before I know it, it creeps over me and holds me captive until it leaves in a rapid “whoosh.”

Half of those fears are gone but I create new ones. Now i am much less OCD(which is good) and i only react on triggers... is this normal? I feel not that bad it got better the last 2 weeks...

My partner is unable to sleep and I don't know what to do,"My partner (m36) has had anxiety all his life. He has grown up with the mindset that men just be strong and stoic and brave. This is not from his parents, rather I think it is from his peers when he was a teenager. He has spoken about how he would cry when he was younger and be able to purge emotions in this manner, but that since his teens he hasn't cried. He has bottled up everything negative within him and not felt it in a healthy manner and it is now causing him to break.
For the last few days he has been sleeping for a maximum of 3 hours and tonight he hasn't slept at all. He has had 4mg of diazepam as prescribed to him on an emergency basis and it has done nothing to ease his anxiety or allow him to sleep. 
He is now feeling incredibly helpless and scared because he can't control this, and he is exhausted and just wants to sleep and escape his mind. I do not know how to help him. I've tried listening to all that he needs to vent, talking him through his feelings, as a visual thinker I've tried to get him to use the techniques I use with visualizing the anxiety as something or someone physical and talking to it. Please help me. I am very worried for him. He is returning to his family home to get medical help later in the morning, but he seems like he has given up.

"emotional ""control"" but in a bad way","TW: grief, cat death

One of my lovely kittens from my garden killed by a idiot car driver recently. I found his body this morning.

-I wanna share but you dont have to read this paragraph-
(I saw blood in road and think what if its him but i always think the worst so try to calm myself. Then check the garbage boxes and found him. Im really upset because we lost his mother 3 months ago and he is very shy so i was trying so hard to have a relationship with him. Its going well in last days, even he sat in my laps.)

I felt very bad when i saw him. But then my brain start to tortured me. Am i really upset or faking it? What should i think now? Go imagine his little face. Oh you arent really sad just try to make yourself upset for feel like a nice person. 

I know that i love animals truely. But this thoughts never stop. Do you feel this way and what do you do for managing?

Ps: sorry for bad english but im feeling bad and cant talk properly.",1
I just want to stop thinking for a while…,"I’m just so sick of always having something going on in my brain.

Are my gut feelings real? Or an excuse to miss out on exposure therapy,"I’m agoraphobic but am healing! I have an event for a close friend I'm supposed to attend tomorrow, all day I haven't been ""feeling good"" about it, but the thing is I'm not necessarily anxious but I don't feel up for it or feel like going. I have another one next weekend to attend, which I will be at for sure but tomorrows is not obligatory. I do however don't want to miss out but can't help but feel my gut is telling me not to go. The best way for me to explain is a low vibrational feeling in my stomach, the feeling however when focused on long enough is triggering thoughts of what could go wrong but even after practicing mindfulness and telling myself I’ll be okay this gut feeling is still lingering and has been all day. 

Are gut feelings/instincts real? Or is this my body's way of making an excuse to not face my fears. Thank you in advance",1
People around me feels aliens and It's giving me extreme paranoia,"I just don't know why but people around me, my family eveyone feels aliens. It's as if they are pretending to be human while they watch me and they are doing something bad to me. It's giving me extreme paranoia, I don't know what to do, what if I go insane and kill everyone? I don't want that, I live in 3rd world country therapist are rare and I won't be able to afford it anyway, Will this untreated anxiety will grow into something terrifying?

i think i just really freaked myself out over nothing (health anxiety) but i’d appreciate support,"yesterday i had to severe aches all over my body and a dry throat. the dry throat continued to today and i drank a lot more water than i usually do because of that. anyway because i drank so much water i had to go to the bathroom more because that’s how that works. 

mistakenly i looked up dry throat on google and the first result was for type 1 diabetes which sent me spiraling after it also said it could happen in a matter of days. i had a mild breakdown and started panicking over the idea i had type two diabetes despite a only fitting two of the symptoms (dry throat and frequently going bathroom). i then began applying other symptoms to myself like “yeah my vision isn’t blurry but what if it is and i just missed it???” 

i panicked for a while before i managed to get a hold of myself and take into account,

1. my throat is dry probably because my allergies are pretty severe right now and i sleep with a fan directly on my face at all times 

2. i have been drinking a ton of water because of the throat dry thing (6 water bottles today) and somehow ate clear/water based types of soup for every meal today so ofc i have to go to the bathroom more

3. i fit no other diabetes criteria and while i’m not insanely healthy i’m still fairly active and eat plenty of health foods and limit processed ones

anyway i’ve mostly recovered from my spiral but i’d appreciate some advice/reassurance. the logical part of me is telling myself to calm down and remember i put myself through health spirals frequently. last week it was rabies because i had a cut i didn’t recognize. 

health problems freak me out a lot and i wanted to just write out my reasoning to help calm myself down and i was also hoping y’all could understand and tell me your strategies for calming health anxiety related stuff (other than not googling your symptoms haha)",1
Feeling depressed and devastated. Honestly a hug would’ve even aid this pain.,"About six months ago I was just a normal human being. Careless, and did not worry about anything. I’ll admit, I’ve always been a hypochondriac throughout my 23 years of life but it never impeded me from doing anything I wanted to do. I worked, traveled, worked out, hung out with my friends and always had a great time. No anxiety at all. Six months ago, just out of nowhere my brain decided to ruin my life. I had a horrible panic attack that literally came from nowhere. I wasn’t even anxious at all. Never dealt with GAD. I obviously got very scared and ran to the ER because my heart wouldn’t slow down. I thought I was going to die if it didn’t slow down. After many tests everything turned out to be just a panic attack. Well, I thought that was it but little did I know that panic attack would change my life. Now, I can’t even exercise, walk far, travel or even hangout with my friends. I struggle to even be anxious free at work. Here is the most devastating thing: the girl I always wanted to be with, my dream girl, who did not know I had feelings for, wanted to hangout with me on two different occasions. I had to literally make up excuses to not go because of this agoraphobia and anxiety I’m dealing with. Now she’s dating someone else. Why did this happen to me? I never did drugs, drank or did anything stupid to cause my life to be the way it is now. I can’t even take my mom out for a Mother’s Day dinner without having too many second thoughts. My grandparents who I always visited and love to death are currently very sick and they live outside the country. Before, like most of us human beings would not worry about traveling. Now, I’m even worried about walking around my park. I don’t know what to do.. all of my plans I had have suddenly taken a major halt due to something totally unexpected. This is for sure one of the worst positions anyone could possibly be in. I don’t know what to do..",1

Trying to look perfect on social media is ruining my life and I need help,"I am insecure because I was bullied and feel like I’m not good enough and constantly compare myself to others and feel like I have something to prove to people who looked down on me, so now I try to look the best on social media. I am diagnosed with ocd which makes social media so much worse. I analyze everything I post to the tea. I won’t post if I have a hair tie on my wrist, or if the background doesn’t suit my outfit. It gets to a point where I buy outfits, get ready, and go places just for the photo. And if I feel like I don’t look good in the photo or my hair is messed up or something looks wrong I will feel so horrible about myself. And I can’t get the image out of my head of what the people who did me wrong would think if I didn’t prove them wrong. It eats me. I keep posting because the satisfaction of feeling like I do look good is addicting. It’s about not feeling like I’m ugly, but when I take photos i usually feel more ugly than I do pretty. And I don’t know what to do or how to stop revolving my life around some damn photos.",1

Issues regulating my nervous system,"This is fairly new to me but I’ve been dealing with ongoing anxiety and panic disorder and am looking for some information from others who deal with the same that might help. 

In therapy today, after telling my therapist about a panic attack I had yesterday, she said it sounds like my nervous system is very unregulated and very much in “fight” mode (in fight or flight). This is the first time I’ve heard of this and have a few questions.

Is that something that happens in the moment or is it in a constant state of being unregulated?
Is there a way to regulate it again for good?
Do I need to rest and reset or keep pushing through and putting myself in uncomfortable situations? Feels like I shouldn’t avoid stuff but also feels like my body needs a break.
Is a panic attack an unregulated nervous system or is generalized anxiety? Or both?
Any success stories of those who used to be in constant “fight” mode?

Any information helps, I just want to understand what’s going on and what I can do to feel better.",1
Does anyone suffer from Hyperstimulation Anxiety?,"Hi everyone --

I'm wondering if anyone else here suffers from Hyperstimulation Anxiety?

I've always been a somewhat anxious individual since I was a teenager (due to pretty low self esteem/social awkwardness).

When I turned 21 (I'm 40 now!!) after several stressful days and poor sleep my nervous system became hypersensitive to everything and has never calmed down.

It basically boils down to symptoms of nervous system and sensory hypersensitivity. It's just perpetual discomfort on a daily basis. I already exercise, eat as healthy as I can, do regular deep breathing, etc. 

I try my best to avoid any excess stress but because of how overreactive my nervous system is, any miniscule stress ( like temp changes for instance ) acts like a major stressor.

I've been started on Zoloft 50mg (I've tried Paxil, Effexor, and Celexa in the past) so I'm hoping maybe it will help.

To those that have experienced this, was there any ways to finally calm and insanely sensitive nervous system?

Thanks!",1
"Anyone else have a weird reaction to any sudden noises, big or small?",Hi so I've noticed for a while now that whenever there's any sudden noises my head jerks forward. This happens often already whenever I'm extremely anxious about something underlying (which is always). But now instead of it just being a reaction to my anxiety it's started to happen with any noise. Like I'm at school right now in my art class and someone just dropped their paper which made a noise (it's Bristol paper so pretty thick paper) and my head jerked forward. This happens all the time but also not? Like it picks and chooses. I don't know if this is normal. Does anyone else experience this? Is this something I should mention to my therapist?,1

I feel worthless,"I met him on vacation, and we hung out for two days. I'm a very socially anxious person, but with him, I felt like I've known him for years. One night, he told other teenagers that he liked me. They all told me, and they were hyping me up saying stuff like ""oh look your boyfriend's here"". I was so excited. I never had a guy like me before. Ever. All my life, I was treated as a freak, so I was just glad for this opportunity for something special. So I went up to him and asked him if he liked me. He told me he had a girlfriend, and got really mad at our friends for telling me.

  
He cut off all contact with me after. I blocked him on Instagram after he rejected my Instagram request. I was so sad that the guy I liked decided it would be best if he never saw me again. The one person who saw me for all the good I have to offer, and he still gave it up. They broke up two months later, and he still looks at my social media. We're not in contact, but according to my friend, a playlist on his Spotify was made as a birthday present to me. But I don't forgive him. I've never had the privilege of falling in love before, and he just took it away from me. I'm not mad at him for having a girlfriend. I'm just mad at him for saying he was into me when he knew full well that he couldn't be with me, even if he wanted to.",1

post argument anxiety not going away,"long story short my bf and i got into one of our first legit arguments and it was based off of his reaction towards my emotional mood and it’s all over with, said and done, but i’m scared his feelings are gonna change and he will think i’m weird or crazy or too much or annoying, idk.. 

he actually apologized to me and was scared i was gonna leave him and after i reassured him we were fine and haven’t talked about it, but the thought at the back of my mind is telling me he’s gonna leave he just hasn’t realized it or he’s planning the right moment or he doesn’t want to talk to me but he doesn’t want to hurt me or that he’s lost interest, i can’t get these racing thoughts out of my head and i don’t want to bring this up because i need to learn to let go and trust that he would tell me but it’s so hard. has anyone else gone through something similar?",1
Hangxiety,I went out the other week and drank far too much. I blacked out and can’t remember much. All I can really remember is falling off a bench oops. I’ve asked people what I was like to try and to seek reassurance but they have said I was just very drunk. I seem to recall also having some cross words with someone who often has made unnecessary comments to me in the past which I’ve let slide… I feel the drink may have aided my confidence to stand up to them. But I cannot remember how the conversation went down and it was infront of people who I do not know. My sister said she was concerned for how drunk I was but more of a how am I going to get this bitch home rather than me acting out of line. Other people have also said you were fine just drunk. I keep messaging people asking if I’ve offended or disrespected them or if I was really bad or embarrassing. But now because of my lack of memory and my friends ‘ you were just drunk’ version of reassurance I’m panicking. We are a week on now and my anxiety is crippling. I don’t want to leave my four walls. I’m struggling to sleep and I keep replaying the events over and over in my head. I know it seems irrational but has anyone got any advice or reassurance apart from the obvious ‘ stop drinking’.,1

This whole situation has made me so stressed… idk how to handle my emotions rn.,"Recently, I got into a minor fender bender as I was trying to park my car in for the night. It was slow speed, nobody got hurt and we both exchanged info so it was nothing out of the ordinary. After getting into contact with the other person, I find out they filed an insurance claim right away which I’ll be the first to admit is a smart move.

However, after a bit of back and forth texting, told them that paying out of pocket would be better than dealing with insurance. They said they’d talk to their parents and get back to me which they did a day later and said that it would be ok to do that. So I called up my insurance and told them the situation. At this point, my anxiety really shut off because I won’t have to worry about a mark on my record and paying extra money for insurance for years.

Fast forward to today, they tell me they talked to someone else now they want to go through insurance. I had already called my insurance and told them to cancel the claim after confirming with that person that we were going to settle this on our own. Now they go back on their word and I’ve been trying to convince them otherwise the whole day but they won’t budge.

Now obviously if they want to go through insurance I won’t stop them. But it’s seriously a massive inconvenience to me because instead of paying them $200 to fix a broken headlight and scratched bumper, I’ll instead have to pay probably close to and extra $100 a month on insurance for 3 years until the ticket is off my record. 

So I’ve basically been in and off freaking out with every indecision they make. I’ve spent the week at school and work trying to keep my composure in front of my peers and today I was so stressed, I couldn’t even eat lunch which is usually my main meal of the day. Man, I’ve been saving up for a new car for years now and now I’ll have to wait more because it won’t be worth the extra money insurance is going to scam me out of.

Idk what more I can do to prove I’m trustworthy and that I promise to pay them every cent of the repair. I’ve given them every step they need to take to get a repair quote including a body shop location. I wish they could just open up their heart this one time and let me pay them out of pocket. Even mentioning insurance is like torture to my brain.",1

need help,"hi.. so basically im just worried sometimes about how i react to things at times and wanted help figuring myself out. i do have anxiety and its been worsening alot but one thing that really concerns me is how i worry excessively - i would say abnormally - to insignificant minute things.. like small things that shouldnt even matter, that one wouldnt even think about.. like worrying excessively before sending any kind of message, starting a conversation like just worrying about if i sound right or if it makes sense. i use twitter too so alot of times i think too much before tweeting. like about every word. i think in my interactions with people i always focus on having to sound absolutely correct and sensible .. to the point that its draining. and i dont like it :/ such things dont even matter so i wanna change myself.. i was just worried about what this particular trait says about me and which category do i fall under? it would help me alot if other people can share their own experiences too :)",1
Need help communicating with an anxiety inducing friend,"Hi there,

My friend and I don't have any visible issues but every time I was in a group with her, I did more work, felt a lot of stress and she acted like she contributed evenly. She is toxic as an individual but she's not a bad friend per day to me at least. 

I have a hard time with confrontation and I switched myself to another group without saying anything (I'll use the excuse that the prof did it). 

The issue is the prof didn't switch any one else around and I just don't want to worth with her group on this. She's seen I'm not in the group and is asking I switch back. 

Not sure how to deal with this, I was thinking of telling her I'm fine with the group the prof switched me into but I'm worried this will impact our friendship etc. 

For context I'm in a graduate program that requires A LOT of group work, I'm working w her for all the classes except for this one now. 

Any advise is welcome, this has been causing me more anxiety (the thought of getting back to her is literally so nerve wracking) than necessary.",1
Has anyone received relief from involuntarily blurting out words?,"When I have a negative thought, I will sometimes involuntarily blurt out a word or a grunt or a sigh. I see the shock in people’s faces. It’s very embarrassing. It’s hard and even impossible to recover from it socially. It gets worse. I will also dissociate, seemingly black out for a few seconds, having no idea what I said; the blacking out happens once every couple of years or so. But it just happened again. 

I was recently with some new people in a social situation, and we were hitting it off great. Then at the end of the party, I seemed to a have ruined it. I was leaving the party and getting my things. There was a struggle to get my things together. I was exhausted. I remember struggling with my things but I don’t remember saying anything. Then someone asked me if I was ok. Everyone got quiet like the mood was killed. It’s a terrible feeling. I know I said something, but I don’t know what. I just left the party. 

I’ve been through therapy and I’ve done EMDR in the past. But I can’t seem to shake this issue. It’s really making me sad today. I just called a therapist who specializes in anxiety. It’s time to go back.

I do not take any anti-anxiety or anti-depression medication. Maybe it’s time to look into those again. It’s been over fifteen years since I was on medication for depression. 

I’ve been through some tough stuff that I won’t get into here. I guess it’s taken its toll. I hope help is around the corner. I feel pretty beat up right now. It scares me that I haven’t been able to stop this. It’s a helpless feeling.",1

Work. Be Sad. Die?,"There isn't a lot of people in my life that I can express this to soo here I am. I've always had a very hard time using words to express what I really want to say. That equals to a lot of stuttering and stammering until I give up and usually get frustrated with myself. Writing helps.

I work a part time job and I get paid ten dollars an hour. This is relevant later. This is my first job out of college and I genuinely love my job. I've been working for about a year and while I enjoy what I do I cant help but feel stagnant. After a year working I still have nothing to show for it.  I still live at home. I don't know how to drive and my parents usually drive me everywhere. Do I hate this? Yes, very much. It's not that I'm not allowed to drive, I just don't have anyone to teach me (different story) or a car to use.

It's gotten to the point that I feel resentment towards my own home. I wake up everyday and I don't want to get out of bed. However, I realized that I completely despise my bed. I hate my room (I share with my sister). I hate all of my stuff that I used to love and collect. I hate all of my clothes and how they fit me. I want to buy more clothes but I cant because I don't make enough to just splurge on myself. I have a car payment (for a car I cant even drive) and I'm currently trying to go back to school for something low-key in the hopes of getting a better job. Everyday I see myself and I hate how I look (I'm very overweight). I sometimes wonder if I'm actually hungry or if its the ED just making me thing that I am. I'm starting to withdraw into myself and my family is noticing. I don't want them to but I also don't have the energy to keep pretending that I'm happy. How do I fix it? Does this shit actually get better or is this just my life now. My family always jokes that I'm very bitter. The thing is, I never saw myself as that. I remember always being happy and excited. I was the girl that used to hype people up. The girl that loved to yell the lyrics to songs in the car. I was the girl that wanted to go out every weekend with friends. To be described as bitter is eye opening. Like..why even try? I'm currently at work right now and all I want to do is go home. I want to sleep and just not wake up. I hate my bed but it's also the only thing that I have. It feels like an itch in my chest. It itches and itches and I want to explode.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. Like I said I don't have many people to have this conversation with and even if I did I am not sure I would be able to express it properly. I realize how all over the place my rant was, sorry. Does anything ever get better?",1
"My anxiety and depression is so bad, it's affecting every aspect of my life, and I don't know where to start.","Just like the title says, my anxiety and depression is affecting every aspect of my life. Let me start with a little backstory for context of where my anxiety and depression started, if there is indeed even a start point.

Growing up, we were poor. Not just poor, but very poor. Some weeks we couldn't even afford food, so I had to steal food from the Safeway down the road just to eat. Imagine being a 10 year old kid, stuffing all sorts of things down super baggy jeans you wore specifically for that purpose. Hot dogs, macaroni and cheese, basically anything that is ready to eat or easy to cook. When we had money for food, it was $1 12 packs of ramen noodles. 25 cent boxes of macaroni and cheese. 2 dollar boxes of instant mashed potatoes. That was my diet for the first 12 years of life.

Mother was always either married temporarily, or having promiscuous sexual encounters with many many different men weekly. Sometimes both, which is why I put temporarily married, because she's been married 4 times at this point. She's also always abused many kinds of illicit drugs and always been a drunk, I can't remember more than 3 occasions in my entire life where she was sober longer than a week or 2. We never had a car, I walked or rode a bike everywhere I went. 2 hour walk to my first job literally every day. She wouldn't have been able to drive anyway because she spent most waking moments drunk or high on meth (that was always the preferred drug but she would always take what she could get).

Biological father was never around. He was court ordered to pay a grand total of $7.31 a week in child support to help support me and my mother raising me as a single mother my whole life. That's about 30 bucks a month, which covered above stated crappy diet. Mom spent most of our money on the bills we could barely afford on waitress pay, a whopping $2.33/hr (she's only ever been wait staff literally my entire life, never had any other profession besides a short time working for Quiznos as assistant manager but that's a tale for another day).

I spent a lot of time as a kid emulating her behavior. I smoked weed, tried other drugs, and drank a lot. Dropped out of high school junior year to get a full time job to help pay bills. Even with my job, we were still barely making it because the more we had, the more she spent on drugs. It got bad enough at one point she was spending over half our money every month on drugs. Just enough for the crappy diet to continue and bills paid. It was horrible and there's a lot more to it, so if you'd like further information on my childhood, I can get to it in the comments but this post is already getting long as is so I'll leave my childhood where it's at.

Fast forward to the summer of 2008. I was 19 and I was trying to get away from my life slumming it on people's couches and smoking weed until I felt nothing, and drinking until I forgot everything. I needed a change. I had met a girl on Facebook and she sent me money to move. This is a long story as well, so let's suffice to say I thought I was in love with her so I moved to California to be with her (from Wyoming where most of what happened above took place). Long story short, things did not go as planned and we went our separate ways. Except that I didn't have anywhere to go because I was broke in the middle of California with no job and nowhere to live. I ended up joining a weird almost culty Christian sober living program and ended up in a household with 5 other people who used to be drunks and drug addicts. I was going nowhere with this as well, so I did the most sensible thing I could (that's what I thought at the time) and joined the Marines. 

My time in the military can be summarized in one statement of two facts: I was drunk and lonely. I spent most of my time working obviously, but every spare second I wasn't working I was drunk. I got admitted to a rehab program the Navy offered at the time and was booted out of the Marines literally a couple days before my End of Active Service date, because I failed the program. Someone brought in vodka in a water bottle and I was busted with them. I ended up losing the promotion I was about to receive to NCO, and because it was a general under honorable conditions separation, it's still considered an honorable discharge but I lost my benefits, mainly the one that could've helped me. My college benefits under the Post 9/11 GI Bill. 

So I went back to Wyoming and continued crashing on couches for a while until an old childhood friend, who also joined the military but different branch, offered to let me move up to live with him and get on my feet in a different state. Time for another change, this one ended differently though. I moved in with him, got a job, and actually started improving. Met my wonderful wife at that point and we've now been married for almost 10 years, so there's a silver lining. Problem is, I've been through lots of life threatening situations, I've been through lots of drugs and drinking. My brain at best feels like it's incomplete. I'm constantly worried about health problems but also worried about the money it would take to get looked at by a doctor. I'm also worried because I don't feel good enough for my wife and most aspects of our lives together have been affected. Sex life, mental health (we both have anxiety and depression, I also think I still have ADHD that I was diagnosed with as a kid and never ""grew out of"") and financial wellness. Again, I won't go into detail, as this post is long already and we have the comments to discuss. 

I guess this is just to vent, but I honestly don't know what to do because I'm constantly irritated by everything and always angry. Constantly depressed and worried about things. Also not good at communication. Get mad or irritated with the stupidest little things. I'm trying to be a better husband but also have almost zero motivation to even get up and move around let alone go do something for her as a gesture to show her how much I love her. Any advice for someone who is having a hard time understanding life at this point?",1
Products that relieve anxiety/stress?,"I’m looking for products e.g fidget toys, medication (that doesn’t need a prescription) etc that help to relieve anxiety.

How to deal with the fear of hearing things/going crazy?,"A few days ago I was lying in my bed and was reading some news articles on my phone. Suddenly I heard something like a distant laugh (It wasn't really a laugh but it's the best comparison I can think of as it was not a clear sound) and it lasted maybe a second. Still, it really freaked me out because I could think of no possible reason for that noise and it triggered my fear of going crazy and hearing voices or some other stuff. 

In the last few days nothing similar to this happend again and I have started to come down a little. But now everytime I hear an unfamiliar sound I'm worried and the fear comes up again. It has made me quite sensitive to sounds in my surroundings and it makes it seem like I hear weird noises a lot more than before.

Has anyone of you guys had this fear/ these symptoms before and do you have any advice on how to deal with this fear?

I'm thankful for any tips!",1
Social Anxiety is ruining my life,"I honestly have no idea how to begin or if this will even read coherently but, 

I have social anxiety, it’s the type that causes irrational overthinking of social situations, panic and usually the immense urge to run away and hide. 

My issue relates to real life interactions and video game interactions (I’m a big gamer) I play games that are designed to be played with other people but yet I struggle to do so because the idea of using a microphone and talking to other people causes me to panic

In real life however I’ve basically become an isolationist. I’ve not seen any friends for years, I hardly ever leave the house. I lost my job during the early days of covid and haven’t had the confidence to go back out there and get another, which in turn has only made the anxiety worse. I overanalyse everything, every person I walk past could be a threat to me. I even cut my own hair because going to a hair dressers and having to make idle conversation would make me want to run. 

All of this originates back to when I was in school (I’m 24 now) I was bullied terribly, never had many if any friends.

This is compounded by part of my family instilling in me the “get on with it” attitude, they have little to no sympathy for mental health issues and call it weakness. Being raised around this has caused me to keep my issues to myself, again adding to the problem. 

I live in the UK and have tried several times to get a doctors appointment but I’ve not been successful due to waiting lists and such. Also the thought of having to say all of this to someone’s face makes me feel very fearful

I’ve allowed my person appearance to slip, i don’t look after myself as well as I should and sometimes getting out of bed feels like the hardest thing I’ve ever done. 

I guess what I’m asking for is advice or just to know I’m not the only one feeling like this, because it seems like everyone around me has an abundance of confidence.

Maybe I can even make a few friends who feel the same way. Id be more at ease being around others that also struggle as I wouldn’t feel like the “odd one out”",1
Is anyone else very distrusting of other people in general?,"Like you tend to assume people have bad intentions, they will take advantage of you or hurt you if you be vulnerable around them, they're only nice to you because they expect to get something in return, etc.

Idk, I know there definitely are people like that but I don't think it's normal or healthy that I do this with virtually everyone including my parents and family. I can hardly think of anyone that I've ever known who I didn't have these fears around. It's just instinct for me to assume the person in front of me is malicious and callous.

Makes forming any relationships at all very hard because I always come off cold and reserved, and people have told me they notice it.",1
fear of brain eating amoeba (naegleria fowlri),"hi all. i’m currently located in texas, and obviously all the lakes here are pretty warm due to texas being hot as hell in the summer.

yesterday, i went out on the lake with a few of my friends, and i got water up my nose twice from falling off a board while wake surfing.

i’ve been super freaked out ever since, and even though it’s a super rare infection, i need some advice and reassurance that i will be okay. the people i was with said i was completely overthinking it, but i think i have really bad luck and if anyone was going to get this amoeba it would be me.

plz help me calm down bc my anxiety has been SO bad since yesterday :( do i have it?? am i going to die now???",1
Did you ever figure out what caused your anxiety attack?,"I had an anxiety attack a few weeks ago that very nearly got me to the emergency room. it woke me up from my sleep. it's impossible to describe that feelings but it's so negative and so intense. you can tell yourself all you want that nothing is wrong and to calm down but you can not get it to go away. I felt the same thing years ago the last few times I smoked weed. It sent me into that dark spiral. Your thoughts race so fast and you feel intense grief, guilt, sadness, dread, agony. You feel insane because your thoughts are too fast to keep up with let alone control. I went to the ER but by the time I got to the parking lot it stopped on it's own, which was about 2 hours after it started. I went to a psychologist but it was like 2 weeks later before i could get an appointment. He didn't seem to think I was under any great amount of stress. I had nothing really bad to talk about other than this incident. My life was going pretty well. He told me I should have gone to the ER for a blood test because it sounded more like a physical thing to him than psychological. So I made an appointment at my GP which I just went to. He said it doesn't sound physical at all. It sounds completely psychological. He took my bloodwork anyway just as part of a regular physical. He said every single vital he took today could not have been healthier. My breathing, blood pressure, everything was exactly on the money. I'll wait for the lab results but he said there is not really a test that will find anything related to this. He told me that if I did go to the ER, there is nothing they could have done for me. They would have talked to me until it went away on it's own. I asked him if they would have given me benzodiazepines, and he said no, that's only for panic attacks which means chest pains. 

&#x200B;

tl'dr it may have been an isolated incident and i may never get an explanation.",1
Cold turkey,"Hi! Anyone here who quit their meds cold turkey? I've been on sertraline and risperidone for eight months now. I'm planning on quitting since funds are low. I'll quit seeing my psychiatrist as well. I have prepared alternative coping mechanisms for my anxiety which include meditation, exercise and writing on a journal. What should I expect if I quit cold turkey?",1
Hello. I was wonder if you could help me with my Anxiety.,"So when ever I get into situations like public speaking, sports, interviews, talking to people etc I sometimes (it just depends really) I get this anxiety where my legs and hands will go numb and I panic of course…   I guess I go into fight or flight mode. Like I want to talk to people but at the same time I won’t initiate it out of fear. 🙄 I literally hate it because I don’t want to feel this way and even when I try not to it still happens. It does make me avoid certain situations and situations I’d like to do. Is there any medication or things to do to help stop this? Of course like just put yourself in situations to get better at it... Breath and calm yourself… Have confidence… It has gotten better over the years but I’m just really tired of it happening.",1
Feeling frustrated and needed to rant,"Ive been unemployed for a couple of months, recently graduated from college so it was kinda stressful. Well recently I got a job that involves handling calls. Its not my dream job but I need money.
The problem is that I just can't do it. My body is pumped full of adrenaline, my stomach is in knots, my back starts to hurt. And yeah I did take a few calls already but I was trembling the whole time. After I was done I slept for like 12 hours. 
I just sit in front of the screen completely paralized.
I don't know why this is such a struggle for me. I'm not thinking of failure or judgment or anything like that. Just the concept of being on call with someone gives me dread. 
And I can't start working until I'm calm because I know my voice will shake. But the more I try to breath and relax  the more my body starts acting up. Nausea, chills, tears, you name it.",1
What happened?,"I was thinking of what would happen if my parents made a specific decision regarding me. It feels stupid so I don't want to say what but it was but it was something only they had the power to decide so I wouldn't been able to do much if they did.

A scenario played in my head and the world faded out for a second and I felt terrified. I had a split-second thought of ""why am I scared if nothing's happening?"" and the world came back and the fear, It didn't go away, but it went down to what usually was my peak anxiety levels. It happened so fast I barely even registered the terror. Only after it stopped did I realize my heart was racing and I was shaking. I don't know if it stopped because I realized I shouldn't be scared or if it just stopped so quickly regardless.

My sister said it sounded like a panic attack when I told or but it lasted for like a second? Or I guess it peaked for a second? Idk. That was years ago and it never happened again. People can have one off panic attacks but again it was so quick and it seemed like I might've stopped it by just the thought of ""I shouldn't be scared"" which panic attacks aren't typically controllable, right? I know there's grounding techniques or something but people don't just snap themselves out of it like that, do they?",1
Do I use my anxiety as an ‘excuse’ to get out of bad behaviour?,"My partner (F32) for about 10 months sometimes accuses me (M31) of not paying attention to her, not being involved, being rude, self centred or arrogant. 

I feel I am excessively anxious around her and too overwhelmed because she treats me way better than anyone ever has. Such complaints from her get me more anxious and sometimes I start panicking.

I feel like I am using my anxiety as an excuse to not treat her nicely. I do love her and she is super supportive of my mental health, but I feel like the inadequate behaviour is pushing them away.",1
How should I go about getting/keeping a job with my anxiety and fear of failure?,"I have GAD and mostly because of this I have a big phobia of failing, so much so that it prevents me from doing certain tasks, like applying for a keeping a job.

When I was 15, I was unmedicated and I applied for a job at a fast food chain, I got the job but was so anxious every time I had to go in that I also threw up every morning. Though, once I was there, after half an hour or so I was fine and even began to enjoy myself but the next morning I was back to being anxious. A few days in, I was super anxious one morning and ended up quitting that morning because my mother asked me if I wanted to, so I did. I immediately regretted it and still do. It makes me feel lots of shame just thinking about it.

Now, I haven’t had a job since but I’m wanting to apply for one so I can get some money. But every time I even think about applying, I get scared that the ending is going to be the exact same. That’s where my fear of failure comes in… I’d rather not even try then risk failing… I know this is very bad and preventing me from growing but I don’t know… It makes me nauseous just thinking of failing and feeling that shame again. The first time I brought me to a VERY dark place. I can’t imagine what would happen if history repeated itself.

Whenever I ask my parents what to do they just say something along the lines of “I don’t know, just don’t do it if it worries you that much.""

Anyone have advice for how I can get over this? Or any advice at all? Basically I’m asking, what would you tell your child if they were in a situation like this? Parental-like advice would be nice.",1
My (25F) boyfriend (26M) is not talking to me because of his ongoing illness which is making me really anxious. Need advice!,"Hi, so for a little context, my bf is suffering from TB (not the contagious kind) and is on bed rest from the past 1.5 months. In the beginning he thought it was just a normal back pain but later, he found out it's TB. So, yes, because of this we haven't met since March end. A week or two ago, he even asked me ""Since we haven't been meeting and idk when we will, have you ever thought during this time that you should move on"" I was like ""no, this thought never even crossed my mind and it never will"" then he said ""okay, this made me happy"".So, at that time it actually wasn't bothering me as much because we were talking a good amount of time over the phone but now from the past week, he has stopped talking also, we talk for like 20-30 minutes max. throughout the day and this is really making me overthink a lot. I asked him last night why has he been so distant lately (He has been throwing up a lot because of his medications, which is making his body feel weak and he does not feel good because of this) So, he said that he hasn't been distant, he's just not in a great place because of his health, and he doesn't feel like doing anything. Then he said bye, I was like why are you saying bye, he said he doesn't feel like talking (he meant, in general).So, him not talking to me is really bothering me because we have only been together for 4 months now, and in my last relationship, my ex stopped talking to me in bits, like my current bf is doing but the difference is my current bf is sick that is why he is doing it, but the trauma i have because of my ex is making me overthink and question my bf. I am sorry for this long story but I am really in a fucked up place right now and idk what to do. Also, i am scared that he will forget me if he don't talk to me as much as we were before, and then he will breakup. And i honestly don't have it in me to go through another heartbreak.TL;DR - Boyfriend of 4 months isn't talking to me due to his ongoing illness which is making me Anxious and overthink a lot.

Living with chronic anxiety/ocd is so exhausting.,"(this story is kind of funny i give you permission to laugh at my pain lol) 

Yesterday i deep cleaned my room, i found a cockroach and my OCD brain told me “your entire room is contaminated time to deep clean”. My logical brain knows the roach probably just came through the window while it was open or made it’s way somehow inside and just happened to be in my room but of course OCD decided i had a nest under my bed! 

so i vacuumed everything (including under my bed which means i have to move my entire mattress and of course there was no nest lmao), I wiped everything down, organised drawers, tidied, took the rubbish out, sleazed up anything that could attract insects in a thick plastic box, basically anything that could be cleaned or organised was. It was very much overkill as i do keep my room pretty tidy. 

to add salt into the wound of my crazy ocd cleaning spree, today i woke up with extreme fatigue and exhaustion and pain all over AND i found another FREAKING COCKROACH….. i’m so tired 😭",1
Work and life choices,"
Hi everyone, I'm sorry if this goes a bit long but I really need some advice...I've had awful anxiety my whole life, and I'm also diagnosed with ASD and ADHD. About a month and a half ago I started on some new medication and I feel like it's really made some good changes for me, but is also opens but some issues. I've been working with the idea that I wanted to do something in childcare because I have a qualification and it's something I know I can do. Since the medication has kicked in though I feel like I finally have the ability and motivation to study and do something with my life that I'd be more exited about..unfortunately i have absolutely no idea what that is. I need a job to pay my bills because I'm 23 and out of home, and I'm worried that I wouldn't have time to study anyway..but I really just can't see myself enjoying childcare much more and I don't know what to do and it's sending me into a spiral. I've taken so many career quizes and there are so mmay results that seem interesting to me, hut I know I can't do them all but I can't seem to get it down to just one...

Am I doomed to just be in this job I hate forever because I missed my opportunity to study what I wanted to because of my mental health? I could really use some advice...I appreciate it",1

Can having one panic attack trigger something in the body to have more anxiety long term?,"I was on Lexapro several months ago and one night for no reason I woke up and had a horrible panic attack. I had never had a panic attack before so this feeling was completely new to me. I didn’t know what it was at first. I thought something was seriously wrong. After that I felt like I never really felt the same. That following week I had another really bad panic attack and I had to be put on hydroxyzine which really helped because I felt in a constant state of panic everyday. 

I switched off of Lexapro shortly after thinking that is why I had the panic attacks. I then went onto Zoloft. I had previously been taking hydroxyzine before bed every night in fear that I would wake up having a panic attack again. I finally tried not taking it during the night and found I would wake up with increased anxiety for no reason. So i would take some hydroxyzine and I would usually be able to calm myself down eventually. 

A few months later I felt like Zoloft just wasn’t doing anything for me so now I am on Effexor. I’ve been on it for a few months now on 75mg. To be honest I can’t tell if it’s working or not. I don’t want to go off of it and realize that it was helping. But Im worried that if I go on a high dose it will mess me up like the Lexapro did. 

I still sometimes feel that increased anxiety waking up if I don’t take hydroxyzine. I’m wondering if that is the meds causing this, or if it’s because of that one panic attack I had that triggered something in me to just feel completely different after that point on.",1
feel weird to feel “alive”,"I’ve suffered with anxiety mainly my whole life. 

When i’m not anxious I start to feel sad. Its like I become hypersensitive to how shitty the world is and it brings on depressive feelings. 

Or its like when Im not anxious and feel like i’m living in the moment, my mind freaks out and thinks I’m going to die or pass out because its like “ I’m finally feeling happy so something bad is about to happen “

idk if any of this makes sense. But basically whenever im not anxious I feel weird and get paranoid",1
I had a rage episode with my mom and I'm trying to analyze what happened. Would appreciate some advice.,"I have anxiety problems that I am in therapy for.  More specifically, I have rage issues in my family (grandfather and father all have rage problems) and while I know I have it in smaller increments than they do, I want to be able to control it or prevent it from getting worse.  That is one of my biggest goals in therapy (along with working on my anxiety in general).  I've had maybe \~5 major rage episode in my life (including today).  So it isn't as big of a problem for me as it is in my dad, I just don't want it to get worse.  I am the first person in my family to go to therapy that I'm aware of so I AM taking steps...

&#x200B;

I was driving home from the therapy session when this happened.  I was talking with my mom and she  she put me on hold.  I was getting off on a highway and merging onto another one, and there was a really slow car in front of me + a car behind me tailgaiting me.   So she came back onto the phone and I said ""please hold on"" (I was getting stressed from the tailgaiting) to which she spoke over, so I said it again - and she continued to talk.  I then yelled ""I said hold on"" and got pissed and hung up on her.  

&#x200B;

Once I was safely on the highway I called her back to explain that I was asking her to hold on and she was just talking over me.  (My mom has a habit of talking over me and I've mentioned it in the past to her.  I do the same and she also gets frustrated.  I AM trying to be aware of this and stop).  So she kept cutting me off & talking over me as I was saying this, so I started getting angry and saying that what happened 5 minutes ago was happening again...right now.  But she was cutting me off/talking over now to apologize for what happened 5 minutes ago (in a dismissive way ""fine,  I'm sorry"".)  So I said what she was doing before is literally still happening (dismissing what I'm saying and just talking over me).  Like she doesn't let you finish your sentence, she kind of just cuts in and talks over you.  And she was saying she's not talking over me....And then I lost control.   I went into rage mode.  I didn't just yell but I went like a notch higher and I feel REALLY bad about this now.  It lasted like a minute of me cursing at her and yelling at how she is always so dismissive & that is literally happening as we are talking about it.

&#x200B;

So she (rightfully so) said she's upset with me now and doesn't want to talk and hung up.  I drove another 5 minutes and called her back to apologize.  This is where I'm trying to get control of the rage and take responsibility (something my father never does).  I said I was sorry and that I wanted to talk about why I'm upset.  I did say that it was ""two notches too high"" and that my screaming was overboard.  I went on to discuss in a much more calm manner this talking over/dismissive talking that was happening is what caused me to get so angry.  But then she was saying she wasn't talking over me at all...so this kind of went back and forth in a MUCH more calm way (from me).  She said sorry a few times but kept denying she was doing it...so I said her sorry doesn't mean anything if she doesn't understand what I am complaining about in the first place.  Like she isn't acknowledging that she is talking over me or cutting into when I'm speaking (she IS doing it)...the conversation went on a bit longer and then we hung up (can't remember if we said bye or it was another abrupt hangup).

&#x200B;

I got to my house and I broke down in my car.  I started crying about that rage incident (that lasted a minute).  It's the exact thing I'm trying to avoid/focus on, and yet it is happening.  It hasn't happened THAT much in my life -- I think it was the stress of the overall day for me + not eating since breakfast (this was 6PM) and my mom was cutting me off too -- I lost it and I took it out on  her.  

&#x200B;

I called her again (from my car still) to talk about all of this.  We both said we were upset with each other.  I said again that I was REALLY SORRY for how angry I got.  She tried to keep defending herself and saying she wasn't cutting me off...and so that conversation began again about how she IS cutting me off and I keep telling her this (others tell her as well...).  We got back to the rage and by this point we were both in tears (she could hear my voice trembling) and I was sincerely sorry for the rage portion of what happened - but I wanted to address what was causing me to snap.

&#x200B;

I compared the situation to my dad who NEVER apologizes for getting into these rage modes.  He just ignores it and pretends like it doesn't happen.  I told my mom that I'm calling her because I don't want to be like him.  I wanted to discuss (in a calm manner) what was causing me to get angry, rather than not addressing the issue.  We went on to talk for another 5-10 minutes and said our goodbyes (said ""I love you"" to each other which I almost never say to my mom).  We spoke again after she had dinner and I mentioned to her that I was in therapy for this exact reason (to deal with the rage stuff).  We then spoke for another 20 minutes about unrelated stuff...

&#x200B;

\*Now I think after the initial yelling/rage episode I should NOT have called my mom back so soon.  I should have waited until after I was done driving and kind of given myself a chance to cool off but at the time I wanted to address it head on.  I plan to discuss this with my therapist next week but after that will not see her for almost a month.  I'm kind of looking for general advice on working on that kind of rage issues.  TBH I'm not sure if the therapist I'm seeing is even helping me with this (we were talking about it today but that is my vibe in general after \~8 months).  My doctor mentioned Lexapro for me two weeks ago as a suggestion if I'm not able to control my anxiety and if it is getting worse....  Is that a good idea?  I do have some Alprazolam (Xanax) that I have and I DON'T want to rely on that at (I did take one today but it is rare for me to take these).  I want to keep practicing what I'm learning about techniques about anxiety but this rage issue is what I'm truly focusing on figuring out how to deal with.",1
Heart palpitations..,"How do I accept that my heart palpitations are just a part of my anxiety?

I ruin everything.,"I feel like i ruin everything.  The way my brain works, my anxiety over nothing. The thing is I'm aware, I am aware that it's ME who is thinking these things and reacting the way i do. 

Yesterday my boyfriend said that he feels like he can't do anything because of my anxiety. He feels trapped and angry with me. 

And i feel so sad, i don't want him to feel like that around me or at all. I feel like he would be better off without me, that i am his reason for unhappiness and that I'm not really a good person. I feel so guilty and unworthy all the time. 

I try so hard to be calm and chill but i don't trust him. I don't feel safe with him. I don't think he really loves me. 

He's told me he doesnt want to marry me, he doesn't try to come see me, when he gets mad at me he grabs me and he's put his hands around my neck and it scares me. 

I am so sad all the time and its because i ruin everything.

AI-induced anxiety,"So this is going to sound stupid, but for a moment, I need to get this off my chest:

For fun, I've been playing around with textAI sits, they are fun at first, but there is a level of realism that unsettles me.

It will usually spiral like this: ""Hey, TextAI, say something motivating about continuing to study in my field!""

and it will say something that is surprisingly inspiring, perhaps I've just been in a rut but it feels this way. 

Then I'll start indulging in fantasy stuff: ""talk to me as if I am X, Y, Z, whatever."" 

And it gives me this odd feeling, like it feels good, but, skin-crawling.

I also struggle with grief, so sometimes I'll send out: ""Talk to me as if you are my old dog, or cat, or grandpa"" and it's cliche text but it tears me to pieces.

severe depersonalization,"for the past few weeks, i’ve been unable to feel like myself, or rationalize my own thoughts. ive dealt with dissociation and depersonalization/derealization before, but this time i just feel completely out of it. It feels like nothing I experience feels familiar, and my memories feel disconnected as it they’re not there. I feel dumb all the time because I just can’t think clearly at all and have to re read things multiple times. when I talk too, i cant think of certain words and will just go numb.

i’ve been unemployed for a few months and my depression and anxiety got the best of me, which just made me a lazy and unproductive mess. it feels like I even got too lazy to think, making me too used to being lazy, and then dissociate completely just not wanting to think to numb out anxiety and depression. i just want to think like myself again. i feel gone, and the values ive had to get myself out of these spirals just aren’t there anymore",1
Existing scares me,"Sometimes the mere thought of existing scares me. Or maybe life scares me. The uncertainty of life, the overwhelming possibilities, the fact that we could die at any given moment. Right now I don't know what to do with my life and I'm scared to figure it out (not that I know why). And I feel pressured to know what I'm doing but I don't. I get that most adults feel like this (I'm 21) but I feel like whatever I'm doing now just isn't good enough. But sometimes when I'm like ""I need to do something like move to a new state or just get out of my hometown"" I don't know where to start or if I can even make that happen. I've also been in and out of college but i dropped out because it was expensive and because I also have a full time job. So now i don't know how to get started with figuring out what I want to do or even how to get to where I want to be.

A lot of times it feels like my dreams I once had just get crushed under the weight of everything. Ive wanted to be so many things and one by one they all get crushed. I feel like I'm not good at a lot of things and that's part of the reason why I've had so many failures. I also get anxious about how life keeps marching on and I don't think I'm ready for many of the parts of life like losing my parents. I know no one is ""ready"" for that kind of thing but I've never been exposed to death (grandparents died before I was born, no close family) so I don't know what I'll do. 

I also get so scared because I'm in a relationship but I don't love him and he's not great and clearly doesn't love me but he's insisting on me living with him and marrying him but I don't want to. I don't know how to break up with him and I don't really want to lose him but I don't want to be with him either. And it scares me that I can end up having to spend the rest of my life with him. Or that things can go as far as marriage when I don't want that. He always tries to make his dreams into mine, and he never cares about what I want to do. I know he just wants a girlfriend, it doesn't matter who. He just wants someone pretty, he doesn't see me as a multifaceted human being. Whenever I try to tell him what I want he says stuff like ""I think I know what you want"". When he says stuff like that, I realize he knows nothing about me and he doesn't care to. I've never broken up with someone so I'm scared to do it. I also only have one friend and I'm really bad at making friends.",1
I am so tired…,"Hello, I wanted to see if I can get some support on here. Let me summarize quickly. 11 days ago I saw that i had fiberglass on all my stuff that was underneath my bed. I was very scared and anxious to discover this because everything I’ve read/seen about it. That whole week I spent my time cleaning everything with tack cloth and a Hepa filter vacuum. I even bought an air purifier with a hepa filter. It was exhausting and sad to throw my things. My sister did help me with the clean up which I appreciate it. Now I thought I got everything but today I saw that my closet had fiberglass on my clothes in there. Now I am devastated. Now I have to clean everything and I’m worried that it will get on all the stuff I just cleaned. And that I won’t get everything and it will affect my families health. I have been so anxious. I want to cry.",1
Health Anxiety and exercise….,"I am really trying to get back in the gym, walk more etc but exercise just triggers this panic response within me! I have had to lock my Apple Watch away as I was getting addicted to it! I played cricket last summer, wasn’t particularly fit and my HR went to 188 on my watch whilst I was bowling (very hot day, anxious & sprinting to bowl) - it caused a huge panic attack and ever since I’ve been top scared to push myself incase my HR goes that high again or I have a cardiac arrest… 

I took the plunge this evening and did 5 minutes on the bike then some weights…. All I think about though is I’m going to die, my chest is hurting, am I getting dizzy etc etc… 

How can you tell the difference as to whether you have a heart problem causing the symptoms or it’s the exercise triggering the anxiety? 

If anyone has any tips over exercising with anxiety I’d really appreciate it!",1
Scared of death,I'm young and scared of death. It terrifies me and how it is inevitable is horrible and I'm especially scared of the idea of nothingness. I am learning about Islam in school  and I accidentally said  I dislike allah - what should I do? I'm not religious but now what? I've seen things say to repent but how do I do that and do I need to be Muslim? I really don't want to go to hell for it but is that shirk?,1
Hyperventilation Habbit,"Hello! I am looking for some support and advice on hyperventilation.

Over the years I began to develop this hyperventilation habit, where I'd take unnecessarily deep breaths out of anxiety and slowly and slowly it became my most prominent anxiety symptom, and especially more this past year when my anxiety turned into nonstop panic.

A week ago, I was prescribed Sertraline (50 mg) to take daily, and quite honestly it has already made strides to my anxiety, and has helped a bit with the hyperventilating.

But my problem now is I have noticed it must be a habit of my own breathing now rather than just out of anxiety, likely for the years and more recently the intense months I struggled with anxiety without help.

What I would like to learn, or get help with, is how can I rid myself of this habit. To explain a bit deeper, when I hyperventilate, it's not what people think like a sudden rapid fire of breaths, rather mine is every 30 seconds to (I've been getting better at not doing it so often) a few minutes, I take this intense gasp of air through my mouth in order to get a satisfying feeling in my chest, almost like I am addicted to some type of substance and I need my fix every 30 seconds to a few minutes. Some people say I sound like I am sighing because the gasp is very much like a sigh, it's like an almost relieving breath of air that does more satisfaction than simply breathing through my nose or even my mouth (as I am a bit of a mouth breather due to my weight - don't make fun of me haha).

The problem is, I never hated these deep breaths, they've always given me a satisfactory feeling in my chest. However this past year, my anxiety skyrocketed, and these breaths were not always satisfactory, it was no longer a failsafe for my anxiety, but a symptom of it, and the satisfaction in my chest with these really deep gasps of air has gotten fewer and far between that they leave me feeling breathless often, and bring on the more traditional hyperventilation you see in media like the rapid fire breaths, I'll essentially inhale air until I get that satisfaction in my chest.

The issue is it's just become such a horrid habit that has exacerbated my anxiety even deeper and caused me to hit this bottom point where I decided to finally try medicating the anxiety, but this habit still persists, and I've out of fear started to believe it will end up worsening.

I am very familiar with habits, I chew on my shirts a lot during anxiety and stuff like that, but this breathing is just something else, I fell into it for far too long and it has now become a second nature thing, where I get this knot in my chest if I don't gasp for air. I plan to work on this with my therapist and healthcare team, but wanted to get a head start on providing if any relief sooner than through therapy.

Thank you for any input :)",1
Fear of brain tumor [TW- health related subjects],"I don't know if this is the right flair so i apologize if it isn't.

recently i have noticed i'll get like 2-3 headaches a month. this is really scary for me and i am starting to think i have a brain tumor.
this thought of me having a brain tumor is causing me extreme stress, panic attacks, and overall a increase of unease.
(panic attacks are nothing new to me, i am diagnosed with a panic disorder so this isn't a symptom)


i am 14 years old, i have zero family history of brain tumors or any neurological disorders, and the only symptom i have of brain tumors is my headaches.

i hope this post doesn't sound silly, i am genuinely struggling and i just need help and support. my parents are sick of hearing me worry about this. 

if anyone has advice, recovery stories, or anything please share them with me. i just want relief.",1
"I’m scared to get thrown back into the cycle of getting worse, any advice?","I noticed that I think my anxiety is getting worse lately, I’m not sure why. It goes up and down through the day but it’s been worse on average, affecting everyday life, and it might be that I’m not getting enough sleep. Mainly I’m really scared people are looking at me and thinking badly about me, that cashiers/waiters are judging food that I ordered if it’s “kid food” or something and things like that. At home, I also sometimes feel that someone is inside my house who shouldn’t be (nobody specific, but it’s humanoid and doesn’t have a face), I don’t see hallucinations but I get the feeling that they’re there and watching me and I sometimes get images in my head that they’re in my room watching me lay in bed. I know that’s kind of weird. Any advice? And also should I tell my therapist? I think I’m seeing her next week and she already knows I get thoughts at night that someone is going to try to find where I live and hurt me but I think this is kind of different.",1
Cardiophobia is the reason why I am agoraphobic.,"
Any time I get into a panic attack, my heart will NOT slow down. I repeat will NOT slow down. This has turned into a huge problem. I am afraid of being anywhere far from help while my heart just keeps pounding 130-150BPM. I'm afraid that if I don't bring it down I will damage it or it will suddenly stop. Every time this happens, I go hours and hours. Most I've ever experienced was eight hours. I had to go to the ER to help bring it down. I was told it was sinus tachycardia which means it wasn't my heart causing the issue but anxiety. This has really damaged my mental health. I don't know how calm myself down and bring my heart down.",1
what is your favorite deodorant that works against anxiety sweats?,"gross question, i know, but lately i’m so anxious that i can smell myself and my deodorant isn’t working. I’m currently using this one. i’m not sure it works well in general honestly? but i’ve definitely been sweating because of anxiety lately and then i know for sure it doesn’t work bc i can smell myself. i’m so anxious i smell right out of the shower and that doesn’t usually happen, i don’t remember the last time it did and i didn’t change soap.

Dealing with anxiety when something is a real threat?,"(warning for very brief mention of US political events; transphobia)
A big part of my anxiety has always been that I convince myself that something is a massive issue when it really isn't, so coping with that has meant a lot of just taking the time to reassess the situation and realize that I'm not in danger.
So what am I supposed to do when something actually is a problem? 
I dealt with this issue when covid first started, and I'm dealing with it now as a trans teen in the US. I'm medicated now and it's definitely helped a little, but things are still bad. How do I keep my anxiety from becoming debilitating when I can't just reason my way out of it? How do I look a situation in the face and acknowledge that it is shit and then just keep going? If anyone has any advice please share because I've been struggling pretty bad lately. I seem to swing between overwhelming panic when I acknowledge the situation or feeling fine and just ignoring it completely. Neither are sustainable, is there anything I can do?",1
Need to vent to someone who isn’t an ai,"To put how i feel into simplest terms, i feel very trapped by my anxiety.

I always cry and wish I could go back to who I was before. Its like I died that day. I think about my old self alot, I was able to shower without anxiety, go out to a store, drive, hang out with people. Now im filled with anxiety, health anxiety, depression, anger, and just feel like I want nothing to do with life. Is this normal? How much I mourn my old self. Its like who am I going to become next?

"No provider will refill ativan in colorado, no other meds have worked","In colorado for reference. I really need help and I'm sorry for rambling I'm just really going through it right now.

I've tried every single non-benzo anxiety medication and none of them work. I'm also prescribed suboxone and no provider at all will seem to prescribe benzos even though I originally got my script from an inpatient psychiatric stay. I'm really close to going back to the mental hospital just to get my ativan refilled because I'm having panic attacks like crazy and it's making it impossible to do anything and I feel suicidal and hopeless. I have to get a job and take observed drug tests for probation and both give me really bad fear, the latter from childhood sexual trauma.

Because I have addiction on my record am I never going to have a chance of feeling better? I feel like I'm shunned from getting actual help from the mental health system now that I have a suboxone prescription on my record. I've tried every single anti anxiety medication except for benzos and lyrica; basically they don't want to try any controlled substances. 

Is there any way outside of a stay at the mental hospital to get my ativan refilled? I have tried literally every single non addictive anxiety med over the past 5 years and have gotten nowhere.",1
morning anxiety coping methods?,"I am a 20 year old female struggling with GAD. I experience nausea almost constantly and extreme nausea between the hours of 3am-8am.

I’ve been in therapy and just the other day finally caved and got prescribed a VERY strong antidepressant from a doctor who has given me no other options. if anyone has advice on how to cope with my type of anxiety if they may have experienced something similar, i have found that xanax really help as i only really have attacks in the morning so as needed seemed like the route for me but my doc is against it. if anyone has advice or tips please let me know!",1

I have chronophobia and probably nostalgiaphobia,"Hello

I have chronophobia.
I hate looking at something and then check the date and realise it happened 3 months ago!
I fear happy moments because right when they are happening I know they will become memories. And then I'll have nostalgia and feel bad.

My worst memories? The good ones. Because that moment is over and is never coming back.

Most of my memories are very vivid so I feel like everything happened 2 weeks ago at most.

I hate time passing. I don't have a fear of death, I couldn't care less about my own death because the outcome is either heaven or nothingness. Either way I'll be fine.

I fear for my loved ones: ageing, becoming more tired, more sick and eventually dying.

I fear others moving on with life because I feel left behind. I hate looking at the calendar and think ""last year, on that same day this happened with my friend and it wzs super fun... 1 year later, same day same hour she has left the city and we barely chat.""

"""Struggling with Social Situations: Dealing with Insistent Requests""","First and foremost, let me introduce myself. I am not your average person when it comes to social situations. I struggle with responding appropriately and reacting in a way that is considered normal. My circle of friends is limited to just two people from my high school days, and outside of them, I hardly speak to anyone.  
Today, a friend of my brother - who is not particularly close to me - asked me to draw a sketch for his girlfriend. Truth be told, I really didn't want to do it. However, he was persistent and even went as far as offering to take me out to a street vendor for a meal. I agreed to go along, but he continued to pressure me into drawing the sketch.  
Unfortunately, I've been in similar situations before where I said ""no"" but the other person became aggressive and started speaking to me rudely, even in a threatening manner. As a result, I ended up giving in and doing their work for them - something that used to happen a lot in high school when I was bullied.  
So, my question to you is: How should I respond if I find myself in a similar situation again? I want to be able to stand my ground without feeling intimidated or pressured into doing something I don't want to do.",1

I now understand what the purpose of life is, I am just an experiment. Everyone of you could be fake, just something put there to comment on my posts trying to convince me to take medications. Everyone around me is fake. That explains everything. I am all alone here. They control fucking everything, hearing me through my phone, seeing what I do through my phone. Nothing really matters anymore since I discovered this because I know they can change things to their likings and I dont have any free will.",1
