So around 1 this morning I was in my living room staying up late as I usually do but then I hear this almost rhythmic tapping against the wall as If it was a person. Now in the 2nd story bathroom you can hear tapping in the walls and ceiling but it's just birds. This was different I heard it and ran by the stairs then I heard a creak and I then was at the top of the staircase and eventually went down and fell asleep an hour later probably because it freaked me out so much I was tired. But I just dont know what to do at night I'm always worried about someone in my house and this has not been helping.,5,paranoia

"So sometimes I’m afraid of my shadow and convinced there are people in my house. I can’t ever find them but sometimes I 100% believe they’re there. This only happens (so far) when I take a little too much of my Abilify. It’s a long story but I take 1-2mg every other day because I have super sensitivities to meds. I told my psych about the people in my house and she said that’s just anxiety. Correct me if I’m wrong but people in my house that are real to me feels like borderline psychosis at least but paranoia at a minimum. I am afraid people will break in. I’m afraid people are in. Not all the time, but for example, right now my light is on because I’m afraid to go to bed and be in the dark—not because of people, but because I’m uneasy and afraid something will come. My heater came on and my first thought was someone is in the house and turned it on. No, I just thought I turned it off when I checked it this evening. If I hear a beep like my refrigerator door beeps when it’s open I immediately think something is very wrong and the world is ending. Beeps send my into apocalypse mode and it’s hard to feel normal after. I know my thoughts are irrational. My sane brain is still sitting in the back of the bus but I’m pretty confused about what to call this. I have been diagnosed as OCD, bipolar NOS, and Gen Anxiety Disorder.

Life is horrible, and I’m sick and tired of being ill, and poor, and lonely, and all the shit that has happened in my life, and keeps happening.

Not that I don’t want to “be happy”, but I genuinely do not believe that is possible, anymore. My life has gone too far wrong. I’ve made too many life-destroying mistakes. I genuinely don’t have anything left to give.

So yeah, I don’t want to “get better”, if all “better” means is being a lonely weirdo with no real friends, a decade behind most people my age, with fuck-all, just playing constant catch-up for the next decade, while my body deteriorates.

I would rather simply *not be here*. And that’s not new, or “impulsive”, or something I haven’t considered extensively.

"Rant because Jesus, I need someone to understand.

Mother’s Day was a nightmare for me. Usually, my family is very understanding of my needs as an autistic person, and will happily accommodate them. For example, going out to eat at restaurants and bars can sometimes be very challenging for me, so they’ll bring me home food or let me step outside if it becomes too noisy.

However, for Mother’s Day, everything was off the table. I left college that morning with my mom (she picked me up since I don’t have a car on campus) excited to spend the day with the family. My family agreed to go to a bar during the day that I know I usually have issues with, but they said w e wouldn’t do anything after, so I decided to go to make them happy. Sure enough, I had to step outside in the last thirty minutes because I couldn’t handle it. I’m visibly distressed and telling this to my family, who just tell me to “tough it up” because we’re now going to another restaurant that’s known for being crowded and loud for dinner. I ask to go home, offer to pay for my own Uber (we all drove together to the place), but I’m yelled at and told to toughen up again.

Sure enough, we get to the restaurant, and I’m immediately struggling. I was curled up in a ball with my hands over my ears trying to not have a meltdown because it was too loud, too hot, and I never had a chance to recover from the last place. My grandma snaps in my face to get my attention and tells me “to sit normally and just be quiet” to not ruin this day, especially after my mom drove all the way to my college just to get me. That sends me over the edge so I leave, sit outside, and just cry. My mom followed to yell at me, and that was it. I spent ninety minutes sitting outside sobbing because I was having a meltdown and nobody cared since “it ruined Mother’s Day.” My family didn’t even check to see if I wanted food or tried to help me calm down. They didn’t do anything they usually do when I have sensory issues. They’ve never even seen me get to this point because they help me out of it most days, so this was a low point for me.

I just got home and went to bed without eating. Now, it’s the next day, and I don’t even know what to expect. I’m considering buying a train ticket back to my dorm a few days early (I’m not fully moved out yet since my job requires I help with closing) to get out, since I don’t want to spend the next few days living on thin ice. I thought it would be common sense that I can’t just stop being autistic and turn off my sensory issues on holidays, but I guess it isn’t. I literally did everything I could, I tried to communicate multiple times that I wasn’t able to do this, and now my family is mad at me for having a meltdown that could’ve been easily avoided if they listened.

Sometimes, I will doubt my ability to think about things. For example, I might try to analyse what is wrong with me and then I doubt my analysis. I doubt everything I am thinking. I doubt my ability to think. I think I may be biased. At that time I feel very disconnected from myself like I have lost control of myself. WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THIS? 

Once, back when I was a kid I had this episode the day before one of my exams. My mind was saying some stuff i.e. I was thinking about things. I was panickimg and telling my mom "" Mom my mind is saying things and not letting me study. I cannot concentrate. It will not let me study"" I was crying vehemently. I was inconsolable and I thought I'd fail. But I passed with flying colours. I WAS NOT HALLUCINATING. I WAS NOT HEARING VOICES IN MY HEAD. This episode shook me to my very core and had instilled in me a fear of exams. For the next few exams I told myself ""this is your own mind speaking to you. You can ask it to quieten down. It will listen because this is your own mind"" 
For more clarity, I would like to tell you I never prepare for my exams beforehand so it could have been stress. But this was just a one time thing. To this day I do not know what had happened to me that night. WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

Background information about me: I suffer from OCD. I have never suffered from a head injury. I am a procrastinator. I am high achieving and have always gotten good grades without even properly studying ( because of the procrastination ) I had an emotionally unavailable father growing up. I donot hallucinate. I do not hear voices in my head. I am a maladaptive daydreamer.

The same goes for the car gear, i always forget to hit the pedals before moving them so most of the times I almost break the damn car.

After work I go home to my solitary room and either try to clean, or workout. Sometimes I'm so brain dead I do nothing but lay in bed.

"Hello all, thank you for happening upon my post this evening,

I just wanted to write a quick message, not feeling particularly great but need to finish some tasks today so can't spend too long with an elaborate post

I do experience irrational paranoia inside the house when i am severely in a confused state (which is intertwined with my condition), as when you get confused as i do (and maybe you do) its easy to work yourself up and essentially become frightened of anything as nothing quite makes sense

However whenever i am out, especially when alone and away from concentrated civilisation, i have shear fear that puts me in an unnecessary hyperaware state. I feel this fear because of my state of vulnerability with my conditions, which are quite debilitating.

Recently, i was in a place where there were civilisation around but not inside. I happened upon a man, not sure if he knew i was there but he was overweight, and had full-cuffed earphones on, he may even have been singing. If i had hostile intentions, lets just say nobody else was around. It stuck with me because i have no idea how one achieves that level of ignorance

My rational brain assumes its because as most of his experience outside has been positive, or perhaps he hasn't had anything happen once, what reason does he have? Ignorance is bliss. Neglect to mention though, as long as the mind was iron-willed, he could easily defend himself if aggressively approached in some way, or atleast not be defenseless

But i don't have that ability to be ignorant, and personally i think it'd be fine if i could rationally ensure there is no threat, and just be aware of my surroundings, but this fear is irrational. I can visually discern a threat but i don't feel at ease after verifying there is no threat. My medical conditions (Which are not all confirmed and some are still being investigated) puts me in a severely vulnerable state. I'm talking sensitivity to heat (basically heat= painful itching (sometimes) & worsening symptoms, e.g cognitive problems worsened), trouble balancing, slow processing and thinking, forgetfulness (So i'll have to often rescan my environment anyway as i forget it so often) fatigue and tiredness on the daily, etc. So this isn't a normal situation to begin with

This fear has probably come up because i know there are bad people in the world, but also i have pretty uncommon problems, even with speaking, listening and remembering, so i guess i also discern someone speaking to me as a threat because how i'm belittled and how i feel speaking to people that don't understand my health problems, which has been most.

I'm doing my best to shake this feeling, i'm trying to go out everyday and hope repeated exposure will do something, i have hopes it'll improve but was wondering what advice this community may have? I think i can understand the reasoning behind much of my behaviour, but unfortunately it is my health conditions cure-dependent, and there's not much i can do about that right now, so my ears are wide open for alternative ideas

This probably isn't a typical case around here, i appreciate that. But any advice you could think of to help out would be much appreciated, thank you!",5,paranoia

"I’ll try to keep this short and to the point.
About ~9 months ago I started taking flecainide and metoprolol for an irregular heartbeat. At a similar time or a bit earlier  I started having depressive episodes. Episodes where I would feel passively suicidal, hopeless, irritable, and at times full of rage. During these phases I fantasise about running away, abandoning my husband and kids (for at least a while).

Every time I tell myself it’s just PMS and to wait until my period is over before I do something hasty. And once I’ve had my period I come good again. Recently it’s gotten more severe though, during these episodes there is a lot of uncontrollable crying and feeling hopeless. I came very close to telling my husband it’s over on the weekend, and I embarrassed myself in front of his family with my hostile and miserable mood.

I’m thinking about seeing my doctor and requesting SSRI’s to control PMDD. But I haven’t had sex with my husband in two months - will SSRI’s make my libido even worse? I’m in a miserable and depressive dry spell.

My husband is very supportive but it’s starting to take it’s toll. I can sense the kids are picking up on the bad vibes too. 

Does this sound like PMDD? If you’ve dealt with something similar, did SSRI’s help you? Was anybody able to see a libido increase getting it under control?",2,depression

I know people are gonna say “oh I know guys who are bald and do well with girls” or something like that but those guys are clearly the exception, not the rule. Not everyone looks good bald.

Finasteride is really good at preventing hair loss but it definitely causes major sides, especially sexual sides.

"I had an upsetting conversation with a friend today. They were upset about a status I posted online, because it referenced me worrying they were manipulative. This is a status I blocked them from seeing purposefully and did not name drop them. It was purely to reach out and get support. They didn't even know the full status I made, that I ended by saying I wasn't sure if it was true or a trauma response. I just wanted advice on how to cope. But someone, and I don't know who but I have two people that I believe it probably could be based on past conversations, decided to inform this friend about the status. And apparently they were not informed of the full status. They decided to talk to me about whether or not I actually thought they were manipulative. I don't think it's fair that I had to have a conversation about thoughts I never intended on sharing with them. My anxiety is very high right now and I started to dissociate, possibly to stave off this becoming paranoia about their intentions and the other people involved in this. Ironically I feel manipulated. But as I usually do in these situations, I am telling myself not to believe any of my thoughts as true since I recognise that it's extreme to believe everyone is against you. Because I'm fighting off believing that I'm unsafe right now around people who completely disconnected from the conflict.

I guess the point of this post is I don't feel like there's anyone in my life I can talk to this about right now. Because the people I'm closest too are potentially involved or one degree of seperation away, and my other outlet was to make a status with a filtered audience and now I feel like I can't do that without it coming back to this person.

I’m really weary when driving, always looking in peoples car as inconspicuous as possible just to see their hands. I feel like I have fucking ptsd but I’m basically from the suburbs wtf.

"I'm a 45 year old man. I was diagnosed with ADHD during a meeting with a psychologist... 6 years ago.  I knew about ADHD, like everyone else. But it never occurred to me that I ""had it.""  To be honest, like most everyone else, I wasn't even sure it was a ""real thing.""  I certainly did not think it was something that applied to any adult. So... anyway... I am in a real ""bottom of a well"" situation right now... and I just thought I might reach out for some help after watching a YouTube video where someone mentioned this subreddit. If you read this post, and think... ""Well... okay... but what specifically are you asking?"" I must pre-apologize... because I am not 100% sure. My life situation has gone from doing-okay... to NOT doing-okay... in record time. And right now, I have more problems than I could ever squeeze into a Reddit post. So... I'm kind of just... reaching out... hoping someone can give me... some kind of perspective or advice.

My job:  The job that I had up until I was laid of in March, was... the text book definition of... the WORST job for someone with ADHD. My job was one of those jobs where, my manager would assign me some mega-task... where it was not clear to anyone whether the task might take someone 2-3 weeks, 2-3 months... or even > a year. The team was made up of absolute golden-soul kind-hearted people... so... it seemed to me like a *perfect* job. They would basically ask me how long I think something would take. I would give an honest answer. But... I always over-estimated how long it really takes to do something. Like... I would say... ""I can have that done by Friday."" only to discover... I should have said ""three weeks."" But it was okay... because they would always say... ""No problem... just have it done by the end of the quarter."" i.e. deadlines of three months were extremely common. So... of course... I would intend to get right on that. But then... two-and-a-half months later... I was always scrambling to get something done. And always disappointing everyone.  I am a very charming guy... so i was always able to get help from all my resources... and I would get it done. But. for 5 years, this job was one big feeling of... Oh my God, I am a terrible person!!! dot com!!! dot  gov!!! dot ORG!!!

Then... when COVID began, I had to do my job from home. I'm divorced, and live alone. So... I became the shut-in-extrovert. And.. after two years of the most complete loneliness I've ever felt... plus... having a job that I was clearly destined to fail at...  my outlook on everything was (is)... bad. Very bad. And... I could not seem to explain it to anyone. My mom... sister... friends... Try explaining how your job is basically a cake walk in the park... and it's making you miserable!!! No one understands. They think it sounds perfect! Flexible deadlines.. Given months to complete easy stuff... blah blah blah. It all sounds like job-porn to most people. Anyway... my self-worth was at -11... and then... one morning... I get an email that my position was being eliminated. Laid off. 

At the time... I was not even upset! I honestly felt a deep feeling of relief.  I felt like I could finally get back out there and find something that I could be proud to do. Well... now... it's been 2 1/2 months. I have done some very minor online job searching. I've completed my resume and sent it to some companies... but I have not actually gotten down to business and started a solid job search. My insurance lapsed, and as I type this... I have no health insurance. I don't even know what COBRA is... and I feel absolutely paralyzed. paralyzed with fear that I might have an accident and have no insurance. Paralyzed that I am 45 years old and have NO IDEA. what job to search for. I don't know what I want to be when I ""grow up."" I was taking adderal, but that ran out 2 months ago. I was also taking Lexapro for anxiety... that also ran out.

So... yeah... I was already depressed, lonely, and feeling worthless. I lost my job... and within a couple of weeks, I've gone from feeling worthless to not even knowing it was possible to feel this bad. Stopping those medications cold-turkey like that was... terrible. I am not a ""sad person."" Meaning... I do not cry often... I do not think bad thoughts... In general, I'm a pretty ""peppy guy"" usually. But... since I lost this job... I've been crying, every, day! Like... sobbing in the shower!!! I haven't slept an actual night's sleep in... months. I wake up at 6:00 pm... feel like I'm in some kind of bad dream where I am awake all night... and then pass out from exhaustion at 7:00 - 8:00 am... trying to NOT do that... so i can reset myself and try to stay awake so I can ""get normal"" again. 

I've started walking every day. I try to really push myself to do exercise hoping that it will reset my clock.. and I can get some good Vitamin D from the sun and some endorphins.  And I do feel a good sense of accomplishment, but it is not helping with the sleep. I don't drink alcohol (thank god!) I did in the past... but... I got away from that years ago. And, I've been trying to do as many ""Reaching out"" activities as possible. i.e. using Meetup dot com to find some hobby groups... tried online dating... trying to just meet some new people. I think the dating part is a little stupid right now...but to be honest... it's been great! I have been starving for just conversation... so... I enjoy it, even if I am not exactly ""boyfriend material"" right now. 

Anyway... I will end this post now... but really... my main ask... of you guys... is... How on Earth can I find a job that fits my ADHD brain? I did some Google searching for ""Best jobs for people with ADHD,"" and they were all jobs that I cannot just... get. Like... Teacher. Journalist. Food Service.  I'm 45... single income... have a $1,500/month mortgage. I can't just... be a teacher. or ... become a journalist. And Food Service... I wouldn't have the slightest idea about that. 

Does anyone here have a resource for, ""ADHD Tech jobs."" I honestly feel like my ""calling"" is to be something where I am helping people. But... like... within a tech sector, environment. Like... a manager... or a consultant. But I don't have any mgmt experience and... I just don't know where to turn for some help with getting my head straight.",3,adhd

	After being in college for two years I have been asked out three times. In the past since I was asked out over text I would sort of avoid the question and change the topic, but most recently I was asked out by someone I see very frequently as we are both in a relatively small major and typically have lots of classes together.

	Him and I have literally never held a conversation and I really don’t know what to do. He’s sweet but not really my type, but more importantly I have absolutely no interest in dating, and hanging out with people one-on-one is a literal nightmare for me. I don’t think I have ever hung out alone with a guy in my entire life. I don’t talk to people often in class and I never hang out with people outside. I’m basically a shut in…

	He has texted me every day for the past week and I had been able to put off agreeing to hang out with him because of legitimate reasons, but now it’s just getting too much, and I’m running out of excuses. In the past when I guess I essentially ghosted people, I always felt like shit because I know if I were In their position I would be really upset. 

	I know the easiest thing would be to just say I’m not interested but the fear of awkwardness of seeing him every day for the rest of my time in college is overwhelming. When I asked my friends (who don’t know about my anxiety issues) for advice they said I should just hang out with him once so he’ll stop asking. But I just know I’ll be awkward and probably end up having a panic attack when I come home. Plus what if he ends up asking again? My friends think it’s stupid that this is even a concern of mine and I can’t really turn to them anymore for help because I’m worried they think I’m trying to boast or something 

	Sorry this post is a bit of a mess but every time I think about the situation ship I feel like I’m five seconds from a panic attack. And sorry if this seems like a stupid worry, I guess that’s sort of the point though",4,anxiety

"Since I started medication I have discovered that one of my most annoying qualities is that my brain says nope to everything. Just ""nope"" and there's no reason for it. It's practically impossible to get around the nope and it always requires a lot of exhausting mental gymnastics. Even if I want to do whatever it is or if I really need to do it, there's that wall of nope that makes it impossible to jump into action. The medication fixes the nope. It is _incredibly_ hard not to think that ""the nope"" is laziness. Even though I've literally read about studies where dopamine deprived rats became completely passive - and it sounds a lot like a ""nope"" issue, I still feel like a fraud somehow.

My tutors are expecting me to speak in class and they speak sarcastically when I don't, i am having very bad anxiety and I can't even look at tutors and classmates properly. Every class is like torture to me. I fear my classmates may report my avoidance of eye contact as bullying them.

"I had an anxiety attack about whether I have derealization or not a few weeks ago maybe 5 weeks ago. And it was basically me over thinking and worrying that i can’t tell the difference and I have psychosis/Schrizophenia. After that I was anxious for a couple of days/on fight or flight. After that I frequently started having intrusive thoughts about stupid things like forgetting my memory or existential thoughts. Also fears on having mental illnesses this went on 24/7. Sometimes I could eat sometimes I can’t. But the negative thoughts replayed in my head all day. But life felt weird after the anxiety attack like I was in a different dimension and the vibes of the days changed. I’m also getting random memory pop-ups, and random vibes or sensations. (I have a post about the sensations) like my environment feels weird or has an unfamiliar sensation. And it feels like it isn’t my life. I don’t know if it’s depersonalization or derealization because sometimes I get it and it feels worst. I feel like something bad is going to happen or  I’m going to die. And sometimes I can’t remember things or write things well or write sentences well. The worry and weird feeling has been going on for 5 weeks. Honestly sometimes it goes away or gets better but comes back worst. I’ve already talked to a therapist and she says it’s just anxiety, but it hasn’t gotten better. I honestly feel like giving up at this point because life feels so weird like I’m floating or stuck in a box. It doesn’t even feel like life.

"After months of job searching I finally have a job, and a decent paying one for an entry-level position in my field. Only thing is now at work I am plagued with intense paranoia and anxiety about how my coworkers perceive me. It gets to where I have a really hard time concentrating on what I'm doing and then I screw up, which then adds more fuel to the fire because ""oh, now they saw me mess up and are probably gonna talk about how stupid and incompetent I am"".

At my previous job the people were great, I felt very safe, comfortable, and just appreciated there. It was such a nurturing environment to be in and I really took that for granted.

The last person in my position was very well loved by everyone there and I feel like since I am not her and I am very shy that at least some of the people there already dislike me. Like yesterday I said good morning to the receptionist and she looked me dead in the eyes, saying nothing back. It was quiet and I spoke clearly. I know she heard me. I just hate it, because I always have felt negatively toward/about myself and to have that mirrored by others just multiplies that self-hate, self-criticism tenfold. Back when I saw a therapist, he commented that I have rejection sensitive dysphoria which means that anything I even perceive as rejection I can't help but fixate on.

This is a solid position for me to start out at and gain experience with so I don't want to leave, but I just wish I could let go and stop caring. But I can't. I have never, ever been able to just not care what other people think about me.",5,paranoia

"Throw away account because I'm ashamed. I know the rules say to search for similar posts, but I wanted to not only have responses that were specific to my situation, but also to vent a little. I don't have anyone I can talk to about this and I feel like it's ruining my life. 

I have paranoia. I don't know what mental disorder it stems from. All I do know, is that it's very much taking control of my life. I'm paranoid about losing my job even when I don't think I've done something terribly wrong. I'm paranoid about the health and safety of my mother. Especially, for the past few years, I've been extremely paranoid that she will fall in the shower. I check my phone often to see when she was last online, just to make sure she's okay. If I haven't' heard from her in a few days, I get a sick feeling and have to call or text right away, and I get very upset when she doesn't answer or reply right away too. Worst of all, the worst paranoia I have ever felt, is about my boyfriend cheating on me. It comes on fast and strong. It's always the strangest things that cause it too and the smallest of acts set it off. It's been causing a lot of problems lately because I've just been coming right out and sharing these thoughts. He tells me I'm accusing. I don't mean to come off that way. I just want to ask right out if the thoughts I'm having are true or not. It's been all day, every day for 2 weeks now really bad. It's been years with me being paranoid, and normally I am able to push the thoughts to the side and ignore them. But sometimes, they are so strong and so believable I can't help but to give into them. My brain puts all these pieces together, and no matter how ridiculous they may seem to everyone else, they make sense to me. They could never not make sense. Typically, it lasts for a few days, and then I just wake up and I'm not that worried about it anymore. But lately, it's not gone away and every time a new paranoid thought comes up, it just adds more fuel to it and it's scaring me. I don't want to lose this man but I'm doing nothing good for him or us by coming off as accusatory and I don't want to hurt his feelings. I know, when I'm not feeling paranoid, that he would never be unfaithful or do anything to hurt me, but the paranoia is so strong. I know I have issues with trusting people and I often worry that I don't trust him and maybe that's the problem? 

Any advice from similar situations would be greatly appreciated. Also, if you take any medications that have or still do help, let me know. I should also mention, I have very severe anxiety about every aspect of my life and I'm thinking that maybe causes the paranoia? I really don't know. But what can I do when I'm feeling so enraged and fueled by paranoid thoughts? And what if they don't go away? I know I've read it's possible to have a good relationship with someone that has paranoia, but I'm really feeling like this is all my life will ever be and I should just stay single as not to hurt the people I get close with.",5,paranoia

So a few nights ago I had a bit of a headache but thought nothing of it, I get headaches pretty often. All of a sudden thought I had this crushing sensation in my head like it was being squeezed, and then when I went to move my head it felt difficult and I had intense pain shoot behind my eyes unlike any headache pain I’ve had before. It freaked me out and I ended up phoning NHS24 (UK’s 24 hour health hotline) to describe it to them and ask if they thought I should go to the hospital. They told me if the pain subsided after those few seconds and pain relief helped I should be fine, which put my mind at ease a bit. 

The next day I didn’t even think about it whatsoever really, but yesterday I was back to work and halfway through my shift I started getting pain in my chest, struggling to catch my breath, tingling in my limbs and around my lips, feeling faint, nauseous and extremely agitated. My mind instantly jumped to that headache a couple of nights before and I started convincing myself I was gonna die and that I’d had a bad brain bleed and that the symptoms had been delayed. I felt so on edge and looking back irrationally anxious. It was mild as far as I’ve seen panic attacks go, and I might be an anxious person, but I’ve never had a real panic attack hit like that.

I told my parents and they sounded concerned but told me there was nothing physically wrong with me. I phoned the doctor’s today and when I described just the symptoms, without mentioning that I thought it was a panic attack, the receptionist’s immediate response was ‘you need to go to the hospital’. I explained that I thought yesterday was a panic attack rather than physical (although I have no way of knowing this for sure and don’t trust my panicked opinion at the time and so would have loved a doctor’s opinion), and she is instantly changed her tune and told me I’d have to wait a couple of days for an appointment, because if it is anxiety it isn’t urgent enough.

I feel like I’m going insane. Last night I almost had another panic attack cause I’m so hyper aware of my body now and it feels so weird. I know I might be irrational but I’m not worried for nothing here am I? Sure, panic attacks make you have crazy thought loops, but the crazy headache and crushing, followed by chest pain, limb numbness, trouble breathing, etc. a couple of days later with no previous experience of panic attacks is objectively concerning. Like yes, I might not be thinking straight and it’s hard for me to have an unbiased opinion, and it’s probably about a 99% chance that I just had a panic attack, but i don’t like how my symptoms are clearly concerning and seem to just be putting down to a panic attack with little follow up just because I mentioned the anxiety possibility. I already felt like I was going crazy from my panic attack and it doesn’t help that everyone’s acting like I’m unhinged for wanting to take precautions with my health when weird out of character shit starts happening to me.",4,anxiety

"For the last 6 hours I have done nothing but focus on the article and short documentary released about private ADHD practices (I’m not here to discuss that as it’s done on many other threads I just hyperfixated on it because it’s something I find really intrestering). It’s been fascinating but awful timing. I have a major exam Wednesday and have been desperately trying to improve my grade and it was going well but now today I have done nothing and the chances of getting it up this close with a day wasted are very low. The only reason I have stoped looking into it now is because I have to go to work.

I also have a music lesson tomorrow which I have not practiced for because I have spent all day fixating on this article and now because I’m working late tonight I won’t be able to practice and I’ve got my music exam next month too. 

My dinner considered of a mug shot because it meant I didn’t have to stop. I even bloody sat at my desk for like 3 hours just hoping I would be able to work.

I need to be up early tomorrow to mentor but again I’ve done apslutly no preparation and I know as soon as I get home I’ll be back to this fixation. 

I don’t really know the point of writing this maybe someone will be able to relate but it’s basically just a rant screaming into the void. It frustrates me so much when others see hyper fixations as purely a good thing cause every time I hyperfixate on something i hate it so much. I wish that my fucking brain could regulate attention like a normally person!!

If you got this far through I hope you are currently hyperfixation free (/hj) and enjoy your day!",3,adhd

"Hello, I wanted to see if I can get some support on here. Let me summarize quickly. 11 days ago I saw that i had fiberglass on all my stuff that was underneath my bed. I was very scared and anxious to discover this because everything I’ve read/seen about it. That whole week I spent my time cleaning everything with tack cloth and a Hepa filter vacuum. I even bought an air purifier with a hepa filter. It was exhausting and sad to throw my things. My sister did help me with the clean up which I appreciate it. Now I thought I got everything but today I saw that my closet had fiberglass on my clothes in there. Now I am devastated.

Me:I learned against my own will how to hide my entire being at a young age as a result of chronic, repetitive child abuse, emotional neglect, bullying, ostracism, and social isolation simply because l'm autistic that lasted for over a decade, causing me to involuntarily mask on a daily basis and become a bitter, confused dissociating mess of a human shell who for a long time believed that there was something horribly wrong with me as an existing human being and couldnt comprehend that I was just different and that there was actually nothing wrong with me and I never came to terms with it until early adulthood and that is why, my friend, I don't look autistic to you

Everyone, and I mean *everyone*, grew up and was harmed by the result of living in a society built for neurotypicals.

"I finished moving out of my room in my apartment today. I was having so much paranoia and mistrust of my roommates. I got my exit and I left. The biggest thing being thinking there's a camera in my room. I kept dismissing the thought. But it was so persistent. It just kept coming back. It was better for my mental health to leave, and live with people I knew I could trust, regardless of fault in this relationship. But I kept going back and forth. Thinking there really was a camera and the roommates really were saying the things I thought they were. And then telling myself that that's a delusion and I need to let it go for my own health. I've been out of the apartment since September but just finished grabbing the very last of my things today. I'm stressed. Sure, I bought a house and there's a lot of things on my mind including other things at work and family things. But as pressed as I've been I've been staying positive or atleast neutral. Today was a stressful day. A lot of things to do and my new roommate was mia for health reasons. Plus I had done a carpet patch and I was worried the roommates would complain about the quality since the color was not an exact match. So maybe it was that. All the stress and worry and anxiety. About finally saying goodbye to them. But then, as I went to finally leave. For the last time. I came up to my roomate sitting on the couch to say goodbye. And I swear. On her phone. She was watching my face. I didn't get a great look and I have trouble recognizing myself in videos and photos. But as I walked out the door. I swear I heard her start to say to her boyfriend ""she saw.."" This is why I have to leave. Real or not it's causing me severe mental distress. But the idea that there really has been a camera in my room this whole time. The idea that all this psychosis I've been worried about struggling with for my whole life. Is actually just gaslighting. I can't go back and forth on it I know. It either did or didnt happen but it's in the past now and I guess I'll know going forward. But rn I am not doing well.",5,paranoia

"6 years ago I had an interaction with a sex worker.  It was short lived and I wore protection the two times I saw her and have been rigorously tested for STD's.  After both encounters the lady took the condom into the bathroom and flushed it, or so I think.  I believe her age would be somewhere between 40-50, and she was living with another worker in a very rundown motel.  At the time, I was a virgin and 20 years old and felt the need to lose my card in a non-judgmental way but have since determined this instance to be the worst mistake of my life.   Now to the paranoia:

What are the chances that she took the condom, didn't flush it (I didn't visually witness this) and used it to impregnate herself?  Would someone do that, maybe in a child-support ploy?  Would it work?  I blocked the number directly afterwards.  But her profile was deleted two months later, around the time someone would discover pregnancy?  

I worry that one day my future children will get some kind of 23 and me testing and find a sibling, and I am having a hard time reconciling whether this is some kind of paranoid, anxiety-based thought or something with merit?

Just wanted to ask is there any hope for someone like me or am I just fated to live a life of nothingness and fade from existence without ever knowing what it’s like to be loved by someone other than family? And I know it might come off as whiny because I have a family that values me but I feel if we didn’t have a blood connection I would truly be alone in this world and I probably wouldn’t stick around long enough to ask this question.,2,depression

Duration: 2 months

Hello everyone! For the past 2 months, I started having eyelid twitching particularly on the bottom of my right eyelid. I have observed that sneezing, touching the area, and blinking hard would trigger the spasms. No drooping of the eyelid. No other vision changes. It’s only the eyelid spasm that I am really concerned about. I have read online (which was probably not a good idea) that the causes might be from absolutely nothing to a dreadful brain tumor. I do not know how to function normal anymore. It’s really taking a toll on me.

"I don’t know how to keep on

Hey Guys,
First off all: Sorry for the length and my english grammar (should have went to school more often back then lol).
I’m suffering from a very specific issue for almost 2 years now and it slowly took possession of me. To give u a little background information i was (at least the way I see things) a very bad person in my teenage years. I did awkward things to gain attention from people and to get “cool”. I bullied people, i went out drinking in parks with bad people, i did drugs etc. and just acted so goofy. In this timeline some people from around my town started laughing at me, took pictures from me in the bus without no clear reason and I experienced a lot of very specific issues which, since they happened i’m constantly feared of. After I finished this first phase of anxiety things went quite well till I got encountered again. People I didn’t knew were yelling my name. So I was starting to ask myself again why those people would shout my name, what they may know about all those awkward things I did etc. At this point, I was hyper aware of every person walking by and as soon as I thought people were watching me I felt anxious and started to panic. I even feel people are standing in front of my house in order to wait for me in order to just make my life terrible. I’m not quite sure if this really happens but I’m constantly looking for signs which may were left for me in order to make me feel bad. From this point, I just feel followed everywhere I go, I’m feared that people know me and i didn’t went out with my friends for 1 year. I’m pretty much stuck in my room isolating myself. I went to a therapist who diagnosed me with depression. I tried to take the advice from my therapy but I’m just too feared to do anything. I’m even scared to sit in my own backyard because people could notice where I live and follow me. I just hate myself for what I have done and I can’t get over my old me. Slowly, suicidal thoughts added up. I feel unable to take serious actions against this. I also talked to my friends about this issue but it seems as they don’t really taking me serious plus i don’t want to annoy them every time we see each other. I don’t even eat while the sun is up because I’m feared people could see me through the windows. I was wondering if you guys maybe made similar experiences as I did.",5,paranoia

"When I have a negative thought, I will sometimes involuntarily blurt out a word or a grunt or a sigh. I see the shock in people’s faces. It’s very embarrassing. It’s hard and even impossible to recover from it socially. It gets worse. I will also dissociate, seemingly black out for a few seconds, having no idea what I said; the blacking out happens once every couple of years or so. But it just happened again. 

I was recently with some new people in a social situation, and we were hitting it off great. Then at the end of the party, I seemed to a have ruined it. I was leaving the party and getting my things. There was a struggle to get my things together. I was exhausted. I remember struggling with my things but I don’t remember saying anything. Then someone asked me if I was ok. Everyone got quiet like the mood was killed. It’s a terrible feeling. I know I said something, but I don’t know what. I just left the party. 

I’ve been through therapy and I’ve done EMDR in the past. But I can’t seem to shake this issue. It’s really making me sad today. I just called a therapist who specializes in anxiety. It’s time to go back.

I do not take any anti-anxiety or anti-depression medication. Maybe it’s time to look into those again. It’s been over fifteen years since I was on medication for depression. 

I’ve been through some tough stuff that I won’t get into here. I guess it’s taken its toll. I hope help is around the corner. I feel pretty beat up right now. It scares me that I haven’t been able to stop this. It’s a helpless feeling.",4,anxiety

"A couple years ago someone who I considered a close friend of over a decade blocked me on all forms on contact seemingly out of nowhere after moving to live with his gf. Today I happened to notice one of his social media accounts is active again and the two have gotten married. I don’t use social media much and it never really impacted me negatively but but seeing this brought up so many hard emotions. I’m re-living all this anxiety… like what if I was a bad friend and I caused our relationship to end? What if my current friends don’t actually like me? What if the people around me get sick of me and leave me?

Being ghosted and not being able to ask why, or to try to fix anything, it felt as if he was saying it was a lost cause to work on our relationship. It was painful as any romantic break up and I kind of had to accept that I’ll never get to know why.

I have talked to my therapist about it before when it had happened. I thought I was over it, but I’m aware that I now carry this anxiety and self-doubt with me in the back of my mind… always.

Idk I guess I’m just venting and it’d be nice to hear from anyone, maybe if anyone has been through something similar.",4,anxiety

"I have seen posts online that only confirm what I was fearing: a fair number of autistic women hate us autistic men. I wanted you guys to know how unbelievably heartbreaking and degrading it is for them to make generalisations such as ""most autistic men are creeps"" who ""harass and stalk women."" On one post, there were literally a thousand upvotes. Now imagine going through your whole life being called a weirdo and a creep. Why would you even talk to people? This causes many autistic men to just not speak and keep their mouths shut throughout teenage years and young adulthood - a key period for social and romantic skill development through trial and error. When they finally go to college and the workforce and try to get romantically involved with women, they end up demonstrating these traits of poor social development. On top of immense levels of bullying and rejection, we are now ""mostly creeps and weirdos who stalk and harrass women?"". The fact that they blame us for this shows how unbelievably un-empathetic they are towards us. Imagine I make a post about how from my experiences with autistic women, I feel like they are extremely dull, boring and creepy due to their poor posture, lack of social skills and weird, obsessive and clingy behvaiour.

"Currently, I'm living in a group home on the campus of a psychiatric hospital. I've been outpatient here for the past couple of months. I've been struggling with self-harm, and I had to go inpatient twice. I don't think that helped me much, though, and they've given me a lot of chances. I've been warned that if I self harm again, I'm getting thrown out, so I'm trying my best to control myself and use some coping skills, mostly breathing exercises or listening to music to calm down, but sometimes these urges are just so strong that it's like I'm so ready to act on impulse, but I also think about the fact that if I risk self harming again, I'll actually be homeless, and I don't want that it'll make everything worse for me. Everything is just so hard right now. All I feel is constant stress and depression; so many things are building up inside of me. I'm just so used to using self harm as a relief for everything. It's like I'm an addict, and I need it so badly as an outlet to relieve myself. I know it's up to me to try harder to help myself.",2,depression

"Every day is the same to me; I feel so numb and empty.
I genuinely have no interests, and my life is so boring compared to literally everyone my age.
I don't really feel happy unless I buy something, but then I feel unhappy after like a day, and my depersonalization usually drowns out the happiness.
I'm so jealous of people who can study, watch stuff, socialise, go to school, and literally do anything.

It's so unfair, but I've technically done this to myself.",1,autism
"I generally feel like my family talks about me behind my back a lot. This bit isn't paranoia because I've walked in on them many times and I've often heard them say things about me (after an argument)  that kind of stung - my mom told my brother that she doesn't care about the things I get for her as long as she's got him and when he mentioned that I can hear her, she said that she "" doesn't give a shit"".  After that I was expected to let it go because she was angry. I mention this because it kind of traumatized me and my relationship with my mother was essentially over after that even though we're still living in the same house.

In the time since then, I exchanged exactly one look with another person. My mother, she and I were there, and we were talking about charity and my mother turned it around to how everything at home is sorted and we have everything we need. It was just a second but for my part it was very, very judgemental but the other person and her have a very good relationship and I often catch snippets that sound less than appealing to me. It's none of my business though so I stay out of it.

The thing now is that I tend to get very paranoid about them talk about me and based on basically everything I've heard my mother ever say in my entire life, I feel like I'm anticipating the worst. Even ridiculous things. One day, for example, there was a small earth tremor and the second it hit I recognized the sound with the vibration and I started counting the number seconds it lasted as I went to my safe place in my bedroom. My mother and I have both experienced earthquakes before then (her in the 60s me in 2018)  and I didn't recognize it the first time and I slept right through it (this was in Japan where some major quakes have hit not long before I was there so they were experiencing aftershocks). It scared the hell out of me that I didn't recognize it  so I read tons of accounts about what people hear and spoke to people who were there to try and figure out what I might expect. When the tremor hit where I am now, I heard a crack before I felt the shake and I immediately figured that this was it. Anyway, I told my brother (who didn't feel it at all) and mother that I heard it (tons of people did and tons didn't) and they gave one another ""the look""  now I am trying to figure out how this can  be used in one of their gab sessions to make me look bad. To me it feels like this would be consistent with everything I've experienced with them but it still feels so dangerous - like anything I say can and will be used against me, even something as ubiquitous as hearing an earthquake!",5,paranoia
"My friend is emotionally draining, he has a super inflated ego and thinks that everything me and my other friends say affects him. He cannot take a joke. He gets offended by comments without even knowing the context. He always insists on being a part of every conversation and will become violent and defensive at the drop of a hat. I try to tell him how I feel about his behaviour, but he either refuses to admit that he is being ignorant of our feelings or guilt trips us. I don't know what to do, he is generally a source of stress which contributes to my depressed state. But he refuses to listen.",2,depression

"I dont really know where to start but I will try my best to explain this.
So I am normally suspicious of the motives of other people but not to the point where it is interfering with my life however, I do feel like the potential is there. I recently went out to eat at a restraunt when the food and drinks are served to me a small thought creeps into my head that says ""I wonder if this could be poisoned?"", and the more I think about it the more paranoid that I get to the point where I won't eat the food and want to leave the restraunt. 
I had another incident in which I went to the doctor for a prescription for a sinus infection and as I went to take the medicine I began thinking ""what if they're not trying to help you, they're trying to hurt you"", I do manage to break out of the suspicion and take the medicine but there have been times where I almost avoid taking the medicine.
At night or when I'm alone I always feel as if there is someone watching me and due to this I keep protection near me at night and when im alone.
I do not like to self diagnose and I dont trust a Google search to answer my questions so I won't .

"I've been depressed for most of my life. It's usually not too bad. More of a back of the mind type of feeling. Sometimes it gets really bad, but I can usually pull myself out of it enough to start enjoying life somewhat. It's been gradually getting worse over the past two years. In the past few months, it's gotten really bad. I've slowly lost interest in a lot of things. My performance at work as gotten worse and my boss is starting to notice. I feel like I've over compensated in doing all the things that normally help me pull myself out of my depression. I moved into my dream apartment, I went on a week long vacation abroad, my apartment has never been cleaner, and I've been trying out all of the hobbies I've been wanting to do. Nothing is working and I feel like a shell of a person right now. I'm starting to get really scared about the path I'm going down.   


I've started to wonder If I should try anti-depressants.  I know that I need to start looking into therapy as a longer term solution, but the waitlist for therapist inn my network are insane. Plus I know it will take some time to find one that's a right fit for me. I don't know I can wait for a therapy appointment and subsequent sessions to be prescribed medication.   


Does anyone know if a Primary Care Doctor can assess and prescribe them? Are there different types of anti-depressants? I'm not 100% sure how it all works.",2,depression

"Hi. I am paranoid. I won't bore you with all the details, but for about 10 years I have always been thinking people are following me and watching me with a plan or intention to hurt me.

This year I have been trying to change this problem, because it is very exhausting and I often change places or move around and never really settle in one place. 

What do you guys do to help paranoia. I went to the doctor and got some therapy but it didn't help much, and in the end I didn't trust the therapist. I have just started reading a book called CBT for Dummies that my friend recommended. Any other tips or advice on how to stop feeling and thinking paranoid. Thanks.",5,paranoia

"How am I supposed to continue if I despise everything I do. What’s the point if everything degrades into meaningless drivel or another mistake for the pile. Where’s the sense in struggling if there‘s nothing to be gained from it but endlessly recurring disappointment. When moments cease to exist and blur together to form a mass of drab bodies of experiences, all categorized, defused, stale. Where every escape leads back to the inevitable confrontation with the real infused with new anxieties and struggles.  When success is shallow and the only real emotion is exasperation in face of illusory ideals. The only thing keeping me going is the anxiety of possibility reflected in the future, which is dispelled by the inability to escape myself.",2,depression

"Is it time to give up?, a thought ive had since age 6. Is it time to give up and jump into the street or similar methods. im too poor to afford quality therapy and all the places ive been too near me have been wildly ineffective in treating my ASD level 2, ADHD, OCD and Medication resistant MPD. Im probably gonna end it soon, im entirely unfixable unless i become rich enough to afford real therapy. My entire life has been a terrible Cycle of emptiness, neglect and loneliness. I grew up in a extremely poverty struck home with a emotionally wrecked and distant single mother. ive
been through everything from intense health issues to emotional issues
and ive decided life isnt worth it anymore, im an unfixable broken toy
and my circumstances are unfixable as well. when your poor and disabled
in california your given an insurance called medical. its horrible and
useless. your a second class citizen to doctors and hospitals. especially mental health. heres my detailed my 4 experiences that made me come to the conclusion of i wanna die soon. 

My first stint of therapy was at Choc Childrens in socal, from ages 5-8 is when i started to become extremely depressed, isolated, lonely and suicidal. the gap between social and intellegence bassed development which was later to be found
out caused by my autism was getting noticable. the reason i wasnt diagnosed till 3 years ago was beacuse i was racially profiled by my GP who said all my issues were because of my i tensive seizures as a kid and that because im black i couldn't have autism ot similar learning disability. i had said i wanted
to commit suicide to a teacher in 2nd grade and i was forcibly made to see a childrens therapy place in my area of South socal. the place was terrible. i was treated like a second class citizen and discrimated for me being poor and a half black mix. i was never treated properly and was passed around by multiple therapist who just played stupid board games with me.i hated it. nobody really cared they just babysat me for a paycheck. this is around the age when i began to develop extreme nihilistic ideas from reading books and watching internet content. Nihilism explained my existence it gave it reason, my entire life is suffering. I have nothing and will always be poor. in my early life i had a shit ton of health issues like seizures and breathing issues. this created an even larger social and Self suffering divide. i was divided and pitied socially like a kicked dog. I was never able to be ""friends"" everyone thought id give them seizures since i had experiance one in 3rd grade in class due to my epilepsy and extreme stress which come to find out are autism related. My life hasnt improved at all since i was younger and has continued to snowball so 8 year old me turned out to be correct. 

Elementary public School Psychologist - from ages 9-12 i kept myself closed off from others. My inability to make friends continued and i became even more depressed and nihilistic. spending hours reading philosophy books trying to figure out why im forced to suffer this terrible existence. which eventually led to buddhist ideas and to this day i've never found an answer on why my life sucks and i was cursed to suffer. in California schools your required to do mental health checks yearly and i answered truthfully on mine was forced to do multiple appointments with the school psychologist. she was terrible, just another worthless shrink that made me fill out paperwork for her and i
was never actually cared for or treated. just fill out this questionnaire and ill give you SSRIS that are complete BS and dont work for you at all. my social life became even harder the older i got. i drifted so far away from my age group in terms of interests and social skills i became an outcast. The ""weird fat kid"". Ive continued to worsen as i age in terms of physical and mental health. 

western youth services - at age 13 i was forced to go to a place called
WYS after my first major suicide attempt. i was referred there since
they were the closest place to me that took medical, boy was that terrible. they somehow where even worse then my previous two experiences combined. Terrible unresponsive psychologists, terrible therapists and they actively emotionally abused me. they gave me more ineffective drugs and treated me like a nuisance rather than a patient. most psychologists just gave me SSRI'S and told me to fuck off. nobody cared
for me, my family didnt and neither did the shitty workers. my depression became even worse and i began to develop violent thoughs of revenge and bitterness began to develop in me. mI wanted to kill my family for neglecting me, i wanted to kill my bullies for making fun of me and i wanted to kill my psychiatrists for not listening to me. i became even more nihilistic and had began to Self harm more extremely 

After that stint i was out of therapy for 2 years, i had only one attempt and my nihilism worsened. I was socially ridiculed more than ever now as i reached junior high. this when i noticed major declines and more bullying. Between stint 3 and 4 in late 2021  after a i had a hard head injury i was seen by a neuropsychologist that diagnosed me with autism,ADHD, OCD, and MDP and advised me to see a Therapist and psychiatrist. she was incredibly surprised i wasnt diagnosed with autism before. she said after talking with me for 10 minutes she knew. She was astounded nobody noticed till now. Its kinda hilarious guess racial discrimination and all that really does exist when it comes to autism in black men. Previously between 3 and 4 and the autism diagnosis i wanted to re enter therapy and was subsequently put on a 2 year waitlist between late 2019 and early 2022. In mid 2022 i began my 4th stint back at choc

choc stint 2- from age 14-16 i i was placed on a two year wait list to receive treatment after my 3rd suicide attempt in 2019. 2 years passed then COVID hit then it got extended to another couple months even though i had another attempt in the mean time. A TOTAL OF ALMOST 3 YEARS TO RECEIVE GARBAGE TREATMENT. i was treated like trash by choc again. i started back with them in mid 2022 and its been terrible. the therapist was a step up and my best to date but the Psychiatrist was terrible. Dr ngyuen fucking sucks, how can you take pride in your self as a dr when you actively miss appointments and flake on patients a bunch. Hes no showed us 8 FUCKING DIFFERENT TIMES. since ofc hes a telehealth only dr, but thats not all oh nooo he was fucking garbage at treating anything. he gave me 10 different SSRI/SNRI/SDRI combinations all to do fucking nothing since im medicine resistant and we told him that from the start. hes also completely worthless in terms of treating ADHD as its one of my biggest struggles and is actively ruining my life. his treatment plan is the exact opppsoite of what your supposed to do for ADHD. hes insistent on treating my depression first which basically means ""heres a new SSRI go away"" each session. hes also shown some very racist and discriminatory actions towards me. im refused adderall because i have an ""addiction risk:"" due to my socioeconomic status and my race. This recent stint has solidified in my mind that my only relief is death. i have no other option. this place was my last one that my insurance covered.

I bet nobody read all of this, but i just wanted to rant today. My psychiatrist flaked on our appointment today and i needed to get this out. i have no hope for my life and actively want to end it soon. lk the whole ""its so over meme"" but my life feels like it literally is unless i
win the lottery. Im too poor to afford anyway out of my living hell and
i cant work.i have no options. i have no other therapy options or ways to fix my mental or health disabilities. I just need to end it now",1,autism

I’m scared people won’t take my values seriously and think I’m just another deranged person that thinks the way they do just because of a specific mental disorder, as if it’s a personality contributor.


My last therapist was so cold. He tried to diagnose me and told me to take meds half an hour into our second session. He never looked into my eyes or asked me anything specific, he just.. generalized my thoughts and stayed silent. And no this is not a paranoia or cynical perspective, this is what he was genuinely like.


Nobody even suspects me of having paranoia because I hide when it happens. I have a good reputation, a nice social life, a nice future ahead, and a responsible personality. I’m just.. paranoid. I keep hearing mean people in my head and feeling foreign air creeping up behind me and all this other threatening stuff. It’s like my walls are closing in on me but it’s not schizophrenia because it’s a strictly mental sensation, after I’m done with the paranoia I know it’s not real. It’s just scary to witness.

"Hi! So I have been struggling with depression for a while now, and a major aspect of my struggle is isolating myself from others. I usually stay in my room and sleep since I don’t have the motivation to really do anything, especially to spend time with people even my family who I am very close with. 

On most websites that cover this subject it recommends going out and spending time with people even when you don’t feel like it, but I have found that even spending time with the people I love and enjoy spending time with the most makes me feel so much worse. I get way more irritable and upset when I’m out spending time with people, and usually this ends up hurting them way more than just isolating myself from them does.

"Lately, I have been going through moments of intense social anxiety. I’m assuming that it’s because I am anxious about living with my roommate. I feel like I'm constantly being watched and scrutinized for what I do and that people are talking behind my back without me noticing. Like I have this fear that someone sees something embarrassing on my phone/laptop/glasses reflection without me knowing, people are judging me for the clothes I wear/how kept my hair is/how my posture is like, how I blurt out incoherent sentences, how I pretend to know what’s going on when I don’t, how I can’t do my job properly, even me typing out this Reddit post makes me anxious because I’m afraid someone from my school/life will come upon this and identify that I wrote this. When my friends complain about other friends/acquaintances I think they’re trying to subtly hint to me that I need to fix something about myself but I’m simply unable to grasp that that is actually a targeted fact about me that they want to be polite about. I’m also a very forgetful, self deprecating, and overall insecure person and I’m also second guessing all of my paranoia.My brain is a mess and I feel like I’m living under a rock because I keep focusing on these flaws that I can fix rather than hobbies/interests.

My mom who is suffering with delusional disorder has been getting increasingly more delusional over the weeks and I have not managed to convince her to go see a doctor.

I'm not someone who is suffering a lot. I know people who have had a really bad time, people who keep fighting, people who have already left... I feel that their fights are superior to mine. But at the same time I know that something is wrong with me, because my brain tells me that I'm okay, but it also tells me that I'm not.

I've come to my own conclusion, I don't want to say that it works for everyone, but it has helped me. Not only war, death and any danger capable of taking your life hurt and make you feel bad. No... In fact, I think life is more like an hourglass.

What do I mean? For every second that passes, a grain of sand falls, bringing you closer to death. But you can always fill the hourglass with more sand. But for that you need fucking motivation and you've to be careful, because every grain of sand weighs.

If you're fed up with feeling how the grains of sand are falling, causing you to submerge yourself in the quicksand that you're creating, you'll be unable to fill the hourglass. If your grains of sand drown you, you won't be able to fill that sandglass, and when there are no grains of sand left, you'll die.

I'm tired, I've been in quicksand for a long time. If I'm still filling my hourglass, it's because if I find little meaning in life, I find even less meaning in death. I try to keep going, I've everything I ever wanted. I've enough reasons to be happy. But I'm not. Why?

Why don't I want to refill my hourglass anymore? I've been working for so long to make it the most beautiful hourglass there is. I've people who love me, I do well in my studies, I do what I want to do... But it seems that I love to hate myself, and I hate to love to hate myself.

I realize I'm a happiness junkie. I need the fucking soma. But I know that even if I could find happiness in a drug, I'd still feel sad, because I see so many people who have plenty of happiness, and I've to beg for it. I think what makes me sicker is not feeling sick, but believing that I've no valid reason to feel sick. 

Well... I'm sure there are also people who feel like me... For those people, I want you to know that hope isn't something you find, it's something you have to create. I feel bad, but I'm not hopeless, and I want you all to keep going :).",2,depression

"My brother and I used to be pretty close, he always used to be laughing and very productive. We always used to go out to places to hang out, if he needed advice or help, I was always there for all of it and in general, we were pretty cool with one another. 

One day, I noticed the changes happened so suddenly, and my once very family oriented, loving brother suddenly said that “if God was telling him to drop his whole family, he would”.

My brother hasn’t spoken to my family as much, he no longer has friends, he doesn’t text and refuses to hang out with me ever since his first “episode”. 

He says that I made fun of him but I don’t remember that happening. I remember being confused and scared because his first episode had happened with my family, and he ran away to my home that night. I had never seen him like this, it was almost like someone else was wearing the skin of my brother. It still feels this way.

I have tried to reach out, but he doesn’t seem to want to talk or spend time with me. I feel like I’ve lost my brother, and that I failed him as his older sister. Is there anyone out there that feels this way too? Any experiences? Does it ever heal?",6,schizophrenia
"Before age 23, I never struggled with anxiety. And then I started my first real job and was absolutely crippled by it out of nowhere. That was July 2021. I talked to my doctor, got prescribed SSRI meds, had an AWFUL adjustment period of mood swings and at least one panic attack for 2 weeks, and then on day 14, boom. Anxiety gone. What a bizarre little pill. Stayed on them for a month or two longer, got used to my job, tapered off, and I was good. 

Well now my anxiety is back again and it feels distinctly different. I used this herbal supplement called kratom for a long time. It’s a powder made from a leaf from a tree that grows in southeast asia. It’s completely unregulated even though it’s pretty much an opiate. It heightens your mood, kills pain and makes you feel motivated and happy for an hour or two. It does this by reacting with your opioid receptors. So it makes sense to say it’s as physically addictive as painkillers. 

I took one 5 gram dose of it once a day. For about three years straight. I thought I wasn’t developing dependency because I was taking so little, only once a day. 

Well I decided to stop taking it a month ago and now I have anxiety, but it’s not the same as before. It’s like my base level of anxiety is slightly heightened, and it only becomes really bad if I use marijuana, nicotine, drink coffee, or eat too much sugar. When I’m dehydrated I feel it too. None of these things ever used to make my heart pound and give me that tight feeling in my chest. And sometimes it feels like I’ll get a wave of anxiety for no reason.

There is a subreddit for quitting kratom but I feel out of place there. Everyone there was using 10, 20, 30, 40 grams of kratom a day, dosing throughout the day. When THEY quit, they get cold sweats, restless lags, GI issues, brain fog, depression, it’s like quitting heroin, and a lot of them also report anxiety symptoms, and these same sensitivities to THC, caffeine, nicotine and sugar that I’m feeling. 

So I’m hoping this is just my brain’s reaction to not getting that hit of Euphoria for 1/2 hours once a day, and this is temporary. Today is day 26 without kratom. Never taking that stuff again. But I thought I’d be feeling a little better by now. Every day is pretty bad. No signs of improvement. But other kratom addicts have said it can take two or three or six months to feel like your normal self again. For some it can take a year or more, but that seems to be very severe kratom addicts. 

I started the SSRI meds that fixed me up last time. First day of taking them was yeaterday. I do NOT feel good on them. It’s going to be another BAD 2 weeks. But fingers crossed that I have the same experience with them and they just suddenly cure me like last time. I just have a bad feeling it’s not going to be so easy this time.",4,anxiety
"For a few weeks now I've felt like the world around me is fake, I don't trust anything and I have anxiety attacks weekly, and I feel like it's getting worse. At certain points, I feel like people or the world around me glitches and I have a vision that the space around me will deteriorate as I wake up from this dream I feel like I'm in. I have anxiety, quite bad anxiety at that, and I've suffered from derealisation and depersonalisation many times before, but this doesn't comfort me one bit since I believe anxiety and all that is a figment of my imagination too, as a part of this fake dream world that I'm in.

I’m actually way worse today than I have ever been.  I just recently quit my toxic job because I can’t function anymore.

"I have a great, musically talented, smart, funny kiddo. He will be 17 soon. His dad and I aren’t together anymore (about 5 yrs now) but we coparent well. We both have safe loving homes where he is 50/50. We tell him we love him all the time. I’d hug him if he’s let me but at his age he would prefer not. Oh well, fist bumps it is. 

I’ve noticed he’s been really angry/mopey for the last year and it’s gotten worse lately. And when he’s angry/annoyed everyone around him feels it. A short fuse with the dogs that he adores stomping around and short one word answers to questions…or no answer at all like he didn’t hear. The air is toxic. It worries me, and makes me feel like shit at the same time. But this isn’t about me…

His primary Dr recommended antidepressant a year ago which both he and his father were adamantly against. I was over ruled.  

He doesn’t like many kids at school. Says they’re assholes. I thought maybe he was getting bullied? We talked to his teachers and they said he could come to the office anytime he felt frustrated or bad in any way. He will never name names. 

I know he was getting teased about his weight. And for a few weeks I couldn’t get him to eat. That was scary. 

He’s decided he would like to change high schools for his final year. This may help? Or it may be the same ol same old. but I’m willing to try anything!  

He has no interest in doing anything fun with us. Laser Tag, a Summer Vacation of his choice, going to see a movie. He just says “Nah” and goes back to his room. 

He will not talk to his father or me about what SPECIFICALLY is going on. He said,  “Everything sucks and is annoying. Home, work, school I hate it all.” I asked him what I could do to make his home life better as I can control that. He had no specific requests. And I mean I’M WILLING to change anything I’m doing wrong. 

I would like him to go to therapy. And am open to getting him on antidepressants but, again, he has been very against it. It seems like he feels like he would be less of a “man”. Like it’s a sign of weakness to get help. This sucks! I didn’t raise him to shove down his feelings. It also doesn’t help, as I said previously, that his Dad, is against the therapy or meds too. 

Last night everything came to a head and we all talked. His dad said he should take two days to think about what he would like to do. And how we can help. If he doesn’t know what to do, that’s okay too. AND dad said that something needed to happen, like therapy, so he could be happy again. (So glad he said that!) I asked if he’s ever had thoughts of hurting himself and he said no. But is that the truth? 

Today my son said he would like to try medication. He will talk with his dad tomorrow about it. I wish he would do both talk therapy and meds (even for a short time) so he can feel happy again.

It’s just chore after chore, test after test, job after job, working towards a goal that doesn’t even seem to great: survival. I cannot express who I love, so I will never date and never marry, growing old alone, and being forced to watch the only people I love - my parents - fade away from earth, and frankly I don’t wanna be around to experience it. I don’t wanna leave their arms, grow old and overworked, loveless, work and sweat just for survival that doesn’t seem to be something I want. I’ve isolated my friends down to nothing, I make every conservation and meeting worse, I’m not attractive or charismatic, even my “friends” gossip about me. I’m not a genius and have little accomplishment to show for my life at all. I can’t talk to anyone, express my love for anyone, it all just feels like torture where I’m being forced to run through the cycle of life until everything I love is taken away from me. And there’s no reason I should feel this way, I’ve been blessed with a stable family, food, education, and still have made no use of it. I just feel pathetic and useless and frustrated that I have to be around on this filthy planet just to suffer.

"for the past few years, my ability to talk has become worse and worse. i used to be able to speak somewhat okay without getting too tired out and slip up occasionally (like stuttering a little or switching up words a bit), but now nearly every sentence i say makes no sense. everything i say is jumbled, i stutter super often and it takes longer than it should for me to get a sentence out. i have to often resay sentences 3+ times because i cant organize my words and it pisses me off. if i talk too much, itll start to feel like i have a faint sore throat (which i DESPISE the feeling of) and i have to strain more than i already do to get the words out. its so exhausting to speak aloud and i hate feeling ""pressured"" to continue talking because of the fact its not socially acceptable (from what ive gathered) to just choose to not speak. sometimes talking feels overstimulating, even when im not overstimulated otherwise.

as bad as this likely sounds, every time ive been overwhelmed to the point of not being able to speak at all, ive felt a sense of relief that i cant talk anymore, and my energy came back much quicker than if i were to be less overstimulated but still be able to talk. i wish i could just write on a notepad or in my notes app every time i wanted to speak, but i fear people wont be patient with me and i dont want to get yelled at by a stranger or something. GODDDDDDDDDD i just wish it was socially acceptable to not talk, because at this point it feels so irritating and horrible that it makes me want to punch something.

One of the tasks is just speaking, you have a person asking you questions about yourself and you have to answer it in 3/4 sentences. 

The thing is, a lot of these questions are really personal or touching on politics and I don’t want to answer honestly,
especially if it inevitably touches on subjects like mental health affecting my day to day functioning, or politics in my country that are quite hostile to me considering I’m lgbt.

Im not better than her. I have no idea what she has,   but it has been going on for decades without any help, that sounds like hell. I cant even get to class on time because sometimes my hallucinations end up keeping me up at night, and i see a psychologist twice a week and a psychiatrist every now and then. 
 Although, im 16, and i used to hate her a few years ago, i was a child and children tend to be assholes lol. But i do feel bad about how much i detested her, given that she hasnt done anything, besides begging. Its sad how society is organized in a way that fails people like her so badly.",6,schizophrenia
"So I use Siri quite a lot for navigation because I drive for my job. Just in general she does weird things sometimes like saying “turn right” instead of “turn left” and having little glitches that I tend to take personally, so I’d understand if this was just one of those things but yesterday she had a glitch that really freaked me out.

I was going to this street called Thistledown and as I was about to turn onto it she says “turn right on This-sssssssssss-essstledown” like she was a real person stumbling over the word. Then when she had to say the street name again (“you have arrived at 6800 thistledown”) she said it kinda weird and slower like she was trying not to stumble over it again.

So to be clear, Siri said the name of this street at least 3 times and at least 3 different ways (correctly, stuttering, then hesitantly) and she sounded so much like a real person that I’m wondering legitimately if Siri has become sentient and is only pretending now to be my personal little helpful AI.

"Before I sound too rational and like I am not actually paranoid, I am just basing what I think reality is or should be to most people and seeing that it is not what I experience or am experiencing right now. Also the main purpose of this post is to try and find others like me or a community that deals with this. 

1. I believe my paranoid/pessimistic mental state affects the world and people around me and they start acting different. (without even speaking to them.) 
2. I have seen reasonable evidence that people are quite legitimately against me (or just evil in general) even though they were my friends. 

I will start with number 1. In my current living situation I live alone with my dog and my sister. I take the dog out frequently and today I noticed that people in their cars driving by were staring. One guy even took a photo or video of me when I was looking. He even seemed to slow the car down to do it. Usually I feel like my vision must have been obstructed but this time the window was rolled down and it looked clear as day. 

Also, It feels like when I am in this state that the world changes based on my paranoia. Like having a power that you can't control sort of way. Or one that actively goes against you. I feel like the results I am looking to have will not happen if I look forward to them too much. One example is the stock market. I feel that I should not look at the graph or it will start going against me. That is more of a soft example though. I have also been rejected from many job positions and it feels like the more I wanted it the more that obstructed. I had received an offer at a decent place only for it to be taken away by a literal pandemic. Then the company which seemed to imply they would hire everyone later rejected me over email even after all that I have been through with them (summer program they provided). Whenever I feel too happy about something it will get ripped away. 

For the second point, it seems the more I look the more evil I find. People actively don't give a shit about others. No one in this town cares about covid. 

That is not even the bigger issue to me. When I am in this state I think that it influences other peoples decisions and how they view me. Even though I never talk to them about my delusional thinking I can see it in their faces and actions. It's like they can pick up on my ""energy"" so to speak and they actively either make fun of me or avoid me. 

I am not that bad right now but there was a time I thought my GF was a literal government agent of sorts and that I had evidence to support it. I remember specifically thinking that the evidence was undeniable though I cannot seem to recall any of it.",5,paranoia
"Hello! I am the daughter of someone who has recently been diagnosed schizophrenia but has been experiencing symptoms for decades. I love my mom so much, more than anything in this world. I’ve tried really hard to be there for her by calling her almost everyday and visiting whenever I can, but I have been at undergrad out of state for the past 4 years so it’s been hard. I’m just recently finishing and moving back near her. Since being diagnosed with schizophrenia, my mom has lost her job and hasn’t found a new one (any advice on that would be great too). She has money saved up to afford a place, but I thought that when I move for my job I would get a two bedroom in case she has to move in with me eventually. This is where the communication I need help with is. I have always expressed to my mom that moving in with me is a last resort. Not because I don’t love her or because of her schizophrenia, but because I am 22, newly out of college, moving in with my serious boyfriend of a year, and learning to become an independent adult. Now, that doesn’t mean I don’t want her in my life. I’d love to live near her and see her often, even have sleepovers when she’s having a rough night or just for fun. But she seems to think that because I am getting a two bedroom that means she can move in whenever she wants. If she was ever about to be homeless or ran out of most of her money or needed a caretaker, of course I’d take her in. But I’d much prefer to be neighbors who see each other a lot but have separate places to go at night. How do I express this to my mom so that she understands without hurting her? Because of her schizophrenia she can get really emotionally volatile, feel attacked, lash out, and also comprehend things poorly sometimes which causes misunderstandings. I don’t blame her at all, it’s just shitty symptoms that happens when she’s not doing well with the illness. I was wondering if anyone here with schizophrenia or family members with it would have advice. Thank you!",6,schizophrenia

Now maybe my other suspicions about other people may also be true?  I deal with PTSD (sexual abuse/psychological abuse put upon me when I was a child by friends, family and professionals) and along with that comes my paranoid thoughts of either people wanting to abuse/hurt me again, use me, or that they pretend to like me when they actually despise me and they only pretend to like me in order to get close and eventually harm me.  Kinda feel like shit about my thoughts being true, now I feel like my brain is on defense mode, which I assume is a normal/expected response?

"Throughout my entire life I've had a lot of issues with socializing, anxiety, and confidence. I developed a stutter around age 6 that probably reached moderate levels of severity as a young kid but over time it improved significantly to the point where it doesn't usually affect my life or make people notice at all. Even though it improved I think it contributed to me having a lot of self-esteem issues and probably stunted my social development and I still worry about stuttering even now. Adding to that while I think I grew up in a great home I had an extremely competitive and ambitious older brother who clearly had some narcarssistic tendencies. We argued constantly growing up and I didn't live up to the expectations that I perceived as being set on me as a child by him. I was also just a lazy child and didn't really care about extra-curriculars and I was always an outcast on sports teams and I would spend most of my free time just playing video games so I think I missed out on a lot of opportunities to learn what it's like to be a part of a team and community. All of these I pinpoint to my social and self-image development being really stunted and at 25 it feels like I'm really far behind and in a lot of aspects I'm lacking on a lot of what I want in life and my youth.  
  
I have really bad social anxiety and it's always been that way to some extent or another. One of my earliest memories is from when I was around 10 and I was playing catch with my best friend at the park and a group of kids from our school showed up and were doing whatever and my friend wanted to join them. I really didn't want to go because I was afraid of being made fun of so I told my friend to go and I left and went home. In early high school I gained a bit of a reputation for being a weird kid and I was so afraid of being bullied that I felt that my reputation was unfixable (it wasn't) and the best course of action would be to just hide in obscurity as much as I can and not make waves so people would leave me alone. I was basically never invited to parties and I didn't go to any grad events in my senior year except for prom, the grad ceremony, and the convocation (so I didn't go to the annual grad campouts, the boat party, the end of year parties, none of that). I've really only been to a few parties and whenever I do go I have almost insurmountable anxiety.  
  
It's funny looking back at high school because despite all this, I actually had a decent amount of friends, or at least people that could've been friends if I tried harder. I would still joke around with people all the time in class in my later years, my senior yearbook is filled with funny comments and inside jokes, I had a ton of people that I'd talk to regularly at school and online, but I never really saw any of them outside school except for a few. I guess I just didn't really think they'd be a friend and I never pursued. The only friends I made in high school that I kept long term are people that did pretty much all of the heavy lifting at the beginning. I would almost never be the first one to say that we should hang out.  
  
And I never really learned how to make friends. I went to a community college after high school and never had any interest in the limited social aspect of it. I went to a big university after a few semesters and completely failed in the social department. I didn't meet a single person that I considered to be a friend. I went to a few study meetups but that's it for social meetings with people from school. Never went to dorm or frat parties (huge regret). I worked in a restaurant off-campus and would drink with my coworkers, almost none of whom were students. I liked my roommates but I knew almost nothing about them. I never knew how to get into that social community at university. I was too nervous to ask anyone to hang out outside class or the dorm room because I was nervous about stuttering and sounding like an idiot.  
  
I only have 2 people that I would consider friends and honestly? They're shit friends. One of them has really horrible drug and alcohol abuse issues and all he ever wants to do is binge drink and watch movies in his basement and the other just never wants to do anything interesting. I love him but besides going to a hockey game in December I can't remember doing anything memorable with him for years. I've brought him to my family's summer place every year for years now and while I'm glad he comes after a while all it ends up being is he and my brother taking every opportunity to get on my nerves and I just want one of them or both to just leave. We used to be so much closer - us three called ourselves ""the dynamo"" and along with their girlfriend's or mine when I had one that was our friend group. I remember my awesome 19th birthday, the barhopping night right before I left for vietnam, the awesome day we spent together right before one of them left on a long trip, us staying up all night and sneaking out until 6 AM in high school, going to the driving range, the bike rides into the forest, the camping trips, going snowboarding, going longboarding around town, all with them. But all of that is so long past and I don't think either of them want to do those anymore. This is different than in high school when I didn't realize that there were people I could've made solid friendships with. At this point there's really nobody I would consider as somebody that I would see on a regular basis recreationally.  
  
There was a point where life was really good. Second year of college I meet this girl at work and she's clearly very into me. After a month of flirting I ask her out and we embark on a 2 year relationship. That relationship flourishes, my friends and I are all still together, I'm going out and making memories, I'm losing weight, I go on a trip to vietnam, my confidence is improving greatly. I fucked that relationship up and I gradually lost contact with my friends and were never really the same with them since. It just sucks looking back and thinking about the time when I had a vibrant social life and real connections with people and comparing it to what little I have now. Now all I really am is an overweight line cook making a shit wage at a restaurant I don't care about with 0 skills or network gained through a 4-year degree with terrible and unresolved social anxiety issues, 0 good, close connections with people outside my family and can't get passed the first date on those frustrating dating apps. It makes me feel like such a loser.  
  
It really sucks because deep down I really think I'm just like everybody else. I have the same interests as tons of other people my age and I'm a nice guy who loves to laugh. I love following sports and going to shows and going out at night just like everybody else but I don't feel apart of any community at all. I know that somewhere there's a version of me that can flourish socially because I've been that before. I'm just so anxious about everything and have such low self-esteem and it's been that way ever since I was a kid and I hate it. I really, really don't like the fact that I'm me. I feel almost embarrassed that other people get to be themselves and I was unlucky enough to be me. I'm not happy with it at all. I really just want to be normal and happy but it seems so far away. I'm 25 now and I'm wondering if I'm just completely screwed, like I fucked up during a critical period of social development and I'll never be the person that I was supposed to be.",2,depression

"I'm in art school, art was something I used to love doing, but in the past years i began losing my focus. I do less and less every day, be it school work or just personal art for my own enjoyment. Right now, finals for my 2nd year in uni are _weeks_ away and I have absolutely zero drive to work on anything. All I do is fixate on very short-lived obsessions for that dopamine rush, like certain games or movies. I dont have any aspirations. I have a burning need in me to _know_ things, to learn and experience and DO stuff. But i just... can't.

Recently, I began to realize some things are not actually in my control, and out of a last attempt at finding _why_ i couldn't escape from this hole I've dug myself into, I went to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with ADHD. I will start medication in a month, which _is_ progress and will most likely help in gaining some control and drive in my life... yet I cant help but overthink everything. The second i feel that terror and discomfort creep in, I dont even try doing any work. And due to toxic relationships in my life, and due to my previously undiagnosed ADHD, i have little to no trust in my own mind.

Here is where i feel i need an outside opinion. Whenever I'm in a conundrum, I start spiraling and end up with nothing but mush in my brain. Am I stopped by my condition, or am I letting myself be stopped? Do i have the power, actually, but its just very uncomfortable to overcome this struggle, or is this thinking the same one used by the toxic people in my life, to belittle my struggles and blurr my limits? Am I, by not trusting myself, reinforcing my insecurities, or blocking out the response I learned to throw _at_ myself as a punishment?

Am i pushing myself in this corner or just accepting ive been pushed here by other factors?

TLDR: I'm overthinking my every choice/ avoidance _of_ choice, cant tell if its more my fault or out of my control and I need an outside opinion in hopes that i can figure out what to do.

"In the last years I found out I have a habit of telling new people (potential friends, partners, coworkers) that I meet right at the start that I have memory problems just so they would know what they're dealing with.
I would say to them that often it will happen that I will forget something they would have said or some appointment, birthday or some chore but that doesn't mean that I don't not respect them or appreciate them and I apologise in advance.

When I met my now gf I told her exactly that, like ""Please don't be upset if I forget something you tell me or where we have been a year ago or what has happened at your mom's lunch or if I forget I have to do something, it's my brain, that doesn't mean that I don't appreciate you or care about you..""

"I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety a little under a year ago. I attempted and was sent to a psych ward for a week and put on lexapro as a parting gift. I still felt horrible so they upped my dosage a few weeks later. And then I still felt like shit so they gave me 2 grams of Abilify (an anti-psychotic) to even me out. It still wasn’t working as it should’ve and my symptoms were already scary enough (I was extremely numb, nauseous all the time, and wouldn’t stop shaking). So not wanting more shit put in me I stopped taking them.

I know that’s usually a bad idea and I should never stop something with such high risk factors cold turkey like that. I accidentally admitted to not taking my meds one time to my friends and they wouldn’t get off my back about it (and they thought it was just a one day thing, I haven’t taken them in months).

Thing is, I’m much happier and content than I was before. Of course I’m not always on my a game, but I haven’t felt suicidal in weeks and I actually have hope for the future.

It’s a big contributor to many things in my life right now, and Id love to tell my therapist but I fear it would count as me harming myself and the last thing I want to do is go back to the mental hospital.

I’m not sure what I’m doing is good or not, maybe I should give the meds another chance? Or maybe I should tell my psychiatrist the truth? Idk. 

What do you guys think? It would be nice to hear opinions of strangers that would know what I’m going through and aren’t being paid to help me.",2,depression

"Having multiple different friends messaging me mostly every day, whether to have casual conversation or invite to something, has been really suffocating me recently. I feel bad for thinking this way since many other young adults, as well as some of my friends wish they had more friends / people asking them to hang out but that's why it's very hard to express. I love my friends, and I usually have a good time online and in person, but I have an extremely low social battery. 

When I spent 3 days in a row doing spending even a few hours with friends I'm drained, and I want at least a day or two to recover and spend on my own things. When I do something social, I feel like my entire day has gone out the window since it disturbs whatever plan I had laid out for myself. If I reject one invitation, I might still have 1 or 2 more to reject that day or a text conversation to hold for an hour or two while I'm trying to focus on something else. And it's not really good to say, ""I'd just prefer to go back to what I'm doing than talk to you right now"" when I don't necessarily interact with that individual a lot. Even if I'm not doing anything important at a given moment, losing this time unexpectedly usually means I won't keep up with other things I wanted to get done. I can explain that I have a low social battery and that these things are more taxing on me since I have ADHD, but none of my friends, even ones that also have other mental illnesses, understand how straining it is for me to keep up relationships, especially online ones or if I'm expected to be reaching out first. I told that to someone and they must've misunderstood it because they still try to start a conversation every day (sometimes multiple times if it fizzles out) and think it's not straining since I'm not initiating. (Said they ""would do all the heavy lifting"") 

Explaining this to friends, especially since they don't know all of my other friends are or how I've been dividing my time, sounds like me complaining I have too many friends and that I'm annoyed that they remember my existence lol. I can go weeks without messaging a friend first because I just haven't thought about it. With a lot of my friends over my life this has been completely normal and worked out fine, but its difficult when I have so many things to keep in check just in my own day to day life. 

I wouldn't trade having my friends for anything, and I could only imagine how terrible I would feel if I didn't have any, but it still often feels like an obligation to me. I got diagnosed in Fall 2022, so I'm still learning a lot about myself and unpacking things like this",3,adhd

But nothing helps the fact that I’m 26, I live with my mom, I don’t have a job, I’m too crippling depressed to work, my car just broke and I have a 7 year old daughter. There’s no light.

And it makes me so mad that I can’t just end my suffering because I know how badly that would hurt her and she doesn’t have another parent. I feel so hopeless and I can’t even kill myself. I’ve taken all the steps to try and fix me but nothing is working. I just want to normal, functional.

"If you are unaware, there are multiple clips of Shaun circling around online, mainly of scenes of him experiencing meltdowns. These clips are posted with the intent of completely mocking the character, or to be used as an example of ""how not to write an autistic character"".  


I have also seen posts of this nature in this subreddit before, but from a more ""critical"" perspective, basically claiming how Shaun's autism is offensive/unrealistic/horrible representation.  


Yes, it is a doctor show. Yes, there are elements of the show that may be dramatized or ""cringey"". Yes, it is not going to be a 1:1 representation of the real world or whatever.  


But please, please consider before you make fun of this character, remember that MANY autistic people are ACTUALLY like him, or experience things similar to how it is depicted in the show. You can find plenty of people in this subreddit who really relate to this character, and autistic people are coming forward about how this trend is making them feel extremely alienated and disgusted with themselves. 

I know people are going to say ""but non-white-male autism is poorly represented"". Does the media/system favor white males? Yes. Is there a systematic prejudice against women and POC? Of course there is. But autism is autism, and you don't have to be white or male to relate to this character from an autistic perspective. You do not have to be white or male to have uncontrollable meltdowns with speech loops, or to talk the way he talks, or have the social style that he has. Just because he is is a white male does not mean that his autistic traits are made up out of thin air. So when you're claiming that his meltdowns are ""clownish"" and ""a mockery of autistic people"", what does that imply about the people who actually have meltdowns like that? Sure, we could use more diverse representation. But how does that logically condone the bullying of this character? How does that condone saying that his (very autistic) traits are not autistic?   


If you don't relate to him, that's fine. If you don't like the show, that's fine. But please do not mock him simply because you don't relate to him. I don't even really like the show. We need to remember that this is a spectrum condition and there will be people who present differently than you. That does not make you any less autistic, and it doesn't make Shaun's traits any less autistic, it just means you are different people with different symptoms and needs. We are alienating a part of our community by engaging in this bullying of traits. Thank you for coming to my TED talk lmfao.",1,autism

"I can’t do this anymore. I want to kill myself. My therapist told me her manager was reminding her of all other people waiting to be seen by their mental health services and I immediately got triggered by it and didn’t tell her. She said she would fight for my case but now I think I’ll never get better. I won’t be able to survive by myself these coming months. I’ve seen her for four months already, and while I think therapy is supporting me, Im still severely suicidal. My therapist has spent all that time just trying to stabilise me and we’ve only just started treatment. I feel like I can’t be fully honest about my violent thoughts or how suicidal I really am. And I’m afraid I’m starting to accept that I will die soon. I’m waiting for it, it’s just a matter of time. 

I’m constantly thinking about the end of the world, having vivid apocalyptic nightmares and about killing myself, about people chasing me trying to hurt me. I know that once the covid situation gets worse the government/authorities will assert their control even more and are probably going to detain me eventually, put me in prison and kill or torture me because I don’t believe in their luciferian evil new world order. I think there’s an evil force sabotaging me, like a ghost or dark cloud of smoke watching my every move. None of my family believe me what I say, they brush me off when I try to explain what is really happening in this reality. I sprinkled some holy water just in case to feel better. Im really scared of what will happen soon, and something definitely will, a catastrophe, depopulation and control. I would rather die by my own hand. 

I’m really scared of ghosts/demons. I see shadows moving sometimes but I play it off as my mind playing tricks on me. I’ve seen horrific things while sleeping too during sleep paralysis and I can’t get over the fear. It makes it hard to go to sleep at night or be by myself.

"So my anxiety used to make me pass gas a lot and because I got bullied for it, I developed this really odd feeling whenever I get anxious or generally throughout the day. Basically, it feels really tense in my lower area (stomach, butt) and it feels like I'm constantly farting? Like theres constantly gas flowing out of my butt even though that's impossible I think, or almost as if there's poop at the entrance of my butt even though when I move to a quiet area or less populated place the feeling disappears. I genuinely do not know if this is anxiety causing this sensation or I am actually farting, because I am on anxiety meds and taking gut health supplements plus I eat a pretty healthy diet avoiding lactose and gluten foods. Because of this I've been interpreting everyone's actions around me as if they've smelled me, if they scratch their nose, move away from me, stare at me etc. it feels like they're doing so because they've smelled me.

I live on my own in a clean, well decorated apartment. I have 10 people I can call my best friends, and we get together in person often. I have a boyfriend that I feel super secure with relationship wise. I am incredibly physically fit and am working towards my first strongman competition. I have trauma from childhood stuff (long story, family of addicts, hoarders and enablers), but my family is now clean and did 180s with their personalities.

"Hi my name is lupe and I’m 18 from southern California (sorry about getting so much into detail) but i have a brother who is turning 31 on June and for about 3 years since 2020 in my eyes he wasn’t himself anymore.

For about 3 in a half so maybe years my brother has been dealing with paranoia, delusions, and thats really about it, and i have been telling myself this doesn’t look like schizophrenia maybe delusional disorder, bi-polar, something of that nature but basically he believes he’s being watched from every single device from my game console to his phone camera, the cable box, he believes he’s being watched when he gos out to do something, he also believes celebrities, the government and other different agencies are in on it, he names different celebrities to me who are watching him, he believes he’s the most influential person, he says “I’m bigger than social media” he believes different celebrities want to be intimate with him, it goes on and on.

The thing is that he doesn’t deal with hallucinations (auditory or seeing things), he doesn’t have disorganized speech, he doesn’t have psychotic tendencies unless it involves the delusion, like hell get mad if i don’t agree with what he tells me about these specific delusions, in his case all of these beliefs are reality.

Its been hard dealing with this for 3 years especially since i live with him, i feel like i don’t know him anymore at some times, he was completely normal until boom he snapped in 2020, and now he’s just this now. Theres so much more detail that i can get into but its a lot to explain but i hope some of you people get the gist and have insight.

Me and my sister don’t have any mental health disorders, well i have ADHD and anxiety but i feel like thats common i was diagnosed when i was in elementary. But other than that my uncle does have severe trauma from jail which may have caused him to have a mental health disorder but my biological mom had 3 kids with 3 different dads so i have a different dad my brother has one and so, my grandmother says we don’t have schizophrenia in our genes as well, somethings i get scared ill end up like that, but at the end of the day i wanna live my life.

So i wanna conclude this on i hope you guys can give some insight on this, i also want to include that my brother has been through severe trauma like being ran over by a car at a very young age, doing narcotic drugs frequently like Xanax,Percocet’s, lean, pretty much ODing on them, also he got a yeast infection due to having intercourse with another girl, he also start smoking since high school until now but he stopped once he started to get like this due to panic attacks.

I'm feeling quite lost and anxious right now, and I'm hoping to get some guidance from you all. Recently, I've been hit with panic attacks for the first time in my life, and it's been a real shock to me. I've always been a calm person, so this is completely new territory for me.

The panic attacks seemingly comes out of nothing, during the first one I was alone in my bed and during the last one I was enjoying myself at a barbecue with friends. 

I want to regain control of my mental health and minimize the impact of these panic attacks as much as possible. Can you help me with a few questions?

What are some initial steps I can take to manage and reduce the frequency of panic attacks?
If you've been through something similar, what self-help techniques or coping strategies have worked for you personally?
Should I seek professional help? If so, what type of healthcare provider should I reach out to?

"I'm so frustrated. I graduate with my master's degree in a week, and I am having crippling anxiety over the ceremony. I normally wouldn't, but for the past 10 months, my anxiety has been causing me to dry heave. I'm severely emetophobic (afraid of throwing up), so this symptom is my biggest nightmare. No other anxiety symptoms scare me, but this one terrifies me. I've still managed to live a somewhat normal life, but it's considerably limited compared to what it used to be. 

I have a big family/friend graduation party over the weekend - I don't want to do that because I'm terrified of dry heaving during it and ruining my whole day. It's even worse for my actual graduation ceremony. My boyfriend is flying in from 1,000 miles away to come see me, and I don't want to make his trip pointless if I panic during the ceremony or I'm not able to actually participate because I'm too anxious. I don't even want him to come because I'm so panicked. I'm afraid of disappointing my parents by panicking and not going to the ceremony (they're also traveling to come see). If it were up
to me, I would be able to skip this all and just move on. I still have an entire week until the ceremony, but for the past 3 days, I've been waking up with a horrible racing heart, nausea, and I feel like dry heaving all day. Xanax helps, but I don't allow myself to take it more than 1-2x per month. Hydroxyzine and propranolol don't touch it. 

I don't have social anxiety, I normally love big events. I love parties and ceremonies. I'm not scared of the social aspect, I am just terrified of gagging and being trapped in the ceremony/grossing people out/looking like an idiot. I haven't been able to find a single thing that stops the gagging - not water, not other drinks, not mints or gum, nothing. The fact that I can't prevent it is what scares me most. I've tried positive visualization, but all I can visualize is me getting all done up for graduation, getting to the ceremony, and either dry heaving in my seat or worse, walking across the stage. It's so irrational, but it feels so real. The *only* reason for the dry heaving is anxiety, so you'd think that if I knew I could stay calm, I wouldn't worry about the dry heaving - but nope. 

I don't know what to do. I'm considering just not going so I can stop being this anxious. I'm so angry that I can't just enjoy exciting, happy life moments like most other people can. No one in my life even gets why I'm so anxious because I should just be ""happy and proud"" instead.

"Just looking for maybe some opinions on this?

I have always been very paranoid especially when I was younger. When I go to school or basically anywhere in public, I always feel that everyone is secretly looking at me and watching me and laughing at my every move and what I look like and how I walk and what I say on the rare I occasion that I speak. In all reality, I'm fairly certain no one is even acknowledging my existence but I always feel as if there's a number of people watching and laughing behind my back. Does anyone else feel this way?

I am 22 years old, and believe it or not, I have been suffering from depression for almost a decade.

I have nothing genuine,no friends or purpose to go on with life,I have had ADHD since I was 2 years old and major depression with anxiety diagnosed about 3 years ago,although in reality,it has been going on for quite some time.

I feel so exhausted, so angry and so lost, that I don't even plan to be in the future. I feel like hurting people, even though I know it's not right. If I knew today that I would never wake up again after sleeping in my bed, I wouldn't mind ..... Yes, I would be afraid, but it would give me the peace I so longed for.

The only reason I haven't taken my own life is because of the harm I might cause my family.

Sometimes I wonder if teachers,classmates or people who barely knew me today wonder where I am,what I'm doing,or if I moved on as that kid who breaks out of the mold and doesn't like to be like everyone else....

"So as long as I can remember there's always been a hint of melancholy below the surface. A single blue flower in a field of sunflowers. Some days the blue would spread to the other petals, others they'd be the natural yellow, and it was a balance that, although challenging, I thought I'd learned to live with. Well, I'm 18 now and something must have evolved because the whole field has decayed.

Depression runs in my family quite strongly, I think I've got it. I thought it was just situational depression (it's not been an easy time) but even after escaping all of it, it's still there, screaming instead of whispering now. I can't picture a future, I can't see myself in this world as anything other than a mistake or a cosmic joke. I feel like I'm simply just not meant for this world. If dying wasn't painful, I think I might have done it by now. I tested those waters fairly recently and I'm too ashamed to tell people close to me about it.

Doctors and therapists tell me all the coping mechanisms but for some reason they never bloody stick, they just slide off my brain the second they land, or they work once or twice but never always. I'm at a really precarious point mentally. I think I'm getting out but I'm still researching the least painful ways to die. I know that logically I don't want to die and that I just want this feeling to end, but if this feeling is clinical and festering inside me forever then isn't it the same difference? Everyone tells me I'll learn to live with it, but I don't want a life where the slightest inconvenience causes some reaction that makes oceans roar in my chest. The past week has been spent crying on the floor, sobbing in the street, collapsing in front of my friends - it's so pathetic. Is life going to be a pendulum swinging between emptiness and drowning in uncontrollable sadness?

"One day I was sitting in my living room with my boyfriend while in a reasonably good mood. He came over to me to explain some math related thing, which involved him holding up a piece of paper flat (so it's just barely a line) in front of his eyes and it started making me very uncomfortable, I had to ask him to stop holding the paper in front of him because it felt like he was attempting to do something to me.

Then a few minutes later, while still on edge from that experience, he was talking to me about something else and went to scratch his forehead as he was talking and the way he was moving his fingers reminded me of spider legs and that freaked me out too. 

Edit: by the end of this 10 minute scenario, I had cried from the overwhelming feelings I experienced.

All day I haven’t been in a mood. I’m at an all time low with being depressed and I really don’t feel like being around anyone. I went out last night with a friend and he met this girl. I’m really happy for him. But it sucks when no one wants anything to do with me. I sat there alone in the middle of this bar for at least a half hour. I’ve asked people to hangout in the past and I’ve been shrugged off by everyone. He was the only person I hangout with now. And I heard today they’re hitting it off great. Again I’m happy for him. But I’m tired of the pressure of everyone asking me about a girlfriend. Every time we go out to eat my mother always embarrasses me in front of the waitresses. It’s getting old. I’ve come to the fact that I’ll be alone forever. That’s fine too. But it gets depressing. Am I the only one?,2,depression

Its been a battle to disconnect from Google; it simply is not practical; and it is extremely difficult to stop downright cancerous growth off the storage consumed by applications

I open up my junk drawer tonight and , underneath it all I discovered my old cracked up Samsung phone

I wonder to myself, is this thing really off you know like! Absolutely dead. 

So I press the power button and the screen lights up. You cant see any thing except neon stripes, I'll just throw it in some water and that will do the trick. Right? To my horror the device will not stop despite being underwater with a cracked screen for several minutes.

Okay so Ill just open it up and take the battery out,. I Proceed to it pry it open with a screw driver, glass getting everywhere in my hands and on the floor.

Here comes the fun;.

I pry the battery out with a screwdriver and it fucking catches on fire. It' started glowing bright red so I threw back in the water and it continues to burn and melt the plastic pitcher the water was in so I run a flaming plastic fireball out the back door and plop it on the balcony , shut the door, and get my handy "" organic vapor blocking respirator"" because the smell of the fumes is ridiculously noxious.  Now i know what  lithium ion batteries are how they work, and that they are quite dangerous, so I'm not really that shocked....

What really gets me is , when I scrub the search index for "" removed my cellphone battery and it caught fire"" All I get is some consumer advisory saying, ""it's dangerous to try and replace the battery yourself"", ""No you cant change the battery on your iPhone yourself"" ""it's a way to make sure you have to upgrade"" "" Your better off just to get a new phone"" ""Woman leaves phone on charger and it explodes"" exploding cellphones are dangerous""

Just because the screen is blank, there's no way to know that phone isnt active unless the battery is disconnected and the phone is totally disassembled and destroyed.


What gets me reeling is that I cannot find one single peice of data where someone wanted to simply, disconnect the battery and throw the whole thing in the trash. Why is no else  one questioning all these millions of dead phones  ( The phone doesn't need a screen to do anything,  the screen is merely for humans to interface with)  that nobody seems concerned about. these devices are permanent,  there's a permanent record of me on that thing and I hate because it causes malfunctions, and makes my device harder to use, I have to do  daily maintenance to keep the device working correctly, it causes stress, etc etc etc, its like having a Corvette that only can go 40mph.. it's stupid!!! What a waste of time.... 

Why is it seemingly inconceivable that I wanted to just disconnect the battery and throw the shit away. I don't care at all If I damage or not. I want the thing to turn OFF ;and it won't, I just want security and peace of mind!!  

It tried to kill me!! It tried to burn me and my apartment down to the ground, it cut my hands, and THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE ALL HERE!!! JESUS CHRIST WHAT THE FUCK!!?? THE AUTHORITIES ARE ARE ASKING ME QUESTIONS?!?!?NOW EVERYONE REALLY IS LOOKING AT ME.... I I just wanted to take the battery out of my old discarded phone,  and throw it away,. It's like im in trouble or something

All this does is reinforce the thought system of my extremely paranoid personality,   I want to destroy more phones,  THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY ACTIONS CONFIRM THAT WHAT I AM THINKING IS 100% TRUE

.. damn guys, please, I hope someone gets this message

""TLDR :  I FOUND AND DESTROYED THE SURVEILLANCE DEVICE AND NOW I AM  IN SERIOUS TROUBLE, THE AUTHORITIES ARRIVED AND.INVESTIGATED IMMEDIATELY""

"I underwent a miniature diagnostic process for autism a few weeks ago with my therapist. I got a 6/10, which is just on the threshold that qualifies me for a full follow-up, potentially leading to a diagnosis. I had a previous therapist indicate that I could be on the spectrum as well.

But, frankly, I'm dying to know the answer. I live in the UK and with the current state of healthcare it could take months for me to find out. But, I feel like I've already kind of accepted my diagnosis before getting it, which feels foolish. But something about it feels so right, I don't know. Even the few people I have in my life seem to think it's highly plausible that I could be.

I don't know what I should be feeling, but I'm already feeling a strange sense of relief. Like even if I am not autistic, it feels like I'm a step closer to understanding myself and why I am the way I am. It feels like a very important question that's going to be unanswered for a large amount of time.

I used to be happy when I was a kid, but as I grew older everything started to seem so pointless. I started hating everything and everyone. Now I'm not so hateful like then, but the deep sadness is still with me. I used to be afraid of death, but now it's what I think about the most, my own death.

Me and my family changed states, we live closer to our relatives, I have a job close to my home, I now have a dog that I love, my first dog ever. I do love my family and we get along. But I can't ever feel satisfied, I'm on medication for anxiety and depression, which in the start of treatment they helped, but now after a bit more than a year I feel like I'm not on meds at all.

I'm always thinking that I should try exercising, studying something to maybe get a better job in the future, but I can never bring myself to make these changes, it's just so pointless. I struggle with suicide thoughts almost everyday, if something goes wrong at work or at home I feel terrible and just give up for the day.

I've been wanting to give up on this job for a long time now (I've been working there for 3 years), but I know that I won't find a better job still close to home and with an OK pay like I have now, I only finished high school and did a few short term courses so I could start working, and my bosses have been very patient with me, even though I'm as slow as a slug, I wish they would fire me already but I don't think they will. I work with heavy machinery, and I have already hurt myself on purpose once there, but what I actually want is to just crush my head in that machine for once and never have to wake up again.

You know, I just wish I could endure life, because in the future my parents and my brother who is disabled may need my help. But after they're gone, after I've served my purpose on this planet, I will finally have the guts to kill myself and truly rest. The only thing keeping me from ending it now is my family.

Met my husband when I was 18, married at 19, and have loved him like no ones business since then... but if I could I would go back and not have married him. I wouldn't have been in the state I'm in right now because of my family. I would have done things and been across the world right now if I went on a different path. 
I don't want to be labeled with anything so I've tried therapy a couple of times and make sure I don't share too much because of my past family trauma and my sister's diagnosis' of bipolar and anxiety and my mom's depression and dads and such I know I have depression but I don't want the label. 
I get waves of BAD depression every now and then and I just want to die... I hate my life, I want to be alone, I want to leave my husband, I want to just ghost everyone and disappear and die.

"Some background: from about 10-13, my night would go like this. I'd fall asleep at 10pmish and wake up at about 2-3am. Things that wanted to hurt me, I thought, would come through my window and door, so I'd spend whole nights feeling watched by them, checking the window and then the door, before breaking eventually, dashing across the hallway to my parents and saying I had a bad dream (usually had).

Now for the current issue:

- Last night I had an episode like this for the first time in ages - something was watching me wherever I turned, plotting to harm me. My suicide note, from an abandoned one earlier that day, turned up next to me but I'm certain I didn't put in my bed! I only felt safe under the covers.

- On zoom calls, I never believe the camera is off, even when everything indicates it is and will often turn the device away from me. 

- I get the feeling my phone is listening to me - that I'm either still on the phone and people didn't hang up to listen to me or somehow I've been connected without knowing, and have to check the call history all the time. I talk to myself to work through things but don't want people to hear them. I get this feeling only alone.

"I’m 23 and if it wasn’t for the weight of leaving my family in pain I would have already killed myself.
I’ve gone to therapy for the past couple of years, tried some courses to deal with emotions and currently being followed by a professional.
I feel like I make no progress, every time I think I’m doing okay I dwell once again in desperation. I cannot create genuine boundaries with people, feel very alone and unattractive. I got a very creative brain and interest in many things but act on nothing because overwhelmed by every feeling and fear. I feel constantly paralysed and unable to change my situation.
I wake up, if I got the energy hand some cv around, mostly for job I don ‘t really want, I don’t actually know what I want.
Sometimes I think I should start an university course that excites me and persue my creative attitude learning building, making and engineering but terrified by the commitment, I’m not good with mathematical disciplines. 
I actually want to leave and try to get better at something, but at the end of every day I find myself very disappointed and unsatisfied with myself, incapable of everything.
I ‘m terrified of living, terrified by solitude, I have no one to share my interests with, no stimuli, no excitement I can act on.",2,depression

"I’ve never been diagnosed with depression but around 6 years ago I developed an eating disorder. Pretty much package deal with feeling crappy all the time. A couple years ago I went into recovery. The past 5-6 years I’ve had multiple periods where I feel utterly insane. For no reason at all I feel sad, mad, irritated, hungry, not hungry at all, can’t sleep, sleep all day, hate everything etc. And some periods I feel fine and dandy. 

My coping mechanisms usually were either starving myself or ranting to Internet friends. Now I have neither. I have a lovely partner who I love and trust but I can’t open up to about how I feel as I barely understand myself. I just don’t know what to do with myself. I feel ruined every time I enter these stages.",2,depression

"Hey there,

I don't even know where to start. My life took a big nosedive ever since 2020 (not because of covid-19).
Reason was that my father, who lived one house further did terrorize me and my mom. He was screaming, hit the windows at like 2:00 or 3:00 AM in the morning and even broke one of our windows and stole some stuff from our house, insulted me and my mom heavily and even damaged both of our cars slightly.
He began drinking again at the end of 2019. Basically this stuff was ongoing for like a year. We did sue him many times and we called the police nearly everyday. But they couldn't do anything because when they came he behaved normally. It's hard to explain the details tbh.
From this point ongoing I was getting even more depressed than I have already been. I performed badly in school, bad at work and all because I had so many sleepless nights without any hope.

Then we moved out of our home where I've grown up at the start of 2021. Surely the situation was getting better because my dad couldn't find us anymore and we had peace. But the more time has passed the more I realized that I didn't heal. 

Before I was a rather emotional kind of person. I could feel empathy for people around me. I could feel fear, sadness, happiness and I were able to listen carefully when people where talking to me and I could remember most things.
Now I think im such a mess. Anything from the above I can't do anymore. It's like I'm another person and rarely it feels scary. But to be honest I don't care anymore about anything in my life. 

I have a girlfriend I am dating nearly 5 years now. The first two years everything went amazing and I truly enjoy my time with her. She helped me alot and I am more than grateful for her. But ever since my trauma starting from 2020 to 2021 I behaved like another person, which she told me aswell. I don't know how to communicate anymore. Everytime she wants to talk about our relationship and how to save it etc. my mind is just blank. I can't think of anything and how to even sort things out. She is mad at me and tells me that she's tired to come to me to sort things out. I should be coming to her now. But I just never know what to say.
I think I even became kind of unable to relate. I don't feel anything like love or attachment anymore. Not only for my gf. Just with nobody (same as my family). So it's hard for me to even figure out how to fight for this relationship.

My life is so meaningless to me everyday I search up for ""quickest"" methods to suicide. But fuck me I seem to be too scared to finally do hang myself or something.
I don't deserve to be here anymore and I'm sure everyone would be happier if I would die already.

If it wasn't enough I am addicted to masturbation and nail biting alot. Especially the part about masturbation fucks me up mentally since I do waste hours on it every other day. And my pervertions go to a level where it isn't considered normal aswell.

Just wanted to write my thoughs out which are killing me inside.
Fuck me. I should really rod in hell.",2,depression

Its like I can do the neccesary to survive, which I understand is a blessing. But dear god is it psychologically intensive. Ill spend more time deciding what do to do with what is left of my precious attention. Or start doing something, not get any sort of satisfaction from it, and then just stop.

"It's basically the title. I simply can't study without having a panic attack, i can't focus on reading a book, i never finish personal projects, and i am just always super demotivated. I went to a doctor last year and went through a lot of tests, and it turns out i don't have ADHD, but i have anxiety. My doctor said that i have almost all of ADHD symptoms but some key things are missing, like some points on memory or something like that, so she can't give me an ADHD diagnostic. I have been taking SSRIs for a month a half now and it honestly  only made things worse.
The only time i don't feel bad is when for some reason i get extremely happy with something, like some time ago when i moved to a better house. I felt like a superhero, like i could do anything i wanted and all that i had to do was have the courage to do it, and then 1 month later i was back laying on my bed and waiting for the day to end. It's tough guys :/

TL;DR: I don't have an ADHD diagnostic, i take SSRIs, and the only time i am productive is when i am super happy.",3,adhd

"So I’m in the psych ward now, I stopped clozapine cold turkey and felt so shit I ended up coming here. Basically it’s been a month and my positive symptoms haven’t come back. The doctors who’ve known me 2 weeks are basically saying I’m just depressed and never was schizo. I know diagnoses aren’t everything but it took me 6 months from when I was first hospitalised while psychotic (4years ago) til I was sane enough to accept I was schizo instead of just psychic and spiritually gifted. Since then it’s all made sense, I’ve had every symptom and I relate so much to every post on here. I just feel like it’s so not fair that doctors that didn’t know me when I was psychotic are telling me I never was . Like I went through hell while psychotic. They’re now refusing to give me meds bc they don’t know what I have , pretty sure they just think I’m depressed. Which I am because I feel so shit about them acting like they know what’s wrong with me better than my doctors of 4 years. Also they’ll take me off disability if I’m ‘just’ depressed.

"So for a while now, whenever it's bedtime and I lay down to sleep, my mind kinda starts to panic and basically develops a mind of its own.

It stops happening if I start doing something like I'm writing this post now but eventually you have to stop doing anything to fall asleep.

At this point, I just know that as soon as I'm gonna hit the bed, this is going to be waiting for me. The mental torture I have to go through is something that I can't even begin to describe. Not just due to this thinking, but also because I'm so tired physically and I just have to go through this till my body gives up, which can be a few hours and sometimes takes till the morning.

So I just hate/fear the night now and I just don't wanna lay down and stop doing anything, till my body allows me to, but I still try as I have this slight hope that I might be able to avoid it today if I dont think about it. 

Honestly, I don't know. Idk whether I cause it myself by thinking that it's gonna happen or this is just how it is now?

I have trouble at sleeping again, at eating.
I thought I was mostly out of it but I'm not, I was never out. Just because I had few weeks okayish I thought I was good again.
It's been three years like this, the idea of keep living this way makes me lose my mind.
I'm soon starting my master degree but I don't even care, I'm sure I'll just have lot of problems and I'm too stupid to continue in my field. I'm mediocre at everything.
I'm struggling to concentrate even just to watch a movie, let alone studying.
Suicidal thoughts are back and stronger than ever and I'm alone, I just have my boyfriend who doesn't care that much about me and I have almost no friends.
Almost nobody would miss me.
A few months ago my boyfriend's friend (he was my friend too even if not super super close) took his own lives leaving all of us so shocked, we all loved him so much, he had a girlfriend who clearly loved him and a wonderful family.
I feel so bad to be still alive while he's not here anymore, he still has so many people that care about him. 
I just keep thinking that maybe if I had offed myself before, maybe just maybe he wouldn't have done the same. I don't know why I keep thinking this. Maybe if I hadn't been invested so much in my own depression I would have noticed his.

"Since the end of the school semester my anxiety has been getting worse at night. Probably because I’m less busy and not much is on my mind.

I’m losing sleep and getting headaches from it. 

I’m a 20F living in a student living apartment complex and it is a busier street. But the apartment has a deadbolt, my bedroom has a deadbolt, and we put a security door stopper under the front door handle. I know that I’m safe, but I cannot stop the anxiety.

"I get extremely paranoid about the people around me having an issue with me.

Should I feel guilty about this?",5,paranoia

Am I talking to someone I just met? He's better than me. My girlfriend is talking to another person we just knew? He's better than me and in this case he might potentially ""steal"" her from me.
When I feel this is happening and I'm in a group, i often isolate myself by using my phone or doing whatever.
When I start feeling useless and uninteresting, I become a passive piece of the wallpaper.

I have been seeing the same number constantly for a long stretch of months. I try to calm myself down by telling myself it's just a coincidence but I know its not a coincidence anymore. I believe in angel numbers. im too scared to type out the number because I feel like I might manifest it or someone I know will realize its me, but basically its two digits and I see it-- EVERYWHERE. it is not a coincidence, I understand I should rationalize it but I know that what I am experiencing is not a coincidence, it is real. I'll use XX to represent the number. I check my phone at the same increments of time-- 10:XX, 8:XX, 3:XX, a lot of times in order too, 5:XX, 6:XX, 7:XX, 8:XX, EVERY HOUR IN A ROW like that, and im not on my phone checking the time either, ill go downstairs, come back up and bam, 8:XX. my mom will say ""hey can u tell me what time it is,"" I check, its 4:XX. this is just the tip of the ice berg. ive recently started to get a sixth sense like sensation when im around the number. ill get a hunch, a feeling or sensation like ""If I look behind this paper theres going to be XX on it"" and there it will be, I get a feeling ""somethings telling me XX is to the left of my screen, I look and the video im watching was uploading jan XX or whatever, this is not a ""once a day"" type thing either mind you, this is constantly. CONSTANTLY. as in this number thing has taken over my life, essentially. im afraid that the XX is warning me of an approaching death, because I try to keep track of what I am thinking of or what the XX is next to when I see it and the signs are pointing to either me or my family member/members dying. I went on a YouTube live stream of my favorite tarot reader and asked her to clarify what XX meant. she said its going to be a massive change, ""like a door slamming."" this sounds very frightening, not the change part, but the door slamming part. that can't. be good. I pause a video. its landed on XX. I randomly get a feeling to search a celebs birthday, because somethings telling me they were born on XX, I search and they're born on that day. all of these little details are happening to me day in and day out. im aware it sounds crazy and I hate it because its literally driving me crazy. trust me, I literally try to rationalize with myself ""just ignore it, you're probably looking for it now and now you're gonna notice it more."" I search my problem on google--- ""paranoia about a number that I keep seeing"" the post I click on, the person lists their age and its XX and then... to my ABSOLUTE dismay and horror... I go to the comments and there are XX COMMENTS....... I wish I was making this up, but im not, and because of things like this, no one can convince me this is all just one big coincidence. what's worse is I tell myself ""if I see XX within the next minute, it means \*insert bad thing, like someone I know or me Is going to die\*"" and then within the minute ill see XX, or like today I was interacting with a loved one and they go ""look, its XX!"" and point to a box that MYSTERIOUSLY has the number XX printed GIGANTICALLY on its label, instead of literally any other number??? so then im like shit, if they're pointing it out, it must pertain to them... and my astrology chart said this next year there might be a car accident and that loved one has to go somewhere they've never been before tomorrow and im so scared im just so scared. I feel like something really bad is gonna happen. and I know the way ive typed this out all ramble-y makes me sound neurotic, I just hope y'all believe im self aware of that LMFAO... please, theres no WAY this can be a coincidence, I didn't even reach the tip of the iceberg of all the times I see XX and sense its presence, Is this is a spiritual thing or am I paranoid, please help and thank you SO, so much

edit: fuck me, right as ive posted this, my brain went ""something tells me ur gonna check the clock and its gonna be 11:XX"" I GO AND CHECK AND IT LITERALLY IS 11:XX PLEASE HELP ME I JUST TALKED TO MY LOVED ONE TOO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE OF THIS?

I've been applying to every job listing that I see have been relevant to my previous line of work, but the response time from companies is so agonizing. I don't know if they'll contact me back, let alone give me a chance at an interview. I can manage to get by for another 2 months from savings and I honestly don't know if I'll get anywhere before my savings run dry.

My biggest issue with anxiety at this moment is my inability to sleep and wake up peacefully. For these past two weeks, I've been heading to bed with a giant pit in my stomach and it haunts me to the point where I can't sleep. When I do sleep, it'd be from pure exhaustion of trying to fight the sense of doom. Even still, I would only sleep for 1 to 3 hours at a time. I'd wake up with the pit in my stomach feeling like it became a giant crater. I'd wake up sweating and frantically trying to seek the presence of others because I feel so alone. Often times no one else is home and my friends are still asleep, there's no one for me to cry to. I'm fairly new to feeling like this, is this what it's like to have a panic attack? It feels so terrible and it puts me on edge every morning.

This is certainly putting a strain on my friends and relationships. I've cried to them so many times already and I feel like at some point, everyone will understandably become tired of me and I'll lose my line of support. I don't know what to do. If anyone out there can share a piece of their story on how they overcame this terrible time, or how they're coping, please talk to me. I don't know what to do about this pit in my stomach and I just want to be able to sleep again.

EDIT: To clear the air, I am not asking/begging for money. I would just like some advice on how to overcome this and to hear everyone's story. I appreciate those who have made it this far into the post.",4,anxiety

"I need advice. I;m 24, never worked (because I would quit after a day or two). I have debilitating anxiety and depression, which has worsened over the past year ish?? I've been to a psychiatrist, horrible experience never went back. I'm currently in therapy trying to work this out. With all that being said, I started a new job last week and I feel like its making me worse. It's not the people or the job itself, it's just me. And idk what to do. I want to work, but I feel like I just can't. I get so anxious I get sick, I cry everyday before and after work and I only work part time 5 days a week. What do I do?

"Life is 90% of the time a haze of confusion, fear, and paranoia. Then when my mind is somewhat clear I look back at life and feel nothing but existential dread knowing this is just how things are and I can't really do anything about it. I can see myself getting worse, but what am I supposed to do? 

They say ""get help"", I have tried this. I did exactly what I was told, and I can say beyond any reasonable doubt that ""help"" made everything worse. 

Go to the doctors, get locked up and dehumanized and abused for a week or two, beg the doctor every time you seem him to let you out of there as this is a horrible place to be, eventually get let out and despite the meds they put you on be notably more depressed, reclusive, and psychotic to the point that you try to game end yourself and end right back up in there bc you can't do a single thing right. 5 times. 

When I think about it, I'd rather do anything than go back into those hospitals. I used to sit down and pet my dog and that would always calm me down alot, but he's gone now and everything feels hopeless but I think it was always hopeless.

He has screwed all windows in his house shut, boarded up rooms with pad locks so nobody can go “through his stuff” believes his Iphone is hacked, his internet, people are “under neath his house” he wants it all to end.. 

He sold his house in one state and moved from one state to another and claims it is all happening still happening and that “they” followed him over 2k miles away.. like what in the hell?

"Hello everyone, I deal with dissociation. i can’t go to a therapist. Lately I have been feeling very out of body. I do stuff everyday but I feel like I’m not even doing them. I feel so numb. It’s pointless living like this. Even If I do something that makes me happy, I still feel so numb and I can’t feel anything like I used to before . I sometimes look at people enjoying their life and I ask myself, why can’t I be normal? I am just surviving. My memory has become so bad lately, sometimes I mess up my words because I feel so out of body and I am so inside my head.My dissociation is actually not THAT bad, I have heard some worse scenarios but I am just scared. I am just so pessimistic. I think about the future and I ask myself Do I even have a future? What if I go crazy?

"It baffles me how people manage to say “I enjoy doing this thing so I do it”. I know I obviously don’t feel that because of depression, but I even see people with depression talking about how doing their hobbies helps. How do you motivate yourself to do things? 

I can’t even begin to make myself do the things I used to enjoy and haven’t done for years. They are still things I have an interest in and would like to do. I don’t know how to describe it, I just can’t. I just have no drive to even try. I’m 32 and have had a depression diagnosis for 21 years. The last year has been a real drop in being able to do things I used to enjoy though they’ve been had for 3-4 years overall.",2,depression
"It's been ten years and nothing has changed. My parents were horrible to me. Abused me when I was a kid and they still gaslight me about it and put down everything I do. They sabotage me but I also self sabotage. A lot of it is also on me but I feel as if everything is against me too. I've worked but it's horrible out here. Even people making a livable wage have a list of grievances. I'm down here at the bottom being underpaid, getting in trouble for using the bathroom, not being able to take meal breaks. I've had a job where the boss was engaged in some illegal activities and I had to leave as quick as I could. I'm just that unlucky.
But Ive also accomplished nothing and have nothing. I just feel horrible everyday. There's so many that can power through it and make it on their own while i envy and live with my abusers at almost 30 years old. I dont have much hope. I wish someone can kill me before I do it myself",2,depression

I was mean to my mother today, she makes me so angry. She tries to be nice but i cant help but hate her so much. She treated me like shit my whole life. Always favoring my brother over me. Now he's traveling while my dad bank rolls him with no responsibilities whatsoever and has a videography thing on Instagram that's really taking off. It pisses me off that i was forced to join the military. It pisses me off that my brother steals my interests and is immediately better at it than me. I've been to therapy for the past year and a half. Taken anti depressants, i was working out and eating healthy for the longest. I just feel empty inside. I might be a narcissist. I want everything given to me all the time without working for it and i don't care about anyone else's issues. I hate that i have to work a job. I feel so restricted by life even though I have all the opportunity in the world right now. I don't feel like doing anything. I only receive validation from women. I know all the things I hate to work on but i don't want to work on it because why should I have to change? Why am I the problem? Why can't I just be happy?  I like being depressed. The suffering gives me an identity. I've made my suffering an identity. If i can't do whatever i want then why do anything at all?

"My wife has depression and I'm always trying to learn and support anyway I can. A common issue we run into is that she can let very minor things totally de-rail her day. For example if I was to say ""yeah we can do that"" vs. "" yeah I'd love to do that"" she will overthink the sentence and take it as I'm only doing the activity because she asked and I'm not actually happy to be doing it which could lead to her thoughts and mood to spiral. The only thing I've seen work so far as a solution is to just talk out whatever the situation was about and give her space until she can bounce back and then she'll come to me when she's over it. This solution is ok but depending on the bounce back time can take 20 mins or sometimes up to 24hrs for something bigger. Is there anything I can do that's more preventative instead of reactionary to this situation? Or is this just a normal symptom of depression I need to be patient and sympathetic for?

"That's literally my entire life. I'm so miserable all the time and I hate everything about my awful life, but I just can't manage to make myself change anything. I'm helplessly addicted to video games, they're the only way I can distract myself from how awful everything is around me, and I need them to help regulate my emotions. But, sometimes, I get so miserable that I can't even manage to sit in my chair and play video games, so I just lay in bed for hours. I already sleep over 12 hours a night every night, but I spend at least an hour or two in bed throughout the day, as well. Sometimes even longer.

I'm in awful shape and I don't really take care of myself well. My diet is garbage, too. I mostly eat beef jerky and granola bars because there's never any food in my house (I live with family and they just don't give a shit about me). I know I'd feel better if I was in better shape but I just can't force myself to exercise, or do anything.

"Lately my relashionship couple has become the mirror of all my personal failures. Less athletic, I struggle to find the motivation to take care of myself. I am less desirable physically and I feel less wanted. The biggest black spot being my financial problems, with a rent that I struggle to pay every month, which puts my girlfriend in a quite unfair and perilous position of offering us 90% of all our shared moments. I still don't have my driving license, and I snore when sleeping, which has become a totally unmanageable problem lately, first for my girlfriend who has a very light sleep and who can't sleep, and then for me. Usually I change the room to sleep somewhere else when we sleep at my girlfriend's place but it's impossible at my place having only one living room. I am very unhappy to snore. I miss some of my friends that are far from me (other countries) and it's make me feel sad and lonely, even though we share a lot through messages. I feel that I can't recharge socially to be able to boost myself on the work side. On a professional level, I often feel put aside by some of my working mates who keep me away from certain projects, probably because I am a bit too critical and I bring them more problems than solutions. I don't turn in my work on time, I can't find the energy to finish a task quickly and I often forget to call a client back or to give them news. I feel stuck in every aspect of my life.

"When I took my exam to get my driver's license (early 90s), they were using computers for the first time so software and graphics were primitive. The passing score was 18 out of 24 and after every question, the system would tell you if you answered correctly or not.

Question 1, good answer. Question 2, good answer, Question 3... 4... 5... 10... 15... Question 17, good answer, all good answers. I come to question 18 and I know if I get this one right, I'm home free. I answer, hit enter, good answer!

As it was programmed with proper manners, the system would inform me that I have enough correct answers and that the test was done. Congratulations, you passed.

I go to the counter, get the paper copy of my results :

**Result : 18/24 - PASS**

I went back to the counter arguing that this was wrong. That I did not get 18/24, I got 18/18 and the paper should reflect that. ""Why do you care? You passed. It doesn't matter"". ""It DOES matter because 18/18 means I absolutely nailed the exam because I was prepared. 18/24 means I barely passed and one more wrong answer and I would have failed. There is a HUGE difference"".

They couldn't change the paper of course, and my parents never believed me when I told them the computer stopped at 18 because I had a perfect score up to that point.

So if you were a programmer in the late 80s, early 90s and you programmed the software for driver tests in Quebec at the SAAQ, know that your shitty code changed the course of my life.

"I have been working in Sales for coming up to 10 years now. During that time i have struggled with Social Anxiety and Imposter Syndrome to varying degrees. At its best, i can just about manage to control it, at its worst it severely impacts my ability to articulate myself, communicate with colleagues/customers and focus on what i need to get done in any given day (I procrastinate a lot through the overwhelming feelings of the tasks at hand). I foolishly believed at certain milestones in my life/career that i would reach a point where my anxiety would dissipate but this is yet to happen for me. 

I am at an Industry event tomorrow where there will be lots of my current colleagues, people i know from other companies in the industry and of course prospective customers. 

My anxiety is playing havoc at the thought of this as i hate the expectation to ‘perform’ that these events bring. I feel like i am not good at small talk or that people won’t want to listen to what i have to say. I overthink what i want to say (i almost always play conversations out in my head) and think that the people who do speak to me are judging me and end up inevitably losing interest.

Having said all of the above, i am trying to get better at managing these feelings of anxiety and reframing my perception of them (It won’t be the end of the world, if i f**k up, will it?) to try and control it to the point where i can get by. 

Any words of advice/encouragement ahead of tomorrow to help me through?",4,anxiety
"Hi there. I've been experiencing extreme anxiety, despite medication, in the fact that I constantly feel scared/paranoid about making others uncomfortable or acting weird around others or just generally saying something weird around my friends or coworkers, online friends or anything really. 

OCD doesn't make it any better, because I tend to obsess over these thoughts and seek reassurance by asking 

•""Hey um, are you ok?""
•""Hey just an odd question but have I ever done anything to make you uncomfortable?""
•""Hey um have I ever done anything to annoy you or maybe bothered you at some point?""
•""Hey we're cool right? Just asking""

It's suffocating at times because I constantly feel afraid of doing something wrong or accidentally saying something off or making someone feel weird around me and I try to correct it at any moment, it's getting to the point where I just feel paranoid of others feeling like there's something wrong or off with me, especially when they seem tired or preoccupied, and part of me knows ""hey they might be tired or just worried about something else it's probably not me"" but that feeling of doing something wrong or making them think badly of me or think I'm weird or uncomfortable is so overwhelming and I guess I'm wondering if anyone else ever feels that lingering paranoia and it's just

I dunno, even feeling this way and asking them to make sure just makes me wonder if I look even worse or weirder or even suspicious or like I'm hiding something and it starts to delve into a spiral of ""what if they think I'm some weirdo?""

I feel fundamentally broken to the point where I can't ever be ""normal"". I don't even have a bad life really. I don't have friends, but I have a girlfriend, and a job I don't hate that pays okay. 

I just don't feel *anything*. I don't know what I'm thinking most of the time. Nothing makes me happy, or sad, or even really mad, and I'm constantly in a fog. I don't feel alive, just that I exist.

"So first off; I'm Self-Diagnosed Autistic, and actually diagnosed ADHD.  
I work at a local supermarket chain (I won't say the name of the company or what state I live in) and it prides itself on being an equal opportunity employer; which is certainly the case - been here for 9+ years and I've seen a wide variety of people come, go, move up or just happily stay in one position (I'm the last one) I'm just a bagger - lowest rung on the ladder; although I am treated as a sort of unofficial manager of the parking lot since I've been here so long, I'm reliable, and I'm firm enough and have decent enough social skills to train and keep an eye on the teenagers outside. But I have no real true authority - nor do I want it.  
We have a variety of people with different conditions; ADHD, Downs Syndrom, having a prosthetic leg, autistic, and people of varying ages from 14 year olds to people in there 60's-70's.  


So, I have one particular coworker who's been here for about 5-ish years. He's Autistic and has depression. He's also approximately my age; I'm 32, he's 31. I used to consider him a friend - we never hung outside work. But we have talked often, we share similar interests, and we were both art students at different points in our lives, ect. I honestly get how he thinks for the most part, and I see a lot of myself in him - athough; a younger version of myself. The way he thinks reminds me A LOT of myself when I was in my early to mid 20's in all the wrong ways. Claiming and thinking he's a noble white knight when he's really a hypocrite. Being very socially awkward. Over-correcting other people's behavior (he used to be a talle-tale early on)  
And the most frustrating of all to me; using his Autism diagnosis as a sort of shield when he does something wrong. He constantly late to work. He'll sneak off and hide out on his phone for long periods. He'd take advantage of other people's kindness or oversights. When he's confronted when he does something wrong; first thing out of his mouth is excuses. When he DOES apologize; it's half-hearted because he'll often go right around and do it again. Hell, a few months ago he tried hitting on another coworker who was 19 at the time. (it was a few weeks away from his 31'st birthday at the time) She told me how creeped out she was by that.  


The other frustrating element is that managment seems totally unwilling to do SOMETHING about his behavior. They just don't even bother reprimanding him at all. The Assistant Managers might say something about him being really late, but actual managment won't really do ANYTHING.  
I've tried talking to several of the managers for my department about being firm with him if they actually want him to actually do his job. But many of them behave that because he's Autistic he's TOTALLY incapable of his behavior being corrected. One HEAVILY IMPLIED that he thought he was too dumb to learn. When I KNOW DAMNED WELL that it DOES work because we had a manager 3 years ago who DID do something about his behavior and actually punished him by taking away his phone except when he went on break, and he had to stay in the checkout department; he couldn't work outside in the parking lot for several months. And it WORKED! His performance and attitude did improve back to a respectable level. He was no longer late, he didn't slack off or take the easy way out. And he stayed like this for more almost 2 years.  
But last year his performance and behavior was slipping right back to where he was right before he was at his worst.  
Honestly, I think if this company wasn't so forgiving, he would have been fired A LOOOOONG time ago. And I've even told him that since he told me he's going to be moving out of state later this year, and was going to be forced to live on his own.  


I've vented to other friends of mine; many of them being Neurodivergent in various ways. ADHD, Autism, ect. And they all side with me that my coworker is a spoiled brat in a grown man's body.  
But still, I wonder if I'm just being too harsh and/or that my standards are just too high. That I should just let it go - but it's difficult to do so when I've been working very closely with him for 5+ years. I DID consider him a friend for most of that time, but I had to put my foot down when he made more fake promises that he would do better. To me; it was a breach of trust and faith that he'd just take advantage of me many, MANY TIMES when I've been kind, understanding, forgiving despite me being firm with him when he's fucked up.  


Still, I feel like I'm being a total asshole because I can't/won't let it go. Sometimes I think maybe I'm just not understanding enough. That perhaps I should lighten up. That perhaps that me being only self-diagnosed autistic makes my judgement of his crappy behavior invalid. I don't think I have clinical depression, so maybe I'm just just not understanding him there.

"I just wanted to share my thoughts about a mater.

So I have for some time suspected that my brother might be autistic but I have never said anything untill recently when I told my mom. 

She later brought it up whit one of his teachers but she said that he didn't have autism and just imitaded me because he sees how our parents treat me. (Probably refering to my meltdowns)

The thing is, most of the reasons I suspected he was autistic is other things, for exampel 

• He has special intrests that he always talk about and he plans his free time around it and gets uppset when he can't prusue it.

• He always want to know exact times when stuff is happening.

• He also is wery precise with how mutch money he has left of his weekly allowance he has left after buying candy. (We get our allowance on saturday and tend to buy our candy before we get the monetära so we only get what is left after we have bought it.)

The point is I see where his teacher is coming from but there are somethings that I don't see how he would imitate from me. (For example his special intrests is formula one while mine is books and cultures.)

"It wasn't supposed to, but it's kind of a rant.

 I've just been feeling kinda..weird, lately. If I'm not actively crying\\having an almost anxiety attack\\feeling an overwhelming sense of uselessness, I can't say for sure what I'm feeling. 

I'm in college since 2021; since i started I've felt useless\\incompetent\\stupid in at least one subject. That's fine, i guess; I assume everyone deals with something like this. But this semester is especially bad. Even in subjects that I supposedly already have some knowledge on, I just fuck something up and can't keep the assignments on time. And even before I fuck something up or even star something, I just think, ""let's see how long this lasts until it derails completely"". I don't feel like doing anything other than lay in my  bed or watch something random on youtube, thus making everything harder for myself.

In general, I have some difficulty taking showers (I like being clean, but the whole process of taking a shower really tires me out), but it's never been as hard as it was these last few weeks. Doing anything,  washing the dishes or cooking an egg, made me feel like crying. I have\\had group assignments where I'm not doing much, I know that, I've apologized to my friends that are doing them with me, but most of the time I just can't **make myself do it.** Since being diagnosed and getting on meds (Ritalin), I've been ok at forcing myself to do things, but it just hasn't been working lately.

I just have this sense of failing in every aspect of my life (college, living alone, managing relationships, having any ability to get a job, even as trainee...) and it's tiring, for me and for the people around me. My boyfriend thinks I'm depressed; i disagree. I think it's me being generally bad at being a member of society, mixed with having a period that usually messes deeply with my mood (it's supposed to come this week, that's why I'm wondering if the last shitshow week could be a result of it, but it's usually not that bad). 

Some things in my personal life also messed with my emotional, so yeah, it's been...a month. I'm just wondering if it's deppression, my innability to do things, hormones, a mix of some, a mix of all.... Tired, that's something I know I feel most of the time.

Next month I'll look for a therapist that my ensurance covers. I'm not doing it for me though; if I waited until I felt like going to a therapist for me, I just wouldn't go. I don't like the ideia of just talking about personal things to a stranger (yes, i realise the irony of posting something like this online, but I can't see you, you can't see me, so it's easier and less likely for me to get embarassed and shut down), it doesn't exactly makes sense the whole process of it, to me. Even more so after i tried therapy before, and the therapist complained to my parents I wasn't opening up fast enough after six months. 

So I'll do it for my parents, for my boyfriend and friends; for the people I fear hurting because of the way I feel about myself.

"TW ⚠️: mention of c*tting

I’m 17 and I’ve always suffered from low mood I have it where I’m in a really dark place for months/years at a time . It started when I was 12 I c*t myself when I was 12 . It makes me sad to think that , when I was 14 I got over it and  was sooo happy living the dream and now I’m 17 and about 7-8 months ago it has came back . I thought it had gone for good but no . I actually cant do this I never ever ever feel happy I had to quit my job drip out of school because I couldn’t mentally do it . And I’m wondering if depression will ever go I try sooo hard to ignore my thoughts but the more I push them away the stronger and louder they become.

I wish I were normal. I don’t find pleasure in anything like I used to and everything is just torture even seeing my friends is a chore I only do it for them because I do love them but I would rather sit in my room and rot . 

I’m literally a kid I need to get out of this ‘phase’ I want to be like everyone else . I want to be happy and see everyone but I can’t . 

Recently in like October I c*t and when I looked at it it made me so sad because I hadn’t done it sinse I were 12 and it reminded me of being a kid and not knowing why I hate myself so much . That made me stop c*tying for good . Ovc I get voices telling me too but I can’t do it again .

Sorry for rant it’s a bit embarrassing because I don’t talk like this to anyone irl . And sorry if some bits don’t make sense I’m really dyslexic.

But yeah does anyone actually get better and does it go for good?",2,depression

" 

We  have a friend that always asks questions but never talks about himself.  He is 40 years old. Once I met him after job he asked me: did you go  somewhere in Saturday night? I replied that I went to some coffee shop.  Then he asked me 2 more times if I went to other places. Then he asked  me same questions for Friday. I was at 3 places.  I replied where I was.  Then he asked me if there was some band playing at place 2. I figured  out that he was checking if I am saying truth and I said yes. I figured  out that he will ask me more questions about my life and I decided to  play that game. He asked me if I go to coffee shop on working days, what  do I do at home, what do I do on computer, do I play games on phone.  Later he asked me what is happening on Facebook , how many Facebook  friends do I have, when do I wake up, when do I go to bed. Do I always  go to bed early? Did I ever go to bed at 3 am? Do I always go to beach  at 4PM. Once I told him that it is not good to go to beach before 4PM  because of UV radiation. Where do I go for the walk. Do I go outside at  same time. We know each other in real life. He asked me on chat: were  you outside, where you were, did I met somebody?  ( probably to ask that  person if they met me, to see if I am telling truth. ) I asked him same  questions to test him and he skipped them all. On question he asks new  question, he does not answer. he also asked me if I was drinking, how much, did I vomit  after drinking, do my cats pee on walls. etc. Once he was traveling in  other country and he spent 1 month there. he told nobody that he will  travel there. He spent one month there and he never told what happened  there. I asked him 3-4 questions and he gave me most boring answers.

He  does this to other people too. After he asks you many question, then he  talks about windows 7, Firefox, smart TV and other easy to understand  things about technology, but never about himself.

He  behaves like he is programmed. He walks same streets every day, He goes  outside at same time and goes back to home at same time. He goes to one  of 3 coffee shops every day. he stays at home every Sunday.

I decided to find excuses when he sends me messages, because it is weird. I do not go outside with him anymore. Am I paranoid? Am I bad person because I avoid him?",5,paranoia

"I am 16 f and a sophomore. Years ago, when I began school, I instantly made friends. I am told of how I had an outgoing and bubbly personality and I remember how I always tried to be friends with everyone. There were three of my closest friends C, A, and K. I considered C my closest friend due to how much we talked, yet one day she stopped talking to me and A quickly followed. Soon K became my closest friend for 5 years and we were inseparable, until the same thing happened. She ghosted me and acted like she didn’t know who I was. In middle school I was alone due to this but made a friend D. D introduced me to her friends and we all began to become a very tight knit group. Last year, as a friend of 6 years and treated like family, she ghosted me. This year we share classes together and even were paired in class work, yet she acted like she didn’t know me. After being almost entirely alone for a while my sophomore year began where I met 3 really good friends. But I’m scared. Am I the problem? I have always had people walk out on me so it must be me who is in the wrong? I’m scared my 3 friends will end up hating me like before I am terrified of being alone and depressed again.

"So I’ve been on geodon for over a year now and when I first started taking it I didn’t sleep for two days. Eventually I got more used to it and had a sleep schedule going but as of late every night is a struggle to fall asleep. What’s your best advice to get to bed at a reasonable time every night and actually sleep properly?

Before I was on medication I would be asleep by 10 and then I was in latuda and it would knock me out quick. But now no matter what I try I just don’t get tired. 

I’m on cyprohedtadine for sleep but it’s not making me tired it’s only helping with my nightmares. I’ve tried melatonin and that only works sometimes. I tried not getting on my phone or watching tv last a certain time. I’ve tried reading before bed. It just seems to be random when I get tired no matter what I try. The only thing I haven’t tried is getting out of bed at the same time everyday no matter what. I guess I will try that out tomorrow as I have somewhere to be in the morning but I’m running out of ideas. 

After school gets out my doctor said I soils take my pm meds at an earlier time so hoping that works. But when I was trying to figure out a time that worked for taking my meds it took forever and I felt awful and life sucked back then. Maybe now that I’m more used to it it will affect me less.

Also I didn't realise how deeply I was cutting until I realised there was still a couple scars that hadn't fully healed.

"I was going to try and make this short but it probably needs a bigger explanation. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for 5 years. 5 months ago I had a mental breakdown where I tried to hurt myself (I am not in that position now so don’t worry) 

Anyway I have been off work since then and am due to have a sickness meeting with my manager and HR  to see how they can ‘support me back to work’. My work place has an Occupational Health department who have been very supportive and helpful and have been liaising with my manager instead of me having to do it. 

My manager is new, and from conversations before I have come to realise he doesn’t know what we go through with anxiety and depression, you don’t really know unless you suffer yourself or are a trained profesional. 

So about going back to work, I am worried that I am going to go back whilst in a good phase then drop back to rock bottom and my manager think I am trying to pull something. I often have a good couple of weeks then drop to rock bottom and it takes me a month or so to come out of it and that happens in cycles. 

How do I get my manager and HR to understand this and to understand that just because on was on top of the world one day doesn’t mean I’ll be like that the day after? 

I am scared of going back to work and this happening and then being penalised for something I can’t control.

"Hey ya'all. Throwaway account for a bunch of reasons.

Quick background before I get into my problems just so it is easier for you to understand, I hope. We have an average sized friend group, it is mostly the people that I hold near and dear to my heart. Yes, I am very picky when it comes to friends and I'm not the type who would want to have loads of them, cause the people that I talk to have a certain value that they hold. I have severe paranoia issues I believe(not diagnosed or anything), to give an example - 

Whenever there's like an event organized by this group and I can't make it due to some other reasons, my minds flooded with questions - what if I'm going to be left out for everything else? What if they're going to do something in a sense that has a negative impact on me etc.. How can I deal with these issues.

"A few months ago I decided I wanted to start working out and found myself a nice few exercises to follow on YouTube. It wasn’t too intense, but I wanted to start off small and practice setting goals and routines, so that I could slowly add on to it and not feel overwhelmed. And honestly? For a while, it was going pretty well. It became a bit of a habit for me. I started to see tiny results. I felt good. 

And then for some reason I decided to just stop. I was like, “eh, it’s fine if I skip today, I’ll just do double the workout tomorrow” or “a few days won’t make a difference in my gains” and now I’m sitting on my ass a few months later with all of my progress reverted. I haven’t worked out in a long time, and I feel worse than ever. Why did I insist on suddenly stopping, just when I was developing a healthy routine and feeling good about myself? Why did I let myself do that? I know I need to push myself to be better or whatever the hell in order to combat my depression but every single time I try I just give up and end up setting myself back. Whenever something starts going well I immediately fuck it up. Why even try anything at this point? I know it’s not going to work anyway. I doubt I’ll be trying to set another workout routine anytime soon, that’s for sure. I’ll just be disappointed.

"Ok this is going to be hella long but I hope someone is willing to read this because I need help. For nearly my whole life or as long as I can remember (my earliest memory of feeling like this was when I was 4 and I am now 16) I have been extremely paranoid and it has not stopped in 12 years. It’s not a type of paranoia that I read about most on here like I’m afraid my neighbors are plotting against me or my boyfriend doesn’t actually love me. I constantly feel like there are “things” around me and out to kill me. They taunt me all day every day waiting for the one day they will all finally get me. Now obviously I know that this is a delusion, but I guess the thing with paranoia is you can’t actually convince yourself it’s not real. There is never a single moment where I am not afraid or weary of my surroundings. Like I said this has been going on since I was about 4. The first memory I have of it was I was sitting in my parents bed alone and I wanted to get up and go to the living room but I felt like there were evil things all around and if I got up they would hurt me and when I finally worked up the courage to get up I had to sprint to the couch because I could feel them chasing me. I’ve lived with this feeling every since day since then. I don’t remember having any sort of crazy trauma that may have caused this, or maybe I did and it was so bad I can’t even remember it. My childhood is a foggy memory I don’t really know. 
I have “episodes” I guess that can be as short as a couple hours or as long as 2 weeks. They’re just periods of time where I am twice as paranoid than I usually am, and in consequence I severely lack in self care such as showering or brushing my teeth because I’m too scared to go into the bathroom or be near the mirror, or I can’t do anything all day because if I get out of bed or up off the couch I’m too vulnerable and in danger. I’ve found that they are usually triggered by seeing a scary movie or creepy picture/video on social media because it gives my mind more delusions to make and place them everywhere in my life like for example something that has happened before was I saw a video from an account that makes like digital art video stuff and it was this very disturbing human looking creature creeping around and then bam that was everywhere in my house for the next two weeks. I basically live life in constant fight or flight mode. In my house it’s just me my dad and my dog. I do online school and my dad works full time 5/6 days a week so I am home alone 80% of the time and that is when I am the most scared and vulnerable. I am still very paranoid when my dad is home though, it’s just not quite as bad. I don’t think I have ever truly  hallucinated but I do always think I see things or see an object as something else like a person, or think I see things running around or past me. I also don’t think I really hear voices necessarily, it’s more of my voice in my head saying things that I’m not voluntarily thinking like “if you go in there you are going to die” or “get out right now”, “it’s coming”, “hurry”, stuff like that. Maybe that is what hearing voices is, but it sounds like my voice so idk. I used to only be paranoid when I was alone and when someone was with me I was completely fine. But in the past year and a half ish everything has been getting continuously worse I’m not even slightly okay anymore when I have someone with me, sometimes it’s worse and I think they’re not even real and just a trick to get me to feel safe and let my guard down. 
I’ve always thought this would just go away one day or I’d get used to it but it is impacting my life way too severely now that I’ve been considering therapy and maybe even medication who knows.  

If you read all of that I love you so much.

"I may be suffering from paranoia which is an altogether concerning subject but I think my roommates might have a camera in my room.

I’ve always struggled with depressive thoughts but it’s been so bad recently and I have nobody to turn to. Nobody knows I’m like this I’m so tired of being alone I’ve never felt so alone in my life i recently quit a job that I was content with for a “better one” and it’s honestly a lot worse I hate every moment I am awake I can’t stand it I just need to vent but I have nobody to vent to. I constantly think about suicide and I hate it I don’t want to die but I can’t stop thinking about ending it all. I work 12 hours a day to distract myself but I hate my job I quit drinking and smoking weed awhile ago because I know it’ll only help in the moment and dig a deeper hole. Fortunately I never got too involved in hard drugs. I just got home and it’s the same empty feeling I constantly feel I’m just so sick of this I’m so young and it’s only gotten worse as time has gone on I’m genuinely terrified that it will keep getting worse. I’m tired of telling myself that it’s going to get better and that I just have to keep pushing and trying but it doesn’t and never has idk why idk what’s wrong with me. I can’t find a woman who genuinely likes me either I don’t know what’s wrong with me I mean I’m not the greatest looking but I’m not ugly I workout frequently and am in good shape but I’m just not enough. And it’s not cause I’m depressed like this like I said I never show these kind of emotions. But for instance I recently had sex with this girl that I’ve known awhile and we began talking every single day and then she hits me with “I find you really attractive and we get along well and we vibe together but I just can’t see us in a relationship” like why what’s wrong with me idc about sex I want someone to spend genuine time with and I just can’t find that idk what’s wrong with me I do everything I’m supposed to and it’s just not enough.

A tenacious self-loathing about how I'm a terrible human being, with awful judgement, that can never be trusted to make sound decisions, with fatalistic, negative beliefs about how myself and life in general sucks and always will.

I'm always wrong about everything, except about how I'm a piece of shit that is always wrong (in every single viewpoint except this one) who will never amount to anything. Bet your bottom dollar on that one.

"The meds make me fat. I'm 19m and never dated, still a virgin. We still don't know if it's schiz or drug induced psychosis but my doctor has a hunch it's schiz. Could go away in the course of a year though now that I'm off weed but it's been two months and still no improvement aside from what medication can do. I've been hearing voices for almost two years now but I've been smoking weed for most of that time with occasional breaks. Longest break was 3 months off cannabis with no improvement in symptoms so I just went back to smoking. Finally quit for good though. 

Only time I've ever truly felt love was on stimulants and it was entirely one sided. And my doctor doesn't want to prescribe any stimulants due to psychosis and past abuse of my ADHD meds before I had psychosis.

I've gone up to 193lb and I'm 6 foot. I can hardly manage to lose any weight on meds. Along with psychosis I'm also just generally emotionally unstable. I think about doing hard drugs because the only person I've ever truly loved doesn't love me or seem to give much of a shit about me. I don't even know if I'm in love anymore but I'm nostalgic and miss feeling in love and alive. Medication makes it hard to even feel love.

I just want to do opioids and amphetamines. My family will kick me out if they find me doing drugs other than weed, alc, nic, or kratom though even if they're just research chems, which fall under a loopwhole and can be openly sold despite being analogues and derivatives of common drugs. They just can't be labeled for human consumption.

I loved her so fucking much, hell man I loved her even when she was still going by he I just thought I must've been bi or something. And I don't know if I'll be able to find anyone with the emotional instability, amphetamine cravings, weight gain, and psychosis. I'm a mess. Incredibly self destructive too. If I had a plug for hard drugs I'd already be on them.

And that's not accounting for the fact that I may not even be able to feel love anymore because of meds. I just want to feel in love again even if it was one sided. At least thinking about her brought me feelings of euphoria. I miss the intensity. Feels like I'm doomed to a dull medicated life.

Sometimes the voices pretend to be her just to try to fuck with me. 

It feels like she doesn't give a fuck about me or see me as more than an acquaintance or just part of the same circle of friends.

I have nothing to talk about with anyone either because I'm too apathetic. Stimulants would help but my doctor refuses to prescribe them. If he doesn't prescribe me a low dose of Dexedrine I may end up on either meth or flourinated amphetamine based research chems. Telling him that won't do any good though. If it wasn't for me feeling sappy and self destructive romantically I'd just take low doses to medicate myself where my doctor is failing me.

Wellbutrin worked for like a month or two and after that all it did was make me even more irritable than when I was abusing stims and made me grind my teeth a lot. I never ground my teeth on Dex. But I did on Wellbutrin :/",6,schizophrenia

I just feel like there is someone listening to me, watching me, somewhere, and I don't like that.. it feels like I have no privacy even though I am very quite, keep to myself a lot, and alone more than I'm not. Along with that I am intensely paranoid about thinking or saying certain things too.

"I had a completely off the hook trigger today that caught me entirely off guard and had a brief breakdown.  I'm ADHD + Depression and have been having a *very* rough brain day and just kind of struggling through the work morning (from a home office).  I've been self harm free for about 5 years.  I opened a drawer in my desk to get a pen and write something down and for whatever reason it instantly triggered the desire to s/h complete with ideation and flashbacks of various instances and methods.  I was stunned and scared for a moment by the speed/force of it all and then began crying.

"I’ve experienced heart palpitations before, a few years ago. I remember at that time I mostly felt them at night when I was going to bed. They only lasted a few days and then they disappeared. 

This is the second time I’ve experienced them and they’ve been happening for at least 2 weeks now. This time, I notice them more so during the day and evening. I don’t really feel them when I’m in bed. I can be waking around or sitting and I will feel a sudden “thump” and then it goes away. 

I’ve had the worst health anxiety of my life lately and so I’m not totally surprised I’m having palpitations. 

The time before, a few years ago, I also think I was going through an anxious time. 

What concerns me is that 1) this is the longest I’ve experienced them and 2) they seem to be happening even when I’m not necessarily feeling anxious. 
They aren’t happening a lot, maybe 5-10 times per day (at least when I notice them). 

I have felt them when laying on my stomach or bending over. I’ve noticed them after I eat too. (I have some digestive issues, at times.)

"Hello Reddit! It's been a while since I last posted something of significance.  A lot has changed, lately. I don't see the purpose in my life anymore. That sounds far fetched considering I'm a 23 y/o with a fiance, a decent paying job that isn't too strenuous, family that cares about me, etc. But it's true. I feel as though my life is a never ending groundhog day situation th at is inescapable unless I die. I would love to get help, but due to having no health insurance (it costs too much with rent and everything else piled up) I can't get the help I know I need. All I do is work, come home, clean, eat, sleep, repeat. There is nothing in my life that brings me joy anymore. One reason for this is bc I don't have a car. That should be an easy hurdle, but it's not. I feel trapped and miserable with nobody to talk to. I hate myself, and even when I know the feeling of wanting to die is temporary (for the most part) I just can't seem to see the ""bright side"" of any of it. I've never planned my inevitable end, but I've thought about how peaceful it must be to not exist. If you have no consciousness, then I'd have no need to feel in the first place. My life feels like this cruel joke, and it feels like I'm chasing my own tail every time I try to better my life. I want to give up, buy I know if I do I will just disappoint or frustrate anybody left in my life that gives a shit. And any time I try to talk about it with anybody I'm met with ""that's life"" or ""grown up shit"". Fuck. That. This is not part of ""being an adult"" this is dark and empty and there is no white light that guides me to a better future. I'm stuck.. and i don't know if I'll ever get out. The only solace I've found is that through Satanism and even the fulfilled heart I grasp at is fleeting once I put my book down.. and just a fair warning, i don't need the whole ""God has a plan and is waiting for you"" speech. I'm a Satanist by choice, because it's the only thing that brings me satisfaction when I'm at my lowest. I would get more involved, but nobody I know believes in the same stuff as me.

"I started with computers at a young age and became interested in hacker culture like any angry kid would

After a while i realized that everyone very well could be out to get me and i started treating every interaction online like they were trying to get information out of me or social engineer me, obviously not healthy for a young lad

Anyways, this became the norm, i started having anxiety attacks when someone was trying to social engineer me and i found out and instantly assumed they had gotten access to other parts of my life, so eventually i tried to erase my online identity multiple times

I think me specializing in social engineering made me more paranoid about being social engineered 

Around the age of 16 i started having small psychotic episodes and started developing what my doctors described as early onset schizophrenia, which didnt help, 

Im on meds for it, but i am coming off for personal reasons, and im realizing that that paranoia is seeping into the real world, if i talk to someone new i instantly assume the worst and try and flip the script and try and get information from them and look for inconsistencies in their story to see if its a persona, 

As you can guess this has lead to social issues 

A friend invited me to church on sunday to meet some more people since i dont have many friends since highschool and im worried about my ability to be social

"-Heads up this is probably going to be long-

I've been paranoid for around 1.5 years I think, not constantly but there are spikes to it and I had previously had a what felt like severe episode of paranoia maybe last year where I was sure everyone was out to get me and kill me and poison my food ect I found it hard to meet up with friends and go to work without feeling like everyone was plotting against me to harm me or to get me fired, that my l my girlfriend was cheating on me and my family was deeply disappointed with me ect, I knew this wasn't the reality and felt like I was going mad. It soon died down after I quit my job which was causing a huge amount of stress so I think stress is an attribute to getting  paranoia panic attacks and having breakdowns.

Now I am experiencing the breakdowns again. I don't dislike my job and it isn't too stressful at all, but I think it could be my living situation. I live in a shared house with my mates and I've been having panic attacks/ breakdowns for the last three days now every day because I feel like my friends don't want me there because they just want to smoke green without me in the way and that my girlfriend doesn't love me anymore and wants to be with other men that aren't as fucked up as me and can smoke with her. Usually I wouldn't mind people smoking, I have other friends who use it daily and I've never had a problem with it before but I think because I didn't see it constantly it didn't affect me like this but it is affecting me and I don't know what to do.


My housemates and sometimes my girlfriend smoke together which I cannot partake in because obviously I experience paranoia and the substance isn't exactly helpful to me in that sense, but it has left me feeling like they want to cut me out and so I've been trying to let them get on with it which at the same time is making me feel like I'm losing my friends/ the connection isn't the same. when I spoke about it yesterday with one of them it was confirmed that that wasn't the case but I can't help feeling like it is and that they're doing it on purpose to get away from my negativity or to talk about me behind my back. 

I feel horrible for thinking these things but it's eating me from the inside. I don't feel cared about I'm scared my girlfriend won't love me anymore and wants to leave me because she won't talk to me about her problems and it's always me talking about mine or that I'm stopping her from having fun or doing the things she needs to do all the time and that I'm the problem, to confirm these feelings she doesn't want to have sex with me either which is making me anxious that she's fucking other men because I can't satisfy her or something, I know she wouldn't do that and it's in my head but I can't help thinking things like this.

All this paranoia and anxiety I then took to work with me on Friday where I misinterpret normal conversation and think that the actual conversation I'm having means something entirely different and it really ends up hurting my feelings or making me angry/anxious, which I have experienced before last year also, this would be and is with basically every single conversation I have or overhear where I think it is about me in a negative way or people hiding information about me in their conversations and I have to depict the meaning.


I've had to stay at my mum's house because I am scared to go home in fear of having these breakdowns from seeing my mates smoking weed and thinking all these things that aren't real or are I don't know. It's nice to get these things off my chest but I really just want them out of my head as well.",5,paranoia

"hi everyone this is my first reddit post so please be nice.

i’ve always been kind of a morose person, but lately, it has gotten worse and worse. i’m in college now, and i’m struggling to find a summer job or internship, and because i have very few friends, the days drag on and i feel useless and empty. on top of that, my mom is sick right now which is also stressing me out, and my dad is not helping out much and is not good emotional support for any of us. 
i think the stress from that, the thoughts that nobody likes me or wants to hang out with me from my hometown (i didn’t make many friends in high school), and the monotony of my days is making me very anxious and sort of depressed (not enjoying much of anything, sleep problems, random crying, etc).

i think an important thing to note is that i am a Christian but i’m kind of struggling with that too (stuff i don’t quite agree with in the Bible (i know i can’t pick and choose so you can see how that might be a problem), and also the feeling that i am just talking into a void). so praying about it (for me right now) feels very disingenuous (but i am not asking for any cynical athiest takes as this will probably make me more anxious).
i can’t get a therapist because my parents control that and they already don’t think it will be useful.

if anyone would care to read, advice (Christian and Secular) would be appreciated, just something to lift my spirits and keep me moving forward. thank you.

edit: an important thing to add too is that in the beliefs i’ve been taught, thoughts and declarations are important because they can come true. so there’s also the feeling of hopelessness and then an added layer of hopelessness because you feel hopeless (if that makes sense).",2,depression

"I'm sorry this will be kinda long and might be hard to read, I'll try to break it up as much as possible.

Ive tried in the past to bring up the possibility of ADHD to a few people. My therapist and APRN both told me that my case is too complex for them to be able to come up with a definitive answer on their own (I also have severe anxiety and they said it would be hard for them to be able to decipher what symptoms came from what). And my parents don't believe there's anything wrong with me besides anxiety. But there also pretty uneducated when it comes to mental health stuff. 

About two weeks ago I had an appointment with someone who is supposed to specialize in testing and evaluations. He wasn't specifically testing for ADHD but it was something I had brought up and he said he would help look into. I filled out general forms that covered multiple disorders, but the only thing he gave me that was specifically ADHD related was one screening test. 

I don't remember what it was called, but it was a test that asked questions about when I was ages 5-12 with a scale of like never to very often. 

The only things I answered ""never"" for were questions about disobeying adults (which I never did because I'm scared of confrontation and I used to be terrified of not listening to authority like teachers) and things like ""did you feel like you were driven by a motor"" or ""did you get up out of your seat when you weren't supposed to (I'm believe I would most likely have innattentive type anyway). And there were only a couple questions like that. 

He then said that, based on that one test about when I was in elementary school and the fact that nobody noticed anything when I was a child, (he hasn't finished going through the general forms) that IF I do have ADHD, it would be ""more on the mild side"" and I could probably leave it alone until I got a proper job and had more responsibilities (I'm unable to work and still live with my family) unless I'm saying ""I can't get up, I can't read a book, I can't start anything..."" To which I went ""well..."" But he kinda just kept talking. 

I really regret not speaking up more because I do have those problems and thats part of the reason I'm trying to find someone who will assess me. Like if I don't have it that's fine. I'm not trying to root for it or whatever. I just want a fair, cohesive test so that just that if I do have it, I know I have options available to me. Not ""maybe but if you do then it's fine.""

I literally had a day a day or so after I saw him where I was trying to get up to go do something, and it literally took me 20 minutes just to get myself to reach out my hand and grab my water bottle because my throat was dry. Like literally 20 minutes of me going ""reach your arm out, just grab the bottle, all you have to do is move your arm a little bit, just grab it."" I read a little bit of a book the other day too, and when I first started I had to read over every paragraph twice because the first time I was only taking in about half of what I was reading. It got better as I got a few pages in, but still. 

And I mean maybe that's related to anxiety or something else idk. But I'm just really tired of hearing ""IF you have it"" and like ""that MAYBE could be related to ADHD"". Like I just want answers and I thought this guy was gonna be a big step towards that. But instead I just got more ""maybes"" and ""ifs"" and it's really frustrating.",3,adhd

"I've always been a bit anxious, but recently things have taken a turn to the extreme. I have had trouble in the past, being threatened etc, but back then I never felt as much fear as I do when I have delusions of persecution. When I am by myself (especially when I am not home) I always feel like somebody is going to attack me and I constantly have these scenarios play inside my head, for hours at times, where I get assaulted. This also happens when I am in the presence of police, I feel they are after me every time I pass by them

Now, I want to disclose that I have not been diagnosed. I can understand diagnosis takes time and I am working it out with a psychotherapist. But these thoughts are worrying me and have started affecting my relationships. So my question is, can paranoia suddenly develop or am I just worrying to much?",5,paranoia

For the past year I kept thinking about it for ""just another month"" and every single month I dragged out it only got worse and worse. In the past few months there have been multiple attempts which sadly all failed, but these failed attempts made me even more desperate to die instead of giving me some ""holy wake up call"" like it does with a lot of other people who talk about this.

I went out the other week and drank far too much. I blacked out and can’t remember much. All I can really remember is falling off a bench oops. I’ve asked people what I was like to try and to seek reassurance but they have said I was just very drunk. I seem to recall also having some cross words with someone who often has made unnecessary comments to me in the past which I’ve let slide… I feel the drink may have aided my confidence to stand up to them. But I cannot remember how the conversation went down and it was infront of people who I do not know. My sister said she was concerned for how drunk I was but more of a how am I going to get this bitch home rather than me acting out of line. Other people have also said you were fine just drunk. I keep messaging people asking if I’ve offended or disrespected them or if I was really bad or embarrassing. But now because of my lack of memory and my friends ‘ you were just drunk’ version of reassurance I’m panicking. We are a week on now and my anxiety is crippling. I don’t want to leave my four walls.

"I miss the time were i felt alive. I was just a kid living the best of life. Everything looked so colorful and tasted good. I remember feeling the sweetest scent ever, and it made me think of that gorgeous girl, i had a crush so hard for her. I loved to just talk to her again, so i could look deep into those beatiful eyes. I would go to my best friend's house, play dozens of games and joke around like idiots. Or get all my buddies and go watch a movie.
Well... i'm trying to say that life was really nice. I could enjoy every little thing. I didn't have to think about the future, because i was living every moment to the fullest. I was happy.

But my depression screwed it all. Now i'm just a empty shell of the person i used to be. Trapped in my own body, unable to feel something. Life has lost all meaning and joy. Sometimes it feels like food has no taste, there's no scent in the air, i swear even the light of the day feels diferent, more grey. I'm lonely so badly that even in my dreams my friends ask me why i left them. But i can't send a message, because i honestly believe their friend is long dead. They have better friends. Real people to talk to.

I'm tired of pretending i'm fine, while i'm obviously slowly dying. But what's the point of looking for help? People can't possibly understand, they'll laugh and treat me as a weirdo. Or pity me. Or send me to a psych ward and throw me away. And they can pretend i'm important to them as much as they want, but in the end of the day, i'll be alone in my suffering.

"I have been awake over 24 hours and I got to say, the relief that acute sleep deprivation provides is insane. I have not felt like this in so long. Damn I never realized how dark and heavy of a blanket depression has been on my life. Wtf What an eye opener. Not recommending it as treatment, but it is eye opening to do it once in a while and literally see night and day. This is not the only time sleep deprivation has provided total relief. It is well documented. We are talking about acute sleep depravation here, not chronic where a person only sleeps 5 hours a day for extended periods of time, that is really bad for you, but so can being awake days straight.The main point of the post was to stress the eye opening experience that is the relief from depression through acute sleep deprivation. Put it this way: I really did not know what depression was until I saw the night and day difference. Depression is evil. 

Edit: Not on any drugs except weed and caffeine, but those hardly provide relief from depression for me, at least compared to sleep deprivation, shit. Depression cannot be chemical related as I am like this whether I am sober for 9 months or high for 9 months, but sobriety and moderation definitely surely helps.",2,depression
"How to fix myself

I know the title is somehow misleading,  but this issue is a fundamental one in my life rn, one that I always push and postpone..
I cannot with certainty diagnose myself, but I think I have been suffering with anxiety for a long time, at every major event I would say ""it will get better after that"" ,  and now I'm finishing my graduation internship and I suffer and struggle everyday to keep my mood neutral at best, I act fine with my family and my friends cause no one wants to hear whining and I know I will get told the same shit : chne9sek, e7med rabi etc and believe me I tell myself that too at everytime my mind starts wondering and I feel overwhelmed or anxious and sad and scared .. I went through so much and I thought it would make me stronger and carefree but it didn't .. I'm not asking for a magical solution obviously and believe me I am not in a position where I can seek professional help for this (even tho it was suggested to me in both serious/sarcastic ways because I'm such a nervous wreck) , I fucking wish with all my heart that I wake up tomorrow with a new chemical composition in my brain that lets me feel joy and safety and contentment... I am so scared that I will live the rest of my life like this,  I am religious and I try to feel that peace everytime I pray and it does help to a certain degree but I feel like this rot dark negative energy is so deeply rooted within me no matter what I try and how I act on the outside, I  would still feel it .

"Hi everyone!
So i have suffered from anxiety for many years now and i usually fell into anxious thought cycles that i struggled to get out of and these caused sometimes physical symptoms as well (especially i felt a pressure on my throat). The anxiety was much better until few months ago, where i’ve started getting physical symptoms of anxiety (feeling dizzy, feeling like i can’t get enough air & being hyper aware of my body) randomly and without them being triggered by anxious thoughts (after i get these symptoms i start worrying whether it is normal though). I am struggling to cope with these symptoms and breathing techniques make it somehow all worse…

"So I have a friend who is presenting symptoms of extreme paranoia. She thinks her phones are bugged and is constantly getting burner phones. She came over to my house and could only talk to me outside because she couldn’t trust cars or houses for fear of them being bugged. She thinks her neighbor is a long lost family member that is plotting with her family to kill her. She recently abandoned her apartment and is wondering around homeless because she’s sure her family is out to get her. I have asked her to seek help in the past for possible depression but she was unwilling. She just recently confessed her delusions to me after dropping off some of her favorite movies for me to keep safe in case her place was set on fire by her family and I again told her to seek help, but she has since been changing locations. I had no idea she was paranoid and I don’t know how to help, especially since she is now willingly homeless and constantly moving locations. I’m really worried about her and would like some advice on how I should proceed and talk to her once I see her again. I should add that when I talked to her she was able to admit that it could just be paranoia and that she was also suffering from derealization and she even stopped smoking for that reason but also it worsened after she stopped smoking. 

Please advice!! Thank you!",5,paranoia
"Hi all, I was curious if anyone has had delusional behavior with just an anxiety diagnosis. The reason I ask is because I have always felt that there is something more going on with me than just anxiety. But, anxiety is very strong so I thought I'd ask. My delusions happen when I go off my antipsychotic medication. An example of one is I thought poison was in my food which was a really intense delusion. Usually they are a bit more mild, like suddenly being religious when I have no religious beliefs on my medication. Going down rabbit holes like alien encounters or near death experiences, believing everything I hear/read. I have been in psychosis before but it was due to a drug withdrawal so I don't believe I have a psychotic disorder but I don't know. Please let me know if you experience anything similar.

We are moving around our house because some of our roommates moved out. Which is great because that means we (my husband and I) can have a larger room and get a cat. Here is the thing though it requires moving all of our things out of one room and into the other and cleaning the spaces after we move the stuff. I hate cleaning. I hate it so much. I hate messes but I hate touching the messes even more. It leads me to a lot of avoidance of creating waste whenever I can or pilling my boxes so I don’t need to move them as often. (I also have adhd in conjunction with my autism if that makes a difference to and I am medicated) but because of all of this I have to put in my earbuds and ignore everyone because the minute that someone talks to me they can always seem to tell I am upset.

"Throwaway account first of all. I don't usually make posts. I think I'm just looking for some semblance of connection with someone. I'm a father and husband. My wife and I have been together for over 5 years, got married and had a kid. I have a decent job in my field that I studied for in school. Wife works as well but has no education, so her options are limited. I make more than twice what she does, but even with both incomes, money is tight. I stress a lot, and when I do it also stresses her out and makes her feel like she isn't doing enough. 

In my younger years I was very openly angry, meaning I had a temper and would be rude and nasty. Which is ironic. Because these days, I'm very controlled in how I handle my anger. In fact, I'm so good at controlling them, I've also learned that it's best that I stow most negative emotions deep within so she won't know that I'm stressed, down, and frankly, depressed. She notices at times that there may be something off, but these days I just tell her that I'm okay and we're okay and that everything is good. I keep daily life going and make sure all is taken care of. Our kid, daily duties, etc. 

I think that my negative emotions, even though they're calmly expressed, they tend to end up in an argument. I think I expected my life to be less stressful at this point. I'd have a house, enough money to save, that in the event that I died, my family would be okay. Of course there's so much more to all this, but I'm frankly tired of everything to the point that's it's hard to fully explain. I'm just exhausted. It's tired of pretending. 

Today, I finally took it upon myself to look for a psychologist. I got a call that the one that I had chosen wasn't even accepting patients. So back to the drawing board on that one. I'm finding myself less and less interested in home life. Work feels like the only escape I have, and I get burnt out with that too after a while.

When I am alone I feel restless, as though I must be doing something that I am not.

I wish to be healthy, I feel a sense of dread when I take my medication, remembering how unhealthy I've become. No amount of health will prevent what befalls us all in the end, so what is the point? These thoughts make me anxious, they make me wish I were a character in a story, timeless, ageless, immune to the depravities of the world and of what comes after. Sex is a great distraction, when I am embraced I do not remember I will die, but then he/she/they leave and I am then left with myself, my reality.

"I have anxiety, ocd, and depression. Idk if she knows about my ocd (though she has some misconceptions on it like that it’s only cleaning so maybe she thinks my symptoms are from my anxiety?) and I find she is constantly doing stuff that I have stated upsets me/stresses me out. She also is vomiting alllll the time bc of health issues but I have pretty severe emetophobia- and it’s a living hell. I’m gonna list some stuff she does/has done. I’m just feeling stressed rn sorry.

•leaves microwave with time left on it instead of canceling the time

•holds one of my cats that I’ve explicitly said doesn’t like to be held by other people (because he doesn’t)

•feeds my cats constantly even though I asked her not to

•calls for the cats in the same tone I use to call them for breakfast/dinner. She’ll just call them like that so they’ll come into the room but then they’ll pester me til I feed them treats

•leaves food out that’s meant to be in the fridge/freezer

•constant misgenders my friends

•makes jokes about my sexuality 

•makes comments about me behind my back in front of my sister who then tells me 

•says stuff like “I didn’t think you’d like this” or “glad to have found something you actually like” which makes me anxious because I already have anxiety about being hard to work with

•comments on my weight and asks if I’m eating even though I haven’t lost weight in months and my doctors helped me fix my diet

•talks abt how my older sister never texts her back to me because I also never text back

There’s more- but I need to get to sleep.
Do you all think she’s actually doing all this to bother me and stress me out???? Or is she just annoying? She’s extremely manipulative and will constantly buy things for our family. And then when her and my dad break up (which they do constantly) she’ll demand them back. She once gave my sister a $200 check to help pay for one of her classes as a present and then months later asked my sister when she’d pay her back- even though the money was a present.

"My parents divorced when I was less than a year old because he was a bipolar alcoholic who was very scary when he was in his angry phases, so I was a weekend custody kid. He was actually pretty alright around me, buying me toys, taking me places, but when he moved into his new girlfriend's home, he showed some of those angry phases. I stayed every other weekend and it was very stressful sometimes, but good at least 3/4 of the time. In those stressful situations he would shout and get mad, occasionally I could hear some stuff get knocked around, but sometimes he would end up pushing and grabbing my stepsister, who was a few years younger, and I occasionally had to stop it from escalating. It was overall stressful for me. One night I had to call the cops on him when he was drunk. It was a harsh environment sometimes, but not the worst, no torture, no belts, and frequent legit happiness.

I was always spared

After that I didn't see him for a while. He died 2021, and I never got any resolution to any of it. I learned recently that his family was abusive, even covering up how my uncle raped my dad. Last semester I had to read a book in class that dealt with abuse, and it retriggered all of my post traumatic feelings. 

Now, as I look around the world, it barely feels worth living for. Abuse, torture, rape, it's just fucking everywhere. Even before I became depressed I was hyper sensitive to people suffering, and now it's so bad I don't think I'll ever read a book, or hell, consume any non-musical media again. It's all just so terrible, but if I express this, I'm just a fucking emo teenager whining about shit. I know there is more to life than this, but it doesn't change the fact that it exists. I have no motivation or hope anymore, and I barely feel like I matter. My life isn't bad enough anymore to matter.",2,depression

"Antipsychotic medications only seems to address the positive symptoms and I'm just anhedonic and bored all day I feel like a husk my life is so fucking boring.

Like even if I were to do meth it wouldn't be because I'm an addict. It'd be because I need a stimulant to counteract negative symptoms that my psychiatrist simply won't prescribe. I'd essentially microdose it and just take the equivalent to a therapeutic dosage of Desoxyn.

I'd rather just have my Dexedrine prescription back. I know it'd obliterate the anhedonia.

Wellbutrin worked for like a month or two then it just made me irritable and clench my jaw a lot. Dexedrine actually remained effective and made everything exciting. This was before I even developed symptoms.

I did eventually abuse it but that's because I was dumb and immature as I was still in highschool and just entering my drug experimentation phase at the time. I'm 19 now and I probably wouldn't abuse stimulants if I got put on them. Fuck I want them back life just isn't worth living with anhedonia.

"I've been battling an extended depressive episode for most of the spring. The fog has recently begun to lift but now I feel overwhelmed by how behind I am on taking care of myself and my apartment.

Come, laugh at my misfortune! 😅",3,adhd
"A little context before we start: I am 20, and suffer ADHD (likely turned bipolar but have no official diagnosis), and depression. My mood swings and behaviour makes me believe its no longer ADHD but bipolar disorder instead. Please note that I am currently jobless, so while I don't pay rent, I do cook and clean, and generally make sure my younger sisters don't do anything stupid. Anything I do use up, I replace it if possible using my own savings. 

My dad and I have not gotten along since I was 13. At first it was just typical teenage rebellion stuff. While my mum and I have always had a close relationship. She was the person I could go to and talk to about my problems. She understood me, and she was my rock. My dad however...due to how he was raised he is not like my mum. He has no empathy (sympathy in case I'm getting these mixed up again) for anyone, doesn't understand what to say and when, and does not seem to understand that his blatant comments are hurtful to me. Sometimes I feel like he's being intentionally hurtful. Our personalities clash violently, so when we get in an agrument we tend to say really hurtful stuff we don't actually mean. We know when the other doesn't mean it because we don't say that same thing again later, its always something different. 

I know he favours my younger sister (15). She's like him in every way. No empathy (or sympathy), loves trucks, wants to be a diesel mechanic and drive machinery etc. He lets her get away with almost everything and this is admittedly the source of a lot of our fights. While he lets her get away with everything, he's constantly on my back about stuff I did, stuff I didn't do, stuff I need to do and what I shouldn't do. From age 14, he has treated me like the source of his problems, but never outright hurt me, laid his hands on me or said the worst stuff, he just acted like I could do no right. 

Recently, we have had more arguments than normal. I recently finished a contract to study a Cert III in Business, and currently have no job but I am actively looking for work, I actually have an interview next week so it is not like I'm sitting around doing nothing. I clean each morning: empty the dishwasher, tidy off the bench and clean it, and even vacuum the floors of dirt and kitty litter, and anything else. Sometimes when I'd get home from work I'd do the cooking but that wasn't often. Now, unless my parents have something else in mind I'm cooking almost every night. He comes home to a tidy house, a hot meal, and still often complains or has an attitude with me. 

Every single fight we have now, he has picked up the tendency to tell me: ""if you don't like how I run this house you can move out'. He was telling me this before I finished my work. Keeping in mind I wasn't earning a lot. I was making 25K annually as a trainee, so even if I'd gone for a Cert 4 and stayed in the job I still would not have been able to move out and stay out. But even after i finished work he still tells me to move out if I don't like it,  he knows I can'tleave otherwise Id be homelessand he doesn't care. I feel unwanted in my own home. Every time he tells me these words I cry myself to sleep. Sure we argue but I still love that man. I always worry for him, I always love him even if he treats me like a 2nd class citizen and favours my sister over me. I feel unwelcome in my own home and I am constantly reminded by him and my sister that: I have no friends, I don't have a job, and I'm single. I am constantly made to feel like I don't matter and I'm getting so exhausted that death sounds good right about now. 

I've been considering death for a while now, thinking about how I'd do it, when, how long it would take. And then I'd ponder: would they miss me? Would they even care? My mother does not call him out when he makes these comments and it makes me feel like I can't trust her to have my back. They don't seem to realise my lashing out is a cry for help, and even now as I'm typing this I'm crying after being told earlier tonight to move out. If he wants me out I'll go, but I know if I go he won't help with the house. He won't keep my sisters in check, they wont pass inspections because he can't even wash a dish and I know mum will divorce him when it becomes too much for her. I don't want to leave my mum alone to them but I don't want to keep enduring this. I can't take it any longer! My sister expects me to take her out places, buy her nice things but doesn't want to be nice to me in return, and my dad wants me to contribute around the house but cant even see the effort I'm putting in now. I've put in so much that my hair is falling out, I can't sleep, and while my appetite is still in tact, I know if this goes on that'll die too. 

Every time he says these awful words I die a little more inside and I'm exhausted.....I just want it all to stop. I feel alone, I just want someone to hold me and tell me its going to be ok. But I don't even want to go to my mum this time, as I worry she's going to get mad or tell me I'm being dramatic.....

Sorry this was so long but I needed to get this off my chest....thank you all for listening and I'm sorry if I'm taking up your time internet strangers...",2,depression

"I am 20 (m) and my depression is at an all time high. On November 1st 2022 I quit my job at Walmart for an opportunity to leave state and go live with my grandfather in Mississippi. I had only met him once in my life after my father had passed. He wanted to get to know me and wanted me to stay with him. I live with my mother and before I quit I had lashed out at her a couple times (yes it was stupid and I highly regret it) I lashed out at her because I was just so angry where I was at in life. Living in this stupid town where there’s nothing for me and working at Walmart which now that I look back was the only thing I had going for myself. I didn’t have a car and was just frustrated with everything. I blamed her for not helping me enough, she didn’t teach me how to drive and I didn’t have a car and most of all for moving us to the town. I did apologize to her but my mom was listening to what I was saying and contacted my grandmother. So long story short I suppose my grandmother contacted my grandfather and he offered me an opportunity to come live with him. He said he had land and stuff and he’d teach me how to drive and everything plus it was a change of scenery. So I thought yea I’ll take this opportunity. I quit and my aunt was supposed to get me but let’s just say me leaving never came into fruition. Also found out my grandfather is very negative very very negative and he pissed me off so I don’t even want him in my life anymore. November wasn’t really that bad since I got my last check from Walmart and had money. In December I had a fight with my stepfather because he was drunk and threw my mothers phone so I confronted him about it and told him to get the fuck out. He told me “you don’t even do anything” and yes he was drunk but that statement is very true because at the time I was waiting on something that just didn’t happen. We moved past that and now on to 2023 this is easily the worst year of my life since 2010 when my father passed. Every job I’ve applied for I either don’t get or I get stood up. I’ve applied to Kroger, the local hospital, a car wash, sherwin Williams, a machine operator, lowes, planet fitness, big lots, super 1 and I haven’t gotten a single offer. I’m damn near going broke and I feel pathetic. I feel like my father is looking down on me with disappointment. I can’t be happy with my current situation, everyone is getting to their goals and mines just came to an halt. It’s my fault, everything. The one good thing I had going for myself I fucked it up and that was Walmart. As shitty as Walmart is, I may have to go back there. No one really talks about how being unemployed fucks you up mentally. Feeling like you’re nothing and and embarrassment. I feel like I’m not good enough and I’m still just trying to hold on but this darkness seems eternal. I know my parents think I’m an embarrassment. The truth literally came out of my step fathers drunk ass mouth. They probably think I’m a lazy bum who sits on his ass all day. I’ve been struggling and I’m just about ready to give up. 


Tldr;
I’ve applied for tons of jobs and still am unemployed 
I feel like my parents talk about me very negatively and are disappointed 
Oh let’s not forget that I still have never had a girlfriend

Recently I have tried to fight my depressive episodes by creating healthy habits for myself, such as waking up early at 6 ish for sixth form, or thinking positive affirmations and goals I want to achieve each day to get me in the correct mindset e.t.c

However, I can't keep it up anymore. My biggest weakness is that I get very easily demotivated if anyone or thing interferes with something which is within my control. It makes me feel like shite and makes me feel powerless, inferior, weak. And my way of dealing with these emotions is horrendous. I lash out and start destroying my surroundings, harming my body (whether it be punching my self or slamming my head repetitively on nearby surfaces.)In the end it really doesn't solve anything and I realise the only one im hurting is myself, since noone else clearly knows or wants to know how I feel and I therefore drown myself in this continuos loop of self-degradation and dismayal.

I don't want to continue anymore. I want to go to sleep and forget all about when I wake up or just don't wake up at all. I want to be carefree, not caring about any ones emotions and not taking EVERYTHING to heart. I want to be able to reciprocate certain emotions and thoughts in my relationships with people. Most importantly I just want to feel fufilled and actually wanted.",2,depression

"Hi everyone, I'm a 17 year old guy who is paranoid.
It all started with a meeting with a friend while watching a movie, I stared at the TV screen, and put my finger in my nose (but did not pick it). I lay there for about 10 minutes, but the problem is that I was afraid that he could take a picture of me on the phone (he took it in his hands while we watched the movie and when I stared a little) and maybe put it somewhere on the Internet. We have here such networks as vk, telegram, tiktok, facebook.
And the next day I came to the college and obsessive thoughts began - someone smiled when he passed next to me, two girls started laughing when I sat and ate lunch in the dining room, some guys laughed looking in my direction when I was waiting for the bus home , etc. .d. It seems to me that they all recognize me from this video or photo.
Everything got to the point that I asked 12 people (acquaintances and a friend) if they had seen me anywhere on the internet. Everyone answered that they had not seen, but I practically do not trust everyone (except relatives).
And I also asked my friend (with whom I watched the film) to show his gallery.
There were no photos or videos. But I don't know if he saw something on the Internet with me or not.
I don’t even know what to add here , some people on the street still smile when i go through them.
If you read all this, then I would not be against some advice (because it seems to me that I will go crazy soon)",5,paranoia

Why would somebody who’s meant to have a purpose like this be made to have schizoaffective disorder. It doesn’t make sense. How can I be a positive influence when I can’t even be there. Towards the end of my time there this year I was consumed by anxiety and paranoia and I was suicidal. How is that good for kids to be around.,6,schizophrenia

I’m still kind of the funny guy, but my depression has just left me as the most replaceable person in anyone’s life. My parents think it’s a phase. They tell me to just “have faith in God” or “just pray it out” and I think that’s a load of bs. On my bad days they threaten to take me to the ward or emotionally manipulate me into getting better “for them,” but it’s just a mask. If I wasn’t in this timeline, nothing would change.

"Hello I just wanted to post because no one around me seems to be able to relate. I've been struggling with mental health my whole life (depression, anxiety, ADD).

 In the last year my primary doctor has suspected I may have chronic fatigue syndrome. There's no test for this other than to rule out everything else my fatigue could be. All my blood tests and insomnia test were negative, and the last test to rule out was sleep apnea. So for over 3 months of waiting to get tested for that I was mentally preparing for either. I honestly was hoping it would just be sleep apnea because that is treatable and cfs is not. 

 I got my test result back a few weeks ago and I have the lowest possible sleep apnea positive score. I was relieved at first because I had only mentally prepared for it to be one or the other. But when I saw my primary again, she said most likely my light sleep apnea isn't what's making me so fatigued all the time but she can't diagnose me officially with chronic fatigue syndrome until I attempt to fix the sleep apnea. So she told me it is most likely both.

Now I have been waiting even longer for the sleep doctor to tell me what to do and I still haven't heard back almost a month later. I may not find out a real answer for another year or maybe never. I'm feeling so hopeless because I researched and all they know about chronic fatigue syndrome is that you can get bedridden from it and it's not treatable and may in fact take up to 20 years off your lifespan because of higher rates of heart attack or suicide. 

Does anyone else have chronic fatigue syndrome officially that also struggles with depression and anxiety? How do I live with the probability of this? I am already out a job and can no longer leave the house easily by myself because I don't feel it's safe to drive. But I'm not much closer to finding the true answer so I just feel hopeless. I haven't included all the ways my fatigue affects me but it has ruined my life. Anyone dealing with something similar please share how you deal with this",2,depression

"  For the last 2 years I've been extremely sad at almost all times. About 2 years ago my grandpa died, obviously I'd be sad. I feel like that just opened the door to all my bad thoughts and emotions. I haven't ever had a good outlook on myself, I think I'm a 2/10 at best, I'm not funny, and I absolutely hate myself in every sense of the word. 
  I've never had any luck romantically(I know that's very common) and rejection is never a surprise anymore. As a result of the constant rejection both romantically and socially I never talk to anyone new EVER. I actively avoid all social interaction if possible and I don't feel like I have anything to give anyone. I'm just an annoying burden with absolutely 0 worth. I've tried all the things and they don't work. ""Talking about it"" has gotten me nothing but judgement and some of the very few people I talk to think I'm making an excuse to not do things with them. 
  It's gotten worse recently, for the last few weeks all I've been thinking about is how much better the world would be without me. I've completely stopped drawing/sketching (The only thing I liked to do) I have no inspiration and feel like I'm forcing it too hard whenever I even attempt to draw. So I stopped. I am a shell of my former happy outgoing self because I've got nothing to show for it. All I did was be nice and considerate and do what all good boys and girls are supposed to do and I've got absolutely nothing for it. I'm aware I'm not owed anything but it would be nice once in a while. I've only gotten bullied for existing, which at this point in time I'd love to stop doing.
  I've been in my bathroom for 2 hours crying on and off with a knife in my hand, I'm thinking about the least painful knife related way to die. I can't do it, I don't know what in the universe is making me this much of a coward. I don't think I'm scared, as an atheist I've fully accepted my reality of there being no afterlife or reincarnation. I fully wish to go into the void of nothingness to free the world of the pain that is me. I just don't know anymore. I feel empty and worthless. 🫤",2,depression
" In my life there are often great expectations of me and my fellow human beings (friends, family, strangers) and also great hopes and a deep longing for a different, better life, which logically have been and are repeatedly disappointed. 

Whenever I was a little satisfied with something, I felt at the same time this irrepressible and deep-seated disappointment and dissatisfaction. When I've been out with loved ones, I've longed for other ""better"" or ""cooler"" people, or complete solitude. And the other way around.

As if my inner self has been playing images of my ""dream life"" to me for so long that I would pick myself up and give it my all to achieve it. Like some kind of intrinsic motivation, but through a constantly yelling and driving drill instructor.

Does anybody have that as well?

In that respect, couldn't we assume that expectations just naturally diminish and become less through repeated disappointments over the course of a lifetime?

I rather have the impression that my hopes for better people, better places, better times have developed in parallel with the disappointments, and that I have therefore developed higher and higher expectations for everything.

And I also know that this is totally unfair, selfish and also quite violent towards other people, because there is virtually no one for me (not even myself) who can make me feel that he/she is enough and I feel good, while I also know that this should not be my right nor my claim towards other people, but I have not yet found a proper, healthy way to deal with it.",3,adhd

She couldn't give less of a shit that I'm depressed because all she wants to see from me is fucking money. That's all I fucking am to her. A fucking dollar sign. Without that, I'm a fucking worthless waste of space burden.",2,depression
"TW: S/A mentioned 

I’ve had paranoia problems since I was a kid. One profound example I can remember is that I would apologize when accidentally bumping into or hitting inanimate objects like walls or my toys. I did this because I thought they would come to life and hurt me. 

It died down for a while until about a few months to a year ago. So, for years, my parents touched me inappropriately without my consent(like my boobs, butt, etc). I would tell them to stop as a teenager after I learned I could say no to them, but they got mad and continued anyway. It was really traumatic and my mind still feels messed up about it. A year ago, I started getting paranoid and fearing that I’ll be like them in the future. I didn’t have this fear until I learned that most criminals become who they are because of traumatic moments. Ever since then, I’ve been super paranoid and my rationality is going crazy because I keep second guessing my thoughts. 

I don’t know what to do. I need some advice please.

"hey guys, i don’t have a medical diagnosis or anything and am not sure if i have ‘paranoia’ but i was wondering if any of y’all had advice or tips for some symptoms i live with DAILY that control my life.

some examples:
- constantly scared that i will die or my family will die
- think i will be part of a shooting or mass shooting every time im in public
- cant eat fast food bc i think the workers spit in it or did something to it
- cant get mad at someone for too long before thinking they will die that night
- hear noises that aren’t there and assume someone is breaking in

i don’t feel like i have anxiety, because i’m not jittery or insanely nervous to leave the house, but i struggle with these main fears every second of everyday. i don’t think a moment goes by where i’m not thinking abt my paranoiac thoughts.

does anyone else go through something like this and have any advice or tips? im not sure if i need medication, or maybe just therapy, or maybe to practice grounding. 

any advice will help!",5,paranoia
"sometimes i’ll be minding my own business and then i get hit with this deep deep sense of awful dread and revulsion, and then everything starts to feel surreal like i’m in some kind of horror movie. and it’s not that i’m scared, it’s just deeply uncomfortable. like living in a psychological thriller would be. as if there’s no real monster but everything around me is wrong, evil, threatening. it feels like if i turn around there will be blood everywhere or if i look in the mirror my face will be messed up even if it isn’t. and it just feels like a kind of black hole i sink into. nothing else feels important anymore. i can only think about disturbing things, feel completely isolated, like someone has turned all the lights off for me only and no one else. 

and i want to keep living life like i used to, to go to lecture, watch tv, eat food i like, and laugh with my family but it just feels very very wrong. like i’m not capable of it. like i don’t belong there, i’m meant to wait for something big and world changing to happen to me. only it never comes.

"I'm in need of support/advice. I (f24) am a social work student in the UK. I'm supposed to finish my degree in the next month but I very likley could fail my final placement. The reason for my failing will be lack of professionalism (i.e. not responding to emails in a timely manner, failure to arrange meetings with my supervisors, and a few absences that I did not tell my supervisor about beforehand). I was already on thin ice and now, because of a simple mistake where I sent an email to one person instead of two, I probably don't have any chances left.

I feel so stupid because the things that may have caused me to fail were *really* avoidable. I understand that I am probably not meant for social work due to not being very professionally responsible, and I plan to pursue something else after my degree, but the fact that I might have thrown three years down the drain with nothing to show for it sickens me. If I do fail this close to the end, I'll feel like the biggest disappointment/embarrassment and I have no clue how I'd tell my family.

I'm already super behind for a 24 year old. I've always struggled in the work place (especially because I have dyspraxia too). Plus, I've already dropped out of a degree when I was 18 (although that was more to do with physical/mental health problems than incompetencey). I have no idea where to go from here and I'm afraid. 

I have a supervision with my practice educator tomorrow (who sounds like she is at her wits end with me). If anyone has any advice concerning getting through the last bit of my degree somehow, I'd appreciate it. Or if there's any advice on what to do if I *do* fail and have to come to terms with the fact that I wasted three years, I'd also appreciate it.",3,adhd
"I cant sleep, all week I haven’t been able to sleep at all or barely. 

It’s 6 am right now and I feel like I’m full of energy but at the same time moments from passing out. 

I feel like I’m about to start crying and punching shit but at the same time I can’t move. 

Im scared as shit right now and I feel like I’m being watched but I know it’s stupid but I have this feeling like something sinister  is going to happen. 

All week I’ve had this feeling looming over me that something bad will happen, I brush it off as my anxiety but I feel like something is actually going to happen this time. 

I cant even recognize myself anymore, I look in the mirror and I just stare blankly every time I look I look different, my eyes change or my eyebrows of how my face shape is. 

Randomly when I’m having a conversation with someone it’s like my entire body freezes and it’s like when your in a dream and you realize your in a dream and everything feels unreal, and like everyone is trying to kill you . 

I freeze up and it’s like my soul fucking leaves my body and I’m unable to move and it’s like my body shuts down and I can’t talk and my eyes start tearing up and I start freaking the fuck out. 

I keep having images of myself pop into my head , but sometimes when it happens it sends me into a panic because I can’t recognize myself i don’t know how to explain it, it’s like someone took over my body and it’s not me anymore like I’ve been fucking replaced but I’m still In my body. 

I don’t know if it makes sense and I don’t know how to explain it In words it’s just a feeling I get it’s like pure terror when it happens and I sit there and it’s like I can’t breathe for a bit. 

My heart is beating so fast and I feel like I’m about to cry I don’t know what’s happening but I’m fucking scared , I feel like something in the universe shifted and something is wrong. 

It’s been like this for a while it’s like one day somethint changed, I don’t know what it was but the world changed. 

At my old school I would have this same feeling and I would have to speed walk through the hallways so I wouldn’t start crying, it’s like everyone was staring at me.

"I’m in this discord server and every single time I say something not absolutely literal, or make a claim outlandish, everyone just spams the chat and laughs and then just ignores me having to explain myself. I used to reply in small responses to try and stand up for myself against any single claim, but at one point I decided that every single message would just get buried. So i would just put everything i need to say in one text and send it, except now i’m being made fun of for constantly sending “walls of text.” 

Every single conversation like that becomes an argument and it looks more and more like I’m the villain when the reality is i only talk about things I’m confident in and when i’m wrong i admit i’m wrong; and if i don’t know something I ask questions and will immediately correct it to fit the facts. But this group of people constantly insist i’m wrong instead of taking 2 seconds to listen to my perspective, and in the rare chance that i can actually convey what i mean correctly and adequately, they do admit i have a point. But i always feel like i have a point and before i can correctly explain it, they’re already making fun of me or just dismiss it entirely.

I know at the end of the day nobody has an ego and everyone involved has the power to be convinced, i just feel like i’m constantly having to explain myself and nobody ever takes time to give a piece of mind to my perspective, i feel like it’s always constantly dismissed. I’ve found that in other social situations people do like my thoughts and ideas, so I feel like I have built up enough reputation to have confidence; but in others i feel like they’re totally dismissed purely because i can’t ever convey it correctly.

I don’t know who it is or why this is happening. It’s making me really insecure, someone hates me that much to do all these things and I don’t even know how much worse they’re going to get. I wish I could find out who is doing all these stupid things.

"I went through a series of depression due to lockdown before. I felt so useless because I was fired from my job, and finding new jobs had been fruitless effort. I don't have any money to provide for my two kids, and had to solely depends on my wife income (she's a public servant, so her being fired is almost impossible). I tried my hands at several things, trying my best to find an income to at least pay my bills and commitment, but none yield any results. Banks had been chasing me to pay my mortgage and car loans, adding to the pressure. Because I am somewhat religious, I do not have any suicide thoughts, but the thought of dying is better than living kept lingering in my mind.

As luck would have it, mid 2021 I got a job offer at a startup company (at the time I don't care what it is, I just applied randomly), and I immediately joined the company, despite the salary offered far lower than my previous job (12k a year compared to 78k a year in my previous job). The job itself is mentally draining, but I had determined to prove myself.

So within a year, I went from the lowest position to being one of the top management, and my salary increased to 30k a year. I had my goals to help this startup company to become at least medium sized company. The job is hard, with me often staying in the office after 10 p.m. even though there's no overtime pay, dealing with clients, messy process and issues working with partner company. But I persisted. I have clear goals, and with my experience, I know what to do. The salary still not enough, but at least I can pay part of the commitment I have while the rest I refinance to pay lower amount.

But then, at the end of last year, my mom fell ill (heart attack, stroke, and malnutrition). Malnutrition part is due to wrong advise given by the nutritionist (my mom opted for APD dialysis, but the nutritionist gave the diet for normal dialysis). I took a month break from working to take care of my mother and my kids (my parents took care of them when me and my wife work).

In that time, apparently, my assistant wasn't able to cope well with the job I had given, and tendered her resignation to the owner of the company. The owner, called everyone from my department and apparently almost everyone have a problem with me. The main issue, I was not a ""leader"", but a ""manager"". Now the owner of the company became emotional and he dropped me from the position I held at the time, and told me to do other things, without listening to my side of the story.

From then on, he kept dismissing my ideas, highlighted my mistakes frequently without looking at what I had achieved, and held meeting daily to see what I have done for the day. The consequences of dropping me from the position I held? The department is crucial due to the bulkiness of profits comes from my department, but now it is mismanaged, there's no clear goals, and dissatisfaction among the clients kept on rising. Several signs of a failing business had begun to emerge. I myself had lost motivation. It became harder and harder for me to stay after hours like I previously did, and even the smallest matter made me take leave. I couldn't stay there.

My wife's attitude with me had changed since I got fired, and she seems to lost her respects to me (I think this is part of the things that spark my depression in the first place), as I couldn't provide for the family. But nowadays my wife's attitude had been getting worse and worse. She lost her temper almost everyday, and kept shouting and screaming at me, in front of the kids. I tried my best to be patience, but it broke my heart. My kids too seems to have followed their mothers footstep, yelling and screaming at me when I didn't adhere what they wanted. I still love them, but I don't know how long I could hold on.

I usually have three places that becomes my solace, where I feel happy to be there and it helps me deals with my stress. But now, the three of them, the office, my home, and my parents home, had become the worst hell for me. I am dying inside. My tears aren't coming out anymore. The feeling of thinking that dying is better had resurface. I saw graves, and thought that how good it is if it was me in there. I saw a fatal traffic accident, I thought how good it is if that was me. I still held the believe that suicide is not the way, but still, death seems to be the sweet release from all of this.

If anyone read this until this part. Thank you. I had no place or outlet for me to rant. To express what I felt inside. To meet with psychiatrist is not something I have money to spend on. In fact, currently I only have 50 bucks in my pocket to last me for two weeks. This is how I get by every month. So, this is the only place I can rant anonymously. Again, if you read until this part, thank you, from the bottom of my heart.",2,depression
"I've not failed any course by the moment, but I think I will by the end of this academic semester. This week I've failed two exams and later today I'm sure that I will fail another. I got minimun grades last year (my first) in order to pass the semester. Being an expert procastinator takes this to a whole new level. I never do anything on time and study hours before exams. The reasons of this behavior are my experiences during classes. I'm the one who never answers the professor's questions, the one who's never chosen for any team's work and the one who fails a lot of exams.

"Like whenever friends would flake on me all the time, ghost me, not invite me to friend group hangouts, I would always be devastated. This keeps happening to me all the time, and due to being bullied and made fun of for being ""weird"" growing up, it hit really hard.


I recently found out one friend group I'm in, where I thought everyone was hella tight knit and close to eachother... was actually very casual and not close at all. And I realized that a lot of people I thought I was close friends with viewed me as acquaintances. When I go into friendships I look for people I can have really deep connections with, and it has never dawned on me that other people just want someone to have fun with. 

This is so weird to me, but that doesn't mean that it's not normal. It's just different from what I want. They aren't villains, and I'm not an underdog, we just want different things. Still weird to me how people will talk about their deeply traumatic childhood to people they only wanna go bar hopping with, but then again, alcohol can make people spill these things out.


Anyhow, I mention all this in here bc apparently it's a thing with a lot of people on the spectrum; we want an almost soul bounding connection, not just with a romantic partner, but with our friends. And those not on the spectrum seem cool with spending a lot of their time with people they don't really care about all that much. Weird to me, but who am I to judge?

Honestly, knowing this is making my life a lot easier. Now I don't perseverate over why I wasn't invited to the pool party, if I'm a horrible person, or if they are evil and untrustworthy. I just move on.

"I have major depressive disorder for many years. But I am not suicidal and have never attempted suicide. But I was locked in the Citrus Health Network by the Baker Act and kept under stress for 29 hours.  They threatened me, exacerbated all my phobias, brought me to a big panic attack and a heart attack. They forced me to sleep on a very hard bed in a terrible cold, although I warned them about the big problems in my spine. I could hardly move from the pain and could not sleep. After this ""medical care"", my life is broken, but no one answered for these crimes. When I tried to sue them, the state court dismissed my case because Citrus uses the federal budget, after which the federal court dismissed the case again because everything happened because of the Florida state law (Baker Act)! There was a catch 22. The judicial system does not allow to judge the tormentors! Where is the justice? Where is the humanity? I went to the doctors for help with my depression, but instead of help, they killed my health completely. What to do? These killer doctors continue to torture sick people!

"I am pretty active on twitter under a pseudonym. Recently, I've grown incredibly suspicious of a handful of my followers. I feel like two/three in particular are plotting against me. I think one of them is trying to push me out of the fandom space in order to take over my position. I think another one is posting seemingly innocuous tweets where she talks negatively about a character I like, and that these tweets are directed at me in order to make me feel bad because she wants me dead/away. I think a third one is pushing my buttons a little bit. I think people in general are surveiling me because they dislike me and are waiting for an opportunity to attack me. I'm afraid that some people are gonna stalk or doxx me.

Thing is, twitter can be ruthless, so it's not like my fears are completely unfounded. I don't have any definitive proof that these people are out to get me, just a feeling. 

The issue is that it's affecting my real life a lot. I struggle to sleep because I'm so anxious. I have nightmares. I have been growing increasingly fond of alcohol to lessen the feelings.

The problem is I cannot search ""high protein muffin recipe"" without getting results geared towards health nuts. I'm looking for a muffin with lots of protein - I don't care about low carb low cal low sugar low fat whatever. I'm trying really hard to regain/maintain a healthy relationship with food, but all these suggestions seem to be coming from a place of borderline orthorexia. 

I guess I'm just frustrated that the obsession with ""healthy living"" and diet culture make it so there is no option between indifference and obsession.

I talk to my therapist about that and she didn't say anything much about this, she just asked me some questions. Usually, I am very anxious and paranoid about everything, for exemple : the other night, my dad's girlfriend made food for me and my brother but I didn't eat it because I was scared that she put something bad in it. Those paranoid episodes affected my friendship with my ex best friend : I had a boyfriend and I thought she was gonna stole him from me and I thought he liked her so I broke up with him and stopped my friendship with her. I lost all my friends after that.

I was diagnosed with autism during all of that (I don't know if it has a relation with that)

When is enough, enough? 

Suicide seems so easy in theory but when it comes down to it, it's a lot harder than it seems. 

The thought of ending it is all consuming. The more I try to not think about it, the more I think about it. 
Every second of every minute, every minute of every hour, every hour of every day.

"Hi i am a 25 year old male and ive never been a good writer or been very good at describing how but here is me giving it a try .
i feel or maybe it feels that way now because to be honest i feel like i dont even know who i am anymore.
I feel like i have been depressed for most of my life and i feel like i am living through a third person view i can hear see and feel what is around me but it is like i have no emotional repsonse to anything almost as if i was blank. I do not want to live like this anymore sometimes i even ask myself if i even want to live because i dont see the point in anything, everything just seems like a struggle. The hardest part about all of this is, I basically have no social life.

When i look back i never had many friends but i was always outgoing as a young kid   I had a lot of people who wanted to be my friend  thought i was cool but i never knew how to maintain a relationship
Today when i am around people i feel as if i am a ghost and have nothing to bring and give to a conversation i feel empty and hollow, it is almost as if i was a zombie i hear people talk but nothing comes to mind to add it is almost as if i am frozen watching people in my own body not being able to react.
this for me is the hardest part to live with because i just want to be able to have friends and make connections with people more than anything but i just cant seem to do it anymore, it used to be natural when i was younger but it seems to slowly have started to fade away piece by piece.

I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder at around the age of 13 but it has been slowly getting worse as to now feeling like i have severe social anxiety and bordeline agoraphobia.
This is my first time even trying to describe my emotions which is really hard but it feels nice putting them down almost giving me a sense of existence.

I was always passionate about things i would read and learn new topics, i had a deep desire to be alive to feel and be someone i had things to talk about but now i feel as if this is all gone and i really just dont feel anything anymore.
Almost as if my brain does not fucntion everything is hard to do and even feels like i have an attention dissorder at this point where even if i was interested in something i wouldnt have enough mental
Strength to focus on the topic which leaves me wandering through life not knowing what to do or who to be.
I feel like i just getting worse as time goes on and i almost feel like soon i wont even care anymore, i guess since i am writing this i do care and i do want to be here,
But if things keep going this way i just do not see a point anymore, i will probably just isolate myself even more and become suicidal but somwhere deep inside myself i do feel like there is hope, i wish i had a answer to these issues but i dont, i just wish i had someone who could help me figure this out everything just feels so lonely and i do not want to live like this anymore",2,depression

This was right before Mother’s Day and I had also gotten my mom a card so she would have something from me. But as I was preparing to overdose, something in me told me not to.

In the year that has gone by, I have moved countries this January back to where I grew up.I have seen family that I haven’t seen in years, reconnected with old friends, and explored places that I haven’t been to since I was a child. All things that I would have missed if I had gone through with my plans that day.

The first couple of months that I have been back, I reached a new low. I felt overwhelmed with the move I had just made, the rental crisis here in Australia and  trying to sort out transferring universities. I started to have suicidal ideations again but this time I reached out for help. I got the help that I have needed and I am so happy that I have made it to where I am now. I had to put my own personal shame aside so that I could help myself.

To anyone in a similar situation as I was, just wait. I know you probably roll your eyes when people tell you “it gets better”, because I used to be skeptical too, but it does eventually get better. Although I still have hard days and I am not happy all of the time, I have found hope and a purpose. I am glad to still be here today.",2,depression

"She loves her family but also is fearful of conflict with her parents. So as much as she loves them, and is willing to do what they ask, she will go out of her way to ensure they are not angered.

This ""going out of her way"" has entered our relationship.

We started dating at 24, and now were 29.

When we started dating and still to now she needs to ask to use her parents vehicle because she still has not got one yet due to focusing on school and not work.

She has a curfew living at home, and she follows it very closely. She has never slept over at my house and any time she has been like 30 mins to an hour late her dad will blow up her phone, and yell at her for disobeying his house rules... despite her age. This has affected us because she has slept over maybe 5 times in the years together, but she has to lie and say she slept over at a friends house.

She and I lived together for 3 years during college. She made me agree to never tell her parents that we lived together and so any time I speak to them about college I had to lie. She was paranoid and worried that they would disown her because she was living in sin (catholic) since we were not married. So for 3 years, anytime they came to visit I had to move all of my stuff out, and further continue to lie.

One time her dad mentioned that I should lose weight because I look unhealthy. I shrugged it off, but what annoyed me more was that she didnt stand up for me since she was at dinner and heard that be said. Her siblings told him to cut it out and such but she didnt. She just apologized for her father and said ""thats how he is.""

She and I have sex, and she is very worried they will find out, not just like caught in the action find out, but even birth control wise. Her sister was on birth control for period pains and her mom found out and forced her to get off of it. So in the years together she and I do NO form of PDA in front of her parents.

She got a tattoo and has to wear make up to hide it for fear her parents will yell at her.

Finally, this has been a huge mental struggle of mine. I have been in therapy because of this. But she got an abortion, our contraception failed. Her fears of her parents finding out came up and she felt depressed, numb, and even suicidal. She didnt want them to find out about being pregnant out of marriage, and so she went ahead with it. She was very much against the idea but her fear of her parents outweighed her wants.

Further and sadly, she blamed me for her abortion months later. I talked with my therapist and they mentioned how she is projecting her wishes to keep our baby and since we weren't married, she blames me, despite her clear reasons being her parents.

I understand the red flags here. I do. 

But I want to understand what is going on with her. I wish she didnt have so much paranoia and didnt let her parents affect her decisions so much. 

She doesn't see how unhealthy her fear of her parents is, I brought it up once around when we had an abortion and she almost left me because it was as if she couldn't face the truth.

"I've had some sort of personality fixation that I can't back away from, so I need answers based on what I've said below:
I want to start by saying that I am a minor. My whole family is closed and frankly strange, it’s immediately clear that I went all in them, so I doubt that it’s an injury or something like that, it’s clearly genes.
I was in a psychiatric hospital, but it didn’t help me in any way, through an endless amount of tantrums, I learned to hide my emotions, and then I was released after 2 months.
I am still on pills, but they do not help, sessions with a psychologist too. Doctors do not understand why nothing works, and I have already ceased to believe in therapy.
I am very bad with social contact, every time I have contact with people (even now), I get wildly worried. For me, the most ordinary things like friendship, love or ordinary communication is something unimaginably difficult. I literally Googled ""How do you start conversations? How do you start dating? How do you end a conversation?"" and everything like that. I do not know how to conduct empty conversations, I literally have nothing to discuss with others. My voice is monotonous and lifeless, it is unlikely that people will be interested in listening to me.
I hate myself, I'm helpless compared to other teenagers, I have no interests (even what causes at least some emotions is very boring and turns into a routine almost immediately), prolonged depression and a year of apathy and, possibly, anhedonia (?)
It is very difficult for me, I am very tired, rest has not helped for a long time, every day is filled with disappointment and self-abasement, although I understand that this does not make sense. There is and will not be any sense in any of my actions, I will not be able to achieve anything because of my psyche. Even when I was set up confidently and positively to win, it did not help anything, since then I consider every action a failure.
The psychologist diagnosed ""personality disorder"" after studying what it is, I studied it, noticed numerous similarities with borderline disorder, so I may have BPD, the psychologist refused to voice the full diagnosis. She was still mistaken in many ways and behaved, frankly, creepy, so I insisted on changing the psychologist, I will go to her soon.
I have huge memory problems, I can’t remember what happened yesterday or even today, it seems that the days drag on endlessly.
It was very difficult for me to write this, my thoughts diverge or stick together into an incomprehensible haze, it took me a very long time to write this, my concentration is at zero, I don’t even understand what I wanted to say, but I’m interested in this: what kind of diagnosis? What is wrong with me? How to help it? Please, I need some answers, guidance, direction, advice, whatever! I no longer understand what to do.",2,depression
"It's been a few days since my budgie ciel died.The first day felt strange,i don't know how to explain it but it just didn't feel that horrible.The next days became worse,i believe that's when it finally hit me,maybe i was still in denial about the whole thing but i'm not sure,however i know that it was only after i buried him that i was at my worst.

Ciel was given to me as a gift by a relative,i never even thought about getting a pet bird,but when i did i fell in love with him,he was so gentle,cute and very sweet,the most innocent creature in my world and my best friend...Now he's gone.

I feel awful,it was all my fault.I wish he had a different owner ,maybe that way he wouldn't have died so soon.What hurts me the most is that i know i could have done better,for the past two months i wasn't able to spend much time with him because i have an internship,so i'm not at home during the day,and when i'm back i have to go work on my assignments and some college projects.Of course he would be in my room while im doing my work but i was mostly focusing on the tasks i had,it was a really tough time for me because of all the things i had to do,but i hate myself for it,i should have spent more time with him.

I have no idea why he passed away,was he sick?or maybe being alone affected his health?I can't know the reason anymore,but during his last week he slept a lot more than usual,he seemed so weak to me,he wasn't as energetic as he used to be and i was really worried for him,he was probably sick,i wanted to take him to the vet but i could not afford it,seeing him that way broke my heart i even cried that day,i had a feeling that he was dying,i don't know why or how but i just felt it,that he only had so little left to live.I refused to believe it..i told myself that i was just paranoid and that he was going to be better soon,that i was wrong and that there was no way he was dying.I was going to buy him a friend that weekend,i went to the pet store and the guy working there told me there were no budgies left but on sunday he would be bringing them.I was happy ,now he was getting some company!But the next day i woke up a bit late,my sister came into my room and told me the news,all she said was one word: ""Ciel..."", and i understood.

That day i was still composed,now i can barely do anything right,i'm thinking about him 24/7,i have a report ive been writing and sometimes id just burst out in tears,i can't even count how many times i have cried in the last few days,it's the worst thing that has ever happened in my life.I was depressed years ago but nothing comes close to losing someone dear to you,it's too much..it hurts too much,the pain,sadness and regrets...his death absolutely shattered me.I cannot do anything without thinking about him,he's always on my mind.Earlier i was going through my gallery looking for some screenshots and i saw a picture of him i had taken before,i couldn't look at it,i looked away the moment i spotted it and i put my phone away,i don't understand why but i cannot bring myself to look at any of his photos.

Today i woke up and i realized once again that i didn't tell him goodnight the day before,it was something i always did when he was still with me,and now i feel empty.When im in the kitchen i unconsciously think about how its time to give him his food,but the next second im reminded that he's not here anymore.

I miss him a lot,i want to see him and listen to his cute chirps again,i want to see him healthy and happy...I try to tell myself that he is in a better place now,but it doesn't help at all,in fact all it does is hurt and make me cry again.Why did he have to go?Why so soon?I wanted to do so many things for him,i was going to get a job soon,then i'd be able to give him many things, take him to a vet,buy him toys,and just take better care of him..but he left without all of that..before i even had the chance to do anything for him,i hate myself for not being able to provide things for him before he died,i feel so guilty for not being a good owner.It's all my fault..

It's so unfair..I just want him back..",2,depression

"So I'll start by saying that I don't really have anyone I'd consider my friends, until I started working a new job and I become friends with some people and then we all became one group of friends.

They are only in my city for university and then are heading back home over summer, but will come back once university starts again. As it is their last week here, we all planned TOGETHER to go out and get drinks and have fun.

Which was supposed to be today, yet none of them are answering me back but I can see on snapchat maps that they are all together and active.

So basically my only ""real"" friends have just left me out and now I feel alone again. Actually more alone than before because I convinced myself these people actually liked me, but now I'm thinking they only pretended to like me.

I don't know what advice I want, maybe should I confront them about how much it hurt me that they just left me? Should I keep being friends with them and just ""move on"" from this?

"For the last few months I feel like I have lost the ability to care about whether I live or die. I am by no means suicidal, but sometimes feel like it would almost be preferable to die rather than continue the same cycle of life I am currently in. The weird thing is that I do have a good life. I had a very traumatic upbringing but have found happiness as a young adult, especially in my career. Ever since starting anti-depressants, I have also found it easier to socialise and keep hobbies. I have good relationships, and don't struggle to get out of bed in the morning anymore / be productive. But at the root of it all I just feel exhausted. Even with the small moments of joy life offers, the pain that comes with being alive – loss, suffering, fear – almost seem like they outweigh the good. 

Recently I had to have an op and went under anaesthetic. When I came around I began crying because I didn't want to wake up and told the nurse I wanted to die. She put it down to withdrawal from the anaesthetic, not knowing my psyche over the last few months. Like I said, I am not suicidal, but I just feel like I'm struggling to find the will every day to care about whether I live or die. It's as though the state of the world and the actual fact of existence seems less preferable to me than the alternative.

"Today, a girl seated in front of me in class keep shooting glances at me every so often. It made me very anxious and scared but I tried my best to ignore it. Until the teacher came down and asked the girl next to her if she was being too chatty, she replied “No, I’m depressed”, then quickly corrected herself to “I don’t talk much” and glanced at me again. She was talking about me. It took everything for me to not start crying right then and there. This isn’t the first time someone have noticed my dark gloom, but I’ve never had someone made a remark like that in front of me. I don’t know what I was expecting, she’s completely correct. But I tried so hard to appear normal, to mask my anxiety and sorrow but it never works. I have garnered so much unwanted attention from doing absolutely nothing, I keep asking myself is it that horrible? Is my depression so bad strangers take one look at me and know. Worst part is, no one ever asked if I was okay directly. People only make remarks on my condition like that. I didn’t think it was possible to hate myself even more, I want to disappear.

"I just got out of todays therapy session. Last week I actually got a lot out and felt good about myself for once. Today I barely said anything. I couldn't. I just kept thinking in my head about all these things and situations and overthinking and analyzing and deducing. I tried to tell her that this was happening but it was like there was a wall. I would think in my head of what to say but nothing would come out, like when i thought about the words it was like i was mentally putting them on some high up pedestal that I just couldnt reach. This happens all the time and it's led to me being extremely reserved. I barely talk to anyone and I hate myself for it because I want to be able to make friends and whatnot but i can just never reach the words. There's a girl i like and so when I get the chance ill try to to talk to her. its like i have to drain my entire battery life so to speak in order to make conversation with her, but i try anyway. it works but the second i start thinking about confessing my feelings the wall comes up again and i just can't speak and have to talk about something else or tell her that i have to go. this has gone on since about halfway through our senior year, and it's funny because the other day we were chatting in the parking lot of our school and one of her friends came up to her and she introduced me to them and described me as being ""kind and super sweet"" and the three of us talked for a good while longer. She's called me cute before and has complimented my outfits a lot, too. I know i should feel good about these things but for some reason when I think about it I get angry, because it takes so much effort for me to speak to her at all. My anxiety flares up and I feel my chest squeezing and compressing the whole time, and i hate it so much. i genuinely love talking with her and i hate that it's almost painful to do so. 

after the botched therapy session today i seriously have started to feel scared of myself because i've been considering harming myself. and i hate that because i feel like i don't deserve to feel so bad. i live in a nice house with successful parents and go to a nice school. i should have everything i need to succeed too, but here i am. i can't focus on my work and i am a completely average student academically and am even may be at risk of not meeting one of the graduation requirements with only 10 days left..

my therapist took note of how i was behaving today and suggested i increase my dosage or change medication. i am on two medications at high dosages already and i've tried many, many different meds and dosages. nothing has truly helped with my anxiety and constant racing thoughts. its hard not to feel like i'm unfixable.

i know this is the internet and most people aren't going to care but my therapist is going to be gone next week and i don't feel comfortable talking about my mental health with anyone else in my life and just needed to vent. if anyone has read this far i could really use some sort of response, some sort of advice. please and thank you",4,anxiety

"For years, I keep wanting to implement positive changes but haven't found success. Part of it is depression, which is being treated, and ADHD is just recently being treated, but it's still hard to do things I KNOW are good for me. I have inspiring revelations late at night that seem to be completely out of my reach the next day.

I want to eat healthier, exercise, have a small skincare routine, etc. I want prioritize buying myself things that I need rather than what I want. I want to read, learn a language, or meditate.  These are things I've recently learned people do as acts of comfort and self-care, and they enjoy it. But not me - some of my self-care and comfort habits are in junk food, doing the exact opposite of exercise, and struggling to brush my teeth twice a day. Even the healthy food I buy, most of it goes to waste because of the effort or it's less convenient than frozen dinner or fast food.


I can't quite get into doing the better things or feel like I'm doing them for me.  When I buy takeout or X hobby item (that at this point I'm just collecting instead of doing), I get the feeling like that's doing something for myself. But spending the same amount of money on new clothes that I need or a skincare product to get me started? Can't seem to do it, or if I do, I don't use it then feel bad about my current condition.

What I want is to get that same ""comfort"" feeling from the more uplifting things than the harmful/unhelpful things. Is it that I don't want these things ""bad enough"" so my brain doesn't steer me towards them?

I would love to hear the strategies, and even the baby steps, anyone has taken to do more uplifting comfort/self-care things. How do you even get started? How do you learn to love and get pleasure from these things and prioritize them over the other less-helpful acts?",3,adhd

"Hello everybody, I am M 21  
This is my first post on this sub and I think its going to be a long one. I think I am starting to develop some kind of social anxiety or something similar, let me tell you how it all started. I was always a very outgoing person, never really had trouble with meeting new people or finding myself in a new crowd. I could even say I was life of the party many times. But lately, circa half a year ago I started to feel anxious when I was having lunch at work. Which was weird because I never had anything similar happen to me. I just ignored it and carried on like nothing is happening. Then I started having the same feeling when I was having lunch with my friends, but the feeling went away as soon as I left the table so I didn’t worry about it that much. Until one day, I call the breaking point, I was taking an midterm and was doing fine, I knew the answers, but in the middle of it I started feeling nauseas and went to the toilet to clear my head, hopping I could finish my exam, but to my surprise I just couldn’t concentrate anymore. And since the breaking point I am starting to feel anxious in many more situations, like presenting in front of the class or even just sitting in the classroom and listening to lectures. I still can not pinpoint the source of the problem, my main suspect is stress, because I do have I very busy life juggling job, college and my semi-professional sport career, maybe it all just came chorusing down on me lately I really don’t know…  
I am really afraid in what ways will this affect my life… But I decided to fight and overcome some of the fears which are totally new to me, I find it scary and at the same time a bit shocking how fast anxiety took over my life

"Hey, so my girlfriend recently went to a mental health hospital for PTSD. She's been having flashbacks and panic attacks for a couple days related to a trigger - she's sick and I won't get into it but obviously she has trauma related to that sort of thing. I'm just feeling absolutely sick with worry. We're long distance, she's from Michigan USA. She told me she was voluntarily going and they're likely going to take her phone, which they have. She wasn't self harming, suicidal, or a danger to anyone around her either btw..I just have no contact with her or anyone around her.. And so, my question is, how long may they keep her for? I keep seeing stuff about 72 hours. It's been 24 hours since she went. Any constructive information is very much so appreciated. But please, I don't really wanna hear any bad things about this right now. I'm worried enough.. Thanks for reading.

Edit: I have no idea which hospital she could be in.",2,depression

I struggle with everything. I find it hard to speak, I can’t make eye contact, I have sensory issues real bad, I can’t read very well, I can’t focus, I only have a few interests and that’s all I want, I don’t communicate often because I don’t know how, I am bad at social interactions.That’s just the start. I have autism but recently it came up that I have schizophrenia whilst I was getting a diagnosis. I don’t really believe it. I mean I feel like I’m being followed constantly. But I’m the last few weeks things have gotten bad. I’ve been getting real bad nosebleeds which I swear something is causing. My eye has been twitching too and it feels like something is wrong with me. But I always feel like I’m not alone. I constantly hear the sounds of people around me or a door opening. I sometimes see people outside my window in the dark staring into my window while I’m trying to sleep. I can’t stand loud noises and break down and cry over them. I don’t control my emotions well nor do I understand any of this. I sometimes feel like ripping my hair out or cause myself to be unable to hear. I apparently mumble about random things all the time. I do not notice these things. I can’t stand people touching my stuff for the fear of what they will do. I feel like the people around are just trying to hurt me. I have no motivation yet changes in schedule overwhelm me and I end up having a meltdown. I don’t know what to do. I’m going to see my therapist tomorrow so you think it’s a good idea to maybe tell her about these feelings. What’s your opinion on it?",6,schizophrenia
"I feel like such an awful person because I was fired for insubordination and passive aggressive behavior. I worked at a preschool that had some skewed values. My bosses verbatim told me they believe in using micromanagement. I also asked my supervisor to please kindly not speak to me 
in a certain way, as she was beginning to be snappy and short. We had a great rapport at first and I felt comfortable expressing this. She became very power over. She replied “You just need to nod your head and say ‘Yes ok got it’”. I told her so nicely and it was just such a sudden change in her demeanor. I don’t work well with supervisors like that nor do most people. 

I was constantly told I’m inflexible for pointing out things many, many other people would frequently complain about. Things my bosses previously apologized for and said they never wanted to happen to an employee again they used against me. Such as, they said parents were complaining about a specific teacher that I also brought up to them, as did many other teachers. Then, they mentioned that in my firing that I was causing too many problems with that instance in particular. That makes no sense. Obviously a bullshit reason. 

I just wonder what the kids think, what the parents think, what the uninvolved coworkers think. I know the families were probably told something vague, but it is totally against everything I strive for to seem as though I just up and left. It hurts to know the kids probably think I abandoned them without warning. I had such good bonds with all of them. I wonder what all the gossip is about me. I know I was liked by many, and I do always strive in being honest so at least I have that.",3,adhd

"I get so scared that hell kill me whenever he’s mad at me. He was yelling at me earlier for not cleaning the cat litter/was saying I was wasting my life and that I’m lazy and stupid and whatnot. Then he yelled at his GF and they fought for a while.

I’m so afraid he’ll snap and kill me if I go to sleep. He’s never hit me before, but I’m scared. He gets into this blind rage (similar to tonight but usually much worse) where he says the absolute most horrible things.

"All my anxiety comes from the fear of being alone. I'm in my 40's. Married with 2 kids, 16 and 19. One in college. When my wife is going out of town for the weekend, even if my kids might be around I get anxiety. I get it a week before it is even happening. I get anxiety about the anxiety I imagine i'm going to feel when i'm alone. Thing is, i'm not already so bad when I'm alone. I used to be. These days it can be ok. But yet I still worry and get a lot of anxiety just thinking about being alone.

Even if it's just the thought of I might be on my own in the evening, or maybe I might working at home on my own (my wife and I both work from home, but she goes out to meetings often during the day).

I am, and have been, in therapy - and we focus on how I can rewire my thought about being scared. Is that how you get over it? Or is there a way to figure out why I feel this way? And if it's just about replacing the negative thoughts, the fear, with positive ""it's going to be ok, there is nothing to worry about"" thougths, what's the best way of doing that?   I also exercise, i run.

I remember one time I was in a psych ward really far from home. The staff did vending machine runs for the patients once a day and I had a 20 so I asked for something. They said they didn’t/ couldn’t change it for me so I couldn’t buy something. I was bummed when a lady I talked to a bit gave me a dollar. I remember telling her “I can’t pay you back.” And she said “Nothing in this life is promised.” I thought it was a beautifully profound thing and I think about that and her quite frequently.

"Ok, so I haven’t ever actually gone this in depth explaining what I experience. Like ever. And it might seem weird that I would feel comfortable telling strangers on the internet, but that’s just where I’m at right now. 

Ever since I was a kid, I have felt like someone could see me. Like all the time. Not necessarily in a malicious out to get me way, just like someone could always see me. And what’s weird is that it’s not super specific or thinking there is a specific motive. And what’s even weirder is that it’s usually characters of a show or movie I just watched. That’s the most embarrassing part. Because I KNOW they aren’t real people. So when I dispute the cognitive distortion, my stupid brain switches it to the actor that can see me. 

I’m also pretty sure someone in the government can see everything electronically that I do and is judging me constantly to the point where most of the time I can’t write in a word document, it has to be by hand if I’m writing notes or journaling. 

And all of this is exhausting. So sometimes I will get to the point where I just say “whatever” and go about my day. Or I might explain what I’m doing because I don’t want to be misunderstood by whoever can see me. 

All while being fully aware that it’s extremely likely no one freaking cares or is watching me. Like I’m delusional enough for it to affect my actions, but not so much that I would argue for it being reality. Like I know it’s not real.

He told me he had a girlfriend, and got really mad at our friends for telling me.

  
He cut off all contact with me after. I blocked him on Instagram after he rejected my Instagram request. I was so sad that the guy I liked decided it would be best if he never saw me again.

"Hey guys, I’m writing this as best as I can because I still feel fragmented- like right and left are not connected- in my body or in the world. I don’t use drugs a lot. I guess you could say all the “weed and mushrooms are the new frontier and they will cure everything” talk got to me. A yer ago I tried a very small dose of weed edibles. I had a full on psychedelic experience where I was stuck in a time loop, nothing was real and time stopped making sense. I had what i now realize is a psychotic break. A year later I still wasn’t recovered. 
This weekend, stupidly, I did mushrooms. I believed all that talk about expanding drugs, how they can only help you, etc. it was even worse. I felt full on fragmentation, I could only talk in the third person referring to myself. I can’t even say it was myself talking, I truly was other people. Even now I feel my left and right brain as separate entities. I experiences the worst and deports terror I could possibly imagine, with no way out. No solution. 
It also confused me even more about time. I’m screaming still whenever I have to think of any temporal concept, time is sideways now. It makes no sense. I can’t function. I feel like I’m not here, time isn’t here, it doesn’t go forward. It’s all jumbled. 
I regret doing this. My brain is broken now forever. Do you feel this time perception with schizophrenia? I don’t have schizophrenia but when I was in college even smoking a little bit made me entirely paranoid, which is why I lost interest in drugs for my adult life. Fuck, even typing this the timeline doesn’t make sense of being in college then later then now.",6,schizophrenia

"Hey all, idk if I'm paranoid because when I'm in the middle of my thoughts I'm telling myself I'm being paranoid. Idk if being able to call myself out for being irrational or *sounding* irrational negates anything about it, but I thought I'd share anyways

Let me start this out by saying I have a history of religion related issues. Most recently, I think I'm a mistake from God or that God wants me back in some way; I nearly died all throughout my infancy and my birth(c-section) was very traumatic and near fatal for both my mom and I. I met someone today who, within the first hour of talking to them, told me that demi-gods live among us and the church is trying to hide that. They told me God loves me and that the stones I wear as a necklace are masculinizing my face through magic.
I fully do not believe God loves me. I think God wants me to fuckin kill myself since he couldn't take me out as a child.
Anyways I can't really get what they said out of my head.

Also, today my manager told me he full on had people watching him with cameras and shit. Took pictures of these people and everything. They had recording devices and told me how they pretending to park in a neighbor's driveway to watch him through binoculars. He said they were trying to watch him to look for evidence of insurance fraud since he had gotten severely injured that required surgery and they were looking for evidence that he was lying.
That also freaked me out because I often feel like I'm being followed or watched in public. I start noticing things, little slip ups. Seemingly completely different parties whispering to each other as they swiftly walk by, then clearing their throats around me like some sort of code. People staring at me in public, slowing down in their cars as they pass me on the sidewalk, and other little things I don't remember off the top of my head now.

"TL;DR: Lot of sad shit happened to me and while I was positive for most of it, this week I suddenly became more sad and suddenly lost care for a lot of things and lost enjoyment in everything. Do I have depression or am I just going through a tough time?

Before I start, I am unsure if this is the subreddit I should use. I am new to reddit and looked up ""depression"" to talk about this. If there is a better place to ask this or if this ain't where I should, just tell me. So, the last 2 months have been nothing but a nightmare for me. It started when my parents started arguing a lot, and then later, I found out they are planning to get a divorce. My dad is heartless about it and being an asshole to my mom while my mom is crushed, feels lonely as hell, and has been going to my sister and I for emotional support. Then a few weeks of this and I start to feel sad, and I got less affectionate with my gf because of my sadness. My gf then dumps me, saying she ""hasn't loved me for a few months and tried to regain love for me by herself"" which I felt odd about but was too heartbroken by the fact I lost my gf of 1 year to think about it. I later found out she actually cheated on me with her roommate and told me to hide his and her shame for it. For the most part, I was taking it all well. I was trying to stay positive, and I started exercising. But then suddenly I started to feel worse in a subtle way. I stopped caring about things as much, and I lost enjoyment in my hobbies. Then this week starting Monday, after a bad day at work when I fucked up a lot of things I went home and realized how awful I was feeling and cried myself to sleep that night. Each day I started feeling worse and worse. My sister has depression, and when I talked to her about how I was feeling she told me I might have depression because she's experienced what I'm feeling before. I don't want to believe I have depression because I've been known as the friend and family member who comforts everyone else, I don't want to be seen as the one who needs comfort because I do enjoy making people happier. I told my sister that everything recently is probably just catching up to me. Do you guys think I actually have depression, or am I just dealing with a lot at once?",2,depression

"I’m older than her. Like about four years older than her and she talks to me like I’m a child, she always has ever since we were kids. She’s 18 now and I’m 22 and if she isn’t infantilizing me, she’s straight up ableist with no way around it.

Everyone makes excuses for her, I made a post not long ago because I had an argument with her, got overwhelmed and she mocked me for it and I’m the one who got lectured. 

Today I had an appointment with my therapist who told me I should get my dog certified to be an assistance dog and when I saw my sister I told her about it. My dog is really intelligent he learns so many things easily and she told me he’s too stupid and would never be my assistance dog and then proceeded to grab him to get him away from me.

I’m not leaving the house for a while, as you probably know the economy is ass and I especially for autistic people who aren’t hired at jobs so can’t save up to afford an apartment, plus I’m still in school. So I don’t know what to do when I’m being disrespected like that.

I think what hurts most is that at her job she prides herself on “being the one knowledgeable about autism” and “being the most accepting”. But when it comes to me, I’m the annoying stupid childish sibling who says weird things and doesn’t have any real friends. I’ve tried so hard to be a good sibling to her, I was like three years old when she was born and I already wanted to be there for her and care for her I actually remember that because that was such a strong emotion. So that makes me extra sad that all her life she never wanted to have anything to do with me, would always break my toys and say mean things and I would get yelled at just for slightly raising my voice. 

She only cares about autistic people when they’re her eight year olds gymnasts who she can boss around to do whatever she asks them to. Oh they’re so cute because they give her hugs and they’re tiny children with no agency! I guess adult autistic people aren’t as cute and are just stupid and annoyingly dysfunctional so they don’t deserve respect!",1,autism

"So we're struggling to approach a subject with pretty much anyone including our psychologist. 
I'm trans and had surgery last January, and had 2 revision surgeries after that. 
My surgery was on the mainland and I live with my parents on an island, during that first surgery, I had nearly bled out, (we missed a medication that contained aspirin as it was labeled ASA and we had no idea what it was.. And why we keep saying surgery is not something to take lightly) 
I spent two weeks in the hospital and need 4 units of blood to be brought back to baseline (there's 10 units in the human body) and in that time the only ones who were ever in my hospital room were my boyfriends, the two guys flew from the opposite side of the continent from a diffrent country to be with me for surgery. 
And not a single family member came to see me, when 10 years ago I was the first responder to my grandma's heart attack, and my family members flew to see her in the hospital. 
I feel like I'm missing some social que or something that might explain why no one from my blood family even bothered to show up.. Like yes it was covid, but I was allowed 2 visitors at a time, when asked about it I got told they couldn't afford to take a day off (when they're now taking 2 weeks to go see our grandpa in a different part of the country) 
Is there something that I could have done to been abandoned like that?",1,autism

"For the past 2 years there has been this voice in my head that comes and goes. The voice takes the face of old friends I had at the time. The voice speaks freely and when I try to tune it out, it finds a way to hold on to things in my surroundings to catch my attention. For example, (I’d be watching something and they could say “stick to the basics” and my mind will go on and on about how I am not equipped enough to win this battle in my mind.) This voice tells me to stop trying and that I have no purpose. This voice tells me that I have sold my soul and that I’m not in control of myself. This voice tells me I am cursed. This voice also tells me that I am in hell and that I belong with whatever friend takes face in that moment and nobody else.

I get bothered very easily by minor things, like people looking at me or people talking to me or me failing to do anything perfectly or as according to plan.

My mom, who has suffered with depression and suicide ideation since I was 13, is just not like this. She goes through it differently and copes differently. She's always been able to carrying on with basic hygiene and cleaning around her house, cooking etc. Lately, it takes everything I've got to have a shower or cook for myself, so making plans is not something I do because it just isn't feasible most of the time. 

Lately I've been feeling a bit better, so I said I'd go to her house for mothers day - she was having a bbq with my brother and his family, too. 

The night before I started with the worrying and didn't end up in a good place mentally. I cancelled on her the next day. I've cancelled on her before, but this time she was mad. She ignored my call and didn't return it - just replied to my Facebook message to her saying I tried to call and happy mothers day etc. 

I know cancelling on her was a shitty thing to do, but I just couldn't bring myself to do all of it, and I thought if anyone could understand it would be her. She knows I'm struggling right now. I just don't know how to keep realistic expectations for myself without losing everyone along the way.

"My mental health problems started 4 years ago when I woke up in the middle of the night with my first massive panic attack. That night something happened in my brain and I'm still not well to this day. My main symptoms are - occasional panic attacks at night, random anxiety and derealization (the worst), I haven't been happy for years and everything is kind of ""dark"", I often have nightmares, and I feel like I'm dead inside. But I have no reason to feel this way, my life is fine.  
I've tried almost everything - vitamins and supplements (vit B, D, C, magnesium, omega3, green juices, St. John's wort, rhodiola, ashwaganda, maca, creatine, tianeptine, Lthryptophan...), yoga, meditation, relaxation, books, positive thinking, gratitude, walks, nature, fasting, cold showers... I also exercise 4-5 times a week, sleep 8 hours every day, eat healthy, I do not drink alcohol and go to therapy. I recently tried antidepressants but had a bad reaction.

"17M - i know most of whoever sees this will feel the same or at least understand when i say that i'm gonna sound silly. at this point i don't know if it's a delusion or fact because it damn well could be fact, but there's still the paranoia of detectives/private investigators/police after me. i will admit i'm not the most golden law-abiding citizen out there. so far:

i'm suspicious of cars, people in shopping centres, any persons in vehicles, and i don't leave my room unless i'm about to piss myself and/or everyone else is asleep. the paranoia is concerning me.

12/13th April ~6pm. two cars (isuzu and... toyota, maybe) with tinted windows were parked along the road when i was walking on the side of a bushland surrounded road headed to my estate (suburbs). from both cars i got the vibe of being watched/taken photos of. one of them on my side of the road and parked close enough to the sidewalk that i could read the licence plate. as soon as i was perpendicular to the car it drove off. then when i got into my estate a police car was driving by the school near my house. that's what the last straw was for me.

and just tonight there was a police helicopter (VH-WAH POL61 western australian police force) that came all the way from the city just to circle twice around near where i live. like they traced a nutsack and went back to the city. when i looked up to it, it's flashing light held still as if to signify they knew i was watching them from the crack in my bedroom blinds. i swear, that's proof enough.

i feel this may be the start of a decline and i have absolutely nobody. 0 (zero) friends, mother is a bad person to me, can't talk to my sisters, father will think i'm crazy. i'm fucking lost.

He has had his diagnosis for nearly 4 years now. He is very dependent on me for support as I am his closest companion. He lives with his mother but their relationship is rocky so he doesn't see her as an emotional support figure.

He is medicated but he has always had episodes where he will feel very scared and upset and his hallucinations (mainly auditory) get really bad. 

Lately I feel like things are getting progressively worse and it's to the point that he's saying very concerning things like ""I'm not strong enough"" and ""I can't do this anymore"" and he just seems to be getting increasingly depressed with suicidal ideation. 

Being long distance I feel like I'm not sure exactly how to handle this.

"Today, I failed my driving test for the second time due to ongoing mental health issues. When I turned 16, my mother urged me to start driving to reduce future car insurance costs. However, my anxiety and depression, diagnosed at 16, made me delay obtaining my license until I turned 18. Throughout my life, I have experienced various forms of therapy, seeing nine different therapists since third grade. In one of my therapy sessions, a psychiatrist recommended medication to manage my disorder. Unfortunately, my mother declined. I needed parental consent to take it since I was still a minor. I'm thinking that my struggles with school, road tests, and other necessities stem from a lack of access to medication and strong family support. Now that I'm 18 and can consent, I can't afford mental health help. Despite my fears about driving, my entire family insisted that I learn to drive. Their gossip made me feel like a failure for being afraid of driving. On my first driving test, I failed due to speeding at a dip. The examiner's yelling from the start increased my anxiety. Today, I had a kind examiner. I stopped at a 4-way stop sign. However, someone to my left was speeding. My nerves got the hang of me as I drove, thinking I could pass them, but my examiner had to brake. She informed me that I had only four errors, including one critical error. She realized that I had a severe anxiety disorder based on my reactions and offered some suggestions to pass the test. Her kind words made me feel less hatred for myself. However, I still bawled my eyes out at home because my instructor downplayed my mental health issues, saying I was simply making reckless decisions and that it had nothing to do with anxiety. Next time, I should expect that Californians can't drive properly and cheat at a 4-way stop. I am scared that I will get a stricter examiner the next time and have to apply for my permit again. I hate that my family ridicules me because my younger sisters drive better than me. I also wish that my family would understand that I'd rather take public transportation than put my life at risk by engaging in something I dislike. In the future, I plan to move to a more affordable state or country with better public transportation options even if I attain my license. Once I pass my driving test, I will still use the bus. However, I'm doubting my chances of passing the driving test on my third attempt. It feels ironic that as a Psychology major, I'm seeking advice from others in this situation.",2,depression
"Just a warning I’m going to talk about a medical experience which honestly would be very triggering for me to read, if I wasn’t the one writing, so please skip if it might cause distress. 

For context I was diagnosed with anxiety and have been seeing various therapists and psychologists since I was around 12 years old. 

Because I was lucky enough to get some kind of treatment (even if half of them were unhelpful) I have learned strategies to manage my anxiety over time and it does not usually dominate my life. Full blown panic attacks have been very rare for the last 8 years or so.

I used to have severe medical phobia as a kid (throwing up & hyperventilating over something as simple as an x ray) but I became a lot more comfortable as an adult with these strategies, even getting blood tests and such on a regular basis. I discovered I have a high pain tolerance, and that I can go through lot more than I thought possible.

Two years ago however, I had an IUD insertion done as it is a highly recommended birth control. Before the insertion I was told to just take an ibuprofen on the day, but reassured that it wouldn’t be too uncomfortable and no further pain management was necessary. I should have suspected something was up when started panicking while signing off all the waivers in the waiting room… the procedure was very painful but almost nothing compared to the painful side effects that would last almost a year afterwards. Not only did I have trauma from the procedure, but the way I was brushed off, or made to feel like I was over reacting by almost every doctor I saw while trying to fix the damage (and put an end to the constant pain) made me absolutely mental. 

Now I have meltdowns even thinking about having to go in for a physical exam, or Pap smear in the future. I try to control my anxiety but it’s also fuelled by the fact that I’ve experienced how women’s pain is not considered, barely even researched in the medical world. I keep panicking, just thinking about what will happen to me if I need to go in for ANY medical check up or procedure. 

I don’t know how to overcome this medical fear when it feels so realistic. Tonight I accidentally read a post  about colposcopies and I immediately was shaking and crying, couldn’t control my breathing just thinking about how I might need this procedure one day.

"Hello everyone,

I want to say that I appreciate you taking the time in advance to read this and for giving any feedback.

From birth, I have had severe food allergies, some of which I have developed later in life. I am currently allergic to several of the most common allergies recognized in North America. Navigating these food allergies has presented its unique set of challenges throughout the years, but none of which I have not been able to navigate and overcome. Although, there is one challenge in particular which I have not been able to deal with and it has been progressively consuming more of my daily life.

Over the last several years I have experienced what I would best describe as anxiety attacks, although I have never discussed this with a medical practitioner. The anxiety is perpetuated by an underlying fear of having an allergic reaction but it often lacks any basis for being concerned. Whether eating something new for the first time, sitting on a bench outside, or driving home from work; there is no one trigger which causes the anxiety attack to occur.

To describe the way that I feel during these situations, I will experience a variety of allergy-related symptoms that can be associated with my anaphylaxis. Some of these symptoms which occur either simultaneously or on their own include: irritation or swelling in the throat, swelling in the face, difficulty breathing through the mouth or nose, difficulty swallowing, and swelling in the tongue or irritation in the mouth area. There have been other less common symptoms but are not as associated with anaphylaxis.

Although I experience what I believe to be anaphylactic symptoms, none of these have ever actually happened. Everything which I have felt has been perpetuated through the anxiety of having a reaction and therefore I am made to believe that it is happening at the moment. I have never had an allergic reaction and therefore only understand what the symptoms look and should feel like.

These anxiety attacks have been affecting my ability to focus and live life without an underlying fear embedded in all of my actions. I know that when these scenarios occur that I have nothing to worry about, and am able to recognize that in the moment. Yet, I am unable to control the situation and the only thing that resolves it is a prolonged period of time to pass to indicate there is in fact no issue.

When this occurs it creates an immense amount of fear and stress that I can no longer handle. It has been approximately ten years of getting worse and upon recognizing that this is an issue that I need to address I would like to seek help. I plan to discuss these concerns with a medical practitioner, but until such time, I would like to hear if others have shared a similar experience and how they have navigated this challenge. Any suggestions or comments are appreciated.

Thank you in advance.",4,anxiety

"I am desperately looking for help and advice. I am the caregiver for my mother living with schizoaffective disorder. My mom is young at 46 years old, was very active, and very stable on her medications prior to these additional medical issues. 

Winter of 2022, Mom sustained a back injury resulting in 4 rib fractures. These fractures are where the rib meets her spinal cord. She was bending over to tie her ice skates when she felt pops and pain. X-rays confirmed the breaks and the doctors assumed this was a one-off occurrence and told her to take it easy so she could heal. She ended up healing very slowly but the pain remained and increased.

She has been sent to an Endocrinologist, has multiple tests done for bone density/degeneration. Countless X-ray/MRIs. Pain clinics. Nothing came back conclusive and the doctor cannot provide an explanation.

Not getting an answer as to why the ribs broke has caused a spiral.

The past 15 ish months have been horrific. Words cannot express the absolute derailment that has happened. Everything from medical delusions, fears that her medical team is trying to kill her,  psychosis episodes, etc. I have not seen my mom this way since right before her diagnosis. I have been advocating for her, booking appointments, speaking with her doctors, etc.

In April, she broke 3 MORE ribs after bending over to tie her shoe. 1 was a re-break, the others were new fractures. Again, doctor has no answers. She has been checked for signs of self-harm and abuse. There are no bruising or anything indicating that is was self inflicted. SHE IS 46 YEARS OLD! Why is this happening? Her medical care has been severely lacking and I wont get into it on this post but IMHO I believe it is because of her disorder that her concerns have not been taken seriously. I know they have performed tests but that took a year for them to be ordered and over 30+ ER visits and many hours of advocacy. 

I have been doing research this whole time and after speaking with a schizophrenia advocacy group, they told me about a linkage between anti-psychotic medications and breaking bones.

**My main question is - Do any of you know about or have experience with anti-psychotic medications leading to unexplainable bone breaks?**

I am desperate to find answers for my mom and am open to any questions or advice. If you need some extra details please ask and I will provide what I can. I didn't want to make this post too long. Thank you in advance.",6,schizophrenia

"Not sure how this fits into this subreddit but I am insecure about my teeth.

Well fast forward today, I got a job at a company and had to trial some products for them. One of which were teeth whitening strips. My manager asked me to show her my teeth and I politely declined and said I’m insecure about them but she was persistent and I almost broke down because everytime anyone talks abt anything teeth related I get so anxious and do everything I can to move away from the convo. Eventually she said just take an image of your teeth before you use the strips and document the process because they want to post it on social media. I am genuinely pissed and I have this anxiety in me now because I’m really not comfortable with showing my teeth let alone send it to my manager to post it online. Eventho I’m only in this job temporarily for 3 months and prob will never see them all again. I’m still so anxious and I’m thinking of ways to tell them I don’t want to do it.",4,anxiety

"I want to start by saying a few things. I genuinely don't understand my mom or what could possibly be going on in her brain to make her think and act this way. Also, please don't comment anything like ""why don't you talk to her about how that makes you feel?"" I can't. she doesn't ever listen to me and brushes off my feelings all the time. Either that or she'll somehow turn the blame on me and make herself the victim of the situation, claiming that I don't understand her struggles, or that I'm just trying to accuse her of false things to make her look or feel bad, or go on about how she could never make me feel that way because she ""loves me"".

so, back to the original point of this post. 
i have diognised ADHD and suspected/undiagnosed high-masking autism. 
damn near every single time I try to bring up something that I struggle with or cannot do (because I'm neurodivergent), she always says something like ""you just forgot how to"" or ""you need to teach yourself how to do that"" or even ""just ignore it"" ""just stop.""
one of the main things is that I have time blindness. she just keeps telling me to learn better. and then she guilt trips me and lectures me about how if I don't learn to manage my time better, I'll never get anywhere in life, that I'll constantly be losing jobs and be excluded from social groups because I'm always late. great. thanks for that, mom. 
I cannot control my time blindness. time feels very different for me than what most others feel (I think). 5 minutes can feel like 1. 2 hours can feel like 30 minutes. I cannot estimate time or how long something will take me. that is not something that my brain do, I cannot fix that.
I also struggle to complete and turn in homework on time. she just tells me to stop doing that and try harder. that I need to ""stop making excuses"" and ""stop using your ADHD as an excuse, it's not"". she's right, it's not an excuse, it's a reason.
another time I recall is when we were out somewhere, it was outside, and there were powerlines over the place. my biggest sensory issue is auditory, mainly loud and/or high-pitched sounds. The powerlines were buzzing, they were so loud and bothered me so much. I could hear them no matter where I went. I was starting to become closed off, visibly upset, angry and irritable. my mom told me to stop just ignore the buzzing and just ""pretend"" to have a good time and stop wrecking the mood for everyone else. she even got mad at me when I tried putting in my headphones and listening to music to calm myself down. 
another time, when i was having a meltdown over a ""prank"" that she pulled on me. she refused to apologize, turned my lights on, made me take my blankets off my head and take my headphones out. she got really angry and told me to ""get over it"" and ""stop living in the moment"" or ""stop feeling bad for myself"". 
this has happened a few other times recently. she said the same thing to me both times. one was me telling her how I cannot recognize my body's signals (such as hunger). the other time was when I told her that I struggle with volume regulation and often talk too quietly without realizing it at all. she told me that I just ""need to learn that skill"". I just wish she would understand that I can't. my brain doesn't work that way.

another thing, I feel like she tries to ""relate"" to me but it just comes off as ableist to me. there's been several instances where she has said to me ""I get distracted sometimes, I think I might have ADHD too."" 
I'm like 90% sure she doesnt, but my dad does (diognosed), so I know that's where mine came from. 

I'm just fed up with this.",1,autism

zombie area 

military area (kill npcs and other players)

and the 1V1 arena

so my 2 other friends started apparantly claiming to see a ""figure"" in the FFA arena, my friend describes it as a mixture of me, the other friend we were playing with and another friend i have. in the FFA arena in the center is an ammo box for ammo, and he describes it was there, he blinked and it apparantly ""disappeared"", it continued to happen multiple times until we decided to do stuff in my discord server.

my other friend started to see figures but i dont know if i believe that or not, i only believe that the friend that first saw it (lets just call him michael, and the other friend we were playing with, joj)

so michael saw it first, joj joined not long after we first joined the game.

"TW?? paranoia of course: afraid I’m being watched, thinking of being killed, suicidal & intrusive thoughts


I got really spooked by them and the first night was terrible. I was frozen in fear that someone was watching me in any dark corner of my room, watching my every move, waiting to kill me. That was three weeks ago. My sister has been kind enough to let me sleep in her room on the floor this entire time, but I still feel unsafe and scared. I feel like I’m seeing and hearing things that aren’t actually there. Not like hallucinations though, I don’t know how to describe it right now. 

Then I saw another tiktok on my fyp a few days ago (I don’t want to go into detail about what it was just for the sake of you all) and it genuinely screwed with my head even more than the first one. I cried for an hour on the floor panicking and my sister let me sleep on her bed for that night instead of on the floor and I calmed down a little. But this paranoia is still here. It wont leave. I’m having to force myself to stay up late even when really tired  to get to the point where I physically can’t keep my eyes open anymore and would fall asleep any minute so I can easily fall asleep without all these intrusive thoughts that someone is watching and waiting to k1ll me.. but at the same time, it’s painful to sleep because I’m so afraid I’m going to have nightmares about all of this. 

I haven’t had any paranoia before this really, but I do have GAD. But I’m assuming all of this is paranoia right?? I can’t get it out of my head and I’m worried I’m going to be like this forever now since it has been 3 weeks. People have said it’s normal to be spooked for a day or two by something, but for something to last this long and this intense there is probably a problem.. 
I don’t understand...we have a dog AND an alarm AND I’m in my sisters room. Why do I have to be like this? I feel so unsafe and it’s honestly to the point where I just want to kms so nothing has the chance to do it first. I already am suicidal as it is (but never would act on it) and this just makes it so much more intense I don’t know what to do. I just hope this is temporary, but is it possible that this literally just stemmed into my brain now and am going to be like this forever even though I’ve never had any previous experience with paranoia?..",5,paranoia

"Hey guys, I'm feeling pretty confused about a recent situation with my girlfriend and could really use some advice or insight. Before I delve into the details, I want to mention that I have pretty severe ADHD, which sometimes affects my judgment and ability to interpret social cues accurately. I'm not sure if this played a role in the situation.

We've been together for about four months, and things have been pretty turbulent but we obviously have a strong connection. However, today, she approached me and said she thought it would be a good idea for us to take a break.

Now, considering my ADHD, I sometimes struggle with reading between the lines or picking up on subtle signals. Initially, I was taken aback, but I tried to remain calm and understand her perspective. I didn't want to push her away by being defensive, so I told her that I thought it was a good idea if that's what she felt was necessary. To my surprise, she responded by saying that if we took a break, we probably wouldn't get back together.

Given my ADHD, I tend to take things at face value, so I interpreted her statement as a breakup since she seemed to imply that the break could lead to a permanent separation. Therefore, I accepted it and expressed my understanding that it was over. However, that's when things took an unexpected turn.

She started calling me repeatedly and bombarding me with text messages, clearly upset and demanding that I ""fight"" for our relationship. I was really taken aback by this because I thought I was respecting her wishes by accepting the break. It felt like a contradiction to me.

When I confronted her about this, she explained that she wanted me to show more effort and passion for our relationship, and the fact that I had initially agreed to the break was not what she wanted to hear. She said she wanted me to fight for her and prove that I cared.

Given my ADHD, I'm questioning whether my interpretation and response were influenced by my condition. Did I misread the situation and fail to understand what she really wanted? I genuinely thought I was being understanding and respecting her wishes, but now I'm questioning if I missed some important context.

I'm really confused about her mixed signals, my ADHD, and not sure what to make of all this. Am I to blame for this misunderstanding? I still care about her, but I don't want to keep going in circles with conflicting expectations. Any advice, especially from individuals who have experience with ADHD in relationships, would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Girlfriend suggested taking a break, I agreed, she got upset and demanded I fight for our relationship. I obviously have ADHD (diagnosed 12 years ago) and I'm unsure if my interpretation was influenced by it. Feeling confused and unsure about what to do next. Any advice, including insights from those with experience in relationships involving ADHD, would be greatly appreciated.

"I’ve had things like this happen to me before, but it’s been less extreme; yesterday I was having a really bad panic attack because I thought my friends all hated me (basically just because one of them said they wanted to share a tent with a couple of my other friends when we go all camping and didn’t mention me, which I know is a really really stupid reason) and I got really angry about that, but then I started panicking even more because I saw a book on a shelf in my house which was turned into a series that I’m watching with my mum, and she said she didn’t know what it was about even though she has the book so I started to question whether she was lying about it and that turned into me question whether she’s even real, whether she’s even my mum and I was scared she lied about everything she’s ever told me, and then I started to question whether everyone else was real and I was terrified that everyone was lying to me and I didn’t know who anyone really was and I thought my family was evil and was going to harm me so I blocked the door with heavy bags and a chair so nobody could get in and I hid in the cupboard until my mum found me and I screamed when she came in and it was so scary but I eventually calmed down.

"I may be out of place here since I am a teen and could just be playing victim of depression however I just want to vent out. A lot of stuff happened in my life, at age 10 my dad left me without saying a word. At Age 11 my family broke off and we all had separated ourselves. It is hard, having the responsibilities that I should not shoulder but who am I to complain? I want to ask my mom to bring me to a psychiatrist for I thought I have depression since I am showing off symptoms but I thought it was just my imaginations and I shrug it off. But as years passed I am lost. ""What am I supposed to do?"", ""How can I do this?"", ""How should I carry out my responsibilities plus the responsibilities I have to shoulder?"" These questions pop in my head. And now here I am, in reddit asking people what should I do, to be honest I'm tired of continuing my journey in life and sleep eternally 6 feet under. When all hell is let loose I am always the one to blame, in every chaos I am the troublemaker, in every bad situation I am always the one to blame. I've had enough already, this journey of mine feels nothing more than a freight train of pain and suffering. It irritates me that I have no power nor the materials to improve myself and rely on what is presented at the table. I feel useless as if I exist as a mere jester to make people laugh at me. I just want someone to value that I exist and that I have feelings but looks like it ain't happening. I guess this might be the fruit of my sinful life, and everything is just the consequences of my actions. Anyways, I hope you guys have your salvations and live a desirable life.

"Hi, I am wondering if anyone has any experience of dealing with chronic decision anxiety. I have had it all my life and it gets worse when my overall anxiety is worse. It’s often around dates and times, but can be literally any decision, big or small. It has severely impacted my life and still does, as I procrastinate and leave all important decisions for some future date that never arrives. I feel so stuck and incapable of liberating myself from this issue. Does anyone have any advice?",4,anxiety

"Hi, I’m Tuesday, and I want to give up.

I’ve been on antidepressants for the last 10 years, but I don’t think they’ve *ever* worked. To the point that, at the end of 2021, I stopped taking them. In 2022, I nearly punched my ticket, so, oops, Tuesday has to be back on drugs again. I’m physically repulsed by the idea of being on these pills for the rest of my life, so I’ve been trying to be better to get off of them. And I was doing okay…

But then I crashed, a week before my doctor’s appointment. I reiterated to her that I hate the pills, I don’t want to be on them, they don’t work. Her response was to increase the dose and brush my feelings under the rug. When I told her I doubt it would help because I feel I have ADHD, making actually taking medications difficult, she said, “I don’t think it’d be that.”

Since then I’ve been spiraling down. It feels like every direction a new punch comes my way, and I’m just defeated. I’m trying so hard to feel anything other than “I want to die,” but it’s fucking pointless. Why even try to do anything if you end up back at square one to begin with? Fuck this shit.",2,depression
"I would like to firstly say that I am not diagnosed with depression, but I feel like there's something wrong with me. Take this post more as a way for me to vent out my feelings and frustrations. I don't feel the need to hurt myself or anyone around me, so breathe easy.

I'm a 30 year old guy. During all my years up to this point, I have never felt understood. I try to be honest with people when I'm feeling down, but that always results in those people going away. I've always had these moments where, even unprovoked, I just fall into a pit of sadness and can't get out for a varying amount of time, usually from 1 day, up to maybe a week or two. During this time in the past I've tried reaching out to people, but now I just sit and wallow in my sadness.

I'm alone, ever since I moved out at 18 I've always lived alone. I've put my heart on the line and tried to make meaningful connections with some people, but it was never either the right time, or the feelings were unreciprocated. I don't blame the people for not feeling a certain way about me. But what hurts me the most is that because every time I've tried to find that special person who I would want to give my all to, who I want to make happy, it's never mutual. I'm left to feel alone, unwanted and unloved.

I've had partners, who I've been close with, who I've been intimate with, but I've never been in a committed relationship.

I don't think that I deserve anyone to feel a special way about me, I don't think I deserve someone to love me. But I want, at least once, for someone to feel that way about me. I want to feel like I matter to someone. And I know that I matter to the few close friends I have, and to my family. But that's different. People don't care about how a 30 year old man feels. They just don't. I don't care what anyone says, the feelings of a man are always disregarded and thrown away like a used napkin.

I'm lonely.",2,depression

It's been vibrating because of some typical doorbell bs, harmless on it's own, but them loosening the wire to make it stop (it didn't) is not only completely useless but dangerous. Apparently I worry too much when they leave me at home alone with 3 animals and an electrical fire hazard. I just need to trust them, even though they know about my mental health and know that's asking too much, but they don't have to trust me when I shove a million Google results on how loose wires are a bad thing?

"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2,depression

"I feel like crying every morning before I go to work, and also experience the worst migraines throughout the day. I wasn't this way last year, but have slowly slipped into feeling so lost right now, irrirated, confused, and depressed.

Work has been getting harder and harder, ever since important team members left it's been more difficult that i thought to cope. I constant feel like my job and company will crumble without me, for the longest time i've been wearing so many hats, and the pressure of just having so much depend on me has made me burst into tears at my table. I've been making more mistakes and have been screwing up, it could be burnout. 

I don't know what to do, sometimes at night I think if i should just end it all so the pain in my check stops and the voices that tell me to keep working end. But I have so many people who love me, and I wouldn't want to ruin their lives. I just need to not feel so lost and stuck in this cycle of pain, pressure, stress.

"i’m exhausted of being myself i’m exhausted of being stuck in my head nothing i do works and i am only ever thinking bad thoughts— everyone hates me and i’m the most annoying person in the world 99.9% of the time. i used to have safe people that i knew i would never bother and never feel like i was being a nuisance all the time and now even those people don’t feel safe anymore. i feel like my family hates me too, and the only reason they put up with me at all is because they have to. i know i annoy my mom. i never feel okay with myself. any small change in behavior from anybody makes me spiral and im so tired. im just fighting my own brain every day. trying to convince myself every day that i am loved and i am cared for but i don’t believe it even a little bit. i don’t know how to. i hate that im like this i hate trying different medicines i hate not being able to have creative thoughts anymore because im always thinking about the bad things— im always contemplating my own existence and sometimes it just feels like it would be easier for me if i just wasn’t here. but i don’t want to die but sometimes i wonder if i need to. 

i don’t get excited for the future anymore i just get scared. everything scares me. i feel like half a person all the time— and i always feel like i’m making all this up. idk if this is even the right sub to post this in but i’m just having a really hard time. i know that i need help, but i feel like nobody takes me seriously. every professional help i’ve had has failed me— my psychiatrist made me feel like i was lying and being dramatic and all three past therapists eventually just stopped seeing me. they literally would ghost me after a few months of seeing me i just would never hear from them again. 

i want to grow old, i want to be here but everything scares me. i am scared of my own existence and my place in this world. i am scared to lose my mom, i am scared that people will find out i’m a fraud. i’m just rambling now. i’m just so tired",4,anxiety

I hope this server is real and no trolls. For my safe feeling I will stay anonymous plus this username is ai generated by Reddit. I do want to say I am 16 and have had this same feeling since I was 14. Anyway when corona happened in 2020 I found myself cooped up in my room watching movies one night I decide to watch insidious (I can usually stomach scary movies) and I did for this one anyway after a week after watching apparently I woke up screaming which I do not remember but my mum recounts perfectly. After that my house had let’s say supernatural happening not saying there’s a ghost but stuff has happened. Now going back to insidious the red faces man started showing in my dreams (I know it sounds crazy) but every time i close my eyes I see his face I can’t sleep and when I walk around I feel like he’s latching on to me like I’m a puppet anyway this happened for a month then stopped but kept happening every couple of months. It’s back again but worse I look around everywhere because I’m freaked it might not be paranoia but I thought it matched up so if anyone can help please I don’t want it to ruin my relationship again like the last.,5,paranoia

"Let me start off by saying, I am in no way bashing my friends nor am I not recognising that they are just trying to be kind, but it doesn’t help. 
My life feels like a pit of nothingness, always. I have little moments of happiness but then it’s just back to my bland baseline, or worse. And right now, I am deep into the ‘worse’ category. I’m barely functioning and avoiding social interactions and when I do talk to someone it feels like I am watching myself in a simulation selecting the correct responses until the interaction ends. 

I have very few friends. I have never fully trusted anyone, even though I know deep down I should trust these people. I always just end up saying ‘oh ya I’m okay, just a rough patch’. When inside, I feel like I’m dead. I have no family, apart from my mum who is preoccupied with her other family in another country. I’m not in a relationship, no where even close, I feel entirely unlovable because I have nothing to offer from my empty soul.
Loneliness literally courses through my veins, there are times when I will be sobbing and I feel actual aching pain in my fingertips and body from lack of physical touch or companionship. I grew up surrounded by abusive men, my grandfather, father and step dad. But because we were wealthy, when I acted out it was ‘oh she’s just spoilt not getting her own way’ because I had all the material things I could want, when I was literally begging for help, having anxiety attacks, without even knowing it. I was never protected or nurtured and that theme has continued in my life. 

Where my friends come into it: I’m 27, had a job that I was actually thriving at for the first time in my entire life. In fact, when I was at work it was the only time I have ever felt competent or proud of myself in anyway. I met some great people during that time, and am still in touch with them regularly. They know that I get ‘down’ sometimes, and we do try to talk about it. Everything they express is with the best of intentions, you know, ‘it will get better’ and ‘something good will come along’. I always have, and always will support them because I am well aware that people from perfect scenarios get down sometimes too. They grew up differently to me, and I don’t want to explain my past and either have it 1. Traumatise them or 2. Feel that I am now a burden and their responsibility. 

I simply don’t know how to communicate the sort of things that happened to me in the past that now dictate my emotions and slumps into depression, especially considering that they come from very loving households with a lot of support. I don’t want to be pitied, or tiptoed around, if they find out. I also don’t know how to accept support and feel like I am a huge drain on my friends energy when I am in this down stage. 
If anyone has navigated this, please help me. I want to be open, but I don’t want to be that fucked up friend in the group, you know?",2,depression

"Specifically I have bipolar-type schizoaffective. 

I feel like I've finally found the person I'm supposed to be with, he's amazing and treats me so well. He wants to understand this disorder and how it affects me, but I'm having trouble explaining it to him and there are times I can't communicate properly. Being off medication (due to bad side effects and not being able to find one that works) isn't helping.

I feel like I'm losing myself somewhat in the relationship because it's so hard for me to function on a daily basis to begin with, and this guy means so much to me that I'm putting most of my daily energy into the relationship to make sure I'm a good partner. So when something doesn't go the way I hope, like if we have to cancel plans or something, it breaks me way more than it should.

"What is the point on life for some of us?
I am almost 25 (M), I started working and studying when I finished school with 16. 
I have been a honest person, with values, hard worker all the time, (I even worked so hard for couple seasons that ended up in the hospital for burn out). And still, I am nowhere in life.
I grew up in South America in a poor country, I was hungry of success of course, to help my family, to help my parents when they can not work anymore, to help my little sister to study the career that she wants. Emigrated to Europe, and still. I am just an average Joe, with a little. bit of money saved, working for a big company, with a normal boring life.
I did my military service and was very good at it, I was one of the most strong ones and intelligent in my unit, because I developed good leadership and other habilities and workout a lot too, motivating some people around me. But that does not help me at all, like, in this world it seems you just have to be a nerd on Software development or some thing like that , to be able to succeed financially and provide for your family and have a great life.

And now, I am living in Europe, in a country where its raining and snowing most of the time of the year, but with good and stable economy. Just depressed, alone, with my boring life. (When I could be on the Caribbean with sime friends if I just decided to take the other short way of making a living). 
 
I have some friends here in Europe that I made, but they just care about girls and partys and alcohol. Thay had a really easy and really quiet life, so it is difficult for me to really comnect with them, and I try sometimes to explain how I feel but they just say that their country is to perfect to be feeling like that. 
 I started to join some.sports clubs, to workout with people, but they dont put the work in, it is like people forgot what is like to push yourself sometimes. 
Everything around is just, average life, conversations without meanings, drinking alcohol, planning where to go on your 2 weeks trip vacation if you are lucky to recieve a bonus.

I just want to end my life, I have not done it because I know how much pain will be for my family, and they dont deserve that, and I have my two little brothers who look up to me and I just want to make them proud. But at this point I dont see what I have to do in order to succeed in this world.
Should I stay here and be miserable but stable? Should I move to other place where the climate would be better and I can enjoy life a little bit more even when I make less money? 

What career should I take? I was already in the military but it is not like USA where you can actually get deployed or something, so I am just a reserve soldier. I though about police academy but this country is so peacefull that it is just boring for me to be one. I though fire fighter but you can just be on a side, there is no like full time career.

I dont know if I should move to somewhere where I can have the Sea close and becoming a diving instructor or something like that interesting.

How do people succeed with 25 or 30. I dont get it, I mean, I have friends that are doing really good in life, they had wealthy parents and now have their businesses and everything, and I am happy for them, really. They are making money living a great life. 
I knew for me, was going to be a little bit harder because my situation is different. But bro, I have been working my ass off the last almost 10 years and I am still a loser. 

I think some of us would never be able to taste what been wealthy or having enough money to not worry about it is. 
I feel there is.people.like me who learns really quick and are intelligent, but not able to go and study 7years at university following a system. 
I just did a 2 years career in a trade in order to be able to get out there and live life sooner, that I could learn sooner. And I have been always promoted and stuff, but is still nothing that will take you to another level.

And nowadays when you think like sidehustle, is just ecom and dropshipping, things like that. People just sealing courses and stuff.

I know my parents would have loved for me to be a doctor, lawyer, or something like that. But thats not me.

I know  this post may be confusing a little bit, maybe there is too much information on different topics, but I just dont know what to do. I am just tired of life, I do everything right everyday to be a good human and a hard worker, and it seems that its not worth it. I grew up around people stealing with the goverment and doing some dr*g dealing and things like that. And I always though  that taking the other road (the honest one) will be always better.
 I just think I am wrong, those people live better than me, because I know them.personally. and maybe they just live under their own rules, they make life how they want.

I feel everyday the temptetion to take the shortcut, and use my knoweldge in some areas to just live life by my own rules, because it seems like doing the right thing and following the rules of society is just not worth it. 

I would just like to know what you think. How did you overcome things like that? Hiw are you able to find your path and be happy? Proud about yourself? 

And please, I dont need the ""be more positive it will change"" thing. I already did see a therapist a couple times and it did not help, and is really expensive. 
I know that no one can help me better but myself, but I just dont know what to do anymore.

I constantly tell myself i’ll never be the same, i’ll never get better, I can’t do this or that because i’ll get really anxious. I feel like my mind controls me. I try so hard to fight back but it always wins. everything makes my anxiety go crazy. If I hear a loud noise or if something is unexpected I get so anxious. I’m scared of my anxiety. something simple that makes me anxious makes me nauseous, heart race, feel like I can’t breathe, feel like I need to run away. I haven’t left my house in months. sometimes I cant even go outside. I constantly feel overwhelmed by everything. anytime I imagine myself going out to do something I imagine myself panicking. I never feel calm or relaxed. I feel emotionless all I feel is sadness and anxiety. I miss feeling happy and feeling excited. I feel like I don’t even feel love anymore. I miss my old self so much. and knowing the only way to get better is to do it myself is so scary. I don’t know how to get better. I feel like i’ll never get better. I want my life back. I miss the things I used to do. I feel so useless now. I don’t understand why i’ve gotten so bad. I feel so trapped in my head. I’m so negative all the time because nothing seems worth it anymore. I just feel so alone. I’m quite honestly scared.",4,anxiety

"I love horror and a lot of it can be really triggering and send me into a pit of paranoia but sometimes I like that in moderation. Certain images or sounds usually. I haven't been diagnosed with anything but it's a variety of symptoms such as episodes of manic paranoia or simply thinking people are lying to me (girlfriend cheating, friends hating me etc.) It doesnt need to make sense for it to hurt. These symptoms make me feel like this question is valid. Is this unhealthy to seek thrill in this way knowing it is likely to hurt me?",5,paranoia

"Hi!

I need your help. And maybe my help helps you?

I was talking to someone about his schrizofrenia and his past and we talked about needs, Maslows piramid of needs.

The base layer is physiological needs. We needs nutricious food, enough water, rest and excercise to have a healthy body. The layer above this layer are safety needs. These two layers are the basic needs of a human.

If you don't feel safe you get fear/ paranoia.

My thoughts are as followed; Trauma can cause two problems:

- Not able to fill in the needs to feel safe and secure.
- Not able to guard boundaries so you don't feel safe and secure.

If my partner is able to define her needs, she can fill them; and if she is able to define which boundaries are crossed, she can learn and develop strategies and skills to fill her needs and guard her boundaries.

Basically when we are young our caretakers teach us how to do so, but if they are the ones who took away the needs or crossed the boundaries... how could you have learned these strategies and skills from them?

My question for you is:

Can you verify my thought process? 

If you reflect on yourself, how are your skills in filling you needs for savety and security and how are your skills in guarding your boundaries so you can feel safe an secure?

If is all about a lack in strategy and skills, I'll be able to ask for specific help for my partner so she can learn and develop herself and hopefully be rid of paranoia.

Thanks for reading and I hope some of you take the time to respond. I see my partner suffer so much.. and I want for her to have a normal life.

And as an extra question: What environment / situation would be the best for you to start building these strategies and skills?",5,paranoia

If everything is crap, I can start again, or leave it behind. I can take big risks without fear, because everything sucks anyway. I could address the root causes of what makes me unhappy and reforge myself into who I want to be.

"Long story short.... Used opiates from 17 to 22 been clean since. Then in 2018 life hit me hard with loss and other stuff and I got on meth. I used it hard.... Hard.... For 3-4 years. Ten days awake at times I went into plenty of scary psychosis... Had delusions of grandeur... Persecution complexes. 

Then I hit rehab and wanted to and got clean and have 7 months plus now! The first 6 months were relatively easy. But the past two months I've been having the same recurring meltdown or psychosis for an hour or even day. 

I'm just really frustrated. I moved back in with my parents, older brother lives here, they all support me though I believe my brother enjoys making fun of the failures in my life. 

For example two days ago I had a good day, woke up at 8 am, showered. Worked 5 hours. Around 8 pm at the house all the sudden something took over me ... I got very anxious and fearful and was having delusional thoughts my brother was in the CIA and my parents only kept me around here to make fun of the loser I have become (yes I am self demeaning at times). 

My dad asks what's wrong and I just say something is not right. Then my half drunk mom comes in, mind you I'm in my 30s and she's 60s and goes ""is this because you don't have a girlfriend"" which I laugh at now, but it didn't feel natural and almost like she wants to gaslight me and make it worse. I'm having a panic attack or delusion and she brings up the negative aspects of my life unrelated.... Well I think.

Anyway. I wanted to post and get some feedback because it happened again tonight not as severe. Nothing like the week long psychosis I would have binging on meth with no food or liquids thinking there were cameras everywhere watching me for the world to watch etc......

But damn. 7 months clean and I guess it's brain damage? Can anyone relate after getting clean from major meth use and the mental and psychological side effects. Nothing is scarier than thinking reality is fake or that I'm being streamed live in hidden cameras for the world to see a loser that destroyed his mind and mental health with METH.

"Just for reference I live a full life most mornings are spent doing something I truly enjoy wether that be walking around downtown, playing piano or even just cooking my favorite meal (homestyle ramen) I love my job and my coworkers and have a beautiful friend group that I frequently hang out with and have a great time with. But I find myself bored and generally just unamused with everything. I know one of my issues is my own knowledge of that fact that none of it matters in the slightest, I'm not religious or hold any beliefs in anything whatsoever, I mean shit I don't even believe in luck. I have come to terms with my own mortality through a couple very close calls. Knowing that nothing matters has given me more personal freedom than I ever would've thought myself to have. I feel truly free to enjoy myself as I please and everyone including me knows I'm a kind and gentle human. But here I am, chronically bored. At this point I don't know what to do, I have everything I could possibly want, so why do I feel this way. Will it ever be different? Maybe I'm just tired of existing.",2,depression

"I cannot maintain friendships. I keep getting told its bad for me to not have friends, but trying to make and keep friends makes me incredibly uncomfortable and stressed. 

The friendships always go well initially , As I tend to only befriend other ND people so we click very well. But I can never maintain the energy needed to keep it going. I am the “says hello every couple of months” friend except unless you reach out first, you may never hear from me again. 

My ex would belittle me for it, tell me I needed friends to be a functioning member of society, told me he found me less attractive because I didnt go out and do things with others like “normal people do” and that he couldn’t be my friend because he was my boyfriend. But I was happy being who I was. I was content with myself. & I did go out, just by myself. 

I realize now he was full of it, as my current parter is my best friend and has never made me feel like I needed to change any part of myself. But I still sometimes stress over the fact that I cant maintain/ don’t want friends. I still feel like maybe Im doing something wrong by not having any, but then once I make a friend I realize its far more uncomfortable and “wrong” than not having any friends. 

I guess I just wanted to vent about it and see if anyone else shared my feelings.",1,autism

"I am a first year university student looking to make a campaign ad/film concerning paranoia and the importance of reaching out to someone when in need of support.

The story follows a woman as she tries to find the source of a constant banging noise in her house and a figure that follows her around by appearing in places around her. The idea is to use the figure as a way to represent her stress personified and the banging noise is meant to be an auditory hallucination.

In the end she calls up a friend and all the rising stress comes to a stop as she briefly vocalises her emotions to her.

I am afraid of coming off as tone deaf and insensitive/misrepresenting the struggles people with Paranoia face. I apologize beforehand if the idea is crass or inaccurate, it is not from a place of malice, but rather from a lack of understanding.

It does make me avoid certain situations and situations I’d like to do. Is there any medication or things to do to help stop this? Of course like just put yourself in situations to get better at it...

"yesterday i had to severe aches all over my body and a dry throat. the dry throat continued to today and i drank a lot more water than i usually do because of that. anyway because i drank so much water i had to go to the bathroom more because that’s how that works. 

mistakenly i looked up dry throat on google and the first result was for type 1 diabetes which sent me spiraling after it also said it could happen in a matter of days. i had a mild breakdown and started panicking over the idea i had type two diabetes despite a only fitting two of the symptoms (dry throat and frequently going bathroom). i then began applying other symptoms to myself like “yeah my vision isn’t blurry but what if it is and i just missed it???” 

i panicked for a while before i managed to get a hold of myself and take into account,

1. my throat is dry probably because my allergies are pretty severe right now and i sleep with a fan directly on my face at all times 

2. i have been drinking a ton of water because of the throat dry thing (6 water bottles today) and somehow ate clear/water based types of soup for every meal today so ofc i have to go to the bathroom more

3. i fit no other diabetes criteria and while i’m not insanely healthy i’m still fairly active and eat plenty of health foods and limit processed ones

anyway i’ve mostly recovered from my spiral but i’d appreciate some advice/reassurance. the logical part of me is telling myself to calm down and remember i put myself through health spirals frequently. last week it was rabies because i had a cut i didn’t recognize. 

health problems freak me out a lot and i wanted to just write out my reasoning to help calm myself down and i was also hoping y’all could understand and tell me your strategies for calming health anxiety related stuff (other than not googling your symptoms haha)",4,anxiety
"Hey everyone, just need to vent.I have had an immense amount of stress compounded on me in a very short time frame:

1. My wife said she wanted a divorce and then changed her mind but is in limbo on her decision. That whirlwind alone is stressful
2. Said wife got a job, which leaves me at home watching our child full time while also working remotely full time (breadwinner by 4x her income)
3. My buspar increased intrusive thoughts and some deeply repressed memories surfaced
4. My mom apologized for everything she ever did and the way she let my dad abuse us, which is great but while I am trying to work on a relationship now, I can't forget all the pain that was caused during my whole childhood

"I have a persistent belief that my neighbors are spying on me with hidden cameras in my living room and maybe other places in the house. Rationally I have tried to believe that they had some sort of device in their house that can make out images of the inside of my house. I read that this belief is extremely common with people that suffer from Schizophrenia. However, the other day something that I believe happened to me concerning my neighbors has left me as confused as ever. 

For many years when I masturbate, I do it as if I am a woman. This means that I act as if I am a woman. I do not cross-dress but I do act as if I am Demi Moore from Striptease, Elizabeth Berkeley from Showgirls. When I see an attractive woman on television like Faith Hill during her NBC NFL opening, I like to act as if I am a woman, that I have the body of a woman and that usually allows me to ejaculate. This started probably when I was a teenager when I was admiring my butt in the mirror. I even use to joke to the few friends that I had growing up that I was a lesbian trapped in a man’s body. 

The problem that I have with my neighbors is that when I do the things, they appear to have a way of arriving and leaving from their house in strange 10 minute, 20 minute, Hour rituals. So let us say I ejaculate at 5:13pm. Say someone is at home at his or her house. At 5:23pm, a neighbor 10 minutes later will arrive or a neighbor already inside the house will leave 10 minutes later! Overtime this same thing has occurred 20 minutes later, A full hour later, 5 minutes later (this also appears to happen a lot when someone is about to arrive at our house they will show up five minutes before they arrived). 

Strangely, when this happens lately I have noticed what appears to be police sirens going off in the same matter. Therefore, it has caused me not to masturbate even when I should. I believe that it is not all legit and that these same neighbors along with other people routinely seen in my neighborhood could very well be involved. 

I need to know if this is all real or imagined and why I’m feeling this way.",5,paranoia

"I fear if I were to tell people what I experience then they would lock me away… How do you talk about your experiences without fear that a psychiatrist or therapist will recommend for you to be sectioned? 

I have told 2 therapist’s at different periods in my life what was going on for me in terms of my mental health, I was bluntly open and honest and then they became angry and sort to intimidate me and made veiled hostile threats to have me locked up in a institution through wilful force of their own. 

It’s made me question how mature these therapists are to just outright come out with threats simply because they feel uncomfortable or challenged. It has made me question a lot about human beings. 

So how do you take the risk to tell people what’s going on for you if they are in a position of power that may result in them directly contributing to having you locked up against your will and they may do so at a whim if they feel you aren’t doing what they want you to do… Seems a bit of a power play and these therapists are willing to use extreme cards on the fly if it appeases their ego and they do so in a reckless and careless manner just to gratify their own ego… That ain’t right",5,paranoia

"In the past, I felt like I was getting an okay handle on my depression and finding ways to deal with it, but I just don't feel like I can catch a break latetly. I got broken up with by my long term partner that I bought a house with about a year ago. Her life had a lot of issues going on outside of my control and I was not as supportive of a partner as she needed. I have accepted that at this point and am moving on, but a major issue is the house we bought together won't stop having issues and it just so happens to be all at once instead of throughout our close to 1.5 years of ownership. I have handled almost all of it as it comes up, but it seems like as I fix things, something new comes up literally 2-3 days later. On top of that, someone crashed into me a couple months back and just finally claimed the crash on their insurance so I can get my body damage fixed. I was saving and scrounging to cover the crash if it did not work out which is a postive now, but I feel like some of this is just hangs over my head all day as I work my full time job. Outside of all of that, my overall depression and anxiety as well as living with my ex partner has been a lot. It is a very complicated situation so more just airing my grievances and hoping it will all work out, because I just want some room to breathe. It feels like everything closing in on me even if I have so many positives and have the resources to fix the problems. I mean, being a home owner so young is an accomplishment and as far as I know a lot of my house is in excellent quality outside of the one main area we have been having issues. I just never know what my expectations should be anymore.

I used to be on anti depressants. ADHD and anti anxiety meds, but they felt like they ramped me up even more in some of the ways they were supposed to help.

"Dear schizophrenics, 

I want to warn you about flat earth. I didn’t really study this stuff much when I was young, and got stuck in it for a year or 2, and had to study my way out of it… I was a slow/lazy researcher, and kept letting it get hold of me, and it would make me delusional.

Please don’t get caught in flat or hollow earth.

Do your best to study.

This stuff can really mess with your mind until you grow enough to understand it. Don’t become delusional with it.

Eratosthenes experiment isn’t the same on a flat earth… don’t let people confuse you about it. Think about what a shadow would look like on a stick at the North Pole, with the sun hitting it from the side, with parallel rays (not mentioning tilt). Hollow earth would have inward pointing shadows due to an opposite curve. Sticks in the ground with shadows really can prove a lot.

South celestial pole is not possible on flat earth.

Moon and sun somehow magically float on flat earth and hollow earth.

The North Star disappears once you go south far enough.

Clocks speed up, and gravity is less at higher altitudes.

Meteors somehow make it through the flat earth dome.

The flat earth excuse for seasons is the sun moving further out on the flat earth map, but that would technically mean a longer day due to the sun doing a bigger circle. And doesn’t explain the analemma properly, and in Australia in summer, the sun actually appears to curve south during sunset, due to the angle and tilt…

"hi. I'm 18f. 
I am kind of scared right now.
I opened my Instagram dm requests for the first time in weeks and saw a sugar daddy saying he wanted to get to know me. usually I only message these guys back to mess with them then block them and move on. but this person sent me pictures of a check so I could do the mobile banking feature on the CAPCOM app on my phone.
I did it thinking it would just be bullshit but it wasn't. $1,050 into my account.

so I was obviously very shocked and a bit confused. he tells me to buy bitcoin with it and send it to another account and was starting to get aggressive. 
I know this was stupid so please don't berate me too much in replies but I gave him my phone number and email. like an idiot. I know.
anyway, I blocked him because my friends told me to do so and he emailed me saying he had my information and I needed to return his money so I tried but my account would only let me transfer $200 and then wouldn't let me do any more. 
I tried to explain this to him multiple times but he continued to be aggressive so I blocked him again. then he texted me the following message: 
""Hey. [my first name] [my last name], I'm U.S Marshall G.H Dozier from the Department of Homeland Securities. A report just got to us from a certain Smith Christopher that  you attempted to Steal from her of her work funds. It is advised that you get in contact with her and sort out the discrepancy before the law takes matters into its hands. We will have approached your bank and acquired all the necessary information needed to find you and confiscate you. Make America a better place. And get back to me ASAP.""

so obviously I knew it was complete bull because
1. a US. marshal would not text you
2. he spelled my first name wrong
and just a whole bunch of grammar issues I don't even want to point out.
I blocked the number and thought that was the end of it. two hours later I received another text.
we had the following conversation:

him: ""hello [my first name] [my last name]. Good morning. Am officer Eric.""

me: really now. police officers don't text people. or use improper grammar like you do. if you continue to harass me I will be in contact with the police. leave me alone.

him: why do you block your sugar daddy. why get u paid $1,050. 

me: because he was scaring me and so are you. goodbye. leave me alone or I will call the police.

then I blocked that number as well.
I finally thought that was the end of it, but I checked my bank account because I wanted to see if I could change my pin number just in case and all the money that had been sent was gone (there is still however an extra ~30 that was not there before and everything that was there before is still there as well). 

when I checked the mobile check deposit tab in the app the check now says ""pending"". 
does this mean he has my banking information? or can you just un-deposit someone's check if it's in your name. 

I'm very confused and very scared. it is also important to note that I have a paranoia disorder. every time a car goes by or I get a notification on my phone I start to freak out again. my cat was just messing with my sisters door and I thought it was a knock at the front door. every little noise has me on edge. I'm terrified. please someone give me a rational explanation and tell me this was just a stupid teenage mistake and I've learned my lesson and nothing else will come of it.",5,paranoia
I (male 26) found out i have undiagnosed ADHD recently. I am addicted to porn and binge watching tv shows as a coping mechanism for my childhood trauma. I was fine last year in a way. I had a girl whom i loved very much. But she was not as into me which i found out later when i proposed. I really wanted it to work with her because she was the first person in a long time who saw me for exactly who i was. I was never so happy before in my life. Its been almost a year and we talk from time to time. Now i feel like there is a void where the love and friendship used to be. I need to better myself first. I am trying to move forward but i feel like i have lost my anchor in life. I find myself watching porn and binge watching shows when i should be working. I feel bad afterwards but now i feel like i have lost the reason to better myself. I would want some advice from you guys on reditt on how i can get back on track and not lose sight of what is important. The ADHD kind of makes me forget and it is hard to coordinate.

"I’m feeling overwhelmed and fixated on this recent source of anxiety - something a “normal” person would probably not think twice about. 

I’m a pretty low-maintenance friend when it comes to communicating, I’ll provide tons of support and words of affirmation etc but I’m not one that needs to be in contact daily. Me and my best friend have this wonderful setup where we both know we adore each other, yet we can go up to 5 days without responding to each others messages, then when we do, we always do it lovingly (with voice notes and pics of our kids and news and thoughts from the past week). We always understand that not answering immediately is not personal, nor does it impact our relationship negatively. It did take years to build this sort of peace / not feel guilt over not immediately responding. 

Now, I have another lovely friend, whom I have recently gotten closer to (we grew apart after high school but in the last few years we’ve started talking again, I think because we both became moms, and have had some nice points of connection again. She is absolutely lovely and I even got the honor of being the godparent to her third kid.). She’s someone who messages almost daily, and whenever I message her (usually in response to something), she will message right back. I’m having trouble with this since I don’t feel like I have space/energy for daily messaging so I sometimes wait a day, or half a day to answer, and then boom she answers again. 

How do I navigate this? My problem is mainly the guilt I feel when I don’t respond immediately and the slight annoyance I feel for “having to” be in contact daily. My ideal situation would be that we write to each other a couple of times a week with no stress or pressure about response times. I’m a recovering people pleaser and it pains me to not immediately respond, but I want nothing more than a little less contact. Does anyone have any advice? 


For background, back in high school (15 years ago) this same friend had the habit of wanting to talk on the phone in the evenings after school. This was a huge source of anxiety for me, and I hadn’t been in therapy at that point, so I sort of did this combo of trying to please her while also feeling enraged and stressed whenever my phone rang. I have gotten better at setting boundaries now but I think that same “trauma” is now resurfacing and I’m worried I’m going to be in the same situation as before. 

TLDR: old friend and I have been reconnecting but she wants a lot more contact than me, how do I maintain my boundaries without hurting her?",4,anxiety
"First poster here. I’m just wondering if any one here also experiences some kind of annual depressive moods - I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety 3 years ago and this time three years ago I was severely depressed. I’ll spare the details but I’m a lot better mentally these days. Although some days are harder than others, but for the most part, I have healed and there has been a overwhelmingly huge amount of self discovery and growth. To which I’m very grateful, but it seems ever since I’ve gone through my depression, the main bout of it anyways, this time of year, late April, early May I’m more prone to get back in that mind-set and the same feelings and emotions I felt when I was in the thick-of-it always return. It’s like something is in the air for me and never fails to trigger my depression, and it’s super easy for me to fall back into bad habits. 

I’m OK and I’m safe, have a good support system, a councillor and coping mechanisms, I’m just curious is all and wondering if this isn’t just a me thing, how do you folks cope or prepare if you know a time of year will trigger you, etc., much love and good energy ❤️",2,depression

"I'm a third year, computer science student. Last summer (2022), all I ever wanted was to get an internship this summer(2023). I felt like a failure and the weight of not getting an internship loomed over me, as my brother had gotten an internship when he was in my year. It also didn't help, that I was checking linkedin and feeling sad as my other classmates had internships that summer. Everytime I thought about the fact of not getting am internship my heart would start beating so fast, I had to calm myself many times doing breathing exercises.

Fast forward to now. I got an internship as a software developer, if I were to tell myself this last summer I would be ecstatic, thinking, god has finally heard me. Now, don't get me wrong I am grateful for being able to get an internship, I know the feeling of thinking it's not possible. But, as I've gotten it, I thought my life would be complete in terms of the summer but clearly I feel the opposite. It's funny because as of right now in terms of work - it's pretty light. The guidance/mentorship in the internship lacks but that's pretty much it. What's getting to me is, the future. Even after my work is done I think of what might come tomorrow - What if they give me something big to do? What if I don't know how to do it at all? What if I won't get the help I want? What if it's really hard? All these questions + probably million more follow me like a cloud as soon as I close my laptop and until I open it the next day.

"I have fears about service providers. Long story, i have been mismedicated and misdiagnosed and mistreated by them to never trust one again.

Some of those thoughts people tell me are ""paranoid"" though, like my therapist told me yesterday, i don't veiw as such. The main thing is i've learned i can't trust psychiatrists, emergency rooms, crisis beds and any other crisis service or source of psych meds. I know i struggle with unmanageable problems (i just broke 4 days straight of too much energy no sleep hypomania among other things) and no one i know who's this fucked up is medication free, but i've spent most of the last 5 years med free after my medication-induced psychotic break.

"So, earlier today I decided to go for a little walk in the local park with my camera. I just bought Photoshop software today, and I wanted some pictures to play around with.

I had my camera in a strap hanging around my neck, and a macro lense in my jacket pocket. As I approached the entrance to the park (this little windy path through some trees) a couple came up from the path to the park, a man and a woman. I cast a glance at them, but I was busy changing the lense on my camera as I walked by them. 

I got maybe 20-25 steps down the path when I heard a sound that caused me to look over my shoulder, and there was the same guy (no girl). I thought ""that's weird, I wonder if he wants to talk to me."" He did, as it turns out. He called out ""Hey!"" I turn around and face him. He then asks ""Are you taking pictures with that camera?"" Up until he asked this, I was thinking the most likely thing he wanted was either directions or perhaps some loose change (these are the things I've been approached by strangers for the most in my life). I was puzzled by his question, so I just answered ""Yes. That's generally what one uses a camera for."" He was wearing a mask, but apparently was not worried about social distancing, because he came right up close and personal and then asked ""Are you taking pictures of me?"" Again puzzled by his question I simply told the truth. ""No."" I said. Then he asked ""Are you sure?"" And finally I understood what was going on. This guy was paranoid about being photographed. I told him ""Yeah, I'm sure. I take pictures of birds and trees and stuff like that."" He then just stood there for a good 5-10 seconds looking me straight in the eye. Then he said ""Good. I wouldn't recommend you do that (photograph him) either."" And then he turned and walked away again. As he was walking I just said ""Alright, sure, nothing to worry about there."" 

I was a bit exhausted in my mind, so I didn't come up with any snarky remarks on the spot, but I thought about a few during the rest of my walk. Something along the lines of ""Don't worry, you are not pretty enough to be in my scrapbook anyway."" Probably for the best anyway. I'm sure such a remark would have just set him off. He seemed the type that possibly was very insecure about his manhood, and would possibly compensate by beating witty strangers down.

Anyway, I had a good few laughs thinking about the absurdity of the situation during the day. How paranoid must you be, to think some random stranger is photographing you in secret? I don't know whether he was high, selling drugs or possibly both, but what the hell? 😆",5,paranoia

I got told I'm no longer allowed to use the washing machine because I accidentally left clothes in it on a hot day and it made mold. I'm working a minimum wage job I can't afford the laundromat along with groceries and rent right now.

I feel like my brain is against me. Between the adhd and depression it almost feels impossible to do the smallest of things. I just moved out of my abusive mother's house. I was never given the chance to manage my mental health. I wish people would understand how hard I'm trying right now. I just started therapy to help with everything, but it feels too late by now. No one will give me a chance to redeem my mistakes. My boyfriend is on the verge of leaving and I'm about to lose my house if I can't do my crap correctly. How do I manage this? It feels almost impossible.  I'm in dire need of advice from someone because no one around me understands anything about how my brain works. I just wish people would give me the chance I need. I'm not lazy, and I'm not a slob. I just forget to do things. What is the best coarse of action to managing this? This isn't a crisis of any kind. I just need advice.",3,adhd
"I am in my early twenties and am 5’6.5”. I have a hard time with women and so do my other short friends. My tall friends have a much easier time. 

I have a good physique, I have a very solid degree, and I’m generally well-liked and often make people laugh.

I constantly feel inferior to bigger, taller men. I train bjj but I know that most bigger guys could still beat the shit out of me. I’ve seen women approach my taller friends frequently. They also match with attractive women on dating apps, whereas I only match with overweight and/or unattractive women. I’ve learned to stop caring what women look like, but my friends and men in general will bash me for the girls I date/sleep with and generally respect me less because of this. 

I’ve spent an ungodly amount of time working out and paying attention to my nutrition in order to work on my physique, but no matter how hard I work, I will never be as physically attractive or powerful as a guy who is 5’10”.

I feel like I will never be respected or seen as dominant. I feel like this is a huge component of sexual attraction for women that I’ll never be able to satisfy.

I have dealt with relentless emasculation and depression largely due to this for about a decade now. I don’t mean to complain and I know this is incel shit but I just need help. I don’t know how any guy deals with this. Feel free to check my post history for more context. Thank you.",2,depression

I'm studying my masters (2 out of 3 years completed) which has 1 day of uni and 1 day of placement,  I work 3 days a week, complete training courses for work every other weekend and am trying to save for a house & wedding. I have had a lot of family health issues this year, as well as my own and a bereavement. I just feel so stressed and depressed again. I am not suicidal at all, but when things get like this I always wish I could run away or just leave for a while and come back and carry on as if nothing happened.

 I still live with my parents but see my Fiancé regularly,  but I just feel so down and defeated by the fact that it's almost impossible to get on the property ladder and I lack my own personal space. My family are slight hoarders and I just find the mess so overwhelming. I feel jealous of friends who have had significant help from family to get on the property ladder. I just feel in a rut and wondered if anyone has ever felt the same? How would you cope in my situaiton? I guess I just wanted somewhere to vent to people who don't know me and think I have my shit together. I know people have it worse than I do and I'm lucky to have a roof over my head, I just can't help how I feel.

"... And before I eat everything up or have no idea how to describe it to my boyfriend when he comes home in an hour or two I'd decided to write it down here. 

I'm 21 F, had to stop going to the therapist because they're just for kids and teenager and that ends with 21, at least here.

I've been on sick leave since October last year (because of my depression worsening) and left my apprenticeship in March, hoping that I'd do alot better with A) not being bound to a place anymore that hurts me mentally (software developing in an office with a huge lack of support from the trainer due to there being 5 for 80 apprentices) B) I don't have the stress from being on sick leave and C) I could make a change in my path and go for a more creative job with physical work like woodworking. 

I am not doing better, I'm not sure what I just had, but I was just crying, at least close to hyperventilating, stressed and throwing up. I feel like I'm getting suicidal again, but at the same time don't as I don't want to die, just need a break maybe... I feel trapped... Every day it feels like it's getting worse. 

My health insurance is forcing me to go to rehab(which I now see more as a chance to get better that I'm grateful for), the paperwork is quite alot and annoying but I got people that can help me. I just somehow need to get there. I'll probably try to find a new therapist, but I have problems with phone calls (one of the reasons I didn't call an emergency Hotline), but the social workers at the place I have to go to due to me not working currently offered to help with that aswell. 

I just stepped into a way too cold shower to distract myself enough so I can start to make myself busy, collected my favorite plushies and blanket, made myself comfortable with chocolate a tea and something normal to drink as I realized that I didn't drink for the last 5 hours and put on one of those dancing vegetables sensory videos to try and calm myself a little before playing a cozy game until my boyfriend comes home... Hopefully with food... I don't have the strength to make anything to eat right now... 

There's many more things going on, stuff I can't do that also just stress me even more.

Writing this down made me feel a bit better, so thanks for reading.",2,depression

"Over the past few years I've grown to hate the tattoos I got years ago. Since then, my motivation to work out and stay fit has decreased significantly due to feeling the tattoos ruin my physique. These tattoos have also negatively impacted my self-confidence leading to severe depression.  I have constant thoughts of inadequacy and hopelessness, making basic tasks difficult.   

I started laser removal 3 years ago but progress is slow. Has anyone else's disliked tattoos contributed greatly to depression, anxiety and loss of motivation to workout?

Read my Bible and pray, read other books, keep myself occupied and for God’s sake please stay out of my room. I am optimistic. We will see where it goes but please offer any tips you have or support.

i feel so dumb. how could i forget it was right there in less than a minute?!

i had this card for less than 24 hours and i ruined it, and now all i can do is cry because i don’t know where i’d be without my mom and i just want her to know how hard i’m trying and how much i appreciate her but the card i bought for her is bent.

i’m gonna write everything i said here in it i guess and i KNOW she won’t care but i just feel so incompetent. like i got up for THIRTY SECONDS for the EXPLICIT PURPOSE of getting something to keep the card from getting bent and then i FORGOT the card and BENT it anyways.

I feel like I get so close to doing some thing that I really want to do and have a passion for and then seconds before it happens I switch flips my brain and I go down these holes of what if‘s like ‘what if I buy this car and I magically get kicked out of my apartment and I have nowhere to live but I just wasted money on this car when I could’ve used it to help my living situation’ ‘ what if people think that I am trying to flaunt wealth that I don’t have and I start getting harassed or people talk about me and I get pushed out of the city I live in’ ‘ what if me buying this car is stupid because the follow your dreams idea seems to not work out for a lot of people and cause a lot of disappointment what if I end up super disappointed in myself’ 


I have suffered from paranoia and OCD for a few years now and as much as it has calm down in certain areas specific events like getting close to my dreams and doing what makes me happy starts this spike in paranoia and obsessive thoughts and obsessive actions where I don’t know how to function and I don’t have a lot of friends so I can’t bounce things off of people when I need to talk about them so I just have to sit alone. 

I have the option to put down a $500 hold on the car and I want to do it but my brain isn’t letting me do anything it’s like two sides of my brain are fighting with each other one wanting to do this thing in the other constantly spewing anything to talk me out of it. I want to do things that make me happy but I Ithink the problem is that I haven’t been happy in a really long time and I don’t know if putting my happiness above some thing that tomorrow or in a month or years later could really hurt me financially is worth it.

"This sounds like such a simple problem to ‘normal’ people, but when you think people are imminently about to kill/torture/rape you, how do you override your instincts to defend yourself? I’ve attacked a few people now; verbally and physically (staff I thought were trying to hurt me when I was properly ill in hospital) and it’s becoming more and more of a problem and I can’t think my way out of it. 

I get delusions where I think people are trying to kill/torture/rape me. Reflecting back on it, it’s clear they weren’t but in the moment I had felt no other way out than to defend myself against them when they did something that I believed was them starting to actually kill/torture/rape me. To make matters more complicated, people have genuinely attacked me in the past. I can’t distinguish between delusion and reality in the moment, only after lots of careful reflection.

When I’m not in crisis, I actually already underreact to situations because I’m so scared of overreacting again. For example, today I got hit (not hard) by a car and was so busy apologising and wheeling off that I didn’t stop to think how awful it was that he had pulled out of the pavement and ran into me without ever having looked down at me on my wheelchair. There’s lots of similar situations where I’ve allowed myself to get into danger for fear of overreacting. And yet, when I get ill, I’m so scared, I’m like a cornered animal.

Is the solution to just try to never react no matter what under any circumstances? If so, how should I override the primal urge to ‘defend myself’? What happens the next time I am actually attacked (either in hospital or outside in the real world)? How do I work around this? I don’t want to hurt anybody yet I’m also incredibly fearful of being hurt by others as I have been in the past.

Anybody have any experience with this? I’m at a loss. To make matters more complicated, my community team are currently trying to kill me so idk what to do?!",6,schizophrenia

Please help!! I've been feeling for the longest time that mt life is on camera or that the whole entire world knows about my life and everything I've done... Is this true??? I'm constantly thinking that I'm being made fun from things I've done in the past. I see signs everywhere but mostly on TV or peoples actions or words. Like people are making fun of me because I see relation between my past and what I see haunting me back in the present....,5,paranoia

I have major paranoia and anxity when it comes to doing anything with other people male or female. I have extreme social anxiety.  I have a very bad problem especially with women especially when I find them attractive I almost can't even function. I become so paranoid and anxious I hear stuff and thing stuff like she is watching me she is judging me. Then I look to see if other people are watching me because I think they are watching me talk to her and stuff. It's very bad even if I am by some attractive girl not even talking once to her I get these voices and racing thoughts and I get all red. It's even embarrassing because either have a new boss who happens to be an attractive women actually double my age embarrassing as it sounds and everything she is just by me I turn red and get voices and thoughts and she actually laughed about it are times it is so embarrassing. I go over many phrases in my head and I would never be with someone I work with but yet I still vet this way. What would you do?,5,paranoia

"I cant go to school without thinking every one is making fun of me when they laugh or they are looking at me. I cant get myself to eat in school. I ruined myself in sports, i was so good at soccer but i got so self conscious on how i run by the bullying i don’t bother playing it anymore because i think someone is looking at me or filming me. i feel like someone or something is watching me or is in the same room as me.  my body doesn’t feel right.

I am terrified for my safety and families safety, i get panic attacks like someone is gonna break in my house any second while im home alone or that im being stalked. (???)

It’s grown to the point where i cant sleep. I convince my self that there are spiders in my room/bed. To the point i hallucinate my walls moving (like melting and creating weird spider like things and seeing their legs come out of the walls?) ik its not real but i cant sleep by myself like that.

I often give people advice if they are paranoid on their looks or do. I tell them nobody really cares and if they do just give it a day or ignore it, but i cant use that advice for me its just hard., i want to work on my mind to take back control",5,paranoia

"I hope that's ok to ask this here. Also i can't tjink of a better title.

Basically, one of my biggest anxietys is over Meeting friends/loosing them. (It's not social anxiety)

Tody 2 friends asked me to hang out with them at theor place. And while i really love to, i always fear that i do sth wrong and stuff and they hate me then ladadadada... and that makes it extremely hard to hang out. Though hanging out somewere else and woth other people not only them is better, but not free of anxiety.

Does somebody know how to stop that? Before anybody asks that i should talk to them or sth: i did. I know they like me. I know i won't do sth wrong or things like that. But that doesn't help.",4,anxiety

"I've never used paranoia to describe my mental illness. It always falls under anxiety when I talk about my issues. But I just wanted to share this feeling with people who might understand, who can tell me yes or no, if what I'm experiencing is paranoia.

It's not like the stereostypic ""someone's looking at me through my window"" or the more serious ""I think someone is stalking me everywhere I go."" It's more like, I think the entire universe is out to get me. Like, I'm seruous when I say this, I feel that some being is going out of its way to make me miserable. It knows when I'm happy or feel safe and secure, when I'm most vulnerable, and it drops a bombshell on me. 

My life isn't exactly bad to be honest, I have it pretty good. I have a boyfriend and an apartment and an internship, but every so often, almost like in a sitcom, something utterly stupid happens, something totally out of my control, and it ruins my life for a few days, weeks, months, and in some instances forever. Nothing could have prevented it, an illness, a car accident, losing a job. Not always me but sometimes it affects those around me, indirectly affected me as well.

""That's just life,"" yeah I KNOW that but, it just doesn't feel that way... The universe is sending me a message. Sometimes I hear it talk to me, when I'm at my worst. It's just in my head though, so idk if it's related to my mental illness. I'd like to imagine it is, because the thought of the universe coming down on me the moment I realize it's playing games makes me wanna puke.

I've been like this since... middle school I guess. I remember distinctly. I got bad grades because the universe wanted me to be stupid and everyone else to be smart. I would study and memorize and still get B's and C's. It didn't matter that I tried, everyone else was better. I think it's the universe's way of saying I was never meant to be here and that I should stop trying. I'll never be good enough.

And I've been like this ever since, about a decade or so. I'm tired of this. Of being scared to make a move because it will always be the wrong move. I've made so many mistakes I wish I could erase....",5,paranoia

"I’ve just been in such a slump mentally and I need to get this off my chest even if no one reads or reacts to it. I’ve just felt so lonely relationship wise, like my longest relationship has been 3 months long and I just have so much love to give someone and I know that sounds general and cliche but it’s the truth. I try every single dating app and while I do get matches it seems like the matches I’m into never respond or barely respond or barely wanna hold a conversation and it makes me even more upset.

And I understand people around me will tell me things like “oh it’ll get better” or “you’ll find someone when you least expect it” but even when I try actively to find a gf it seems like an unreachable task. I just don’t know what to do. I just wish a girl I liked gave my a chance and for once tried fighting for me. Like that’s all I ask for honestly.

"So I have had severe depression since I was 10. I also suffer from extreme OCD, ADHD and OCPD. It did a number on me as far as self esteem and confidence. Fast forward a few years and I was very lucky to get a get a girl that really supported me through thick and thin. Due to her I became highly functioning but everyday was a misery fest. Of late, last 6 months I have lost my job and am the lowest point of my life. I am 42 so no spring chicken. My wife has grown progressively tired of dealing with my issues for the last 23 years. She seems to be disengaging and charting a way for herself and my son. I can’t get up and pursue anything meaningful to save my life. Always plagued with guilt, regrets, doubts and FEAR. 

While I have savings right now that will last me a bit due to my high functioning years I can’t help but think what happens after that. Do people who can’t earn (like me anymore) and don’t have active family support just end up on the street, homeless and waiting for death. 

My biggest roadblock to any success is my own mental limitations. Am on 22 medication a day and just don’t see myself ever coming out of this black hole. 

Can someone relate? Is there a story of inspiration out there, any helpful advise to a person who has spent a lifetime self sabotaging.

"I'm 16 and honestly I don't know what to do.My family used to be good enough financially a few years ago but ever since father's company shut down it has become tough.I was like 12 when the financial status began to hit but didn't get bothered too much because I knew something was wrong.Even growing up after it i didn't let me bother it cause I thought ""Nah it will get better,who cares if I don't have enough clothes or can't get the food I like it's not like this will affect me later on"".But since last year I have felt odd.I see my classmates go out and post on insta how they have fun and all with their nice clothes and the food they eat.At first it was fine since I tended to not care cause I had my games on my laptop and didn't have that much connection with others but I too wanted to have fun and have friends.Now it just eats me up a lot.My laptop's broken now so no more games and can't afford a new one or to even repair it.My parents are nice and loving and I love them the most and have no problem with them so I never say that I have a problem or anything but it's getting hard now.I have got some really important exams this year as I'm now in 10th grade and my cousin scored 95% so yes there's a bit of pressure.My cousin is really nice and motivates me a lot.He takes me out to movies and hangs out with me.Teaches me to socialise.Has a lot of friends and... I just envy him.I don't hate him I like him a lot but just... How did life just take a turn.I did think about ""no this time I'll do well in exams""But constant fights between my dad and my mom really does not help.They say not to interfere.I have a few friends but it's not a close relationship.Obviously i don't have a gf but I can't even afford one so yeah.The point is I don't even know what's the point to just survive.The only good feeling I get is just by cutting myself up with a razor blade.its not too much rn but I want to cut more big.I think 2023 is gonna be really bad for me.

"26 yo male. I’m on disability, working 12 hours a week and I’m on the third month working at my local goodwill. I feel people at my job resent me for my limited hours. And I feel like I’m falling apart at work. 4 hours a day isn’t always overwhelming but many days I just can’t do it, I swear. 

Two things are going on that are concerning me. One is that I have attendance issues. I missed two days because of major blizzards that stuffed me in and I couldn’t get there in the morning on time because of my parents big driveway. Then, I was actually sick one day. I left early a day for an appointment, and left early another day because I was going through psychosis and didn’t feel safe being around people that I think are against me and or reading my thoughts or talking about me badly. I was once a pretty darn reliable worker before my onset age of 22.

As I said, I am on disability so I can fall back on that. However, it is nice to get out of the house. But I do have an employment agent at my local behavioral clinic that can find me a job for people like me(disabled).

They’ve been supportive and listened to my issues and helped find solutions. But the warmer it gets the busier it gets and the more tense it gets on all fronts. I just am having a hard time. And no matter how hard I try sometimes, it just gets impossible to focus even on antipsychotics. 

Oh and they told me I’ve used up a “year’s worth” of attendance points and will talk to me tomorrow about it. Fired from goodwill is not how envisioned my life going when I was a boy. Is it safe to want a fresh start?",6,schizophrenia

"its a more or less a thought ive had since ive been extremely suicidal and pessimistic since age 5/6, ive always been extremely existential/nihilistic to a point of obsessiveness and compulsion, ive also had chronic health issues be in terms of chronic pain, severe epilepsy, and other huge medical events. I learned about nihilism from a book i was reading in grade one that i stumbled onto at the library.it made sense, my life sucked then,still sucks, and will continue to stuck in the future. I dont have some grand traumatic event that made me have these thoughts or at least i do think ?. i just kinda put my thoughts in order after reading a book. i was never abused or at least i don't think ? i was neglected by a legal definition sure but i only had one extremely poor parent so its expected - emotionally and physically. before my diagnosis a few years ago i never understood why i was so much slower than most kids as i started to reach the integral ages of 7-11 and began to noticeably slow down brain and intelligence development. i was below average in school and only did good on tests,after age 10 everything became so much harder. i never had friends before or any of that so i was already extremely behind in that regard, along with worsening grades, i just couldn't keep up with normal people and that continues to today. im doing terribly in school due to chronic pain from brain injury and now found genetic condition (CJS) which basically just degrades you quickly as you age, which i guess makes sense in my hilariously pathetic existence. Ive tried jobs and failed, i can barely function as a human my age and i dont see much of a real future. i also don't have a easily obtainable bucket list which includes travel and things like romance but i could take it or leave it tbh. ive kinda resided myself to that those luxury are for normal or rich people. i don't really see a point in my future ? im two grades behind in high-school due to my health issues and now im almost entirely reliant on passing a highschiool early out exam or dropout.my existence has just been a comedic play to someone i bet, reel out that carrot on a stick and give me one positive event only for 99 negative things to happen. i dont really see an end to my mindset either. obviously some parts are confirmation bias to an extent but when your told your entire life is confirmation bias it feels a little stupid. i dont have a long reason or point to life to stay around past 18 ? if anyone's got any ideas id like to hear them. there most likely not obtainable but im a severe maladaptive day dreamer so i could always imagine it. thanks for reading",1,autism

"hi, i just found this sub with a quick search because i feel kind of desperate to talk to someone about how i am feeling. please let me know if this doesn’t belong here. 

i (27f) have had diagnosed anxiety and depression since i was 18. i want to be fully, completely honest here because i never had been before. i have talked about my intrusive thoughts before with my doctors, i have been through inpatient treatment. i didn’t always have them, it’s been about 3 years of having the ones about me wanting to die. however i haven’t described what i am going through recently because i do not want to and can’t be back in inpatient again. 


i am having intrusive thoughts almost constantly. anytime my mind is left to wander i immediately find myself thinking and sometimes even saying out loud “i want to die/i want to kill myself”. i have never had a suicide attempt and i don’t feel like i am actually going to kill myself, i just can’t stop thinking it.


my intrusive thoughts have drastically shifted towards about being paranoid about being murdered. i live in a city with alarmingly increasing violence on the streets and public transit. it’s almost daily. this past winter i was physically assaulted by someone on the train. there is no specific person i am scared of or have been recently threatened by. but in public i constantly think i am going to be assaulted and killed. i think someone is going to attack me on the bus. i think someone is going to knife me from behind when i’m walking down the street. i think someone is going to shoot me in the back of the head through my window when i’m sitting on the couch.  i only ride the first and last subway cars so i can stand near the conductor incase something goes wrong. i get off of buses and trains as soon as anyone one makes me feel scared in any way at all. i don’t use headphones in public anymore and won’t look at my phone or read a book on transit. even if i wanted to i hear louder and louder and feel stronger and stronger that i am going to be killed. i didn’t know how to shake this. if anyone has any advice, books, other subs, or online resources to suggest please let me know! 
i want to reiterate that i am not a danger to myself, i don’t actually want to kill myself it just fees like a guttural  reaction for me to feel the thought and think i want to die. i am not a physical danger to myself. thank you in advance!🫶🫶",5,paranoia
"I currently have depression, yet I can’t seem to figure out how it’s been affecting me. The only things I know is what people tell me is off about myself, including when I’ve given up on simple things or stopped trying in uni and just allowed myself to do the bare minimum. The drive I had to pursue a future that I can at least support myself feels like it’s gone, and I can’t even get through my remaining classes without dragging it through the mud. I’m so close to graduating, yet everything in me just wants to give up now. At this point, I’m convinced stubbornness to not tap out in my last year is the only thing keeping me in. 

To make matters worse, living with my parents was no longer an option as of this year. I’m supposed to take care and provide for myself entirely, yet I’m bound to be homeless and financially ruined if I don’t get out of this rut. I can’t keep going through school and life with my brain off, trying to protect it anymore.

"I'm new to this community so idk if people have a big problem with self diagnosing, I know some communities don't have a problem with it, but if you do then let me just explain first.

The main reason I'm decided to diagnose myself is because I'm in the military. I've tried to pursue a legitimate psychological diagnosis but if I was really certain about doing that and it turned out to be true, that I really am on the spectrum, then I'd be put up for a medical board and might get separated. I can't afford to get separated right now.

I do still feel weird about diagnosing myself, I've never been much of a gatekeeper when it comes to anything really, not even mental health, if someone says they think they have some mental disorder or some sort of neurodivergence then I don't discount them, but I always tell them that nothing can take the place of an official diagnosis and I encourage them to do that. If they keep doing, just going full-on self-diagnosing and telling people about it and whatnot before they have a real diagnosis then it feels weird to me. I don't plan on telling anyone though, I'd like to tell my mom or dad but I feel uncomfortable telling them something like this so matter of fact when I don't have a professional opinion to back up what I'm saying, part of me knows they're just not going to believe me and tell me I'm wrong. Even so, knowing that I'm not going to tell anyone and I'm just keeping this to myself, I still feel weird about it.

I've been feeling a lot better though, it feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. There's just all sorts of things that've been happening in my life since my earliest memory and none of it ever made any sense, I always felt awkward and weird and I thought something was wrong with me and it really just made me feel awful. Ever since the idea came to me that I might be on the spectrum though, things have just been lining up and making a lot more sense. I try to be as conservative as possible when I try to evaluate whether something ""sounds like autism"" or not, but I'm still biased and I'm not a professional so I'm not saying it with such a high degree of certainty, but it's a really fitting explanation.

It just feels nice to not feel like such a freak or such a terrible person anymore, I feel like I understand myself better now. It used to be that I'd say something weird (apparently) and people would react negatively and then I'd feel bad because obviously I must've  been inconsiderate or stupid or mean or something else, but it didn't feel that way to me so then I felt even worse for not realizing I was being so terrible. Now it's like that feedback loop has finally stopped, I still feel a little bad but now I just feel alright accepting myself for all the weird things I do or say and it all makes sense. I know I'm not a bad person, if I say something that might be inconsiderate of course I still apologize, but now I just don't beat myself up about it because I know I'm not a bad person, and really that's because I've come to understand how I think and feel through my limited research. It feels really good, my self confidence is on the rise for the first time in years.

So yeah, I'm diagnosing myself. I just wanted to get it off my chest and explain it to a community that might offer some support or advice because I haven't told anyone in my life. I hope nobody tears into me.",1,autism

"for over 10 years i have gotten increasingly more paranoid. it has ALWAYS been about being kidnapped (from the street/my home/anywhere) or being attacked in my own home/bedroom. i have no ptsd or trauma related to these topics. my trauma is mostly s*a* related + the paranoia started years PRIOR to any of those. 

i had a psychotic break in summer 2020 and since then, i have been trying to regularly take an antipsychotic. the dr decided it was stress-induced psychosis but put on my chart MDD w psychotic features.

in summer 2021, i experienced more psychosis. i was in rehab when it began. it was NOT drug induced (ruled out as i was over 1 month clean at induction). i couldn’t eat, drink, take meds, etc. it ended with what my team classified as a possible hypomanic episode. and then i fell into a depressive episode for 3 months. that ended with another possible hypomanic episode.

now we are here. in nov 2021 i went back to shelter (a shelter hotel tho) because of abuse. i was experiencing low-moderate levels of paranoia around kidnapping/attacks. i have my own room + a key card that only staff also have + my door has a deadbolt. my room should feel safe. but as of mid December 2021-NOW (feb 8 2022) i am at the point where i am going 3-5 days with no sleep, only able to sleep during the morning hours (7AM-2PM) to feel safe, being convinced people are waiting for me to fall asleep so they can attack, checking all spaces people could hide/fit, calling out to the people “in my room”, running out crying because they know i’m on to them, having shelter staff come check my room multiple times a night even though i haven’t slept/left/no one has entered for hours, etc. 

it’s getting out of control. and then this week my psych casually stated that it was probably all just ptsd related ???? i feel very dismissed. i’m barely functioning and that’s it? i can barely leave my hotel room but i also spend basically 24/7 trying to figure iout if someone is there too. 

i’ve been hallucinating & dissociating too. it’s terrifying.

"I was cheated oo and abused in the last relationships by two exes. One was bipolar or borderline and the other was a narcissist.

After the narcissist came my actual girlfriend and so i had no time to deal with my emotions and immediately i was quite distant with her because of my anxiety. But she understood and tried anyway because when i was strange she asked me to explain why and I could do that. 

Now after months we are together and we start living together as well. Now she is far from since 2 weeks for reasons different than us and so we text and we call each other. This though meant that we were very stressed and we fought a lot. Either we were sexting, or talking about stuff or having discussions.

Discussion were started by both of us. The last though was a bit strange on her part and she was a bit aggressive. She didn't insult or anything, just aggressive.

That being aggressive reminded me of my abusive ex and made me go in a fear state.

She recognized almost immediately like an hour after the fight that her ways of communicating was shit (after i said its not okay to be that aggressive when i was trying to give my reasons calmly and she could not understand)

But after that i entered a paranoia state were i had to prove she was or she wasn't borderline.

That has been very stressing and sometimes i wake up at night being anxious and tense about that thinking about scenario were it will get worse and that she's actually BPD and she will abuse me and the more i read about BPD the more i get anxious.",5,paranoia
He seems completely normal then says something that reminds me that he thinks that that society/the police are watching him. He feels the need to kill himself before they do.

He had his first episode this weekend and I really don't know if he is still in it or if it's over and this is our family's new reality.

I myself am a piece of shit person with personality problems,
I have little to no friends or the support that an actual friend would offer.
My ex of 8 years dumped me for a guy who’s entire family is in the towns police force and they were able to have to cops come while i was at my apt to grab some stuff and file a bs complaint against me to get a restraining order on me making me lose my apt and my possessions my pets and over 7k in cash 
She is continuing in her pursuit with 4 charges of assault, one even being armed assault, and even said that i broke my restraining order and they took it seriously with. No proof whatsoever.  The one girl that i had been talking to for about 5 years that made me have problems with my relationship as i was hesitant to go towards her ended up rejecting me without even giving me a chance after i got left by my ex, yes i am a piece of shit for talking to someone else. We had a toxic relationship. My job is not interesting , i am not very good at it, its hard on my body and health i wake up at 5am every day . Im addicted to pot and alcohol , basically anything i can consume, the salary a make is no longer enough to afford a house or a decent appartement. And im pretty sure i have an std .

"venting and vaguely looking for reassurance

I got my car towed and left at a shop and both the tow company and shop have shining reviews but when I got back into my car at the shop, I noticed my cup.holder lid was shut. I did not shut it. that's where my quarters were. they left 50 cents. it didn't hit til now. I don't really care about losing like $3 and maybe the person who took it needed it badly but my car was full of stuff and now I'm super fucking anxious and paranoid realizing they did indeed take my quarters and I'm home now and it's been a while since I noticed like it was yesterday that I saw that. and now I can't help wondering if they took other stuff. but as far as I know taking change out of people's cars is just something lots of car people do as sort of a self-tip so whatever, and also when we cleared out most of the car it didn't look like anything was missing. but there was so much stuff in there and now I'm super paranoid that they took something important to me and I'm not gonna remember until way later and I'm just so upset and so nervous like what if they're taking more shit rn. I think it was probably the tow guy though because he was the only guy who was alone and the shop was closed when he dropped it off and I think that'd make the most sense and I had the least interaction with him. I'd think that a high rated shop would not risk that or a person working with multiple other employees would not risk getting fired if they got caught. So I think it was the tow guy.

"I was thinking of what would happen if my parents made a specific decision regarding me. It feels stupid so I don't want to say what but it was but it was something only they had the power to decide so I wouldn't been able to do much if they did.

A scenario played in my head and the world faded out for a second and I felt terrified. I had a split-second thought of ""why am I scared if nothing's happening?"" and the world came back and the fear, It didn't go away, but it went down to what usually was my peak anxiety levels. It happened so fast I barely even registered the terror. Only after it stopped did I realize my heart was racing and I was shaking. I don't know if it stopped because I realized I shouldn't be scared or if it just stopped so quickly regardless.

My sister said it sounded like a panic attack when I told or but it lasted for like a second? Or I guess it peaked for a second? Idk. That was years ago and it never happened again. People can have one off panic attacks but again it was so quick and it seemed like I might've stopped it by just the thought of ""I shouldn't be scared"" which panic attacks aren't typically controllable, right?

"I have been the victim of several instances of children / teenage boys seeing me and accusing me of racism. The first instance I was out at about 8 or 9 pm, sitting in a chair outside eating a burrito. A group of boys came out of a shop nearby and immediately one of them yelled “what is he doing out? Doesn’t he know it’s too late for him to be out?” He then took out his phone and started yelling for his other friends to come over while saying “this guy attacked me!” They came out and asked what I did (I was about 20 feet away and never saw the boy or said anything to him before in my life). He responds “I don’t know, haha, just who he is I guess! They’re kind isn’t supposed to be outside this late!” 

I was sitting looking at my burrito and glancing back at the boy as he yelled. I didn’t say anything or move. Eventually they left me alone but the incident startled me.

Last week at Whole Foods, I was looking at pizza. Out of the corner of my eye I looked over and a five year old girl was holding up her hand like an imaginary gun shooting at me. 

Today I was at the park walking my dog. I was going to throw a bag of dog poop away and two boys were on the bench nearby. One of them had a skateboard and he loudly popped it against the ground. Startled and beaten down from months of threats and intimidation, I looked down at the ground. Then I heard him say “yeah!” He was staring right at me with hatred in his eyes. I felt like he was purposely threatening me. Trying not to give in to fear, I looked back up at him and threw the dog poop away. Then I walked off with my pup. My dog walks slow and makes lots of potty breaks so as he did one I turned around to see the boy with the skateboard taking pictures of me. He then started to complain to his friend how “they will say he’s just walking his dog.” And how “hard it is to get this guy”. 

I am very afraid that the younger generation is learning to weaponize their phone against anyone they don’t like. All they have to do is threaten or insult the person, then whip out their phone and film the anger. It’s so easy to make anyone look like the bad guy, and you have no proof that they insulted you or threatened you for no reason. 

Why don’t I take out my own phone? Is it fear that holds me back from filming them in response? Stupidity? My PTSD silences me. In the moment I cannot speak, which is probably why I am still alive and free. But I am afraid they will come for me soon. 

I’m making this statement now, trying to raise awareness. If anyone is out there, be careful around children who may be entrapping you by inciting anger or rage in you. They want you mad, they want to film it happening, and they want to pretend that they didn’t do anything wrong so that you take all the blame. 

At this point, I feel that I am a victim of serious abuse. I am suffering regular mental breakdowns and fear for my life. I just want to be left alone. I just want peace and quiet. I don’t know what caused all this rage and anger, and I don’t know why I’m the target of it, but at this point it doesn’t seem to matter.",5,paranoia

"After spending like 6 months just trying to get a diagnosis, I finally got started on medication earlier this year. My doctor said she wasn’t going to prescribe adderall because of the shortage, but there were other things we could try. First we tried Vyvance. My insurance said they approved it, but they just meant it would count towards my deductible, and I got a surprise charge for the entire $350 or so. I can’t afford that, so my doctor switched me to dextroamphetamine the next month.

Both medications worked really well. I thought it was going to radically change my life. And maybe something will, eventually.

"Throw away obviously.    


I've been struggling with my mental health since I could ever remember.  I had anger management issues in elementary school leading to me getting special treatment and very frequent meetings with the school councilor who taught me to ""control"" my emotions (repress them.)  This lead into middle school where they deemed that unnecessary, which happened to coincide with me getting frequent suspensions for my behavior.  This lead into high school where I got into frequent fights for the first two years, mostly due to being bullied. This was to the point where I was on a first name basis with the school resource officer and the social worker.    


That is the point where I learned I'm no longer allowed to be honest about my mental health with anyone for fear of repercussions.  I was honest one time and I was immediately threatened with being hospitalized.  This has stuck with me ever since, I've learned to repress my emotions and the only emotion I really feel these days is a deep overwhelming sadness.  I've tried reaching out multiple times to different therapists and councilors, some of them are completely useless while the only one that was any help that I mildly trusted tried to hospitalize me again.    


I don't understand why I'm not allowed to talk about the fact that living is a constant struggle just not to unalive. I don't understand why I can't talk about how much pain I'm in.  I don't understand why the people who's job it is to help, go out of their way to make their patients not trust them.  I want to talk, I want to be better.  My brain won't let me and people just want to put me into a padded room instead of helping me.

"I’ve suffered from depression most of my life, but growing there was at least always some piece of future optimism I could hold onto. Moments of clarity and ambition.

In the 90s and early 2000s the world seemed optimistic too. Yea it wasn’t perfect, but as a whole society didn’t seem as bleak. Almost like everyone was moving in the same direction. People of different political parties could at least get along somewhat, politicians at least pretended to not be psychopaths…conspiracy theories were seen as fringe. People could genuinely get excited about new technologies. 

I’m in my early 30s now, I have a wife, a good paying job….but Im having a harder and harder time finding any positivity to hold onto anymore.

My many metrics were living in the safest and most prosperous time in human history. The average person has more personal convenience  and luxury than ever before. Wars are less frequent, access to information is universals Al.

But everything feels somehow much darker and bleaker. Social media is dystopian. Political division and corruption feels dystopian. Things like AI advances feel dystopian, sucking up all ambition among artists to be creative. Society almost seems poisoned by disinformation…nobody trusts anybody or any news. Everybody is selfish, and we’re destroying everything on the planet. 

Even things I loved like traveling the world feels ruined by commercialization and homogenization

"22F, applying to grad school. I just have one more application to submit, and it's for the program that I want the most. My personal statement is the only thing that's left, my recommenders submitted their letters months ago and I've updated all the other program-specific materials.
This procrastination might be coming from a place of ""perfectionism"", but I really cannot afford to delay my application any longer. Although the final deadline is in June, I'm an international student and will require a visa for grad school. So I need to receive a decision from this program by mid June. So all I need to do now is upload my SOP and click ""submit application"", like yesterday.
I had planned to finish all my applications by May 1st, but stuff (myself) got in the way. I really don't want to put this off any longer as I've submitted the rest of my apps DANGEROUSLY last minute this cycle.

It's so strange, this is my dream school. I've done my research on the program, identified labs and professors I would like to work with, even decided the courses I would like to take if I get in.

I wish I was huge because it would bring me pleasure and enjoyment that I haven't really ever felt. Again, I know that women don't care too much about size, but I don't want to have sex.

"TW!!! Throwing up / nausea 

Currently on the second full day of constant anxiety and I can’t take it much longer!! It started after me and my flatmates hosted a small Eurovision party + bbq at our house, it was 7 people altogether and I had an amazing time. At the end I started to get really tired, partially from the alcohol but also socialising for 6+ hours. When me and my boyfriend got to my room I felt nauseous and threw up, since then I’ve been extremely anxious. I woke up in the middle of the night with my heart racing and my brain telling me really horrible things about my relationship, I ended up doing breading exercises with my bf and ranting to him about how insecure I am in our relationship. Since then I’ve just had a tight chest (not in the heart attack sort of way), a sense of fear, and random bouts of crying CONSTANTLY for the past two days. I’ve tried to brush it off as a period mood swing sort of thing but this has never happened before. I feel absolutely horrible and the anxiety is constant. I just want to go outside and see my bf but I’m too anxious to leave my house. I’m also scared that if I’m with my bf I’ll just break down in front of him or do something stupid like break up even though I love him. I’m hoping it’s just my period and that it will go away in a few days but I just can’t take it much longer.",4,anxiety

Screws a little loose up here?” (Pointing at her temple, also I’m not pregnant, I just carry my weight in my midsection). It is sooo difficult for me to get out of the house and today I showered and put on these clothes that I thought I looked good in. I just froze from the shock of this interaction.

"Hi there,

My friend and I don't have any visible issues but every time I was in a group with her, I did more work, felt a lot of stress and she acted like she contributed evenly. She is toxic as an individual but she's not a bad friend per day to me at least. 

I have a hard time with confrontation and I switched myself to another group without saying anything (I'll use the excuse that the prof did it). 

The issue is the prof didn't switch any one else around and I just don't want to worth with her group on this. She's seen I'm not in the group and is asking I switch back. 

Not sure how to deal with this, I was thinking of telling her I'm fine with the group the prof switched me into but I'm worried this will impact our friendship etc. 

For context I'm in a graduate program that requires A LOT of group work, I'm working w her for all the classes except for this one now. 

Any advise is welcome, this has been causing me more anxiety (the thought of getting back to her is literally so nerve wracking) than necessary.",4,anxiety

But instead I embrace the pain,
Knowing one day I'll find the strength,
To face the world again.

As torturous screams fill the air,

But darkness is all that is there.

i’ve tried opening up several times directly to my dad in many different ways but it’s always greeted with explosive denial to say the least. my mum knows little bits but her being in another country (she left me) makes it harder as she’ll just worry.

"Bien. Posiblemente ni un alma lea esto pero bueno, creo que ayudara a desahogarme y sentir algo.

Siento que estoy roto, no tengo metas. No tengo nada que esperar de esta vida más que humillaciones.

Esta tortura comenzó en 3ro de primaria. Yo era bastante sensible y a mis compañeros les gustaba jugar con eso, solían golpearme y llamarme ""bebe llorón"" o simplemente ""perdedor"". En ese tiempo solo contaba con una amiga, yo la apreciaba mucho y quería hasta que descubrí que solo me hablaba por pena y para contar mis secretos con otros compañeros y así burlarse de mi. Eso me destruyo. Mis esperanzas en este mundo se terminaban, a mi corta edad ya pensaba en tirarme de un maldito puente y olvidarme de todo, volver a nacer en otro lugar y no tener este cuerpo sensible de mierda, no ser yo.

Comencé a alejarme de las personas, comencé a ser solitario hasta que me aburrí, quería contarle mis ideas a alguien. Quería tener amigos. Ahí conocí el internet, me enganche al instante, el hecho de que podía hacer un montón de cosas sin salir de mi cuarto o moverme me fascinaba pero aun  no me sentía satisfecho. No me siento satisfecho.

Los amigos que llegue a tener en el internet no eran suficientes así que lo deje. Trate de volver a la realidad y activarme un poco, eso paso el 18 de Marzo en 2021 pero ""OH SORPRESA"" mis piernas no funcionan, mi cuerpo no funciona. Tan solo estirar mi cuerpo me duele, y mucho, no aguanto ni dar 10 pasos para caerme rendido. Al inicio no le di importancia pero a los pocos días comenzó a darme una obsesión con el tema, probaba dar unos pasos y descansar para seguir caminando pero no funcionaba, tenia miedo, aun más por no tener a quien contarle.

Decidí olvidarme del tema y seguir viviendo por el internet pero ya no era lo mismo, saber que mi cuerpo no estaba funcionando bien me puso paranoico y ansioso. Mis horas de pasar jugando videojuegos pasaron a revisar paginas medicas, buscando que me pasaba. Lo más parecido que encontré fue un ""tendón inflamado"", no estoy seguro si es esto pero me esta matando.

Al volver a clases. No pude comunicarme con mis compañeros, ellos trataban de hablar y conversar conmigo pero yo sentía un nudo en la garganta, algo no me deja hablar. Siento que algo me obliga a no juntarme con nadie, que algo trata de hacer lo posible para que no me mueva del ordenador. Siento que algo me mira. No sé si ya estoy loco o si es mi paranoia quien me hace creer esto. Siento que esta detrás mío, escondido en la profunda oscuridad de mi cuarto, puedo ver algo correr de un lado a otro, puedo escuchar algo ahí atrás, algo llamándome, algo pidiendo que termine este sufrir. Tengo miedo de levantarme, quitarme los audífonos y verlo detrás de mi, observándome. Quiero pensar que estoy loco. Quiero creerlo. Quiero creer que solo creo que hay algo persiguiéndome por esta maldita soledad y el vacío que siento en mi. Quiero pensar que mi padre esta afuera tratando de entrar, que trata de sacarme de este infierno. Quiero sentir el calor de un abrazo y que me digan que todo esta bien, que solo fue una pesadilla y que tengo muchos amigos esperándome para hablar y hacer locuras juntos pero no, estoy solo, solo con mi oscuridad y con este sentir de que algo me persigue.

Quiero salir de esto, aun si la muerte es necesaria.

Perdón si fui muy críptico pero necesitaba desahogarme y si alguien puede ayudarme, por favor... AYUDA.",5,paranoia

"To begin this has been an incredibly trying couple of years. I am also using a throwaway account. I want to know in terms of me and my family if AITA or if they are. If they are I am willing to walk away.  
  
My parents are fairly well off, have a couple million for retirement and enough rainy day money if it should arise, multiple homes in different states that type of thing.....  
  
In high school I worked, in college I worked, between college and medical school I worked. None of this should be surprising in fact it is probably expected such is life. While in medical school admittedly overseas I was the victim of crime(s) by the medical school and forced out in good-standing. I did try and alert my parents/family that the medical school wasn't what we thought it was and that transferring would be a good option, used my connections to make it happen.... I needed cosigner's on loans and they refused to co-sign on it if I was transferring anywhere else. They also acted incredibly derogatorily once I was in to me in general. I am not sure what changed or why they choose this approach but they treated me with almost disdain. I get co-signing on loans isn't fun but on the other-hand they knew this had to be a possibility when I went to medical school. My life in the medical school wasn't good either and I was incredibly isolated had no friends there etc....  
  
When I was the victim of the crimes I did my best to alert them to it and I asked for help. I wasn't asking for money as I had enough for the situation, I just needed a phone call to a lawyer so they would talk to me using their connections. I fully understand if no crimes were committed and would admit if it was my mistake. I spent some time (alone) trying to get legal help to no avail and they absolutely refused to help. During this period I wasn't partying, hanging out with friends (I have none), just surviving and trying to handle things legally. I also wasn't legally able to work in the country if I wanted to. I eventually couldn't take it any more and went voluntarily to the psych ward for 5 or so days.  
  
I came home directly after.... They still refused any legal help. They live in the middle of the country and I am from a very cold wintery state. I have no car or any real transportation... Therefore, I applied for numerous remote jobs over a 6 month or so period. While dealing with the mental health issues arising from the crimes as well as continuing to do my best to handle things legally... They themselves admit crimes were committed and they just outright state they don't care. Suing ""wouldn't benefit them"". I was informed they won't spend a penny to help me in my future anymore.  
  
Again the same suicidal and overwhelming feelings returned and once again I checked myself into the psych ward. I will note I was overwhelmed, anxious, etc... And did cause some damage involuntarily after once again being denied any help. While in the psych ward I was informed they were kicking me out and therefore homeless (on my 29th birthday actually). Dealing with realizing I won't likely be successful, be a doctor, broke, etc... Has been a lot.  
  
\-Look I understand I am too old to be at home, I don't want it either. I have done in my opinion everything I can, including trying to prevent the situation in the first place. I just couldn't get a job. I get it's a strain and I am a burden, etc.... But the net result is I lost my family and extended family. I feel like I worked hard in my life and my family wasn't there for me. I will say the community now that I am homeless has been helping a lot. I would like your feedback who is right here?

"I have an on off boyfriend of about 7 years. We are both in our late 30’s. We don’t live together.  Over the past 18 months he has let me on much more and I’ve realised he has anxiety and depression sometimes which seems quite debilitating. He can’t get to sleep normally with something and he struggles in every aspect of life really although he has been working to improve them ultimately he is still quite stuck. 

He is really a beautiful person and I’ve seen the changes he’s made going from extremely angry acid tongued to now quite mellow albeit quite sad. The changes are what’s kept me around. 

However he has been saying he needs space and although my attitude was like ‘yea right’ as we were having the best time in our whole relationship I found this hard to believe. He has few friends and is alone a lot. 

I know I can’t make up for what he doesn’t have in friendships but he is actually my best friend and always been really supportive. I’m now trying to be on the same page and support what he needs which is space.

I’m just finding it hard to grapple with the great times I experience when I’m with him and him not finding value or fond memories of it to keep it going? 

We did spend some time together last weekend doing some selling which was planned months ago and when I left he called and asked if he ends the space will I come back? The issue is now I’ve seen the extent of the depression, anxiety and how evening something like a holiday, new experiences and total change of scenery will not pull him out of it I think he needs therapy and that’s the only way I would even consider going back. He really has done a lot by himself in improvement but he has got some traumatic memories if I think about it from quite young (being abandoned) all the way up to recent adulthood. 

I guess I’m trying to find out if he is just actually tried of me or if the depression is affecting his perspective on the relationship. We have had our issues but we have always worked through them. I’m just struggling with the space as we’ve kinda gone out on a high.",2,depression

"First of all, sorry for my terrible english.  
About 4 years ago I was diagnosted with dysthymia by a neurologyst when I went for sleeping problems,  is a mild chronic depression but i never took the antidepressive meds that were prescripted because my family asked me not to, i think that was a mistake. I had some traumatics events in the past but I was able to function, even though the thoughts that all I did was for nothing never left, I was able to made peace with that and keep them for myself, put a mask on and go as I was optimistic to my enviroment outside my home.  


My condition was very well controlled while i was in college, but when covid pandemic strikes, It got worse,  I was in my moms house like for 2 years, so now i struggle a lot with trying to get out of bed, i do lots of things in my room for trying to shut my head and dont think in anything, games ,videos, i sing and play guitar, anything that make me not hear my head, my anxiety, and my sadness.  
I been living with this my whole life, and now Im at a point that im burning bridges with my closest friends, being mad for any reasons while they are very far away and dont have a lot of chances to get them back.  


I started to go to a psycologist but at the 2nd session he told me i also need a psychiatrist as well, and Im going back to my neurologist. I m going to try to do all they said but I cant shake the feeling that is all for nothing. I dont know what is going to change. Also I notice my family is getting really affected by this, they are trying to help, but they dont have enough tools, they end up getting mad and saying horrible things, even though i know they are trying to help the only way they can.   


I really dont know what to do because I feel like my life is getting destroyed by myself, and even though i can rationalize that is my sickness, the feeling that is just me who is doing this wont go away.   
Is there anyone here that beat this kind of behaivours? Is there any hope for this to get better? I just need some hope, and advices for the day to day.",2,depression

"So I've always kind of had a fear of the dark as a kid. I think everybody has at some point? Maybe not? I'm not so sure.

But recently, within the last 6months, I've been completely and utterly terrified of the dark.

When I get home from work past midnight, I triple check outside my car, just to make sure nothing is waiting for me to get out.  When I'm home and it's also past midnight, and when my roommate is already asleep, I can barely leave my room to go to the bathroom because the whole house is completely dark. I feel so immensely paranoid that someone has broken in and is waiting to kill me. 

We DO have an alarm system, so I try to remind myself that nothing will happen if it doesn't go off. That it's completely safe because I'm guarded by this very expensive system. And my very kind roommate recently got night lights in the kitchen, living room, office, and even the bathrooms so I don't feel so scared. 

But even then, I still feel like it's not enough. Someone or something is actively tryna to get me. Sometimes I hear shit around the house, like a rustle or someone outside talking and I get so frightened I start triple checking if everything is locked and the system is on. 

I get so paranoid from the dark that I keep my closet closed and my windows covered up completely with tapestries. I lock my bedroom door, and keep the lights on in my bedroom while I sleep. I actually got curtains for my bathroom window (even though it's painted glass and you can barely see anything out of it) and keep it shut at all times. I cannot even stand the idea of having my completely dark with just a tiny night light. Like I need to be able to see every corner of my room. Sometimes when I'm EXTRA paranoid, I keep my laptop at a low volume so i don't hear anything else but a video playing or something. 

I even got a big ol dog to keep me company at night when I feel so paranoid.

It's starting to really affect me. I cannot do anything at night without feeling like someone or something is watching me. I can't even imagine going to late night parties. It mortifies me to say the least. I just CANT do it.

I hope someone can relate to this. Please tell me I'm not going crazy for having this extreme fear/paranoia of the dark.",5,paranoia

Hello. I'm not sure if this is the correct place to put this, but I (24f) need some advice for a situation with my brother. TLDR at the bottom. 

For the past 10 years, he has had a very rocky relationship with my parents and members of my family due to differences in beliefs and values, mainly on smoking weed. This resulted in him moving out about 4 years ago. However, he began talking and repairing the relationship with them, and over the past year, it has slowly gotten better. This is the case, until last month when he started making 2 accusations about our family. The first is accusing relatives as well as our dad of putting spyware on his phone and computer about 8 years ago and tracking his every move, and the second is that he was caught at a family function smoking weed and family members laughed and mocked him for it. Both of these events never happened, nor anything similar to it. This has also been confirmed with many family members as well. However, my brother refuses to believe it, and believes that we are all lying to him. He will also continue to call/text my parents, myself and other members of my extended family questioning us, and trying to get us to admit to both of the events. We continually try and call him and check up on him, and visit him in person, however he only wants to talk about the accusations and refuses to discuss anything else. He also continually comes up with more and more ""memories"" about the situations each conversation we have, and is becoming more aggressive each time.

After some researching and talking to some mental health professionals, we believe that my brother is experiencing a psychosis and is dealing with paranoia. We have a ""diagnostic"" virtual family therapy session this Friday which we got my brother to join (Basically, the therapist can learn more about the situation and assess my brother and then refer him to further psychological therapy, and us to family therapy if that makes sense). However he texted me this evening stating that he was expecting us to admit to him what the family did before or during the session or else he will never speak to anyone in our family again.

I honestly do not know how to talk to him anymore, since he believes that we are trying to harm him. Through my research online, I have read that we shouldn't argue about the paranoias the person is facing because it will agitate them even more, nor should we agree to their delusions. because of this, I'm at a loss on how to communicate with him, and am very worried that the therapy session won't meet his needs and then he will stop communicating with the family and we won't be able to get him help and resolve the root issue. If anyone who has been in this situation or knows someone in this situation, or is a mental health professional, can please give me advice on what to do in this situation and how to communicate with my brother, and also how to approach this therapy session, or even how to calm my anxiety before the session it will be very appreciated.

TLDR: Brother is most likely experiencing psychosis and is accusing members of the family of harming him years ago. We have a family therapy session this Friday and he says that he will cut us off completely unless we admit to the accusations at the therapy session.",5,paranoia
"everytime I go to school i'm filled with dread about how maybe they moved and they'll see me and tell everyone. I'm afraid to interact or make friends with anyone because i'm afraid they'll ask me about my old school and know someone from their and they'll ask them about me and they'll tell them i'm the crazy person who used and take pictures of people to make sure they were real. My last breakdown was so bad that i didn't go to school for weeks this was during my mom important medical therpy sessions and she couldn't go because she had to look after me. because of this i feel like my mother and father hate me and they may tell me they love but their lying just so they can kick me out when i'm 18. I've tried to ask them about it and they wont give me a straight answer my mother told me she wasn't happy, that of course i could never hate you, but then also said how else do you expect me to feel? so i feel like she must hate me.",5,paranoia

And, one of them tries to plan things without me being there and talks behind my back. Maybe they even have a gc without me in it.

It ruined my mood for the whole day, and thats coming from someone who can go from sad to happy in a minute. Do you think these are signs of paranoia? Or something like it?

"I, 22 female, and my boyfriend, who is also 22, went to brunch earlier today. Side note my boyfriend is Chinese. We walked into this restaurant, and the man immediately greeted us and gave us a dirty look. He still sat us and took our order. There were two women and a man at a table next to us. We had ordered our drinks and food, and when it got to us, it all looked delicious. I shared some of my food with my boyfriend, who ate the food off of my fork. I’m unsure if it was because he ate off my fork, but I heard one of the women next to us say, “I’m done here.” Another issue is that as a waiter/ waitress, you must check on your customers every once in a while, no matter how busy it is. I know this because I am a waitress at a restaurant too. Our server didn’t check on us, but there was a friendly waitress who did check on us and gave us our bill. We have gone out to eat as a couple many times, but this has never happened until today. So am I just paranoid?",5,paranoia
"I've had this lingering feeling in the back of my mind that I'm like.. an operative or something? There's been a lot of odd things through my life. Periods I don't remember and my mom said there were, at certain points, groups of people or sometimes individuals that would show up only when I was with her and never when she was alone. I've had people come into my life every other time I've come close to figuring this out that are a little *too* perfect to the situation I'm experiencing. Similar enough to me that they calm me down and throw me off. People that have given me psychedelics and encouraged me to spill lots of deep memories often deflecting when I asked them the same question. Sometimes those were the same people. I've been convinced at times that romantic partners of mine that just had randomly moved to the city were intended to keep tabs on me and two of them have even admitted it, albeit casually, almost as if to indicate I couldn't stop it if I tried. 


My last phone, I got calls periodically from different numbers but the same area code and I wouldn't answer because why would I? They left me voicemails where a female sounding robotic voice would start reading off numbers and at the end it would say thank you. Eventually I decided the calls needed some basic exploration and I searched the area code.

Next day, you know what happens? My partner persuaded me to get a new phone. I don't know where my old one ended up.

"I've been in my retail job for years in a management position. A couple weeks ago my keys glitched out of the matrix. Completely gone, cannot find them anywhere. I'm not someone who usually loses things, mind you. I left work, drove home, stayed at home, went to work the next day and they're gone. I've cleaned everything at home, everything in the car. No dice. Since then I've been trying to keep it from my boss-because he will just use it as an excuse to make my life miserable-and have been using my keyholder's (N who is my friend) keys and swapping back and forth. Today I was using a different keyholder's keys (D who doesn't hate me but we're not friends) while he was working with me and my boss. I noticed towards the end that he has a different set of keys hanging out of his pocket. I never saw if they're store keys or not, but they're on the lanyard D previously used for his store keys.

Some context on my boss: he is very petty, manipulative, and I've seen him weave complex lies for the purpose of manipulation and mind games. He claims to care for me, but he wants to have an affair with me (he's older than my dad) and I've seen him play mind games and mean pranks on another woman who he is currently having an affair with (he has never admitted this). 

Some context on me: I took many hallucinogens and psychedelics while in high school and have experienced drug-induced and non-drug-induced paranoia before. It doesn't plague me every day but often enough to cause me to doubt myself. I was on anti-anxiety medication when I was younger as well.

I feel like my boss and my coworker somehow took my keys and are playing mind games with me. My boss has made jokes about how I lose my keys and at first I thought he was referring to when I misplace them in the store or stockroom, but now the jokes are ringing in my head. I should have a complete set of duplicated keys by tomorrow, but what if my boss is setting me up to blackmail me with the knowledge I have illegally duplicated keys?  What is his end goal? Is he just enjoying watching me squirm and laughing behind my back? Is all of this just another paranoid delusion? If anyone reads this, please, I need an outside opinion. I don't even feel like I can trust N anymore, and I thought he was my friend. Thank you for your time and any input you can provide.",5,paranoia
"About six months ago I was just a normal human being. Careless, and did not worry about anything. I’ll admit, I’ve always been a hypochondriac throughout my 23 years of life but it never impeded me from doing anything I wanted to do. I worked, traveled, worked out, hung out with my friends and always had a great time. No anxiety at all. Six months ago, just out of nowhere my brain decided to ruin my life. I had a horrible panic attack that literally came from nowhere. I wasn’t even anxious at all. Never dealt with GAD. I obviously got very scared and ran to the ER because my heart wouldn’t slow down. I thought I was going to die if it didn’t slow down. After many tests everything turned out to be just a panic attack. Well, I thought that was it but little did I know that panic attack would change my life. Now, I can’t even exercise, walk far, travel or even hangout with my friends. I struggle to even be anxious free at work. Here is the most devastating thing: the girl I always wanted to be with, my dream girl, who did not know I had feelings for, wanted to hangout with me on two different occasions. I had to literally make up excuses to not go because of this agoraphobia and anxiety I’m dealing with. Now she’s dating someone else. Why did this happen to me? I never did drugs, drank or did anything stupid to cause my life to be the way it is now. I can’t even take my mom out for a Mother’s Day dinner without having too many second thoughts. My grandparents who I always visited and love to death are currently very sick and they live outside the country. Before, like most of us human beings would not worry about traveling. Now, I’m even worried about walking around my park. I don’t know what to do.. all of my plans I had have suddenly taken a major halt due to something totally unexpected.

"I've got 2 exams for my mortgage and protections qualifications tomorrow and Friday. This is the final hurdle to get qualified and be positioned to start working with my dad to take over his business. 


My dad is terminally ill at 60, and when his cancer returned he asked me if I'd train to take on his business that he has built up over years and years. It was just his brother and himself working there but my uncle retired last year so he is solo and doesn't want it to go to waste once he has to step down. So I took it on and pivoted from my own pursuit of growing my fledgling gardening business to a sudden halt and change of direction to do this both for his legacy and my future prospects. I've studied for months and gained the first part of qualifications with this being the final 2/3rds of it to be able to work in the business. I've come back to the UK after being in Ireland with my wife (we moved there when her own father was terminal to support her mum etc), so I'm here in Scotland for my last few weeks revision and exams. 

Since arriving I've mentally and physically dive-bombed and spiralled. I've not been capable of studying properly or consistently as I planned, I've let my nutrition slip greatly and lost lots of weight that I can't afford to, my insomnia is amplified and colluding with my anxiety, stress and low moods to the point where I'm barely functioning. I've had 2 nights in the last week that I've not slept until about 9am and I am feeling so utterly lost and overwhelmed with the pressure of getting past this exam and all it represents. I'm racing against time against my dad's cancer and I simply have to get this done and begin the transition ASAP before his health fails to the point that he cannot work at all and be there to supervise me as is part of the necessary process to be allowed to run the business (I need 6months supervision once qualified to be eligible to run solo). So there is a very meaningful and powerful rationale for being motivated to study and pass these exams, yet I've failed miserably at giving myself a good chance at doing so. 


I've slipped massively into a bad mental space, I'm not doing anything right for myself, both body and mind, and I'm on a collision course with failure. I've spent much of the last 2 weeks here in bed, avoiding life, my studies and feeling entirely consumed with anxiety and depression. I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen yet it has. I'm away from my wife and pillar of support and main source of external regulation. She believes in me and says I'm dojng great and she's proud of me etc but I feel so much guilt and shame when she does because I know I've fallen so far and am letting everyone down. I tell her that I'm not managing to study and when I do rally to open the books that I cant force myself to stick to it for long before I get saturated and feel like nothing is being learned. I turn a page and don't know what I've just read when I reflect on it. My memory and recall is shot, and I know why and that not only am I not helping myself by practicing self care, drinking water, sleeping well, eating regularly and well, exercising, going outside to get done sun and air etc, but I'm also making it much harder through the neglect of myself and health. The sleep has been a nightmare and constant battle. I'm using melatonin, started to try 5htp this week, and nothing I do can override the presets of my nocturnal mind. I'm so very fucked and really don't know what I'm going to do if I can't find a path back to balance and break above the darkness I'm being shrouded by.

"I needed to make a throwaway account to vent my feelings, because I just have to get some things off of my chest. I hope this post won’t get deleted because of my nonexistent Karma score on here, but we’ll see what happens.

I just hate my life. All of it. Sometimes I wish I was never born, and sometimes I just wish things were different. I hate being perceived as an incompetent weirdo, simply because I’m autistic. I don’t have the luxury of a support system, nor does anyone care about me. I’m all alone, fighting every day to even just get out of bed.

The more I do this, the more weary of existing I get. I live such a dead end existence, working a job that I’m so burned out on and have no motivation for. I’m in debt and can barely save any money at all. It doesn’t help that I have a chronic spending problem due to it giving me somewhat of a temporary high to fill the empty void where I’m given no affection whatsoever. It makes me feel good for a while, but it doesn’t truly make me happy. 

I don’t have a partner either, and I wish I did so that I could at least focus more on them instead of my broken mind and heart. I miss my Ex still even after we broke up in November. I want to be back with them but they already are with someone else. It’s super hard finding a partner at all these days now, and no matter how hard I try, I come up with no results. I guess I’m just not what people want, and I’m to die alone. Who knows? 

I lost faith in my religion as well. Nothing but bad has happened in my life, and when I turned to God for answers, more bad just ended up happening. If he exists, then he definitely hates me. I was told I was never meant to be born either way. Maybe this is my punishment for existing.

I’m surprised I’m not hooked on alcohol or drugs as a substitute for covering that gaping hole, but it just doesn’t really appeal to me. 

I just don’t see my life going anywhere anymore. I just want it to end, or I just want things to go my way for once.

"I keep getting the advice of ""oh, if you just practiced, your social anxiety would go away.""  No, no it won't. I feel like people either don't know what social anxiety actually is or they're using the term in a very mild way. When I tell people I HAVE practiced and it's done nothing, I feel like they think I'm not applying myself hard enough.

I took a public speaking class where I had to present regularly. I got better at acting like I had it together, I suppose. I got feedback that I was improving, but I never *felt* any better. I was always anxious and always relieved when it was over. And our presentations always had a time limit because it was large class. When I've had to give presentations or talks at work that last longer than 10 mins, my hands start shaking and my voice starts shaking, and if I keep pushing it, I'll lose my voice altogether and not be able to speak. Even when I tell myself ""you've got this"" and ""it's not a big deal"" and even if I feel calm, the physical stuff starts happening, and I can't control it. The only way I've found to sort of manage it is take a few seconds to grab water and breathe, but I'm always worried that tactic will give out eventually.

I can practice in front of a mirror, but all I'm doing is staring at myself. Where's the fear in that? I can practice the *words* but that doesn't prepare me for the *environment*. I can practice in front of family and friends, but they aren't people from work who will be judging my performance on a different level.

I fidget and get very uncomfortable during job interviews (I'm back on the job hunt), and it's the same problem. I can practice interview *questions*. But I can't practice sitting at a table surrounded by people I don't know who are judging my physical appearance and job history in a very de-humanizing way.

I was encouraged to sign up for a leadership course (""to build confidence"") where they're supposed to teach you all those great leadership skills. And I suppose they did, but I can't say I got anything out of it. It was absolute torture. I was highly anxious the entire time, and I hated every second. Threw all my learning materials in the trash when it was over and ran as fast as I could from there.

I've spoken to a therapist who suggested MORE public speaking, and I stopped seeing him (he also tried to suggest certain traumas happening in my past that didn't, so he had other issues). I feel like people aren't getting it. Repeatedly putting me in stressful situations again and again doesn't relieve the stress. I can develop skills to *mask* it, I guess. But it doesn't make me hate the situation any less. It still feel constant anxiety, and eventually, I will do whatever I can to not be in the situation anymore because no one likes being that stressed out all the time.

I have several years of customer service on my resume. *Can* I work with clients? Sure. Can I do it *confidently*? You're going to have to tell me because inside I am screaming the entire time about how much I just want the situation to end. I've also worked as a receptionist, and I left that job fast. I got a lot of good feedback from my supervisor about it, but I could *not* handle the stress of picking up the phone and not knowing what I would encounter for 8 hours straight. 

I just started with a new therapist, and I'm *hoping* she's going to have something useful for me other than what I've been told my entire life because it doesn't work. And I am so tired.",4,anxiety

"For 8 years now I have been playing video games as my main source of entertainment. Gaming does something for me that movies and TV shows haven't really been able to achieve. I would say it's the immersion and flexibility of the stories in video games that I really like in comparison. 

Around 2021 though I got progressively more burnt out of videogames. This was around when I played through all campaigns of Halo: MCC on Heroic difficulty. I felt pretty good and played a bunch of multiplayer. I didn't really have anybody to play with on that game, so I got bored after a while (110 hours). I noticed afterwards though that I would spend more and more time on the library screen, scrolling through trying to figure out what would be a good game to play next. It got to a point where I got stressed by the scrolling and zoned out on Youtube. 

It wasn't all bad though, it gave me more opportunity to discover more hobbies and activities. I've been more social, I drew more art, and I recently discovered a love for directive writing. What bugs me nowadays though is that I would still have moments where I really wanted to play a game, but I would just scroll though and end up not playing anything. The only opportune times I played a video game was when my friends were playing a game on Steam or Roblox and I joined them for 1-3 hours. 

There's many reasons I have come up with too on why I'm so burnt out on games, not finding the right genre, not playing with the right groups, shying away from stranger players on MMOs. Those are some of the surface issues that I have with games, and it's not the lack of games that bother me, but rather I think it's an issue with really getting into the game that I'm playing. I've struggled recently to invest myself into a game, and it's caused me to close the game in the mid stages of a campaign or a storyline. 

Recently I tried playing RP and MMO games, but I notice that in those games I get really shy, even more so then in public, (it mostly stems from toxic players online). I also got hooked onto Dwarf Fortress for a bit, getting invested in it's complexity, but then I got bored of it too, unprompted and without reason. 

I'm hoping that I can find a spark sometime for games, I feel that it fulfills me emotionally and it sharpens my strategic, perceptive, and reflexive skill. If anyone here on this forum knows/feels gamer burnout too let me know, I'm still semi-fresh on my own super powers :) .",1,autism

"39/F. ADHD combined and Fibromyalgia. 

I lost my previous job (story of my life) and landed a new one and I was supposed to start today.

Last night my little girl (7) was really sick and I was awake with her until 4 am, I was very close to heading to the hospital with her because her fever/pain/elevated heart rate was so bad.

Instead I did what I could, giving her pain relief/monitoring her/holding her for hours until she calmed down/fell asleep.

Needless to say when the alarm went off at 7am his morning I was a total wreck and my Fibromyalgia has flared up so badly my body is in aching from head to toe.

I messaged my new boss and he was cool with me starting tomorrow instead. Literally so cool about it. 

But.. Can someone please tell me why I feel so guilty about missing one day of work, all I did my was my job as a mother and looked after my sick child?

I honestly feel sick with stress to the point of panic and nausea because I feel like I ""let everybody down""

Why does my brain do this!?

"My paranoia seems to have worsened over the years. My current belief is that a demon is after me and I'm under some curse (to the point where I would rather speak to a priest instead of a psychiatrist about it, to see if anything can be done to remove it from my life).

When someone sends me a friend request, my first thought is ""who is that and why are they after me, what are their intentions?"" Even with a friend I haven't heard from in a while, I'll assume there's some evil agenda they have. I've become distrustful of most people.

In the shower, sometimes I'll imagine that there's a black hole behind me ready to suck me in. I am well aware of the process of spaghettification, so it has become a fear. Some people say black holes are not scary, but uh, being stretched out and sucked into a hole that leads to who knows where definitely is pretty scary to me.

Before I see a horror movie, I check to make sure that it isn't ""cursed"" and that nothing terrible will happen to me from watching it (example: in 2014 me and my ex watched the conjuring, which is considered to be cursed but I didn't know it at the time, and afterwards a bunch of bad things happened in my life).

Oh yeah, and I believe I'm psychic and that everything I worry about will come true or is true.

"I'm attending university and while I am on the road to a top grade, it doesn't feel like I've done much to deserve it, it does not feel like it is genuine. I keep worrying that if I leave the university, it will tell its students and staff to track me down and watch me, so I think their grade system has been altered to fit my pace. A few days ago, they announced an extension for an activity that I have been vocally but privately discussingwith someone. I am sure that I am being watched and monitored by my university and friends right now. I was told to download a software for my course and I can't disable it. My university has a hidden reputation and I worry that they will use it to their advantage to intimidate me into submission or notify my friends and family of my whereabouts in the event that I move someplace else. This would lead to me being tracked down for life and I have been aware of this since I was young. I need to ask for forgiveness but I don't know how. I was dismissive at the time that I didn't think about it. Three days ago, there was an RSPCA van but it wasn't genuine because the logo was smaller and did not look real, and upon looking at the side window, it drove away immediately. The person inside had a GPS . A day before that, a lady was walking by my house with what looked to be her friend, and she was looking down at the ground, the way that she was walking was unusual and I think it was something that I was supposed to understand, but in that time, I didn't understand, so I never got if she was helping me or not which I feel really distressed about even now. I have only taken a photo of the van but I can't share it. In my walls, I heard tapping (not heating) around 4pm yesterday, I knocked at the wall and nothing knocked back, but the knocking continued every time I diverted my attention from it. I looked at my laptop while still focusing on my walls and nothing happened, so patterns are taken into consideration. This is recent so I don't know what this is pertaining towards, but I remember that I had a dream about my wallpaper being red paisley which was a sign (not from God), but I didn't want it, it's a bad sign which I have gathered. I worry that people can read my thoughts when they touch me or are talking to me. I had a very uncomfortable thought while someone was talking to me and I felt sick, they asked if I was okay which I attributed to them knowing I was uncomfortable due to the thought. Now I'm worried that my lecturers have seen my thoughts but I don't remember if I have had awful thoughts during lectures so I am panicking badly about this. I can't eat and I feel sick every time I try to, and attending lectures makes me feel extremely nervous, but I can't turn to God because I have no knowledge of whether I had been dismissive, so I have no good reason to. I've been looking at pictures on my Pinterest to stay on board as I store my good pictures there, and have been hanging hamsa in my room to divert the bad pictures. Bad pictures usually come from bad numbers, sounds and rarely music. I can't stop crying and feeling sick and I have to go under my covers when I do but I keep worrying that cameras are being poked through the fabric and my neck. Every time something doesn't feel right or go my way, I get overwhelmed immediately and it's affecting my relationships. My best friend could be a part of this which is horrifying to me as I have told him a lot of things. How do I ask for forgiveness? I'm really worried but more messages and signs keep coming through, I'm really frustrated that I can't understand all of them",5,paranoia

"At least I hope it's just a feeling, every time I look somewhere my brain has decided is hiding a camera I find nothing, yet in my head it's still there. Cameras hidden in the vents, in the little corners I can't easily see, microphones hidden in my walls and spyware on my computers. Whenever I go outside people stare at me and security cameras keep track of everything I do. I keep a journal but whenever I write in it I can't help but think that someone has seen everything and knows what I'm thinking. It's encrypted and on an old laptop that almost never connects to the internet that I've searched for spyware countless times but somehow someone is reading it.

&#x200B;

When I try and think things through and I hit the point where I ask myself ""why would anyone want to spy on me?"", the answer my brain jumps to is ""I don't know"" and I just get more scared and it all feels more real. I don't have anything of value, I'm not an interesting person, I'm not special, so why would someone be doing this to me? I'm never going to get an answer.

"and have to start all over, that pain hurts.

just a bit of a rant post. i spent the past five years (18-23) building a life i was so proud to have - found a nice enough place to live, a min wage job that i was happy enough in, with colleagues i liked, and a strong passion and determination to become a full time musician - I was singing and busking, lots of friends and saw/interacted with a dozen or so people every day! financially stable and progressing. after a horrible childhood and almost 20 jobs hopping around (bad luck with workplaces etc) i finally started having some kind of stability, staying at a job for almost a year. going to the gym, taking driving lessons to the point i was ready to pass, performing in venues, smiling!! actual mental recovery and health 💪 

then stuff happened in december...this will sound crazy but i'm a stranger on the internet so you don't have to believe me - i fell off my bicycle, hit my head, got psychic abilities and started interacting with ghosts (with freaky accuracy), but then I started having unexplained seizure like body spasms - wound up in hospital three times via ambulance...the third, they didn't know what was going on and i ended up in a psychiatric facility for a few months (i should've kept my mouth and my third eye shut lol). so i lost my job and my place. and a bit of my grip on reality / i started talking about vortexes and dimensions. 

fast forward from nov '22 to today...may '23 - i pushed away all the psychic stuff (ignoring it COMPLETELY) i am back living with my parents (a lot of abuse history with them and i fought so hard to leave that, so winding back here now hurts to my core) now witnessing my dad get loud and angry to my mum/ grandmother is so triggering it aches. i witness my mum living a very depressing life too. i'm financially back to zero. living in a small bedroom which is quite dilapidated and rundown, in the middle of nowhere. insects galore which triggers old OCD habits. all of my things piling in storage containers around me and nowhere to put it so i never bothered unpacking. unemployed and will be seeking yet another min wage job. i haven't been outside for almost a month now. i'm basically hiding just watching stupid tv shows and movies, because everything feels so...lost. no friends in this area and the ones i did have last year have all somehow evaporated except for the odd ""hi"" and basic text.

the only thing that ever made me so happy and gave me purpose was music. but i haven't sang or written in months and i think i've given it up. 

i've tried speaking about what i'm experiencing but i end up in tears. so i've just stayed in bed, and for the first time in my life, i've become everything i always feared and worked so hard to stay away from. i think i am in real depression. 

anyway, i'll probably get another job soon within a few months, but with that salary...i can't help but think, i'm probably stuck here unless i find a small houseshare to move to. last time i was lucky, it was a friend's place's garden house after a series of crappy houseshares - but then i had to hit my head and lose all that. 

to what end? i will get a job that pays maybe £1.3k a month, but that's not enough for my own place. eat, shit, sleep, be a cog in the concrete jungle machine. that's what the future looks like. it seems so sad without any of my passion or love left. 

love. even just if i had a sibling or a pet or a close friend. love would make this easier.

because isn't that really why we live? to make memories with people we love. what happens when everything collapses and everyone and everything you loved is gone from under your feet without warning?

I remember first thinking of suicide vaguely when I was maybe 7; I first heard of that opinion in a religious i.e it's a sin and I remember being really upset about it since I didn't think it was fair.

I have no one to talk to either. I spend most of my day alone. I have no friends in school and don't speak 98% of the week in school.

I can't get any help either whether it be socially, mentally or anything else. My school counselor sucks I can't even get a hold of her when talking about classes let alone any issues I may be having.

"Sometimes the mere thought of existing scares me. Or maybe life scares me. The uncertainty of life, the overwhelming possibilities, the fact that we could die at any given moment. Right now I don't know what to do with my life and I'm scared to figure it out (not that I know why). And I feel pressured to know what I'm doing but I don't. I get that most adults feel like this (I'm 21) but I feel like whatever I'm doing now just isn't good enough. But sometimes when I'm like ""I need to do something like move to a new state or just get out of my hometown"" I don't know where to start or if I can even make that happen. I've also been in and out of college but i dropped out because it was expensive and because I also have a full time job. So now i don't know how to get started with figuring out what I want to do or even how to get to where I want to be.

A lot of times it feels like my dreams I once had just get crushed under the weight of everything. Ive wanted to be so many things and one by one they all get crushed. I feel like I'm not good at a lot of things and that's part of the reason why I've had so many failures. I also get anxious about how life keeps marching on and I don't think I'm ready for many of the parts of life like losing my parents. I know no one is ""ready"" for that kind of thing but I've never been exposed to death (grandparents died before I was born, no close family) so I don't know what I'll do. 

I also get so scared because I'm in a relationship but I don't love him and he's not great and clearly doesn't love me but he's insisting on me living with him and marrying him but I don't want to. I don't know how to break up with him and I don't really want to lose him but I don't want to be with him either. And it scares me that I can end up having to spend the rest of my life with him. Or that things can go as far as marriage when I don't want that. He always tries to make his dreams into mine, and he never cares about what I want to do. I know he just wants a girlfriend, it doesn't matter who. He just wants someone pretty, he doesn't see me as a multifaceted human being. Whenever I try to tell him what I want he says stuff like ""I think I know what you want"". When he says stuff like that, I realize he knows nothing about me and he doesn't care to. I've never broken up with someone so I'm scared to do it. I also only have one friend and I'm really bad at making friends.",4,anxiety

Well, I have death anxiety. It's already affecting my life as a whole, but since a while ago I get very very paranoid.

They are two separate people, 2,000km away from each other and another 700km away from me, who scammed me online last year. They don't know each other. It was a fucking baseball card thing. I paid, they scammed me. They both got away with it and threatened me with violence if I reported it. So I didn't report it. I have a locked down internet presence and totally removed myself from it as a hobby after it happened a year ago, but the fear lingers. I keep thinking they found each other and are targeting me, that they laugh at my willingness to trade and accommodation and friendliness and choose to obliterate me. I don't really think they are, if I stop hard to consider it. But the impact it has on my brain is so, so real.

I'm in therapy. It isn't really helpful for this. Because if it isn't one thing, it's another. Car accident, heart attack. I am so afraid to go to sleep and I used to love, love rest so much.

I know this is compounded trauma. I know the logistical impossibilities- people move, people have stuff going on. I know the real trauma likely already happened. They got my money, and got away with it. They don't have trouble falling asleep worrying that I'm going to find them. I know that people like this, who resort to theft, likely have other things going on that prevent them from making a cross-country trip to target a stranger. But I feel like such a fool for giving them my address. I feel like such a fool for trusting people.",5,paranoia

"Hello there, I doubt most people will read this but it never hurts to let some thoughts out. For starters, I apologize if there’s any poor grammar in this post,English class wasn’t my best subject. I have been in this world for 19, almost 20 years and the sad thing is, I still live with my parents, I’ve never been in a relationship, and I have little to no friends to speak of. It’s been like this my whole life and it’s constantly fucked with my mind since. One reason is that I’m a little on the fat side and I know people look down on those type of people but I am working on that, it is however a very slow process that I am aware of. Another reason is my looks, I’m not ashamed to admit that I am ugly and that I will always be this way, no matter what. One more thing is that I have a certain condition I don’t want to reveal but let’s just say it makes me harder to connect with others, especially on a personal level (yes I do know it’s not an excuse but I felt like I wanted to point that out). Because of my circumstances, my mental state has been going down hill since about high school and I really don’t tell people, not even my family cause what’s the point, they’ll just tell me the cliches like “it’ll be alright” or “we’re here for you” and that never really fixes anything. What doesn’t help was the my high school is full of rich stuck up white trash brats who think they’re better then everyone else, and I mean EVERYONE. Not only that but if I tried to talk to someone, they would just silently respond to me and move on to what they were talking about with their friends and completely forget what I said. Those 4 years of high school were the worst of my life mentally but not academically since I managed to ace a majority of my classes but I was so depressed, there were times I would sneak into my stepfathers safe and just contemplate on grabbing one of his pistols, loading it, and just finally ending this still pathetic and worthless life I live. If people saw me and the life I’ve lived they would think “why is this guy complaining? He’s got what most people wish they had.” Yes I will admit I am very fortunate in life because of the great decisions my mother and stepfather have made and I am very grateful for that. To those who have that exact thought, I do agree with you, why should I complain about my life and when so many others are having it worse than others me. Who am I to complain when I have food, clothes, a roof over my head, and a ok paying job. But I my mind, there’s no point of living a good life, if there isn’t anyone else to share it with. I do have people around me but it’s a very small number. My mom and stepdad won’t tell it to my face, but they want me gone, my dad is barley around and while he is a nice guy for the most part, he lives a very poor lifestyle and will end up dead sooner or later, and last but not least are my grandparents on my dads side, they don’t have much time and I don’t see them as much as I want to. I love the people around me but I’m selfish enough to say that it is t enough, I wish there were some people out there who could understand me and some girl to see me as a charming and caring guy and not some fat ugly slob of a loser who has no one. I will always cherish the great things my family has done for me but I always feel like a burden and that if I were gone, people would just forget about me and move on but I wanna fell like there’s till hope for me and that my life with take a huge turn. Thank you for those who managed to read the ramblings of a man with little worth in life.

"For some context I was a pretty normal kid growing up until my parents got divorced when I was around 10. I felt like I needed to grow up for my mother who always had a hard time finding good men so I kind of acted like an adult sometimes even when I was young, and I think that cut off some of my childhood. When I was around 9 my dad got remarried to someone who seemed really nice but she is a selfish prick I learned as I continued to grow up in the house. My mom ended up getting into drugs pretty bad and I couldn’t see her for a few years in college. But I managed to graduate Highschool with a degree and almost a valedictorian, but not quite

So here’s where the story is. I just got back from college and suffice it to say that I messed up pretty bad my first year. I failed a bunch of classes because I ended up getting really sick in the second semester and once I got back to being able to go to classes I felt so far behind that I didn’t think I could keep going to classes. When I started to stop going I beat myself up for it because I felt like a disappointment to my parents. I finally got back from college a few days ago and I told my parents that I needed a gap semester for myself to figure out what I really want to do so I’m not just going to college to go to college. When I talked to them I talked about wanting to maybe explore the world a little bit while I’m still young and able to and my dad interjected “that’s not how the world works” and that hit pretty hard because I’ve always just taken everything that they say to me because every time I’ve interjected I’ve been grounded Or berated for expressing myself or an opinion. What my stepmom said to me was far worse in my opinion as she said “you know we co-signed that loan with you so if you don’t pay it we are the ones who get hosed” which really told me where her priorities with me were. My mom has been pretty supportive to me about this and she understands what I’m going through. I recently decided to move in with my mother because I don’t know if I can keep dealing with them. A little of a side note but my dad is basically telling me I have to get some 40 hr a week job by the end of the week, and I think that’s a little bit unfair because I’m still young, I want to hang out with my friends while I’m still young but they insist that I get a job, almost like they think I’m going to be a bum, as they would say

For the depression part is I think I have depression but I don’t want to just say that because I’ve grown up in a household that isn’t really good with emotional sharing and while I was in college I had thoughts of suicide but I didn’t want people to deal with the gruesomeness of my corpse and I didn’t want to upset my mom.

"Somewhere in my brain I know I'm extremely paranoid and because of anxiety and all the things that have happened in my life, I'm being careful about everything on a paranoid level. Yet I can't help it. Maybe after I write this post I'll realize that I'm getting crazy paranoid so I'll be a little better and delete this post.

My relative who lived with my aunt (my aunt's brother) and was financially dependent on her, suddenly died. At time of his death, my aunt was at home, she called ambulance but he was already dead. Deceased person was supposed to inherit a part of big house later (inheritence would be shared by him and her). He was around 50-55, suddenly got sick and died. Everyone says it was likely a heart attack, but because my aunt and her other family members said no one suspected a foul play, they refused further examination. It just hit me really weird the way she said ""examination doesn't matter as he can't be brought back to life anyway"", ""it doesn't matter whether it was heart attack or if he died of other natural circumstances"" and so on and she repeated it several times, very weird. (I know she's kinda right and it would be pointless and if I were in her position and innocent, I'd also think that... I'm just being paranoid again). 

Now I'm next person to potentially receive a share of that house (though I do not plan to do so cause I don't need it) and I think she might try to harm me assuming I'm right about the thing I wrote above. Thankfully I don't live with her and I barely ever visit her (and probably will never do it again, but if I do, I will not eat or drink anything). Though I suspect she will try to find a way, to make it look like an accident.

Soon it's my birthday and she might soon bring a cake by which she might try to posion me. I will not eat a single piece of it. 

Yeah now that I wrote it down I feel even more paranoid. I am not usually like this and I hope I'm not gonna get worse or anything. The worst thing is I kinda understand it but at the same time I can't help it, cause I think to myself ""I bet if you had told this to every person who got poisoned and killed before their death would have told you that this idea was just crazy"". 

Anyway, regardless of anything, I'm firmly decided on not ever eating or drinking anything from her. Yeah.

Pardon my paranoia and crazy paranoid brain. :)",5,paranoia

"I was dismissed from my primary care for a missed appointment. The appointment at 2:15 but I thought it was at 2:30 (my stupid mistake) and I arrived at 2:35. They have decided to dismiss me from the practice due to my missed appointments. My primary care and psychologist are both at the same location so I lost my psychologist.

It's literally the only good medical facility in my area.

This has sent me into a very depression. I've had chest pains and have been crying and haven't left my bed. I feel like such a terrible person.

I feel worthless and a scum of the Earth because my even my doctor didn't want me after helping me so much. I'm just so done with everything. I'm so dejected and terribly sad.

"I'm going to start with the fact that I am honestly not sure if I have depression or BPD or not, but I think so. It would me a high functioning form. Anyways...

Whenever I am doing good, whenever I finally change myself a little, it always fucking gets me in the end. People, places, whatever else.

I can't keep doing this. My entire world comes crashing down in the end. How the hell is that even possible?

I hate that my life seems cursed. *Like, truly cursed.* People get driven away even though I'm kind, listening, asking questions, and try to laugh a lot. Even those who even try to be available a little bit seem to change over the course of 5-7 months. They act like we're fine, but I can tell they're disinterested. They weren't always.

I don't know what I'm doing with myself, I cant live with myself while everyone seem so fake. So very sarcastic. Micro-bullying, I call it.

I don't know how to deal with anything anymore. Usually only older people are nice to me. Hell, even people only a couple years older.

But I can't help being who I am, and in a school with people the same age as (or mainly younger than) myself, it's quite difficult.

I don't feel emotions less and less, or wanted, or needed. I don't feel anything but this massive uphill journey with no one but myself to look to when I need help. Imaging what it would be like to be your only support - I feel this way. Alone in a cold, unforgiving, stale world.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm not ugly, I don't think. I'm not smelly, I haven't even gone through puberty. I'm not rude, ever. I have a lot of cool talents and interests and widely accepted values, I think.

I've been here before. I thought I could get out of it. The very few people left in this school who are older than me are going away next year.

I am not at the end yet not at all. I still feel some emotions. Some happiness. I can still kind of block all of the pain, I've gotten good at that. But I'm quite close, and I don't know what it will be that pushes me off.

Why am I this way?

"Okay, this post may be controversial, i will try to explain myself the best i can.

There's a youtube channel called ""brew"", each video have Millions of views. Most of the videos consist of something like ""How one small cut can break your spine"", "" The Juice Mix That’s Killing People"" etc.

You can think of these videos as informative, but they are not IMO. They create a true paranoia in people that watch the channel regularly. It's kinda ironic because I think the channel 'Brew', brews paranoia and probably schizophrenia.

Now, I don't suffer from paranoia or any other mental illness but I have enough knowledge in this business to know these videos heavily affects people with a predisposition for them. Also, these people are the ones following and watching the channel, because i tell you, no completely sane, mentally stable person, watches more than 3/4 videos without removing the channel from the watch list.

&#x200B;

If you know the channel, what are your thoughts on this? Do you suffer from any mental illness?

If you don't know the channel, please skip this post and just don't check the channel, there's nothing good for you there.

"Yesterday my psychologist called to tell me about my evaluation. She told me there is no doubt that I have a moderate combined type ADHD. I finally have a diagnosis after a 2 year wait! 🥹 Now my crying 31 y/o ass just needs to wait for treatment ☺️

Sadly when I called my mom (who most likely also has this fantastic dx however she's clinically undiagnosed), she told me something that broke my heart completely. Evidently my dad had discussed some concerns about my behavior with her when I was about 7 y/o, but mom just brushed those concerns aside and continued as if nothing ever happened. I'm really trying to not think of ""what could have been"" but it's freaking difficult when I know that there were people advocating for me as a struggling kid but no help was given to that poor kid who didn't understand why she was different 🥲

So now I'm torn between happiness, understanding, massive sorrow & relief, and also just plain anger.

"Since I was young, I have constantly turned to the internet as a form of judgment of my character. The most important thing in my life (And still is today) is being a good person. And the only way to decipher who a ""Good person"" is, would be the majority of people online (Twitter, redder, any social media). And at 25 years old, I feel like I have failed that task.  
  
With this, I am in a constant state of guilt over my past actions. I constantly scour the internet, reading over other people's opinions on how they judge others in specific situations (Think about the comments reacting to a cancel culture scene). It makes me think, ""What if that were me?"". These people who have done bad things in the past are permanently exiled from communities; is there something I have done in my life that would get me canceled (Assuming I was an influencer)? It makes me sad thinking that even if they were to have changed and genuinely become amazing people, these past actions will forever label them as unredeemable.  
  
The most disheartening part of it all is reading about someone being compassionate for someone who is guilty of something, only to sprinkle on an ""Unless you did something REALLY bad, then you deserve the misery"". And of course, everyone has a different definition of something that is really bad or not…  
  
An example of this type of behavior would be Atrioc. Someone who for all intents and purposes, was a very stand-up citizen. Hundreds of thousands of people looked up to this gentleman, for it all to be stripped away from one mistake. Does all the good he has done, and all the good he will do in the future, not mean he is able to recover from one bad action that he regrets? Even if he came back in the future, I can assuredly see hundreds of people raising their pichforks in anger over his return.  
  
I am 25 now, with a decade of self-hatred. Every day it grows, knowing I have wasted a beautiful day on this planet being miserable. I want to feel better, and I want to be happy more than anything. But then I see posts of people who have made mistakes in the past, with people replying to them on how they don't deserve to be happy regardless of the good they do.  
  
Today my therapist had me choose if I wanted to continue our sessions. Asking if I truly thought I could envision myself improving, and wanting to improve. But as someone who is guilty of past actions, of course, I don't think that. Because I don't believe I deserve happiness. So, that was the end of it, and I have never felt so alone. I want to be happy, but that is a selfish thing to ask for someone who doesn't deserve it. So I won't beg for something I don't deserve. There are too many good people out there, who have never harmed anyone in the slightest, that deserve happiness over me  
  
.  
  
Even if someone does comment on this post with a kind-hearted message (Which I am sure someone will, as there are lots of wonderful people out there) it is much easier to be kind to someone when you don't know the full details. If I was a truly evil person, who did terrible things, would you still be as compassionate? Would you still think I deserve happiness? I am willing to bet the majority of people wouldn't. So why should I forgive myself?",4,anxiety
"(This is extremely long. To have an idea on how long it is, I started typing this at 4:53 pm, and finished at 5:15 pm)

I legitimately have tried my best to at least try to find the bright side to life throughout the 6 months, but holy fuck, it's hard to.  My life has pretty much gotten worse. My family is struggling to find a home as we don't have enough money to stay to where we're living at right now, so we might become homeless. I feel like I genuinely have no one to tell how I truly feel about personal stuff, and life  general. People always say that they're always there if I'm ever feeling a certain way, but whenever I try to text them if I can talk to them, they either haven't seen it for the past couple of days, or they see it, and don't respond. I try to talk to some of my friends in a group we're in, but I always get interrupted in the end, and I feel completely invisible when it comes to me trying to be social in general. I try to talk to my (not so sure anymore) girlfriend, but we barely talk anymore at this point. Yesterday, I called her to try to explain how I feel about stuff, and how I feel like I'm invisible to her, and our friend group, but then she ends up being the one to talk the most, with her saying that me and her should take a break. I don't blame her at all, with her giving some valid reasons, but it gets me sad and kinda fustrated at the fact that I didn't really have the chance to explain how I feel. Things are real awkward now, I get scared to join in any conversation with the group because of what happened yesterday, I get scared that I might cause something within the group, and mess everything up. I feel invisible towards everyone in general, I never really get the chance to speak, as I either get interrupted, or people just kinda trash talk me as a response. I can't even really have an important conversation with my broken family about how I feel with them, because they don't really take me seriously, and they just either brush it off, or yell at me. I feel like I have no one to talk to about how I feel. It's like being trapped in a hole, trying to get dirt to help build yourself back up, but the only way to get the dirt is to dig down. I don't know anymore, I'm only 15 years old. I shouldn't even be thinking about this type of stuff. It's gotten so bad to the point I've been starting to scrape my leg & calves with a knife, and what I find horrifying is that, I don't enjoy it, but yet I do. I know that I'm not supposed to do this to myself but, it's such a relief when I do. I feel so guilty when I do it, but at the same time I don't, I feel like I deserve what I do to myself. Maybe I'm just sounding stupid, or making no sense, maybe typing all of this was just a waste of time, but I'm far into this to stop. I don't know, at this point, I just give up. I tried my best to be happy, but it's impossible. All I ever wished for, was to be happy, and live a happy life, but it seems like that wish isn't gonna come true. I'm sorry if this seems messy, or if it sounds stupid, or if it wastes your time as you finish reading.

I've been contemplating running away from home and starting off somewhere fresh recently as I still live with my parents and they are no doubt the main cause of my issue

ive been born into a life where my parents are in severe debt because of an accident before i was born and i work 2 jobs per day, just to help them pay off their debt and it'll be fully paid off in about 6 years from now if i keep going, but frankly im not sure if I'll survive for a single more year. it's not nice to work your ass off after a long day of college, work 2 jobs and still not be able to buy the things you want to buy, because all my money goes to my parents debt, and frankly I dont want to throw my life away for this.

I know it's not right to abandon my parents as they aren't able to work anymore and their massive debt, but ive spoken to a few people and the general gist i got was 'you need to think about your own life', so i thought on it and I've done nothing to deserve this life that im living, and I'm genuinely baffled on what i should do in this situation. the family i live with is extremely toxic and i dont like it here but i also feel a strong sense of responsibility as the older sibling, and i know my younger sister wont be able to deal with it if i disappeared one day.",2,depression

My kid has ASD and severe ADHD (and possibly something on the BP-SZ spectrum), and his symptoms do not mix well with mine/my needs (specifically, that I require minimal stimulation and he is constantly hyper-stimulating).

I had never been a single parent until a few months ago. I imagine it's hard for parents without SZ, but I generally can't even take care of myself. That means that I'm sacrificing my needs and self-care to make sure that my child is being taken care of because I don't have the spoons to do both.

"The last few weeks, I have felt so empty and numb. It's not a simple feeling of sadness. I can't easily describe it. I rarely eat, I don't shower, I rarely even get out of bed. I don't really talk to my friends or partner much. Not even my roommates. I kinda just lay here, wishing the universe would end.

There's no trigger. It's been a gradual progression to this point. I tried getting involved more, going out more, doing things. But it all just kept losing its luster. Nothing is enjoyable, anymore. I only turn on music or TV for background noise, and can't even enjoy my usual go-to songs/shows. I still go to appointments and such, but I typically don't really want to. I just feel obligated.

I'm not suicidal. Honestly, suicide and even self-harm feel like they require so much energy, and I definitely don't have it. If the universe would just cease to exist all at once, that would be ideal. That way, no one would have to mourn anyone else's disappearance.

"TW: swearing, mentions of emotional abuse

I made a post awhile ago asking for advice about getting a diagnostic test. My main concern was my psychologists’ bias. I was 100% correct.

My psychologist did not do the whole test. She only did the questionnaires, the IQ test, and the social interview. After the test, I discussed my experience with my boyfriend who has gotten an eval before, and he said she skipped MANY components.

She based most of her conclusions on my mother’s questionnaire. I have told my therapist that my mother is emotionally abusive and narcissistic for as long as I have been seeing her. I cried to her for help and she did NOTHING. And now, despite years of telling her not to trust my mother, she decides to base her entire diagnosis on my mother’s manipulative and biased questionnaire. However, even despite the manipulation, my mother’s questionnaire still had the flags. My mother said I don’t handle change well, i struggle to transition from one task to another, I only talk about the things I’m interested in and it’s very hard for me to talk about anything else, and I have a few narrow interests. But she chose to ignore all of that because I “communicate so well”.

She threw out the questionnaire I filled out because I had “confirmation bias”.
Based on my IQ test, the social interview, and the questionnaires from my mother and teacher, I FIT THE CRITERIA FOR AUTISM. However, she said my social skills “aren’t bad enough”. She compared me to her coworker, who she said is “exactly like” me. She said verbatim, “I just wish you could talk to her, you would see, it’s just so different. You just communicate so well”. Having her A. Compare me to someone else saying I’m “not bad enough” and B. Talk down about someone because they’re autistic, was so fucking horrible. It took everything in me not to start sobbing.

The worst thing is, I can’t help but feel like it’s my fault. I’ve never spoken to her unmasked before. I haven’t spoken to my mother unmasked in at least 10 years. I’ve never spoken to my teacher unmasked either. I’ve been seeing therapists and counselors since I was 5, and I learned quickly how to act in a clinical setting. I unmasking with a therapist would be so fucking hard and so terrifying. I only unmask when I am alone or with my close friends. So I feel like her diagnosis is based on my mask, and it’s my fault.
Then there’s the part of me that thinks she’s right, and I do just have confirmation bias. So then I am back to where I started. I’m struggling. I can barely take care of myself, and I have no answers. All she told me was I’m a fucking genius, and I already knew that (honors student, 36 ACT, etc).  I’m just fucked up and I’ll never know why.

"I'm quite confident that I'm not clinically depressed. So, I know someone like me shouldn't be looking for a therapist and acting like a poor baby who just can't accept that I'm a privileged, ungrateful brat. It's just that I'm pretty sure my behaviour is starting to annoy the people around me and I was wondering if these reasons are good enough. 

1) I get suicidal thoughts 24/7. Nothing serious, but when I get thoughts like that I become either really bitter or sad. I become somewhat irritable, cry easily and honestly just a pain to be around. I know my family and friends (I think they're my friends) are getting tired of it. 

2) It's starting to make me hard to focus in school. It doesn't happen frequently, but sometimes I think of cutting myself or suicide so much that I literally can't focus in class.

3) I always get annoyed that I can't cut deep and I'm afraid that I might grab a knife one day and try to chop off my entire arm (ironic isn't it that I say I want to die but yet I'm so afraid of hurting myself I'm also the world's biggest liar btw)

4) Idk but I've been kind of zoning out a lot as if I'm not really there in my body?? And so I've been doing a lot of stupid careless things which is also quite annoying and I think I embarrassed myself more times than I can count and that makes me want to yeet myself off the building",2,depression

"First of all, don't use any management tools including this to avoid seeking professional help. That said, let's keep it real. Let me give you a process and then some tools.

First, really get a grasp of the actual problem. I can't speak for you, but if I hypothetically had such an issue, I'd imagine what is happening is that I'm always very fixated on potential negative motives and plans of other people. There's a lot of paranoia involved in this, and what really would fuck this up is if your hyperfixation on this was ever partially validated. Because then, if part of the scenario you played out was validated, and you can process and think through all the rest of the negative scenarios, you necessarily believe then that anything you can conceive yourself is actually being done by others that have these detrimental motives.

What's the problem then? You will constantly maneuver and avoid or confront those things constantly. You can't function because you are in constant fight or flight.

How can you manage it? Well, easy, allow yourself to completely play thru the worst scenarios and delusions. Think about what the world is and your place if it were true. Realize despite it, you're still here. Whatever the worst thing that could come to pass is (most likely some sort of being killed), come to terms with it now and be amazed of the experience of life you've had and the potential opportunity to pull the cloak away before you slip back into the same aether you were pulled from before birth. Let go of your ego and your need to fight something that if actually is, is so much bigger and awe stricking than you that you should feel privileged to be the focus of such a thing. Allow the ultimate thing you fight every moment to avoid to consume and carry you away, it's OK. We all will turn into the same dust in the end, everything you do and experience will end in you fertilizing the soil exactly the same as your enemies. There are no winners. Allow what can pass to pass, if for nothing more than to witness it and be amazed.

If you no longer fear the meaningless consequences you were trained to fear by your doubts and conditioning, you will be free to just exist and observe, and whatever time you have there, you will be happy and you will be able to do anything you want.

Stop fighting, just let the forces push and pull. Let yourself be in danger, accept death knowing it comes exactly the same for anyone who plotted against you.",6,schizophrenia

"My current hyperfixation is Hamilton which for anyone who doesn’t know is a musical about the founding father Alexander Hamilton. 

This is a problem because I listen to the songs and watch the film every day on repeat and I keep finding out new things about it, but there’s nobody irl I can talk to about it because I live in England and not many people are interested in the American revolution, my friend doesn’t like it and my mum is getting sick of me talking about it. I really wanna sit down with someone irl and just talk about Hamilton and sing the songs from it with them but nobody’s interested. Talking about it online doesn’t work as well as irl.

"This started happening around 10 months ago. I think it started off as extreme anxiety about the possibility of nuclear war but it's kinda spiraled out of control.

At first, I was anxious about the possibility of nuclear war. I wanted to move out of the city I'm in to the countryside. I remember crying to my mum about wanting to move away because I was that terrified. I would go to sleep thinking everyday was going to be my last.

That fear got worse. I started to become scared of any planes, helicopters, etc. Multiple times a day I would start screaming because I thought one of them was a nuke and I was about to die. I would constantly be watching the sky to see if I could see any nukes. I live near a hospital where theres a lot of helicopters coming and going, it freaks me out.

I started hallucinating too. I would see everything getting really bright which would freak me out. Or everything around me would start to distort. One time, when everything was getting bright, I genuinely hallucinated my name being called. It was freaky.

Anyway, it did start to get better. Ive been avoiding the news about it and I try to avoid conversations about it. I'm still scared of helicopters, planes and loud sounds outside. 

I'm not sure if it's starting to get worse again. I recently moved in with my boyfriend and the bedroom faces a main road. There are cars constantly going past. The particularly loud ones really freak me out. I jump everytime. This morning, I got woken up by a loud car and it really scared me. My heart rate was 130bpm when it woke me up. Of course when I came onto reddit I see shit about Putin pulling out of the nuclear treaty and my boyfriend commented that ww3 is coming soon. I haven't told him about this stuff yet, it's honestly embarrassing.

I'm not even fully sure if this is paranoia? Maybe before I was paranoid but now I'm just terrified by outside noises (cars too apparently). 

I just want it to stop. I miss not freaking out over these things. I never used to pay such sounds any attention.",5,paranoia

I would be shrieking and hyperventilating because I was being watched or threatened by demons and they would not blink an eye.

Some moments I'm so stuck thinking about the past and the future that I don't feel like myself anymore, I feel like I'm living my life in third person.

"I've had these dreams a few times in my life that are hard to describe but it feels like either the world is going to end or that I'm going to die. I had one the other week where it felt very strange and felt like if I leaned to far left or right something would rip and I would die. I then got very scared and woke up and for about 3 or 4 minutes the fear didn't leave me. I've had these sort of strange dreams maybe 5 or 6 times but never close together. Except from now.

Last night I went to sleep and was only asleep for about half an hour where I had another one of these dreams. I can't really remember what happened in the dream but I became convinced I was going to die again. During this dream I sleep walked (which I have never ever done before) and went downstairs where my mum and stepdad where watching TV. I then told them I few times that I was scared, starting talking gibberish, walked into the kitchen and then went back to my bedroom. My sister then spoke to me through my bedroom door and I woke up but the fear didn't leave me at all. I was terrified that I was going to die and I went downstairs and told my mum to assure me that I wasn't going to die and it took the best part of 15 minutes for me to stop being convinced that I was going to die.

I'm a schizophrenic so that could have something to do with this but I'm 99.99% sure it isn't. This is something I've only experienced once when I was about 11 where I had one of these dreams and started crying in my sleep and saying that I'm not good enough or something like that. But that's about 10 years ago and I have never once in my life actually sleep walked other than last night that I know of. I'm wondering if anyone else has had these dreams before?

"For some time now I've been experiencing the paranoid delusion that there is something of a war being fought over my consciousness. Some people/entities are good and fight to preserve my sense of self, others are awful and attempt to dissolve my ego. 

I've more or less trained myself over the years to not have any issue regarding maintaining a normal life despite mental health issues but there is significant persuasive techniques being used to make me feel as though none of the aforementioned is my doing and that I'm propped up by some team of people who aren't me.

So infantile of a thought. 

I'd imagine it to be quite paralyzing for others to go through something similar with the same degree of intensity. Which brings me to making this post (plus, you know, that little part of me that feels the urge to state these things just in case the paranoia is based in reality lol), I'd like to hear some others experiences?

From my perspective, I feel like I have the most difficult subset of mental health anomalies in human history.

Anybody got a story that sounds more difficult than my reddit history in various mental health forums? The worst part is I don't even post all of it lol I wouldn't have the time to live my life if all I ever did was catalog all this on here and doing so would preclude me from actually being in the situations where I'd be experiencing most of it... which is an ironic paradox.",5,paranoia

"Have you ever been asked a question and you know the answer but your brain can't seem to form a coherent sentence at all, so you end up saying nonsense and ending it with ""I don't know""?

My ADHD has been terrible, and it's affecting the way I talk to people. I mean, my social skills have never been great, but I feel like my mind is always empty all the time. I feel like every time I want to talk to someone, I need to pull out a mental vocabulary book and spend a few minutes searching for the correct words to say. My mind is never empty, I think about 2-3 things at once every day (including the music in the background), but at the same time, I feel so dumb.

People perceive me as ""dumb"" and ""slow"" because of this. I feel like my mind and mouth are running away from each other.",3,adhd

"I am constantly worried about how other people see me, paranoid about people hating me, finding me annoying or boring. I get these thoughts during most social interactions and they usually clear away once I go home and relax, but others this feeling gets stronger and I feel uncomfortable and distant around people that I care about, I apologise for stupid things and make things weird.
Sometimes when I express this people are receptive and we actually become closer. Other times when I try to communicate this it comes out like an insecure mess and I feel small and pathetic, and worse than before because I wonder “will this person really find me annoying now that they know how insecure I am? Am I boring them?”
The worse part is that I can have this chat - apologetic mess stuff, for stupid thing - with the same person over and over, and still feel uncomfortable the next time.

"I've been having anxiety for the last 8-9 years of my life, but the last 1-2 years have been over the top.

I started Lexapro 10 mg about 1.5 years ago, and it has definitely helped a little bit, but I still have 1-2 week periods of excessive, bed ridden, over the top anxiety.

My biggest struggle is obsessing over certain thoughts.

I'll be 100% normal for 3-4 weeks. Living great, going out, spending time with my gf and my family, but then something will happen and I shut down.

I'll get sick, and I'll convince myself I'm dying.
A simple chest pain and I'll literally be stuck to my bed for a week checking my pulse and blood pressure 20 times a day.

I just can't keep going on through life with these crazy 1-2 week periods. I can't keep putting my girlfriend through this.

"i'm currently cat-sitting for a friend, and i stayed over today. wanted some toast to eat while watching tv, there's no toaster here, so i turned the gas stove on, which has like a middle griddle on it, which usually just has one big burner (my stove and most other stoves layout) but this stove has two burners, so i turned both on, changed my mind about the toast and just turned one off (this is what i'm used to since my stove has the one big burner) and forgot all about the other one, went to watch tv, felt tired, got in bed and as i was about to go to sleep i got super thirsty, went for a glass of water and realized i had left the one extra burner on for like 2 or 3 hours with the griddle on top, i obviously turned it off and instead of relief i freaked tf out which was followed by an unshakeable sense of dread and my mind just started racing with what-ifs: 

what if i hadn't gotten thirsty and left the burner on all night and burned down my friend's house, killed myself, her cats, the neighbors, the neighbor's kitten, what if i left it on and the flame somehow got extinguished and i killed myself and everyone in this building from carbon monoxide poisoning, the tamest one: what if nothing happened but my friend's gas bill came back at an exorbitant rate and she got super mad at me and stoped trusting me altogether.

mind you, stovetops have been a huge struggle for me since time immemorial, but being unmedicated (idfk know why since i was dx'ed pretty young), i've prided myself on becoming an insufferable controlling apprehensive heap of neuroses, because that's the only way i can cope with this ~~curse~~ disorder and not fuck everything up in my life in one millisecond, and yes, i do have some modicum of control over my life despite the adhd and mainly because of these neuroses that stemmed mostly from continuously and mercilessly self punishing whenever i fuck up since i have a memory. this is a double edged sword as you can see because i cannot stop ruminating on all the fucked scenarios that might have come from this and now i can't sleep even though i'm tired as hell and need to sleep because i'm in the middle of a major ibs flareup from too many stressors and sleep is much needed. 

 i just can not stop going over the same damn thing and hating myself about it and thinking about how i told my therapist i didn't feel fit for catsitting because i had preemptively thought about all the worst possible scenarios and she told me i was actually trustworthy and responsible and now this is a testament to the opposite and that i shouldn't have been trusted around the cats because i was obviously going to kill them and myself from being such a ditzy dumbass, as always.

and yeah just wanted i guess to vent and ask y'all if you went through this or something similar and how to cope",3,adhd

"Genuine question. I am at my wits end because I very honestly do not know why people dislike me so much, and I genuinely want to know what the problem is.

Every time I see my therapist I ask him this same exact question and he tells me nothing is wrong with me and I just need to meet new people. I have met plenty of people in my 26 years of life and I am still mostly alone, apart from the LOML, but even he left me for a year during my psychotic episode.

Why were the nurses in the psych hospital so vicious to me? Why do my cousins that I grew up with never text me back but hold it against me if I don’t reach out to them? Why do my boyfriend’s friends treat me like I’m invisible? Why did my only friends during my psychotic episode make fun of me behind my back and right in front of me? Why did my former therapist and my psychiatrist both abandon me in the middle of my psychotic depressive episode when I said I was going to kms? Why did exactly 0 of the 6 mental health professionals I saw over a year suggest treatment for psychosis? What did I do???

"So i’ve dealt with anxiety for a good portion of my life but never realised it was anxiety.

No matter what I do I seem to get drowned in thoughts I don’t want and can’t escape from. 

I’ve tried all sorts but it just feels like i’m fighting against the world and when there’s no thoughts at all that sense of anxiety in the chest is always there and it causes me to overthink and feel like somethings gonna happen, like a bad thought or intrusive thought or worry that a bad dream will repeat and I don’t know what to do to stop that. 

So i’m looking for advice and opinions on what should be done and the best advice that may help overcome this sense of anxiety and dread.",4,anxiety

It's hard to explain, because even though I still had things to be unhappy about, I was content with how I perceived the world in my little kid brain. I wasn't corrupted by bad actors in my life, or exposed to evil. As an adult, my brain is so noisy and chaotic that I'm more of a homebody than anything. Being an adult with a drug/alcohol/gambling/anger problem is a much different animal and zaps of me any motivation to feel human. It kills the part of me that has imagination and creativity.  I used to be an open minded kid hungry for knowledge about things I didn't yet understand. Sometimes I'll put on an old movie or play a video game I used to like to peer into my little kid brain, but it's usually a very bittersweet feeling.

"I know it’s an absolute cliché— everyone wants to be young again, even if it’s for a day. It’s practically in our nature to cling to the past and miss the old days. 

But man, is it the most depressing thing (for me.) I’ve struggled with depression for about 10 years or so, my therapists have attributed it to an after effect of anxiety. I’ll momentarily have *up* weeks, but majority of the time— I’m depressed. It started because of a variety of other reasons, but recently it’s been nostalgia related.

I’m just turning 20, so I’m not far from my infantile days; I can still remember vivid details down to at least 3 years old. I’ve been missing my little friends, the ignorant bliss, my grandparents (who’ve passed), and it stings because it feels like more and more memories pop up every day.

Turning 20 has really given me a wake up call, I know I’m not old but I’m at most 1/5 through my life. It’s just crazy to suddenly realize: shit. Im really like UP here now. Im a genuine adult. 

I worry about future me missing the time that I’m spending right now, and all of the people that I’ll inevitably miss. I live in constant fear and denial of loss. I’ve recently tried meditation and practicing Buddhism, but it’s difficult for me to adhere to a genuine hobby or thought process. For the most part, my medication, therapy, and (as dumb as it sounds) philosophy have kept my spirits up.

Does anybody else struggle as severely with this? Any tips for management? Thank you all <3

"There was an incident in my Food studies class a few weeks ago that has left me upset enough to skip the class for my own mental health as I no longer feel comfortable or welcome in the classroom.

I was working with my friend (17M) in class when another student (17F) who we were not working with put pepper into our bowl.

For some context I (16F) am autistic and have severe sensory needs that makes me react to tastes, texture, smells, etc.. Pepper is something I am unable to cope with as it freaks me out and I have a minor allergy to it.

I rightfully got upset with her as I was never asked if she could add anything into our food(and I'm allergic), so I freaked out and yelled at her. I admit I might have overreacted but at the moment I was panicked and confused. The yelling got my teacher's attention and she got mad at me for swearing, which I understand but I felt targeted as she was only telling me off and not the boy’s in my class who were saying things much worse than I had (calling each other the c word and a range of slurs).  
It was getting really Loud to the point that I was on the floor in tears trying to calm myself down, when my teacher loudly exclaimed to me “that is verbal assault and I'm going to have to send you out” I took off my apron, left the school and I went home.

I purposely missed my food studies class for about a week as I didn't want any more conflict, But I did show up today.

I pulled the girl aside and I apologized for yelling at her and tried to explain that I had sensory problems and that I was allergic to pepper and her adding it without me knowing really freaked me out, but she rudely cut me off saying that she didn’t care and that It was my problem not hers.

I then tried to explain how putting things in other’s food is NOT ok and that even if she had asked my partner, she should have also asked me as it wasn’t JUST his food, to which she just said I was overreacting and “you should be grateful I even tried to help” I was calm the entire time and I was trying my hardest to not sound like I was blaming her, as that wasn't my intention, but It was at this point I got fed up and just let her go as she just wasn't listening.

I then tried to talk to my teacher and she just pushed me off and wouldn’t listen to me so I gave up and went to the library and did work for my art class.

I still feel really bad and I understand that she has the right to be upset, but I feel like my need's aren't being taking into consideration and I don't know what to do :(",1,autism

"I’ve come to realize that I’ve been crying a lot lately when I’m in bed at night. My body, my face. It doesn’t feel beautiful. The world and it’s people don’t feel beautiful. My life overall just doesn’t feel beautiful. It all seems so rotten. 

When I was young, I’ve always felt the need to be kind. Be polite to others and they’ll treat you the same. So I thought. People judge you, treat you harshly, do what they can to push you down. Over the years, I thought that I’d grown a thick skin. But it all cracks. I feel beat down. People who don’t even know me will think I’m disgusting or sick in the head. I never asked to be this way. It’s just the way I am. I struggle and fight and work on myself the best I can. And for what? To still feel like shit at the end of the day? I’m tired. I’m so so tired. My heart aches every night. It hurts so much that I wish I never existed. I feel like all the times that I was happy were all drowned out by all the shit in the world. It’s so crap to say but even those who gave me love and support don’t feel enough for me. I won’t kill myself because I’m a coward. I know that.

"I'm going to post this to a couple different places but I need help. 

So I finally decided to change therapists after:

• She's continuously told me everything is in the past and to just ""let it all go""

• Her advice for dealing with my agoraphobia and debilitating social anxiety is to just go to stores, stand in the aisle in the way, and just repeat to myself I'm okay.

• To just get into the car and drive to clear my head (when I don't have a license and terrified of driving) 

• Despite doing my intake, didn't know of my diagnoses and acted shocked when I had mentioned a hallucination (and tangent but also acted like a was a specimen or something) 

• Told me that sometimes the people we love hurt us because they love us and that's okay

• Told me I cant control anyone (i get that) and no one can control me or make me do anything. When I said I disagree having been SA'd more than once, she told me that I ""learned what I do and don't like"" and ""learned how to say no."" Which triggered me bad for the past month and has had me really messed up. 

After all this, the biggest thing is that I have (for pretty obvious reasons) have not been comfortable reaching out to her for support when I'm really struggling, so with much encouragement from my friends and family, I decided the next appointment I was going to talk to her about switching. 

She then no call no showed that appointment after I confirmed. (I did miss two prior to this from other appointments and honestly just couldn't get myself to go to the one immediately after the above.)

So we put in the change provider form with the secretary who understood... and then the therapist called and said that I can't change providers and if I don't see her than I won't be able to see my med provider. I'm freaking out and at a loss. It's taken so so long to get into the psych and now I feel like I'm being threatened because I want a new therapist and have ALWAYS been told that if it isn't a fit, we can change at any time. I don't know what to do. I feel so lost and hopeless, it's just affirming that they were out to get me anyways and that I'm just another paycheck. I can't handle losing my meds but I also can't handle seeing her any longer. My paranoia and anxiety has been off the charts since this. Everyone told me it'd be okay and I feel like I've been set up.",6,schizophrenia

"I've been married for over a decade to the love of my life, but I believe she has a problem with paranoia and I worry it's going to destroy our marriage.  She always feels like people are criticising her, insulting her, judging her negatively, etc.  If someone says something completely innocent, she'll read a lot of unspoken, negative meaning into it and often times either cut them out of her life or lash out in anger at them.  Every time we've visited my family, she's gotten upset over something totally innocent -- someone having a certain expression on their face, or watching too much TV, etc -- and she'll be convinced that it's somehow a personal slight against her and demand we leave early.  I'd say about 40% of the time that she goes out to e.g. pick the kids up from school, she comes back all pissed off at some random person because of the way they exhaled or failed to greet her and she's sure it's an intentional slight.  She can't go to buffet restaurants because she feels the owners are watching how much food she takes.  If someone tells her something, she believes there's a whole mountain of hidden meaning behind it, which is always negative toward her, and this causes her to behave angrily toward them.  Years ago, she agreed to go to therapy (not for this, but because of depression) but only went for one session because she believed the therapist insulted her.  

None of it ever makes sense to me.  I try to discuss it with her and she's never able to rationally provide any evidence for how she feels, but she is 100% certain of her perception.  It enrages her when I am not ""on her side"".  Every time I bring this up because I am concerned about her, it leads to the hugest arguments where she talks about leaving me.  In our marriage, it's basically the only thing we argue about.  Her father is the same, and she often complains about it, but she is unable to see the same behavior in herself. 

She has other issues which, best I can tell, often accompany this.  Trouble sleeping.  Anger problems.  She had a bad childhood.  These issues with paranoia get worse when she's under stress.  

I feel bad about the drama this causes, the relationships it hurts, the things it prevents her from doing.  Mostly I feel bad that this problem robs her of the happiness she deserves in life.  And I'm scared that one day she really will leave me for not ""supporting her"" by playing along with these false perceptions. 

If I explain that I've done a lot of reading online and that the way she behaves is a common thing people experience and seek help for, she'll react badly.  Broaching this subject in any way that proceeds from the assumption that she has a problem and that her perceptions of persecution don't make perfect sense will just result in a blow-up; the same blow-up that we've been having on a regular basis for years.  I don't know where to go from here.",5,paranoia

"I hate myself so much, you know that? I hate everything about myself right now. And I don't think it'll change anytime soon to be honest. I've done a lot of bad things. Made a lot of people worry about me. Made people genuinely scared about my safety, made them think that I wouldn't make it. I traumatized my parents so much. They already had to go through so much, and I just added more on top of that. They didn't want to lose their first child, the one they had to work so hard on. I'm a bad person, don't try to tell me otherwise. And it's not like I'm going to kill myself or cut myself or anything of that sort right now. That would mean that I've wasted everyone's time. No, I don't want to kill myself. But I wouldn't mind if I died right now. If life were to take back my soul. I wouldn't beg for a second chance. I'd just say goodbye. I know that's a horrible thing to say, but it's the honest truth for me. There are other things I hate too. The fact that my mental health has gotten so bad that I cannot comprehend anything I read anymore. I can't even comprehend shows or movies. I can't play the games I love. I can't do all of the projects I wanted. I'm basically flunking my classes. My friends probably hate how I'm always joking about wanting to die. Heck, I think even my teachers must be annoyed with me. It's annoying. I'm annoying. I don't like how annoying I am. But I guess I can't help it anymore. It's just how I am now. Useless, annoying, childish, immature, hopeless, burden, dead-weight. I'm so sorry for this. I hate myself. I hate all of this. The person who I used to be is dead, their rotting corpse in this shell of their body.  I hate it. I hate myself. I hate how I treat others. I hate how I affect others. I hate how there's nothing I can do to change it. No matter how many books I read, shows I watch, people I meet, things I play, events I go to - everything stays the same. Nothing changes. I'm still a worthless good for nothing person. I can't do anything. I can't be happy, genuinely happy. I can't make others happy or proud. All I know is how to lie, be needy, and disappoint. I hate myself. And I'm sorry.",2,depression

"I go through periods of time in which I experience more hallucinations, disorganization and particularly delusions. Medication and therapy has made them less frequent and severe, but they keep occurring.

These is no regular timing and I have never found a pattern in them. It's hard for me to recognize when I'm entering such a period. When I'm in too far I am unable to recognize my own situation. I think recognizing it sooner can help me get treatment sooner and prevent my life from going further off the rails.

But, lately I've been suspecting an episode coming up. I'm not sure, but I'll bring it up with my therapist. It's better to have a false alarm than becoming too psychotic to function.

"I was recently playing a tabletop RPG, playtesting my own system I'm working on. While playtesting a new rule I had added, my brother got very frustrated about the new rule after losing a roll to another player. He claims I interrupted him. I'm not sure if I did before he started yelling, as I was trying to explain that the changes he was recommending were something we already tested and rejected in a session he didn't attend.

I definitely interrupted him as he was yelling, asking him ""Will you listen?"" I raised my voice slightly in exasperation and to be heard, but didn't approach his volume. I don't think it's disrespectful to interrupt someone shouting to intimidate you to ask them to calm down, though it probably isn't effective. His response was to get louder, shouting ""NO I WILL NOT LISTEN"" and continuing on a tirade that lasted maybe 30-40 seconds. Myself and the other five players went deathly silent. When he finally stopped talking, I said I'd have to reconsider that part of the system and moved on to something else because I could see that everyone was uncomfortable and just wanted to get back to the gaming.

The next week, I wrote him a note expressing how unacceptable that was to shout me into silence. I tried to set a personal boundary in that note, and it enraged him. He called it an ultimatum (pasted word for word below this paragraph), and I can see why he might call it that. It was my first attempt at a personal boundary, so I don't have a lot of experience with this.

*If another such outburst occurs in any game in the future, that will be the last game I play with you. I’m playing to have fun, hang out with friends, tell an interesting story, and in the case of last week’s playtest, I wanted to try out various systems and changes for my own game. Outbursts like that make all of those things impossible.*

Of note, he declared angrily many years ago that we would never play a competitive game together again after I beat him in a game of Dominion. He claims I gloat when I'm winning and whine when I'm losing, but I think that's more of a product of his perception than my behavior, as no one else has ever raised this concern. We still play cooperative games, but I often find if we start struggling or lose the game, he starts criticizing my gameplay, either immediately or in the car ride home.

He has interpreted the above italicized statement in two ways. First, he accused me of trying to dictate what he could do and deny his rights. I view it as telling him I won't put up with being silenced, and he has no right to do that to me.

Second, he hasn't said this out loud, but I believe he interpreted this as me trying to kick him out of our gaming group. If I wanted to do this, I could have simply called for a vote to kick him out over the shouting. Instead, I suppressed my desire to immediately declare I would not play with him any longer, and thought about it for six days before writing my letter. I asked several of the players later, and they were all deeply uncomfortable.

He's gone on the offensive because of the note. He didn't even talk to me about the letter I wrote, bringing it to the next game session and forcing a two hour discussion about it with the others. I had no idea he was going to do this. He had what I can only describe as a predatory glare when he brought out the letter, stared at me, and said something along the lines of ""You think you can make an ultimatum to me? I'll show you what happens when you make ultimatums."" He hadn't said a word to me about the letter yet at this point, choosing instead to pop it on the entire group and try to paint me as the bad guy.

This is the second time he's had an outburst like this. He did it in a previous game, but because it was the first time it ever happened, I didn't know what to do, and we moved past it without a consequence.  There was no letter or even discussion about it, we just moved on. That was four years ago. I still didn't know what to do the second time, so I'm trying to put together a personal boundary statement to prepare for this in the future. He's only ever shouted at me, but I've seen him take an annoyed/angry tone in other games and our writing group if people contradict him. He hasn't shouted them down, but it wouldn't surprise me if those other folks had felt intimidated.

This is what I came up with after watching some videos and reading some mental health webpages. This is my first time ever having to do something like this, so any advice would be appreciated.

*This is me setting a personal boundary for my own health and safety. When you shout me into silence, I feel disrespected and intimidated. I cannot control your behavior, only how I react to your behavior. When you shout me into silence or otherwise intimidate me, I will repeat this boundary and ask you why you feel it is okay to silence my voice. I also reserve the right to walk away if I don’t feel safe or capable of engaging in respectful conversation.*

I appreciate your input. Thanks.",4,anxiety

"I have had depression and anxiety all my life. In my teens and twenties there was enough going on (classes, new jobs etc) that kept me on my toes and too tired to think about how depressing things were. I spent my twenties coming to an empty apartment and sleeping on a comforter on the floor by myself.  Now at 40 I am more depressed than I ever was. I cannot believe that only half my life has passed and I still potentially have another 40 Years of this bullshit. Atleast when I was younger it seemed like it could be a phase or something that will get better... now it's clear it's only gotten worse. I have been on meds and therapy for 10 years and still don't have the drive to want to live another day.

"When I was a child my mom would tell me those stories abt murder cases/serial killers and I think it kinda traumatised me because I was really young and she did this for some years. It was to tell me to be careful but I think I am really TOO careful and I really want to change.
 Since I have ADHD I was wondering if there was a link too..

In middle school I used to go to school with a knife or a fork in my pocket (a fork because I knew carrying a knife could get me into troubles). I did it less often in HS and only sometimes now in uni, when I know I will come back late. This is not bcz I'm less scared but bcz I know how weird I would seem if people saw me with a knife of fork. I sleep with a knife next to my bed at night (again since at least middle school). 

I experience nightmares of being chased extremely often.. Usually I wake up when the person who is chasing me (to kill me) catch me (so I don't experience the killing/pain. It's like when they catch me I die so I'm waking up). Sometimes I know the face/backstory of those killers (which are made up) and sometimes I don't see them at all, I just know they're chasing me. When I turn back I know they're here and I die without seeing their faces. When I'm outside, especially at night, I always get paranoid about killers. Every person (more like every man even if I can get suspicious of women too but it's much more rare) becomes a potential serial killer to me and I hurry home. I can have very short hallucinations of people (mostly killers) because I'm scanning everywhere in alert mode. Those hallucinations are like 1 second long or less so it's not really serious. Specifically, my worst fear is someone/ a serial killer coming to kill me at night in my room. I can become very suspicious at night alone in my room for no reason. I imagine that someone is trying to break in into my room, or is on the roof of the building and will try to come through the window. It gets me in very unpleasant states where I feel almost dizzy, it's like the world suddenly seem so suspicious and scary. Like if my room completely changed, there is a filter that changes it and now every furniture becomes unfamiliar to me, my whole environment becomes threatening and I have this irrational fear that someone is going to come in at any moment to kill me so I can't sleep. 

More than death, I'm afraid of suffering, being tortured or raped. Sometimes I feel so bad I think I want to die already, kill myself because then Im sure I will never experience this and I will stop feeling so scared and anxious. Which makes no sense bcz it means that I'm so afraid of death that I want to die?? (I think the issue is that I'm afraid of someone else killing me, not dying).

 My problem is that I'm nurturing this irrational fear by watching true crime videos. I know I'm harming myself when I do this because I will feel so bad for days, weeks, months afterwards! But I just can't stop.. I always end up watching one again. I think that I watch it because I imagine the situation and it's like  a simulation, what to do if I'm in the same situation.

 Also I'm thinking ""I've been too relaxed lately, I need to remind myself how scary this world is, how there are crazy people"". It's almost like punishing myself for being to carefree/not being paranoid ""like I should"". And I guess those videos can also be oddly entertaining/thrilling and give me very strong feelings I cannot get in my every day life. I want to change but at the same time I don't want to because I feel like it would be a bad thing, that I will be killed and think ""you see? You shouldn't have stopped being cautious. Serves you right.""(more like paranoid..). I have this irrational feeling that one day a serial killer will try to kill me, as if it was my destiny..

 I'm writing this bcz my sister was scolding me saying that I should stop being paranoid abt this, that it will never happen.. because two days ago I read the biography of a very famous serial killer on Wikipedia and I felt very scared. This morning I woke up screaming ""nooo"" because I felt very strong pain in my nightmare and felt this pain while waking up. I went to the toilets to uuuh let it all go and my stomach hurted for 1 hour making weird noises. For the first time in my dream I actually experienced being killed with the killer stabbing me repeatedly in the stomach. It was just a man Shadow, all black and blurry, without a real appearance (like the anti spiral in Gurren Lagann). 

I also feel like this is preventing me from trusting men. I'm 21 almost 22 and never dated, never went on a date, never was close friend with any guy..it's like if deep inside I thought that they're all predators/aggressors/killers when I know rationally that it's false and unfair to think this way..I feel like I will end up alone..And I'm tired of those scary feelings which are almost like torture to me..My psychiatrist for ADHD was like "" it's very Freudian you should sleep with a guy"" when I told him abt my nightmares of being chased/killed and I was like????? If you cite Freud seriously I'm never taking you seriously. I'm afraid that seeing a psy wouldn't change anything' my sister says I should try hypnosis..Do you have any ideas what to do?

"I had an anxiety attack a few weeks ago that very nearly got me to the emergency room. it woke me up from my sleep. it's impossible to describe that feelings but it's so negative and so intense. you can tell yourself all you want that nothing is wrong and to calm down but you can not get it to go away. I felt the same thing years ago the last few times I smoked weed. It sent me into that dark spiral. Your thoughts race so fast and you feel intense grief, guilt, sadness, dread, agony. You feel insane because your thoughts are too fast to keep up with let alone control. I went to the ER but by the time I got to the parking lot it stopped on it's own, which was about 2 hours after it started. I went to a psychologist but it was like 2 weeks later before i could get an appointment. He didn't seem to think I was under any great amount of stress. I had nothing really bad to talk about other than this incident. My life was going pretty well. He told me I should have gone to the ER for a blood test because it sounded more like a physical thing to him than psychological. So I made an appointment at my GP which I just went to. He said it doesn't sound physical at all. It sounds completely psychological. He took my bloodwork anyway just as part of a regular physical. He said every single vital he took today could not have been healthier. My breathing, blood pressure, everything was exactly on the money. I'll wait for the lab results but he said there is not really a test that will find anything related to this. He told me that if I did go to the ER, there is nothing they could have done for me. They would have talked to me until it went away on it's own. I asked him if they would have given me benzodiazepines, and he said no, that's only for panic attacks which means chest pains.

My stepdad pushed once pushed me down ths stairs because I didn't shower, which is understandable. Also I told psychologist and staff in my mental hospital, which i'm in that my stepdad did that and they said it wasn't severe enough for an intervention.

"Hi everyone,

I have a constant fear (which sometimes peaks and it becomes unbearable) that people my find out secrets about me and ruin my life by telling them.

It never actually happened to me but I always think that WHAT IF and start feeling extremey anxious.

In my childhood my mom would very often search my room or my laptop to find things about me and attack me with them few days later and I know now that that is the root of it.

But really what I need to know is, do people actually do this? Like say something to ruin relationships or make me people lose their jobs? 

I'm maily afraid of men doing this in moments of angerness.

Thanks a lot!",5,paranoia

"i use humor to lighten up my depression. even if im having a bad day or something made me annoyed, i joke about it. but ever since i got hospitalized for my depression because of attempting to kms, i send my family to panic when i joke around. i get it though why they’re like that. idk if that’s healthy cant diagnose myself either. 

My family don’t even want to talk about it. they’re too aloof of what i had gone through. idk what else to do to cope. i just feel like im constantly being constrained of saying things inside my head. this feels bad. i know im gonna lose it sooner or later. sorry if my grammar is not perfect.

I'm doing this to understang my behaviour , so i thank you in advance for your help. you guys will literraly save my future life.

\- I have trust issues. My friends don't really know me and when I feel like i'm opening myself too much I isolate myself from them.

\- I tell my secret life to strangers on the web because they don't know me so they can't use my secrets against me.

\- i'm hypervigilant and i analyze everything. Foot steps, physical language , the way a person is breathing, eye contact, voice tone...

\- I isolate myself from people. i deactivate my socials when i feel like i've said too much.

\- sometimes i may feel like i'm going to die very soon. this feeling is strong. then i realise that i'm not dead...

\- my mom tell me to not see my friends too much, that they can steal my energy from me. she often tells me that i need to be careful to what i say, i should never talk about my goals.

\- i have intrusive thoughts, sometimes they are so strong that i need to tell myself ""shut up"" with aloud. 

i don't drink , i don't smoke, i'm working hard to have a healthy life. i'm still young  \[19F\] so i think i'm able to grow and to give myself a second chance, that's why i'm doing that. thank you.",5,paranoia

"To all readers I understand that I am a shitty person. I am not looking for any sympathy from anyone. I simply need to get some things off of my chest. I apologize for the structure of this post. I am not very good at composing my thoughts into words so this may come across as more of a rambling than anything else.   
  
I’ve been battling with depression all my life. I always thought that once I hit that “big event” my depression would finally go away. Despite hitting several of these “events” during my life my depression has only worsened. A few years ago I finally broke down and reached out to a doctor and was prescribed antidepressants. After a few trial and errors with different drugs I finally found one that worked well for me. They didn’t fix my depression, but they definitely made things more bearable. However, now after a few years they have either stopped working entirely, or are working too well. I’m now completely disassociating with the outside world while facing internal conflict like no other.   
  
My job pays pretty well, but it isn’t exciting work by any means. By nature I am a good worker. I am a bit of a perfectionist whenever it comes to my work, and I will get tasks completed fast and efficiently. I do not however get any sort of fulfillment out of my work. My co-workers act as if they enjoy what they’re doing. Perhaps they are lying to me or themselves about enjoying the work, and they are truly as miserable doing the work as I am. Regardless I am jealous of their fulfillment, or ability to lie to themselves because I simply cannot do this. I know I hate my job, and the thought of doing it for another 30-40 years fills me with a sense of dread. Further, I cannot think of a job on this planet that would give me a sense of fulfillment. I think that no matter what job I have I will eventually come to hate it.   
  
I have always had low self esteem. As a former obese child & teenager I never had anyone show romantic interest in me throughout my teenage years. Because of this I despised the way that I looked and turned to porn for comfort. As I came into adulthood I decided to get a grip on my health and managed to lose a lot of weight, but I still hold onto the body image issues (along with stretchmarks and loose skin) from the weight I once held.   
  
I managed to have two serious relationships in earlier adulthood and then eventually met my now wife. I went into relationships with the intent of marriage from the very start. I was coming from the mindset that if I don’t lock someone down I will never be able to get someone in the future. After the first relationship went south I decided that I would marry my next girlfriend no matter what. That’s when I met my now wife. She was pretty enough and had a good enough personality, but more importantly loved me. While dating I wasn’t convinced that I loved her, but kept forward with my original promise to myself and married her anyway. Fast forward five years and we’re having issues exclusively because of me. Some days I like my wife and her personality. She has a sweet side and knows how to make me smile. Other days a different side of her comes out that I simply cannot stand. On top of this despite an initial attraction, I am no longer physically attracted to her. This has made our sex life basically non-existent and has caused an even greater strain on our relationship all because of me. I know my wife loves me, but I do not think that I love her. I can keep on faking love for a while, but I think it is becoming more and more evident. I do not want to hurt my wife, but I don't know if there is another option besides separation. She deserves to be with someone who loves her.   
  
I have family and a few close friends, but they don’t know this side of me at all. To them I am the guy who always has something funny to say. I am rarely serious around them and try to make sure everyone is laughing and having a good time when I’m around. Despite this the second I am no longer around them I return to my depression, often worse than before.   
  
Sometimes the only thing that gives me comfort during difficult situations is fantasizing about killing myself. I don’t think I will actually ever do the deed, but thinking about it helps me get through whatever shitty situation I am facing in the moment. If I didn’t have anyone in my life that my suicide wouldn’t adversely affect then I would do it, but I cannot bring myself to put someone else through emotional pain no matter how much I hate myself. For the meantime I will continue to numb my pain with weed and alcohol.",2,depression

"i’m not entirely sure when this fear came to be… but i know that it is progressively getting worse..

let me give you some examples:

1. walking to my car from my house (vice versa) in the dark. i have this constant fear that as soon as i unlock my car someone is going to come up behind me, stab me and steal my car/ leave me there to die.

2. waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. the fear kicks in when i am walking back to my room. i feel like someone/ something is either watching me or i’m going to see something at the corner of my eye… i usually have to RUN back to my room because my anxiety is too much.

3. being in a public bathroom ALONE. i have this fear that someone is standing on one of the toilets and is waiting for me to sit/ start going to the bathroom & they crawl underneath the stalls to grab my leg and steal my purse/ money. 

3.5 flushing toilets in public restrooms scare me too because ITS SO LOUD & I CAMT HEAR MY SURROUNDINGS 

some context to explain further:

my reflexes i feel are not the best. i also feel like if i was ever placed in a situation like this i would have not a single clue as to what to do (even tho i think about it damn near everyday) . i use to carry pepper spray and knives but i can guarantee you that my first reaction/ instinct would not be to use those said items. i would honestly prolly forget that i have them on me because of how shook i’d be.",5,paranoia
"I have been diagnosed at the beginning of 2022. I was 21 and when I got meds for the first time I was 22.

Now I am incredibly lucky because I got to my diagnosis within 6 months but my ADHD treatment feels so nonexistent.

I take elvanse 50mg and the psychiatrist that diagnosed me also treats me. It was and still is the only clinic I can go to because most don't accept new patients even if they already have a diagnosis. Or most just don't treat adults. The place that I go to has several psychiatrists working there.

When I had my first appointment they told me things like ""you most likely don't have adhd"" , ""woman usually don't have adhd"" and ""most people grow out of adhd so don't worry too much about it, it will most likely be gone until you are 25""

My assessment was with a different person and she actually listened and told me that she has no doubt I have adhd and that the other psychiatrists will make a treatment plan with me.

Well on the day that I should have made a treatment plan with the psychiatrist he just basically talked about ""only meds can fix it"" and that stimulant medication is the only thing that works. Which is horribly inaccurate. He also told me (and my mother who wanted to come along) that therapy is no option and it will not help at all. I didn't even know coaching was a thing and I left really discouraged but I had my hopes up bc I finally had a diagnosis and got meds prescribed that could possibly help me really much.

Despite me being happy about it I still feel like there is a lot of tings wrong with how my treatment goes (I am now with another psychiatrist and she at leas is open for everything but its not that she suggests things. Its rather me suggesting things and she then talks about it with me and maybe she will go though with it like changing my medication after I had horrible side effects from the first medication.

Also other things like depression or anxiety and other things are not really taken into consideration. 

And one of the worst things for me personally is that I only got help because I was at a breaking point. Everything was overwhelming and I had constant brain fog. It got to a point where I slept just an hour or less a day and that continued until I was so physically and mentally drained that I slept 15+ hours on weekends because I could not get myself out of bed.

This issue has unfortunately not been fixed yet.
I sleep much better but still 3-4 hours of sleep per day is just not enough and honestly I don't know what to do about that.",3,adhd

"I have. In animation class in my second last year of school, we were watching all these environmental animations made my previous students, and I give them all credit for having good intentions, but one of them was WAY too anti-steam train for my liking. And yes, steam trains typically use coal, but they're rare in present day and, from my understanding, most coal pollution now comes from places like factories and power plants. Go after present-day fossil fuel pollution, not my number one childhood interest, please!

The first train in the video was a photo they'd found online and, instead of white steam, it was emitting black smoke. Believe it or not, it got even worse during a stop motion bit with wooden toy trains. Duke from Thomas made a cameo, and James the Red Engine’s tender was used as one of the wagons when he wasn’t even there. This might sound okay, but not when you realise the landscape turned desolate halfway through the train's journey, making me feel even more like my love for the environment meant nothing if I liked steam trains too. To someone who cares about the planet but also grew up loving steam trains and the Thomas franchise, it legit felt like watching a church burn.",1,autism

"  
Crippling indecision. Depressed people can be consumed by an overwhelming inability to make decisions. Everything is questioned right down to the granular level. This constant self-questioning and evaluating leaves the person paralysed and unable to function. For instance the depressed person might make a decision to take a shower. What follows next is a tsunami of questions “should I wait to later” “what if I don’t have the energy” “why do I need a shower anyhow I am not going anywhere?” This can literally play out for hours and hours until the sufferer finally says something along the lines of “what’s the point?” Needless to say this self-doubting will be followed by recrimination and more than likely self-hatred for being so weak, which in turn feeds the depression, an almost perfect vicious circle.  
Critical self-judgment. Depressed people don’t really see themselves as ill. They rarely give themselves that good a break. Instead they can very easily view their depression as a personal weakness they could overcome if they just tried hard enough. This train of thought is perpetuated by other people telling them to just snap out of it, or a thousand other platitudes they have heard a million times before. Instead of seeing this nonsense for what it really is they turn it internally and berate themselves for having a character flaw that doesn’t allow them to function like normal people. They don’t need other people to be judgmental as they are expert at doing it to themselves a thousand times worse.  
Interaction is painful. It’s something most people take for granted. Interaction, conversing and relating are things we mostly don’t have to think about. For someone suffering depression this natural ability can become excruciatingly difficult. In most instances we pull on a socially acceptable mask and pretend everything is fine. We are present but not really there if you know what I mean? We can be surrounded by people and feel painfully alone lost in the quicksand of depression. We are experts at hearing but not really listening. We are ninja warriors at the art of avoiding talking about how we are feeling. Everything is great and fine when in reality we are dying inside. While you are talking about how your day went we can be reliving the worst moments of ours and at the same time making sure you don’t see our pain.  
Fear of the future. Ask a depressed person what they think their future looks like and they will more than likely tell you “more of the same or worse” Depending on the severity of the depression a sufferer doesn’t see a future. A future is something other people have not them. Their future is the struggle they are going to have tomorrow morning when they wake up and think to themselves “please, not this again, I don’t think I can go on like this” We think about the future by comparing it to our past. It’s very difficult to imagine a nice future when all the evidence from the past is telling you it isn’t going to happen. For the vast majority of people a future is something they can feel optimistic about. For a depressed person it can feel like something to dread. Something filled with hopelessness and helplessness. Not living in the present is extremely common; it can feel like we are adrift in an ocean of misery and torment stuck in a no man’s land of despair and apathy. Once hope is lost, everything is lost.  
Even the good times can be bad. Imagine not even being happy at the birth of your child or in fact any landmark occasion that marks a supposedly joyous event in our lives. A chronically depressed person doesn’t have to imagine it. For millions of people this is a reality and is something that is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. Guilt and shame which feed the depression are experienced in equal measure. They know on a rational logical level they should be happy, unfortunately they have lost the ability. Their happiness has been replaced by numbness and indifference which they have seemingly no control over. I well remember when I was going through my own depression someone asking me what I would do if I won a million pounds. Without even having to think I said I would probably give it away as no amount of money could ever make me happy again. These are the depths a depressed mind can sink to.  
Observing not participating. There is a song from the movie midnight cowboy sung by Harry Nilsson that I think sums up depression beautifully. Here it is. “Everybody’s talking at me, I don’t hear a word they’re saying only the echoes of my mind”. Severe depression is probably like having an out of body experience. You can see and hear everything happening around you but you are not part of it. It can feel very lonely and isolating to realise that you are a spectator to your own life. Your heart aches to be part of something that will make you feel like a human being again but your depressed mind is constantly telling you that this is for other people to experience, not you. Just like the song you literally do hear what everybody is saying but you are lost in mire of the echoes of your own mind. It can feel like you are living a life where the pause button is permanently pressed. A state of non-existing if you like.  
Dysfunctional relating and relationships. It’s no coincidence that the rate of breakups and divorces amongst people suffering depression is quite high. Relating to another human being requires motivation that is sadly lacking as they struggle with their illness. Maintaining relationships requires effort and energy both of which have been sucked out of them. It’s not that they don’t care it’s because they have lost the ability to care and they feel powerless to do anything about it. When you don’t care if you live or die yourself it can be very difficult to care for someone else. They are trapped inside the prison of their own mind desperately hoping for someone or something to set them free. For a depressed person isolating themselves can be preferable to relating even though they absolutely know this is doing them real harm. A depressed mind doesn’t think rationally it will push away the very thing that could help them. It can see relationships as having very little consequence, even though the opposite is true, such is the contradictory nature of depression.  
Lack of autonomy. The most important thing to every human being on the planet is having a sense of autonomy or control over their lives. When depression comes into a person’s life that sense of control is taken away. Choices start to become very limited and the person’s world can become microscopic. In an effort to fill that emotional void many people turn to food, alcohol, drugs, shopping anything in fact that alleviates, however temporarily, the crushing feeling of being out of control of their own destiny. These strategies can of course bring about bigger problems to add to the depression. A sense of meaning or purpose to their lives is missing and in its place is a gaping hole. This can set some people off on a journey to find that missing piece in the vain hope that it will complete them. They never find that thing that will make them whole again because it doesn’t exist. It is a depression generated wild goose chase that can easily turn into an obsession. Depression holds out the promise that if you could just find that thing outside yourself everything would return to normal and the depression would vanish. Unfortunately as many people have found to their cost, including myself, it’s simply not true. The answer lies internally not externally.  
There are a countless different ways that people can experience depression. There are however quite a few commonalities between the different types. If any of the above resonated with you it’s time to seek professional help. These types of symptoms won’t be exercised away, prayed away, snapped out of or ignored. If left unaddressed they have the ability to devastate your life for a very long period of time.

My paranoia is very severe and makes daily tasks like showering painful and difficult. And ways to deal with it? Its at the point where its driving me crazy.

"No friends, no job, no hobbies besides gaming occasionally. Days have just blended together and I only go outside for groceries. Last job I had was last year for 3 months, got fired without an explanation. That was the longest job I had since graduating high school in 2013. Back then I found it hard to get jobs because of my social anxiety, now that I'm older my anxiety has lessened a lot and I've learned ways to manage it, but now my depression just makes me not want to do anything. Even though I was never given a reason why I was fired, I'm pretty sure it was my attendance. I called out a lot and came in late, because I hated that job. I didn't want to be there or do the work, and I actually wanted to quit but I still wanted the money, so I kept working hoping to be fired lol. It's so hard to make myself do stuff. I have to force myself to just go outside to the supermarket for food so I don't die. I have a panic attack every time I have to go for groceries and it's been this way since high school. I have difficulty managing basic things, I can't see how I could ever manage a normal adult life. I still want kids, want to travel, want to have a life outside of my bedroom, but I'm running out of time day after day. I wish I could find a job that an idiot like me could do for 4 hous a day. I wish I could find someone to talk to and hang out with. I wish I had a reason to get up in the morning. I don't ask for a lot but it still feels alot for the universe to give. I don't feel capable or worthy of anything.  All my therapist can say is 'wow that must be really difficult dealing with all that. You are such a strong person, you just need to set some goals and try one day at a time' lol sound familiar?

i know people would care for a bit, but their pain would subside after a while. it wouldn't last long. it'd be ending all my pain that appears to me in the most inconvenient times, and only causing a small inconvenience to others.

thats not true though and i know it. that'd be selfish of me also. i could never bring that kind of pain onto my friends and family. 

i just want attention. honestly. maybe if someone gave me the love and care i want, i wouldnt feel this way. maybe if someone noticed how shitty i feel, they'd all start to care. 

maybe i'll hurt myself so that they know the pain is real and have a visual.

i'll chicken out. but if it gets to bad, i'm certain that i will eventually resort to a shitty coping mechanism.

"So, I finally signed up for therapy and talked to my doctor about getting on anxiety/depression medicine. I'm 34 years old and have been letting anxiety control me for my entire life.

Looking back, relationships, friendships, work, school, everything has been negatively affected by my constant worrying, needing reassurance, scattered mind, etc. I'm excited to finally try and take control of my life again.

"I am a 22 year old, who is feeling stuck in life. Not sure if this is the right thread of Reddit to post. But I really need some help. I feel like whatever I do is not good enough for my family. Me and my mum have a rocky relationship... which has created a lot of mental trauma for me. I.e. not wanting me to be born, due to my gender. Bodyshaming me for my height ( I am quite short). Or not receiving grades that she wants. Or literally calling me ""not beautiful"", and saying that other people I.e. my cousin is so pretty. I literally can't even work, or walk properly as I am not able to deflect or remove these negative unhealthy, toxic thought from my mind. Even my supervisor told me. And even my friends that I looked depressed. 
I feel like a failure. I don't even know how to cook, or clean properly. And don't even have the courage to get the driving license. As I feel scared.. maybe of failure. There is so much pressure from the family of getting married, and that no one will like me. How am I supposed to get married? If I don't even like myself? And I am not even Independent? I hate how I am so envious of other people.. Envious of them being happy, envious of them being loved in relationships, of having a kind and considerate mum. Envious of career progression in their life.. or being able to withstand negative family problems and still carry out with their lives. I am also struggling with my Deen (relationship with Allah) .. I feel like I am not a good Muslim, I am not consistent on my daily prayers. And they feel forced. I miss that spark .. when I was praying for myself & my own pleasure only. Amd not to please my parents. I also hate how my mum constantly compares me to my brother, bless him he has done nothing wrong. But she keeps on saying how lazy I am and evil. They definitely don't help the already existing negative thoughts that I am having towards myself. I also am struggling immensely with friendships, and being myself in them.. or comfortable.. I constantly feel like I am not good enough, or not as skilled or confident as my friends. I am already in therapy, and my therapist has mentioned to ignore my mum's comments. But it's really hard I don't know.. is this ever going to gey better. Some people might recommend moving out, it's not as cheap, I feel stuck. I also need a job. Or anything to keep me going. I just feel lost. I really don't know what to do. Please BE KIND in the comments section, I have enough negativity in my life & in my thoughts. Please let me know if anyone has faced similar thoughts or situations, and  how you have overcome those. Thanks for reading ♥️",2,depression

"I’m a SAHM and ever since my second child (3 yrs) was born I haven’t felt much happiness. She’s been a much more difficult child than my first (7 yrs). I feel like a terrible mother because I never feel much happiness around anyone anymore. I feel like I have no one to talk to or any sort of support system. I have my husband and he tries to be supportive but eventually gets frustrated when I put any sort of responsibility on him to help me out of this like putting our toddler to bed every night so that I can have some sort of break after being with her 24/7. He says he will do it regularly but somehow we fall into me doing it. His family are the only ones around to help us with our girls but my MIL watches my nieces so she doesn’t have much time for ours. Which is fine but she asked me to watch my niece a day a week so she didn’t have to and I told her I didn’t want to (lots of reasons for this which I don’t want to unpack). She cried when I told her no because she doesn’t dare to tell my SIL no and she said back in the day family helped family which has made me feel like complete and utter crap since she said it. Like she will only take our girls if I help her out with my nieces? That’s not fair. They’re not her kids. Besides I wouldn’t be a SAHM if I had free childcare like my SIL gets from her. It’s so messed up. This was months and months ago and that and so many things just have me so so down. Also so many sicknesses the past two years have trickled through the house so I get no sleep for a whole month at a time between me and my girls being sick. Last year it was literally without exaggerating 3 months straight of sickness (Covid, a cold, then a stomach bug). And now I’m currently recovering from a stomach bug that everyone got before me where I couldn’t eat for an entire week and lost 10 pounds. I also can’t rest whenever I’m sick because I’m home with my very demanding toddler. I feel like I’m in a hole I can’t climb out of and it just keeps getting deeper and deeper.

"Hello! I am looking for some support and advice on hyperventilation.

Over the years I began to develop this hyperventilation habit, where I'd take unnecessarily deep breaths out of anxiety and slowly and slowly it became my most prominent anxiety symptom, and especially more this past year when my anxiety turned into nonstop panic.

A week ago, I was prescribed Sertraline (50 mg) to take daily, and quite honestly it has already made strides to my anxiety, and has helped a bit with the hyperventilating.

But my problem now is I have noticed it must be a habit of my own breathing now rather than just out of anxiety, likely for the years and more recently the intense months I struggled with anxiety without help.

What I would like to learn, or get help with, is how can I rid myself of this habit. To explain a bit deeper, when I hyperventilate, it's not what people think like a sudden rapid fire of breaths, rather mine is every 30 seconds to (I've been getting better at not doing it so often) a few minutes, I take this intense gasp of air through my mouth in order to get a satisfying feeling in my chest, almost like I am addicted to some type of substance and I need my fix every 30 seconds to a few minutes. Some people say I sound like I am sighing because the gasp is very much like a sigh, it's like an almost relieving breath of air that does more satisfaction than simply breathing through my nose or even my mouth (as I am a bit of a mouth breather due to my weight - don't make fun of me haha).

The problem is, I never hated these deep breaths, they've always given me a satisfactory feeling in my chest. However this past year, my anxiety skyrocketed, and these breaths were not always satisfactory, it was no longer a failsafe for my anxiety, but a symptom of it, and the satisfaction in my chest with these really deep gasps of air has gotten fewer and far between that they leave me feeling breathless often, and bring on the more traditional hyperventilation you see in media like the rapid fire breaths, I'll essentially inhale air until I get that satisfaction in my chest.

The issue is it's just become such a horrid habit that has exacerbated my anxiety even deeper and caused me to hit this bottom point where I decided to finally try medicating the anxiety, but this habit still persists, and I've out of fear started to believe it will end up worsening.

I am very familiar with habits, I chew on my shirts a lot during anxiety and stuff like that, but this breathing is just something else, I fell into it for far too long and it has now become a second nature thing, where I get this knot in my chest if I don't gasp for air. I plan to work on this with my therapist and healthcare team, but wanted to get a head start on providing if any relief sooner than through therapy.

Thank you for any input :)",4,anxiety

"I think my dad has tried to poison my younger sister and I. He bought two packs of gum (different flavors), and gave us each one, but what was weird was that he insisted we mix them to each get some of each. I got a weird feeling and wondered if he did something to one of the packs, although I knew I was most likely being paranoid. I decided not to have any anyway. My sister chews a lot of gum; she had 3-4 pieces by the end of the day. The next day she gets violently sick in a parking lot and about six more times in plastic bags on the way home.

I went for some gum today, and I noticed the wrappers smelled weird, somewhat like a perfume, but more like floor polish. Only one flavor, though (remember they're mixed, half watermelon half wintergreen. The wintergreen ones smelled.)

"19, f, latvia

i started my journey of trying to get help by going to my family doctor(?) and she said that i'm just a bit stressed and disheveled bc of exam season and made me buy 20€ brain vitamins. i called bs and booked an appointment with a psychiatrist. 

this morning i went to the psychiatrist to possibly get some help with my adhd. i haven't been diagnosed with adhd but i'm 99% sure i've had it all my life, almost everything associated with adhd i've seen online i can relate to. i've taken hundreds of online adhd quizzes(and other mental disorder quizzes to make sure) over the course of multiple months. only adhd applies. so today at my psychiatrist i tell her everything i feel, maybe leave something out because i was pretty afraid of being told i'm wrong and stressed bc of seeking help in a post soviet country since every boomer almost doesn't believe any mental illness, other than like depression, exists. she gave me a sheet of described feelings and how much i relate to them. the questions were like ""my mental state makes it hard to maintain my house, do school/work"", ""i feel i'm not as good as others"" etc so i thought it was a general sheet, i answered truthfully. later she tells me that it was a depression assessment sheet and that i scored moderate-high depression. that didn't feel right but i thought maybe, bc i hadn't thought about having depression. she prescribed me Sertralin and sent me home. 

now i'm thinking that she was very wrong because i don't feel depressed. those answers in the sheet were because my undiagnosed adhd makes it hard to do tasks as well others at the same age,education level so i'm just insecure i guess. i thought that if i come in saying that i feel i have adhd, she should've given me an adhd assessment sheet, not something else that she thinks might be it. also when i told her i started getting suspicious and looked up information online, she kind of scoffed and asked ""and why did you use the internet "", then asked another question before i could even answer. 

i really feel like i haven't been heard after waiting for this day for so long. looked up that Sertralin may make adhd worse so my hope is that if it gets worse, after a month i can tell her how awfull my adhd symptoms are and that she maybe would consider thinking that i have adhd, if not, i am going to try to find another psychiatrist that would actually listen. i don't know what the point of this post was, i guess to let my frustration out.

also i know that a psychiatrist can't really diagnose me but i had no clue where to go, i'm using misdiagnosed as, i guess, misunderstood?",3,adhd

"TW: minor mention of abuse
I honestly don't know if this is normal for people who suffer from PTSD but I was in an abusive relationship for two years as an early high schooler and it's been almost 4 years since it ended. For that time I've had really bad sleep paralysis/paranoia based on my ex boyfriend. It ranges from him hiding under my bed to reach out and grab me, hiding in my closet, sh00ting me through my window, or hiding anywhere in my house with intent to hurt me or my family. Unfortunately recently aside from all of that normal paranoia, I've been scared of driving alone, being home alone, going to the store/public alone, etc. for fear that he's stalking me and going to find me to hurt me. Besides all of this I have routines and rituals I have to follow to feel safe such as I have to jump from three feet away into my bed so he can't grab me, close my blinds over my windows by 6 pm so he can't see in when it's dark, etc.

"I hate it when people misunderstand me in conversation and assume the absolute worst. This happens too often on social media, when I'm just trying to discuss something with someone, and maybe I say too much or something, or maybe it's simply the fact I don't completely agree with them idk, but it appears that they assume the worst of my intentions because they either insult me in writing or they block me. 






Today it happened again. There's an autistic content creator I've occasionally watched videos of and I saw a video from her about ""autistic coded"" robots and other non-humans. I tried to discuss it with her. I asked her if she feels that the term ""coded"" implies intent because I feel it kinda does and I am not a huge fan of it because of that because we're not in the creators / artists / writers brain so I don't think we can know their intentions for certain unless they've outright said they intended for a character to have x trait. I didn't attack her for saying it. I asked her whether she feels it implies intention and said why *I* don't like it. I then said that I think in some cases robots / non-humans with autistic traits do come about for the reason she said but also offered another reason I think it happens too - which was coming from experience because I literally write about fictional robots myself. And she blocked me. I was just trying to discuss it with her. I had no bad intentions and definitely didn't want a negative interaction with her. 








Its so frustrating when this shit happens. I just have a lot of thoughts about things and I like to discuss things, and when people actually discuss things I'm interested in with me its awesome. But it also at other times results in people misunderstanding me and getting angry or blocking me on social media. It really sucks and makes me feel bad, especially when it's someone I've had positive interactions with before.",1,autism

"I grew up in a sketchy town where crime is high, so anything after the sun sets, gets suspicious quickly. Recently, I moved into a nice neighborhood, real nice, Americana suburbia, so I let my guard down a bit. Yet, I've been noticing some weird things lately. I've seen someone outside with a flashlight looking around. It might just be the neighborhood watch lookin' around for mischief, but I've only seen him once around 10 or 11, so that puts doubt on my Nightwatch theory. I've also noticed that every time I leave my window open at night, I hear strange noises. They could be the local wildlife, cats, and whatnot. 

Now all of these things could be waived aside as an overactive imagination, but the reason I'm typing this is because of what happened a few moments ago. It's 4 AM, and I'm still awake. Nothing new; this happens every few months. I stay up longer, a bit longer every day, and eventually, my sleep cycle flips itself; then I pull an all-nighter, and everything fixes itself. My father went to work a few hours ago, so only our sleeping roommate and I are home. 

I'm droning off to the computer but notice at the corner of my eye a tiny glint coming out of window blinders. I ignore it, thinking it might be my neighbor's porch light, but I swear it moved. So now I discreetly moved my seat to get a better view, and I saw that light again. At this point, I stare directly at it, and then It's gone. I turn on my room's light and head into the living room and kitchen to turn those lights on and get a knife. I'm sitting here hoping that this is a footnote and not a period in this story. I'll keep you guys updated.

"I've been emotionally abused by my brothers in my childhood. I haven't realised of the traumas I've been through until recently. The stigma of having a normal happy family stopped me from looking at back. I have asked myself so many times how did I turn out to be this way? And the answer, the main reason, lies within my family. Infront of everyone I have a pretty much big family. And they all get along. Except for me and my brothers. We had our share of brotherly fights but at some point it went out of hand and detached me from them forever. We don't talk anymore.. We don't even smile. It's been like that more than 10 years. I'm 23 now. And I feel more alone and depressed when I'm home. Don't have that many friends. But I feel more comfortable when I'm with them. 

Years back when I first got diagnosed for my mental health issues I didn't know it was only gonna get worse. That I would be left hurt for the rest of my life. That I would be constantly thinking of death. At first my parents were the reason that held me back from it. the pain they would suffer. the trauma I would cause them. Nothing matters anymore. They are the main reason for me to turn out like this. And yeah, of course my mind isn't normal from early days there's that too. A couple of months more. I know a miracle like someone coming to your life to save you is not gonna happen. I had someone like that, very precious, and it turned out to be the second most haunting thing now. So I'm just waiting it out to all end. I beared myself these fucked up years what's a couple more months. It's going to be hellish like or worst than the past six months. But yeah I'm preparing myself for the end. I have tried to die two times. But it was more like a suicidal gestures, a cry for help. But there won't be another one of that.

"The neighbors across from me haven't been home for a few weeks. Their driveway is on the other side of the street. 

For the past week or so there will be a car that just stops on their (non-driveway) side of the house and you'll see it just wait for 5-10-15 minutes.  I feel like whoever is stopping is looking at our house.  It's been kinda creepy.  The longest I've seen someone hang out there was 30 minutes. 

Today I opened the front door and a car drove off. 

The neighbor (whose side they park on) has a gigantic fence. So if they were casing their house it would probably just show that the lights were off.  Also I don't really imagine some epic heist that would take place there.  Car break ins are becoming more common around here but the side of the street these cars are on rarely has cars parked outside ( we parked ours in the garage).

"Yesterday, shortly before falling asleep, and after staying up all night drinking energy drinks and playing GTA V Online (trying to grind out some in-game cash, which is hard to come by for free), I had the distinct impression that I was rapidly losing my mind.

Normally when I'm tired I just fall asleep no matter how much caffeine I drink; the caffeine just helps me stay alert while I'm already awake. However, last night I guess I hit a 'sweet spot' and I sort of got stuck in between sleeping and being awake. I figured the game was making me twitchy from being alert too long, and began watching YouTube to unwind.

The first and only video I watched ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJEF\_U3L0B4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJEF_U3L0B4), I remember the video because that's when things got weird), I found my brain randomly latching onto little things in the video's content, like words, gestures, etc. and I got the most literal 'tunnel vision' effect that I've ever experienced.

This startled me, and I jokingly thought to myself something like, ""Ha, my brain's playing tricks on me."" I then suddenly had a frightening and nightmarish hallucination of a really vivid brain. Just the otherwise harmless word triggered a terrifying response.

I immediately slammed my computer shut, sprinted to my bed, and hid under my blanket like a four-year-old. I fought my way toward a restless sleep, in which I constantly felt like my back was exposed to some unknown threat, even when I laid face-up.

Now, after having slept and detox-ed, I still have lingering effects from this incident, mostly of needing to shield my back with a wall, or the floor... like I become afraid of staying standing if I lose focus on what I'm doing. Note that I really only delayed my sleep cycle by 8 hours or so, and consumed no more caffeine than I often do.

Idk what to do. I want to just straight up quit but that would leave my mom in an awful spot cause she doesn’t have a job right now either. I want to cry. I hate it here. UGH.

"I get these scenarios that pop into my head and cause me to be paranoid all the time over things that have a very little chance of ever happening. Please note that I am on medication and I do share these scenarios with a professional. 

My newest one involving the bathroom in my house. See, my bathroom only has a small window. It’s between the shower and the toilet. From the outside you can’t even see ones shadow because it’s up so high. The scenario I keep having when I go in there is someone seeing me turn the light on, stand in front of the toilet to either sit to use the bathroom or to undress to get in the shower and just shoot me through the window in my head. 

It’s like I can see the outside of my house, the mysterious shadow person lurking in the deer grass (some tall grass that the deer like in my yard). I can see him (because mysterious shadow person is always a man, idk, I don’t make the rules when it comes to my thoughts) move closer to the window to get a better shot, pull out his gun and shoot. 

The scene switches to inside my bathroom where the glass breaks, and just before I have the chance to look over, my body falls lifeless onto the tile. The scene switches to my 4 month old crying in his crib from the loud noises waking him. The scene switches back to me laying on the tile just gone. Unknowing of what happened and what will happen to my son and my fiancé now that I’m gone. 

Whenever this happens in my head I tend to duck when I enter the bathroom and avoid getting too close to the window. I find standing in front of my bathroom sink stressful because I can’t duck and still see in the mirror. I sometimes find the intrusive thoughts after that scenario playing to be too much and so I’ll leave the bathroom without finishing or starting what I went in to do (excluding using the toilet cause I can’t just get up midshit or piss). 

I have a major fear of death, no understanding of the afterlife and don’t know how to react to death. I’m a paranoid schizophrenic. Most of my paranoia comes from that fear of death so therefore most of the scenarios end in my death while others end in my fiancé or my sons death. I have many other repeatable scenarios that pop into my head every day. It’s interesting when I get a new one because it only takes one time seeing that in my head to never go away. 

Most of the time these main scenarios are followed by a plethora of intrusive and unsettling thoughts. These thoughts will continue until I change what I’m doing or where I’m at to get rid of that setting, or they won’t stop until I’ve found some resting time, whether it be laying down for a short nap or just finding a moment to collect myself. I have also found that i have more throughout the day and night since I’ve had my son. 

Just wanted to share something publicly that I struggle with anonymously. Also once again please remember that I do see a professional and I do share these issues with said professional. I live a normal life aside from my mental flaws. Please delete if not allowed.",5,paranoia

"So I just want to say I had a friend for a long while for a good few years like while. They have been a good friend and they are still a good person and we've always gotten along wellvery rasily.  For some reason and  I really don't know how it happened but last night this friend ans i who has always been aware that I have some mental challenges that present to the world at large as very stoic and non obvious.  I present as pretty normal and live a normal life because I've pretty well  learned how to deal with my challenges I keep my stuff inside without it being apparent to everyone else that there is in reality a whole ass shit show playing out in my head at most any given time.  Chaos would be peaceful. LOL Anyways..  I guess I made a mistake last night and I'm old enough to know better that I should never even say schizophrenia as a diagnosis term applicable to myself. I could just kick ny own ass I swear.  It came about while in process of a normal discussion about noise being quiet, peaceful and just nothing. No sound. We had stoppied in a rural area for a monent and she was sharing her detailed admiration of the peacefulness and just taking for granted I too was enamored of such an awesome moment that doesnt happen very often    I truly didnt even have an imagination to assist me understanding her poetic sounding details. I mean that like way out fictional and still I just dont get what silence must sound like. Oh but anyways..  i kust honestly slipped up  stating how it really must be a true moment in time worth cherishing. It sounds wnderful. My dum dum ass then  explained to my friend that silence that he is hearing  is not the same type of silence that I hear. He givets this look like.. silence is silence. Like everyone hears the same sound of nothing. I then explain silence sounds like for me what i hear is utter chaos. Constantly. There is never this silence and nothingness he is describing for himself. I explain to him that i of course understand rthe difference between it but it's very hard to explain that to somebody and I had never used the word schizophrenia before and decined my mental provlem  It just straight slipped out. Well then of course he was all  understanding and yeah it's okay and doesn't make a difference blah blah blah and questions galore . Todaywe had some plans and he said he needed to go home. He didn't speak one word to me after that was said and i didnt speak either. We didn't say I'll see you later when parting. No goodbye. Nada.  It was totally bizarre. I guess now he is a different person. Because  I have schizophrenia.  I have always had the stigma and it's never going to go away no matter how well I take care of it I know better than to use that ""S"" word I know better but I did it because I thought this was my friend.  But you know what?  I'm sad and I regret saying it but then of course I also dont regret it. Maybe he wasn't my friend at after all.  Generall anytime anybody hears you have that specifi issur they just don't understand it.  They just don't and obviously don't want to. I see Sally Field cross their face and wait to be called Sybil. Its just so ridiculous. Anyways... I just wanted to get that off my chest. I'm. Well you know as alone as i can be . I cant trust people I guess. It makes me me feel so fake  No matter how well I act no matter how well I try to keep myself contained it just takes the mere mention of the ""s"" word and that to completely change any type relationship. I swear i hear a door slam right in rhe moment  It just  make me very sad. Sorry everyone for my rant. Thank you guys I hope none of you are going through these same things.

"Was standing for about 10 minutes today and then my vision faded until I couldn't see anything. My chest felt tired and out of breath, I felt forced to sit down before I pass out. My hearing also felt like it was fading, like something was blocking my ears but there was nothing. 

About a minute after sitting, I regained vision but still felt weak for some reason.. Honestly don't think I have much time left if I can barely stand in one spot for 10 minutes... I feel so pathetic.

Because of this, I also feel the need to do something I wanted to do but earlier.. Something like visiting a different state/ country to see and do macrophotography of some exotic insects. Maybe a little film or something. I also wanted to do some studies. I was saving up for a house but I don't know anymore... I don't think my major in college will suit me anymore since it requires a lot of standing for extended periods of time so I may have to change that too..",5,paranoia

"I’m very paranoid, like everyday, sometimes more one day than another, and it’s especially more potent in my relationship. I’m so afraid that this could all be a trick. I’m afraid of the idea that my girlfriend could be leading me on and trying to get me to be really attached and then hurt me really bad because it makes her feel good. I can’t convince myself that it’s okay or genuine. She says she loves me and wants to get married one day, she says she just knows I’ll be her husband and that we’ll have kids and be together forever. I’ve spent Christmas and Thanksgiving with her and her family, and I’ve been over to her parents lots of times and her mom talks about us getting married and says things like “you guys can’t break up.” They’re all so normal and great. I don’t feel worthy of being there which makes me feel like it’s all a trick. She’s invited me to parties and shown me that she wants to work on things together in our relationship and tells me I can talk to her and that she wants me to open up. I’m just afraid that it’s all apart of the trick and that I’ll feel so good and then she’ll ignore me one day or break up with me or cheat on me or find someone else and leave me for them and she’ll feel good that I’m hurting. I’ll feel so dumb for thinking I was good enough. I consider or feel strongly that this could be all apart of her plan; I don’t necessarily believe it but I feel it and consider it. She has everything. She’s beautiful, she has both parents, nice clothes, and good friends, and she’s going to school to be a teacher. Why would she want to be with me? I’m weird and sensitive and worried about things a lot and I’m afraid that all my worrying will ruin the relationship even though she says I’m not ruining anything. I wish I didn’t feel or think all the things that I do. I wish I could believe and enjoy the reality of things but I’m constantly suspicious that it’s not real and I hold myself back from fully attaching because I don’t want to get hurt. I’m afraid that we’ll get married and have kids and then she’ll leave me and take our kids and she’ll be happy that I’m hurting. I worry that she would hurt me so much that I’d kill myself and that that’s what she wants because it will make her feel good to know that someone killed themselves because they couldn’t be without her love.",5,paranoia

The idea of having people come to my house scares me. 

I don't think I'll be able to properly make friends. Idk people just seem to build a lot of relationships easy but I can't. And if I do I can't break them because of my fear of what they might do. They might doxx me or kill me or kidnap me or something. I'm still looking over my shoulder because I stopped talking to a friend who lives in my town. I just don't know what to do.

I've been on 6mg of respirodone for a while now I went from 2mg to 4mg to 6mg. I never felt and I definitely never asked to be put on a higher dose. I know I'm an outlier and maybe its because it's been so long since I've been on it or maybe I'm just not that observant I've never felt that respirodone has that many noticable effects. I know it helps me sleep and it has definitely given me ED but that's it. Not once did the difference psychologists I spoke to tell me why they where uping my dosage or even that 6 is a high dosage. Now after researching it I'm not sure but isn't 6mg like an extremely high dosage? Like I've really struggled to find people telling stories about there experiences who where on 6mg. I feel like I must of said something to the psychologists that concerned them but they didn't tell me what it was. They didn't tell me what part of what I was telling them concerned them and gave me the impression that things didn't seem to bad with me. I really don't feel like my schizophrenia is bad enough for me to be on such a high dose. Please anyone who knows alot about this that wouldn't mind awnsering questions I'd be very interested in speaking to you.

I feel like sometimes I get overly emotional about some stuff. Like usually I feel indifferent but then something upsets me and I feel like I’m going to have a tantrum. But I also know i shouldn’t be *this* upset about it but I still am. 

For example just now, I showed my mom a drawing I did. She says it looks nice but asked about a part of it, and I said well I was trying to make it in a similar style of a show I watch, and showed her the reference. 

This caused her to believe I ‘copied’ the drawing (Doesn’t help they had a similar hair color and style) and she says ‘so you copied that drawing’ 

this made me irrational angry and upset, I almost want to cry. 

I hate that she always says and assumes I trace and copy my drawings. I hate my drawings being reduced to just ‘a copy’. I worked so hard on it and I feel like it doesn’t matter now because she claims I copied the drawing. 

And I know it’s dumb to be this upset but I am and I wish I wasn’t.  I can’t think about anything else other than this now.",1,autism

Hi so I've noticed for a while now that whenever there's any sudden noises my head jerks forward. This happens often already whenever I'm extremely anxious about something underlying (which is always). But now instead of it just being a reaction to my anxiety it's started to happen with any noise. Like I'm at school right now in my art class and someone just dropped their paper which made a noise (it's Bristol paper so pretty thick paper) and my head jerked forward. This happens all the time but also not? Like it picks and chooses. I don't know if this is normal. Does anyone else experience this? Is this something I should mention to my therapist?,4,anxiety

"Ever since I was forcefully injected with haldol in 2019 I have not been the same. I have just been living my life day to day. I can not remember what i had for dinner last night, I can't remember what anyone has said to me yesterday and Every single thought I have in my head is about how long do I have to suffer living like this. I used to have the greatest memory in the world. I could walk into a room and know if something was moved and now I can't even remember why I left my register keys in the register. Even tho I never needed the injection they forced me to get injected for 2 years Every month. The cops brought me to nicolet psychiatric for no reason at all and tried to make me sign documents saying i was schizophrenic. I refused to sign these papers so they kept me there and i could not leave until i signed them. Everyday they would take me to an office to sign the papers and i refused everyday for 16 days. After 16 days of saying no i didnt want to be there anymore so i signed the paper and got to go home. If i ever missed an injection they send the police to my house and arrest me. This actually happened to me. I was arrested and they tied me down and injected me. The only reason I was able to get off it us because they changed my case worker and the new case worker saw that I was not crazy. My first case worker hated me cause I didn't listen to him when he tried to tell me the injection was gona help me. He definitely knew I was not schizophrenic cause I told him I work 50 hours a week cause im an assistant manager at my store and i have been working there for 6 years I don't have time to be schizophrenic. On top of that they ordered me to go to court to get off it and my first case worker always recommended I stay on it for no reason. After I got my case worker changed I got off it cause my new case worker saw that I was not crazy and i explained to him I didn't have time to be schizophrenic. I have been off it for a year now but this experience has made me miserable cause being injected with this haldol for 2 years really changes everything in your mind. I have been taking nootropic's which is pills to help your brain function to try to get my memory and thoughts back to normal but it's not really doing anything. I just feel like I'm just living today for today not living today for the future. What happened to me is something I wish would never happen to anyone at all.

Honestly I feel like my life is a bad Shakespeare script  written just to be cruel instead of to teach a lesson or some interspection on life itself. 
My starts just like a lot of people born to two parents that weren't at all compatible, nore where they ready to have a kid how do I know that you ask? Simple my parents fought a lot when I was a baby and kid right up until I was about 5 at some point my father hit my mother or so she claims I don't know the facts and they divorced soon after which you know fair enough no one should stay together if that's the relationship no I have no problem with that. 
What I have a problem with is that instead of ether of them taking me and raising me they both just dumped me with my grandparents and said have fun. Mind you my mother would go on to steal my childsupport as long as it was coming in I never saw a dime and funny how that's the less fucked up part the real fucked up part is the fact she left me with my grandparents.
Which your probably thinking whats so bad about that? Well what's wrong with that is she knew my grandmother was an abusive fucking monster it's why she got amansipated at 16 at left the house.
Like bitch jumped ship herself but left her 5 year old son to fend for himself. 
So predictably as anyone could guess the abuse started after that. But twist I didn't start in the way you might imagine. At first it just started with trying to make me into the perfect little child oh all the adults would love me 💌 they would all say what a well behaved kid oh he's so smart this that and the other. Little did they know I was so damn perfect because if I wasn't I should get my ass beat screamed at and anything else you could imagine I was just my grandmothers little living trophy.
I was dragged all around to adult party's with nothing to do but sit around and be presentable I could talk with adults because it was an adult conversation I couldn't watch TV because it was rude to do that as someone's place or around guests I couldn't play games because that was disrespectful to others mind you I was a kid not a teen a kid. 
Oh also did I forget to mention she constantly didn'tni allow me to have friends I was totally isolated from  kids my own age so that as I grew older I had no idea how to interact with kids my own age for the longest time until I was in high school in fact and even then I needed her seal of approval. But i am getting ahead of myself here.
So my childhood keeps going on and I get sent to one of the worst school in the whole of the United States its has been in the national news multiple times for gang fights. As you might imagine awkward nerdy kid with no social skills makes for an easy target for kids to try and bully what you might not have expected was that nerdy kid was taught to fight by his grandfather to protect myself and encourged to do so infact. So I ended up getting in a lot of fights and I do mean a lot. Now what you might not have expected even more then that though was that fact that my evil bitch grandmother would in fact not take my side for defending myself and would in fact both blame me and punish me for doing so.
So needless to say I grew to resent and hate her for both the physical abuse when she hit me the verbal abuse when she called me things like demon child and the mental abuse of telling me one thing but when I actully did it getting punished for it. And when she wasn't beating me or yelling at me what she would do was lock me in my room no books no TV no games no cards nothing just empty room. And to be fair when school was in, it was fine but when it was off on break. Man did it fucking suck I would just go days or weeks without human interactions except for them which as you might imagine a kid doesn't want to interact with his abuser very much so I just didn't interact with anyone except sometimes my grandfather when he wasn't to tired from work. 
And that went on for years until I was in highschool and then suddenly my grandmother this evil woman I hated suddenly got and man let me tell you what a complicated set of emotions that was because I might of hated this woman for all the abuse but at least she raised me which was just a tad more then I could say about my own parents. So I ended up taking time off my senor year of highschool taking care of her just barely being in school enough to graduate. Great am I right? Finally out of that hell hole? Nope because now comes the real mental anguish. My grandfather who never asked me for most anything asked me to take care of my grandmother so that we could save money so she could get treatments and he could go to work. 
As you might imagine I wasn't exactly happy about that arrangement but I agreed to it because he's one of the few people who treated me like I mattered in my family. So I waste a few years of my life taking care of her she gets better at time and then suddenly takes a turn for the worse and I experience all the horrors cancer and cancer treatment do to a person from the throwing up, hair loss  agonizing pain, and anything else you can imagine only to have her die anyways. Now me being the stupid stupid bastard I am manged to get ahold of my mother because I thought she deserved to be their before her mother died worst fucking mistake of my life. Now you might be asking how's that the worst mistake that's simple I had compassion for another person who was hurting at lose because even though my mother and my grandmother couldn't be in the same room without fighting I knew they loved each other. So I make the hospital let her in to see her on her death bed my wishes where honored. she used this as an opportunity to manipulate me into feeling pity for me now fast forward a few years into the future and I invite her to live with me in my grandmother and grandfather's house because he was moving out because it was to painful for him to live here but he didn't want to kick me out so he left me to pay for the house instead. So I figure win win I get my mom to live with me and we can try repairing are relationship and all she has to do is pay real cheap rent and her and my brothers all get a nice house to live in. 

SEE THIS THIS RIGHT HERE ⬆️ THIS IS WHERE I FUCKED MYSELF THE HARDEST

So she and my brothers move in the first thing that starts happening is they all start trashing the house they refuse to clean up after themselves they eat my food mind you I have a fridge in my own room so they had to break in and take my stuff knowingly, and she also refuses to correct my younger siblings behavior because she let's them do whatever they want and doesn't want me to do anything about it ether mind you again this is my house. So it gets so bad that I have to kick her out but mind you it's to late they have trashed my house and I now have a roach problem she broke one of the bedroom doors and door handles changed the lock and handle on another one aboned one of my siblings at my house and refuses to come get him and cps won't do shit. But at least she's out mind you while this happens my current gf who was just a friend at the time saw all this happening and felt bad for me and loved me even if I was to stupid to see it at the time. So time goes on with me struggling then I lose my job get super depressed end up in some amount of debt and I want to die. But she doesn't give up on me and she shows me she loves me in a way that even someone as stupid as me can understand. She supports me and gets me back on my feet enough so I can get a job again and all the while I don't notice she's putting herself in debt to help me. So finally realizing she loves me clearly and doesn't just want somthing from me I asked her out we start dating and I ask her to live in my house ya it still has problems but I say we can try to mange it together we can't because she has put herself in debt trying to help me and so we just try working on getting are stuff together but stuff keeps going wrong. For starters as soon as she moves in the well water pump brakes so we have to fix that then after this on my way to work a guy T-bones me totals my car I use a decent portion of the money to try catching back up on some of the house payments I missed and I hold on to the rest to try to get us through stuff because I stupidly think she has a car we can share not realizing what a burden I am putting on her. Because now we have to make are schedules always work for each other. So I have now placed this girl multiple times under distress because she loves me worthless ass. Mind you she is putting up with roaches we can't seem to get rid of no matter how hard I try or how clean we keep the house. And now she's left to her mother's house rightfully so because she can't take living here anymore I was forced to buy a car with no money saved for one with credit that hasn't recovered yet so that I can keep working so I can try to keep my house feed myself and not be homeless all while trying to deal with the houses problems and trying to not lose my gf because I have made her life harder just by loving me. So now I have negative 147$ in my bank 5$ on my credit card left a 600$ payment for my car coming up no money for food no family to turn to crippling anxiety crippling depression and an intense desire to kill myself all while knowing I won't kill myself. I don't have an idea of how to evan start helping myself and if I am honest with myself I know I can do nothing for myself here I just have to be forced to watch as the little bit of life I have tryed to carve out for myself crumbles like ash in my mouth leaving nothing but a bitter taste in my mouth.

This is my life story or at least a large part of it I suppose. I don't know why I wrote this I don't know if anyone will care probably not. Not many have before. Honestly this just might be my last dying gasps for help but I am not even sure I want help as much as I just want all my hurt to go away to be able to be loved and love someone else without so much going wrong. To be able just just live......... but I probably won't get even that wish. Life real is just a sick cruel joke. 

Show others kindness you don't know what's happening in their lives. support each other try to do better even if it's hard. Good bye I hope you all have good lives.",2,depression
"Bare with me, this is going to be looong!

My background:  I grew up in a dysfunctional family. My parents always fought growing up. I think I saw them once or twice as a child being nice to each other. 99% of the time they were fighting and being loud. Idk why but that used to scare me, & I would go hide somewhere. I used to hate myself for wanting them to get a divorce. I never understood why they were together. Also, my mom is very manipulative. She used to feed me lies about everyone close to me, even my dad. She would tell me he doesn’t want me, and he wants other kids.

Anyways, I’ve been married for over a year now ( I had known him a year prior to that). Our honeymoon was a disaster. We fought all the time. It used to bother me that he would check out other women ( I told him I don’t care if you do it, as long as you don’t do it when I’m around). He said I’m disrespecting him and he does not checking out women 🙄).

It all started when he asked me why I’m still friends with some of my old exs, & he said he’s not in contact with his exs, and that he deleted all their contacts. I was like are you sure? And asked to check his phone. At the time I only knew of one ex. He tried to trick me by pretending he left his phone in the other room (gave himself time to change her name). When I confronted him, he still had her pictures on his phone, he said he freaked out and just didn’t know what to do. 
3 weeks later, I found out her younger sister called him. My husband is a Doc, and the ex is a PA. Apparently, the sis called to ask my husband about a “sick a relative”. And he asked the sis about how his ex is doing, and what she’s up to now. (He said i thought it was the nice thing to do). He claims he told the sis he’s married now. Eventually, I told him this has affected my trust, and asked him to consider couples therapy. I really hate being lied to. 

Shortly before we start therapy, I told him it’s important for me that you delete pictures of your ex-romantic partners. He was against this idea; “these are memories I want to keep, to look back at”. Through the therapist, he was somewhat convinced that it’s a good idea to delete pics of his exs. 

A month goes by, and I had a mini surgery. He was taking care of me over there weekend, since I was heavily medicated. I felt he was acting odd. Few days later I asked him what was going on, he tells me he felt resentment towards me because he had to lie to me🤔. It makes no sense!
Also, turns out, that Saturday! he created a “Trash” folder on his laptop, with all their pictures. But he never deleted it. I felt really sick. Because a week prior to that he said he deleted everything. Another lie. I felt the need to leave the house, and ended up staying in a hotel that night. I thought maybe I was being overly dramatic, so I went back home & realized he wasn’t home. (At that point he knew why I left). 

I came back the next day, and we talked it out. I asked him where he had been that night, he said I was home all night. 3 days goes by, I kept telling him I know you weren’t home. On the the third day I explained to him that I came back so I know he’s lying. He suddenly remembered he had to go back to the hospital.( it’s something he has never done before, nor after).

He told me many times that he has no feelings for her. He told me he actually broke up with her, because his friends told him if you don’t see a future with her you should let her go, and not use her. Her claims there were no emotional feelings towards her, it was just the physical part for him. However, as I glimpsed over their messages I read that he sent her “...this was very hard on me...”. Also, he had dated others after her.

I just knew I couldn’t trust him, so I purchased a tracking device. To see if I can catch him going somewhere, up until now, I haven’t caught him going anywhere crazy.

Also,  I recently found out, this whole year, we had been driving by his Ex’s house (same PA ex) almost every weekend on our way home. He claims it’s a “shortcut”. I noticed he would look into that house ALL the time! & if the car windows are down, he would shut it as we drive by. (Before researching the house, I had asked him if he used to live there, or if he knew someone that lived there, he said “NO”). Continued to drive by until I confronted him with my findings. He claims he doesn’t know if she still lives there or not. And that I was making a big deal out of nothing.

He deleted all his messages has his phone set up to delete messages every 30 days now. I still feel my trust has been shattered. I don’t truly believe him, I just pretend that I do as to not fight. 

When we are not intimate for more than a week, I always assume he’s cheating on me.I’ve this fear that he’s cheating on me, and I’m just dumb and can’t see it. There were two instances where I found hair strands that weren’t mine. I just really don’t know if I’m actually going crazy, and over exaggerating this whole thing...or if I should be worried.  Please help.",5,paranoia
Today was a good day and the worst day at the same time. My sister graduated today and we had a grad party for her. (So proud of her!) I already was dreading the party because it shines the spotlight on college and how I am not currently attending. This means a lot of side eyes and judgement from my family. I had about five or six people ask me what I was doing with my life and it was very obvious what they were doing. I’m already introverted and it was super hard trying to defend myself. I did have to sneakily go into the guest room to let out a few tears because I was so overwhelmed. It’s very clear my family’s love is conditional. It reminds me why I don’t attend family gatherings and why I like being alone. I just have this gut wrenching feeling after every party. I’m just trying my best but clearly that’s not enough. Thanks for listening!,2,depression
"l feel empty, currently nothing I do is truly ""fun"" Hobbies such as music, videogames and sports are all unfullfilling and none of them are fun. I feel like im wasting my time because I do these things to have fun and yet I dont, I never have fun.

No matter the game I play, the sport I do or the music I try to learn I never feel like im having fun. My life currently just feels like, studying and then I waste my time trying to be entertained. None of these hobbies are satisfactory, fun or fullfilling to me. After those long hours of studying and not achieving my unrealistic goals I go and try to have fun but I never do. I feel like a idiot wasting my time

I want to have fun in life but im not able to do so. That sensation of doing something you enjoy and having fun feels just so out of reach... and everyone else can just have fun but I dont.

" Hey, I hope this is fine here, because I am concerned, confused and worried about a friend. About three years ago, she suffered a psychotic episode because she stayed up for way too long one time - as far as I knew, she had a sleep disorder she had to take meds for, and her family had a history of schizophrenia, so I suppose that's all that was needed.

However, after this, I feel her entire personality has shifted. Her episode warranted her having to seek treatment, which she has gotten a lot better from, but I almost feel like this psychosis never quite ""went away"" so to speak.

Comparatively, she's doing wonders since then - she's taken up learning another language and doing work related to that! She does have an amazing sense of determination when she intends on something.

However, she does have various delusions from time to time, and this is where I lose her. Thankfully they haven't been at the severity or intensity since that episode, but every now and then it seems her mind will focus on a very specific thought and she becomes very agitated with others.

As an example, I stream games as a hobby on the side. She wanted to join in but mentioned to NOT stream one game in particular. Streaming this game, according to her, will lead to me being swatted on stream.

At first I tried to ask questions taking the delusion legitimately - the internet can be really terrible so I thought it was some internet trolls but there isn't some wide mass swatting going on for this game: in fact, it really isn't played that much and if it was, it's getting 5 viewers max based on twitch.

The one thing I've learned is that trying to ration or logic through a delusion can actually be more harmful, so I try to not do that. I don't attempt to dismiss her thoughts but any time I ask, ""What do you mean?"" or ask her to explain it further she gets mad at me, tutting, sighing, and telling me vague things like ""The walls have eyes"" and ""You have much to learn"" She gets mad that I don't simply ""get it"" and that I can't read her mind. When I ask her to tell me what she's thinking (not even trying to judge her thoughts, just trying to know what they even are), she will give a vague statement like above and so I'm more confused, and then my confusion pisses her off.

While this example isn't really hindering me, I'm worried what might happen if she develops specific thoughts that would be damaging to herself or others. Our friendship has deteriorated because it's become impossible to have a discussion; a lot of it is now lecturing me to do certain things based on her paranoia. Any resistance to following along leads to condescension and her yelling, which is probably where my biggest problems lie - after the episode, her aggression has ramped up - while I don't feel like I'm in physical danger, her patience for people ""not getting it"" is non-existent and her response is to yell at them and treat them like they're idiots for it. This is the most frustrating bit for me, because I do have a sensitivity to any yelling coming from an environment like that, so my response due to my own personal shit is to back off. But in backing off, it's literally causing me to keep my distance, because I don't want to get yelled at again.

I suppose what should I do, if I should do anything? Is there something wrong with how I'm approaching her, leading to this? It's hard to begin to understand what she's feeling but I want to try in a way that isn't going to make things worse, which I'm worried I might be doing here. Any insights or thoughts would be much appreciated",5,paranoia

"Hi, so for a little context, my bf is suffering from TB (not the contagious kind) and is on bed rest from the past 1.5 months. In the beginning he thought it was just a normal back pain but later, he found out it's TB. So, yes, because of this we haven't met since March end. A week or two ago, he even asked me ""Since we haven't been meeting and idk when we will, have you ever thought during this time that you should move on"" I was like ""no, this thought never even crossed my mind and it never will"" then he said ""okay, this made me happy"".So, at that time it actually wasn't bothering me as much because we were talking a good amount of time over the phone but now from the past week, he has stopped talking also, we talk for like 20-30 minutes max. throughout the day and this is really making me overthink a lot. I asked him last night why has he been so distant lately (He has been throwing up a lot because of his medications, which is making his body feel weak and he does not feel good because of this) So, he said that he hasn't been distant, he's just not in a great place because of his health, and he doesn't feel like doing anything. Then he said bye, I was like why are you saying bye, he said he doesn't feel like talking (he meant, in general).So, him not talking to me is really bothering me because we have only been together for 4 months now, and in my last relationship, my ex stopped talking to me in bits, like my current bf is doing but the difference is my current bf is sick that is why he is doing it, but the trauma i have because of my ex is making me overthink and question my bf. I am sorry for this long story but I am really in a fucked up place right now and idk what to do. Also, i am scared that he will forget me if he don't talk to me as much as we were before, and then he will breakup. And i honestly don't have it in me to go through another heartbreak.TL;DR - Boyfriend of 4 months isn't talking to me due to his ongoing illness which is making me Anxious and overthink a lot.

"Alright, so for the past few years I've been heavily depressed and I've also got anhedonia (the lack to feel pleasure). Recently it's been getting worse, i:e Suicidal Thoughts becoming more frequent, Unmotivated and even planning out my own ""self-end."" I've always been a night owl, and my sleep schedule is usually like this; I wake up at like 3-5 PM and go to sleep at around 6-8 AM (Yeah, I know it's weird). About 9 months ago, we moved into a house located a small lake. We've been living her ever since and no issues so far, but recently (about a month ago or so) I started hearing odd noises in the night. I went outside one morning at 3AM to give my brother something (he lives in a small flat outside). I then admired the views of the stars a bit and walked around the house. When I got to the front yard, I heard sounds of something screaming in the distance, yet closeby. It clearly sounded like a woman, but far worse. If I had to describe it, it'd be like a demonic woman screaming in a movie or something. And then a few days later, I was in the bathroom one morning also at around 3AM. I heard dogs barking and a howl in the distance. It didn't sound like a dog or anything, since I heard dogs barking. If I had to describe it, it sounded like a ""demonic werewolf"" (if that makes any sense). And since then, I've been hearing this deep, eerie croaking sound every night (when outside). 

And just now, at around 3-4 AM...I went to the kitchen to prepare some food, but as I placed food in my plate; I heard a horrific sound that sounded like a beast/demon thing throwing up (like a metal screech or something). 

My older brother also has more or less the same sleep pattern as me, and everytime I heard a sound...I'd ask him if he heard it or if he could check outside. Each time, he claims to not have heard or see anything. He called me paranoid this morning when I told him about the sound I had just heard. So I don't know, I just hear these very odd, eerie and disturbing sounds at times. I heard them quite loudly and clearly. I don't think I'm crazy, but nobody else hears them. 

Am I being paranoid for no reason, or is something wrong with me? My brother claims that it's ""all of my negativity"" driving me crazy...",5,paranoia
"I am currently in a very deep major depression, . I was okay for a long time but now I am at a point I had already been 15 years ago. I find myself planning how to escape. I know I need help and I was actively trying to, but there are some points that don't work out. I am so tired of trying. I need more meds and I start questioning if a life on meds is worth the struggle.
This morning I already had a panic attack and I cried. And I need to sort my thoughts and give them space so that's why I am here, writing. I did some awareness excercise to calm down amd afterwards I started thinking in circles what a mess this is. It is getting harder to get out of the circling thoughts. And how shall I go for a walk when I can't open the frontdoor to step out? When I try progressive muscle relaxation I find myself all tensed up.
I feel bad for just sitting with a coffee and not being able to do normal stuff, feeling guilty for not being functional. And all I can do is concentrate on breathing. 
And there are the thoughts that everyone around just things I don't want to, not believing that I can't and yes through all this I can't... I additional don't want because it feels exhausting to only think about. I know I can feel better, I know It won't stay like this, I know I have to be patient and accepting and nice to myself, but my whole life experiences work against me and I just want to give up.
Is it okay to just do the absolut minimal things? Is it okay to just sit and stare and cry? 
How do you give yourself a friendly hand, when you hate yourself for being sick? Because all you ever heard is that you are weak not sick. Sometimes it even hurts to breath. I am holding on. But I don't want to. How do others cope with this I can't and I don't want anymore?",2,depression

"[Tw, mentions of suicide and suicidal thoughts] 

I've been like this for almost eight years. Maybe longer. I don't know how far the thoughts go back. The pain. All I remember is one sunny day when I was eight years old. Sports day. The bullying. It all comes back in a rush. My mother didn't attend that day, and I was sitting in the shade of a tree, eating alone. Watching, as everyone ate with parents and friends, smiling and laughing. I remember the feeling in the pit of my stomach.

It was the same feeling when they found my diary that night. When my mom saw the words 'suicide' and 'death' written in bright blue glittery ink. I wonder what she though of me. I still remember the look on her face. I don't think they cared as much as they said they did back then. After all, from there on out, it only got worse.

It never goes away. Never wavering for a second. It's always there in the back of my mind. It's left its mark as scars on my skin and a plauge inside my brain. Why does it have to hurt so bad? And then there's the numbness. I can't tell which ones worse. Feeling nothing, or feeling everything, all together, all at once. 

It keeps me up at night. And it's so hard. So fucking hard to make it to the morning. Blasting songs over my headphones until the sun rises, keeping the meds locked up and the blades hidden. Sometimes I just pace about in the hall, hoping not to wake anyone. I ponder it over and over. If I want this to end, I know I have to end everything all at once. It'll never go away if I don't. I reason with myself that it'll only get worse, like it always does. And I don't want to stick around long enough to see what worse looks like.

I get to writing the notes like I've done so many times before. And then I open the box. I keep my notes. Every one I've ever written. My sister tried to bin them once. Told me that it's what's keeping me sick. That and my dirty room. Those are the causes of my misery. She also tried to sell me a few of her old crystals under the guise that they would 'cure my depression' too so I'm not entirely sure how credible her advice is.

I could never get rid of the box. It means something. It's kept me alive. In there, is every birthday card. Every badge, every note, every plea with the universe, every memory starting from the day I turned 13. Its both a blessing and a curse. But I am a keeper. I keep things. I have folders filled with screenshots of messages my friends have sent me. Some current, some from people in my past. It's a reminder.

You mattered to someone once. Maybe one day, you can matter again. I keep train tickets and notes and all these little unnecessary things. Its a reminder. The sky looked pretty that day. You got a really fuckin good milkshake from the McDonald's at that train station. Your teacher wrote a note home to talk about how amazing she thought you were that one time when you were like, nine. All these things. Just unnecessary little things that I cling to. It's hope.

My hope comes in the form of collected rocks and faded sea glass. Bottle caps and scraps of paper filled with doodles and smiley faces. It comes in the form of pink and green scribbles, courtesy of the artistic talent belonging to my younger siblings, paintings of how it was. Pictures of what it will be. My hope comes in the form of little items that would often be discarded. And I cling to them so desperately. 

It's another one of those nights. The ones where my medication makes everything so much harder. Where all I crave is the end. If I close my eyes I can almost see it. A endless void filled with serenity and dotted with stars, the perfect kind of silence swallowing me whole as I dispute from the body I inhabit. Oh to be free. But then I remember my friend. My siblings. 

Oh what I would give to be able to slip peacefully in my sleep without causing them pain. What I'd give to let go, to end this fight I have no chance of winning. But I won't. Not until I'm sure they don't need me anymore. Not until I know they'll be okay. It's hard. All I want is to be gone. How am I supposed to argue with that? It would make my life so much easier. All I'd have to do, would be to end it. But it wouldn't make theirs easier.

And if it hurts them, then I guess my freedom will have to wait.",2,depression

"I started complete life changes after 2 years of chronic stress and anxiety. Symptoms include 24/7 horrible full head/brain fog feeling like pressure without the headache or pain(main and worst symptom), unrested sleep, and involuntary head twitching that started in December 2022. Stayed in my house pretty much for 2 1/2 years with most symptoms.

Everything was better initially when I started in January 2023. Better mood, more energy, sleeping better, good dreams, just all that good stuff. Early on I did get sad, regretful when I started going out again and realizing how life kept going on while I shut myself in. This passed quickly as I continued my recovery. Now about 4 1/2 months in I am getting hit with extreme low mood, sadness, dread, loss of interest, and feeling as if I haven't slept at all despite getting 7 to 8 hours upon waking. Depression wasn't even a issue before this at all.

"Lately, it seems that the main trigger for my depression is bad sleep, not even sure if it's bad sleep or not. The thing is, it typically happens after I wake up, usually when I wake up and then decide to snooze for some time, then I wake up in a horrible mood and it seems to have all the typical depression symptoms. The bad mood seems to get worse throughout the day time. I usually I'm unable to get any work done and just wait for sleep time to hopefully reset whatever imbalance has happened in this broken brain. Usually after one or two nights things start to align again. I can't think of any triggers for these ""bad sleep"" nights.

"Hello! I have just recently been diagnosed with ADHD (combined type) after trying for forever, and am on no stimulants but am on zoloft for depression. my apologies for the rambling!!

my psychiatrist just prescribed me abilify to take with my zoloft as my depression isn’t improving as it should be. i just tried wellbutrin but it made me tremor and twitch and super anxious and just terrible 

i know that my depression symptoms are worsening because i don’t have proper medication or care for my adhd and i’m so frustrated over myself because of it. i feel like i can’t do anything, and my mom doesn’t entirely understand so she doesn’t really help. my psychiatrist wants my depression to get better before trying any sort of adhd care but the “always tired, racing thoughts, bored/ can’t hold an interest” and “staying up at night or sleeping in too much” is because i don’t have proper treatment for adhd.

anytime i suggest i might need to try a stimulant she always shuts me down and tells me we have to take care of the depression first, but i just *know* it’ll be better if i have something for my adhd. 

we meet again in 2 weeks (she’s giving me time to try abilify) and i’m going to try suggesting it again just because i’m tired of being this way.

Like so many who carry this burden I struggle to find meaning or any kind of basic enjoyment. Staying busy helps. Spent most of my youth building a career for myself and moving place to place. No real connections and no desire to build them, until I got older. Eventually I bought a home. Didn't even need a mortgage. I feel as empty as I am successful. It's never enough. Lost touch with everyone I've ever known as I struggle to relate with anyone. It took a long time for me to stop hating myself but, I feel like I'm simply waiting to die.

"Im going to try to keep this as comprehensive and to the point as possible. I dont feel loved by anyone, and i oftentimes question why i continue to live. It has costed me several jobs and my sanity when i came to realize the most important aspect to life is about love, and even though i had my heart completely broken by someone who i thought loved me but actually betrayed me, i still have the innate desire to find someone who completes me. i know that love must come from within before you can love another, i just feel so distraught because my partner who i was smitten with betrayed me, then spreaded gossip about me to further shame me and my reputation. that alone id think would drive anyone crazy, but on top of that, my own family has been mentally abusing me for years, and im just starting to understand why i am the way i am. they told me I was being abusive, when in reality i was gaslit, and now i feel so depressed and alone. my brother is a piece of shit addict who keeps lying, stealing, and backstabbing me, but i try to continue to help him in spite of that because i love him so much. at this point i realized that if i stayed, it will only drag me down more, but inside, i know that if i left or my family left, hed be dead within a few weeks, which compels me to stay to help at the cost of my mental well-being.  


tl;dr: I grew up in a dysfunctional and hostile household. non-biological grandfather was an abusive alcoholic who manipulated people for a living, and did so to my grandmother, who in my mind, was the most selfless and beautiful person i met, because she made me feel like she actually loved and cared for me(unlike my own mother), but she got cancer, and i watched her die in the worst way possible. after her death, said grandfather basically stole my familys inheritance, and my mom, brother and i were left with very little even though it wasnt his right to take. my house was financed by my actual biological grandfather, who by comparison, was highly intelligent and caring. he died of cancer at age 32, so my grandmother being in a vulnerable state, made the mistake of marrying that piece of shit... he ended up dying not too long ago, a couple years after my grandmothers death. after that background, i was very likely cheated on, and used by the woman i thought loved me. my brother overdosed 2 times, and i saved his life both times while he continues to steal from me and berate me. my family betrayed me by not being there for me to show emotional support or love, and theres a specific incident in mind that id rather not share online, but it did happen, and basically my mother refused to tell people the truth of what happened because she was selfishly afraid, so instead of telling  people the truth, she pretended she didnt know what i was talking about, and i made myself look crazy and stupid. my fathers been dead since i was 11, and i still remember the cryptic and depressing things he said before he died. my uncle is probably the only person who shows love, but even then i feel like he thinks im some kinda joke since im not independent yet, even though im on the cusp of it. theres many other examples of emotional trauma that i went through but it would be pages long. in short, it feels like no one in my life truly loves or cares about me, and it makes me question the point of living in itself. I know that i deserved some of the bad things that happened to me, because i realized how toxic i was BEFORE, but that doesnt mean that i am NOW. i learned. not saying im suicidal, im just saying that the pain my past and current situation has created has been overwhelming, and im just expected to ""man up""... WHATS THE FUCKING POINT IF I HAVE NO ONE TO LOVE OR LOVE ME?! seems like society is mentally abusing the fuck out of men, because apparently women are never wrong in america, and if youre failing at life, then the whole world will ruthlessly scorn, judge and shame you over things that you feel like are outside your realm of control.",2,depression

after I got into terrible debt, I started to become frivolous. thus I lost clients and now I have two lawsuits in court with two different clients, because I did not respect the delivery deadlines.

Every single time I start a new job or new studies, on the first day I arrive super organised, carefully dressed and combed, my skin glowing, and a nice little make up on; all my lunch boxes and outfits are done for the week, my home is in order, and I have a fancy new notebook and take neat notes. But everyday after that, my structure falls apart a bit more. A week or two later, I go to school (it's worth mentioning I'm changing careers) unshowered, with greasy hair, nothing to eat for lunch, my smoking habit back, dressed like a coat rack,  my notebook looking full of doodles and scribblings, because I can't keep up, and shores piling up at home. I get burned out for running around in transportations (I study in Paris, and the tube is particularly grim, and there's a lot of corridors, few Escalators and a gazillion people, which makes it even more exhausting. This morning when I saw my gigantic pile of dirty dishes, I cried out of despair, and guilt for not being able to cope with what other commuters can deal with everyday, and with some with kids to take care of on top of it. Everyday I want to call in sick just so I don't have to run and can catch up with my shores. Even though I love what I'm studying. Commuting really drains the shit out of me and makes me feel like a failure. Therefore I'm looking for some advice, and, -I admit- some sympathy, people who can relate. Thank you ❤",3,adhd

"I have been suffering for over three years from back pain and belly fullness. My belly becomes extremely bloated visually. But I don't have any symptoms of bloating.

"After lamenting about my lack of drive to a friend for a bit too long, they just plainly asked me, “Well what is it that you actually want?”

It stumped me. 

I don’t really “want” anything. I avoid discomfort, try to extend time in bed as long as possible, use my phone for 14 hours a day, etc. But it’s not really that I want to do those things, they are just reflexive. I’m just in so much pain and I’m so exhausted I need to retreat - constantly. 

Do I want friends? Hobbies? A job that I love? 

I mean of course I do in theory, in concept. When I actually imagine having those things, or attempt to conjure some kind of spark of interest, there’s nothing there. It’s just a dark, cold, cavernous pit in my chest. In THOSE moments I can definitely tell you what I want - I want to go to sleep. 

I have no vision of my future. I barely make it out of bed each morning. I keep putting one foot in front of the other, but sometimes I need to ask, “Why?” and the silence is crippling, I have no response. 

Does anyone have any advice? How do you feel connected with your desires again? What do I do?

Thanks for listening.",2,depression
"I am 29 F and honestly I get way too nervous to date that it’s caused me to isolate myself big time. 
I have tried the dating apps and usually as soon as I match with someone I get too nervous to even talk to them or don’t know what to say (I HATE small talk) & then the idea of dating and getting to know someone also makes me cringe. The whole small talk thing is just so awkward. If they’re not outgoing the convo is usually a dead end to be honest. 
I don’t leave the house other than for work. & won’t date anyone from work. 
Sometimes I get super sad to think about how alone I really am. & to be honest I don’t think I’ll find anyone that loves me even if I tried. 
I wish I could just like meet someone like every other girl or actually meet someone from an app.. actually have conversations with people and make them fall in love with me instead of being so fucking weird and awkward.

"Hi, all! Long time lurker here. I was formally diagnosed with anxiety 6 years ago. Had it through high school, college, and my previous jobs. Currently, I'm on my third job at a bank and it has been the best employment I ever had so far. The pay, benefits, and workmates are all great. It has been 6 months since I started, but I have been failing and experiencing a lot of small mishaps due to my anxiety.

Everytime I have a bit of inconvenience, I have a small outburst of frustration, anxious during my daily tasks, and just on the verge of having a mental breakdown at my desk. Having my manager sit beside me does not help either, and I get berated over the smallest mistakes. I took a sick leave today for my mental health, and all I got was a bombardment of questions from my boss regarding the reports I submitted and got even told that we would have a 1-on1 talk tomorrow, so my mental health day off wasn't utilized properly enough.

I am starting to doubt myself if I can keep this up or whether I have to transfer to a different job with a fitting environment for my mental condition and forte. That is all. Thank you for taking the time to read my venting out.",4,anxiety

It thinks that, because of karma, that spirits will kill me in 2 weeks because of my wrongdoings and I’m getting really worried about this.

How do I get rid of thoughts like these?",5,paranoia
"24 F.
I’m gonna try and keep this short. 
First of all I don’t know if I’m autistic or not. I had part of an autism assessment with a psychiatrist today but had some technical difficulties so it was cut short and they want me to do another appointment at the end of the week. At the end of the appointment they said they are not sure I meet the threshold for autism but have some similarities so they want to talk more. 

To be honest I’m not 100% sure myself if I have autism. And I don’t have a problem being diagnosed, I actually want to know for sure!
I can relate to some things but totally can’t relate to other things. It was actually my elder sister’s idea that I get an assessment as she feels i’ve exhibited  autistic traits since childhood and autism/adhd runs in the family. However some of my family members think I’m not autistic and just have lack of confidence, anxiety issues and say I’ve been coddled by mother too much. So it’s very confusing for me. 

The reasons I think I could be autistic:

I did not speak as a young child except to my mother, when I started infant school age 5 teachers were concerned because I wasn’t engaging and I wasn’t making friends. Eventually I did make a friend thanks to help of my mother. When I started secondary school I managed to make a couple friends and then was suddenly introduced to a group of friends. I never kept in touch with friends from school though and I never felt that close to them. It was almost like we were just acquaintances more than friends. I was bullied at the end of high school by one of the ‘friends’ in the group and then I just distanced myself from everyone and became a loner. Still in adulthood I have a heard time talking to people, I get super anxious and feeling like I can’t get the words out. I am not very social with family members, I feel like an outcast, I don’t know what to say or how to engage. I was diagnosed with social anxiety when I was 18 and tried CBT therapy but that didn’t really work. I’ve been on different antidepressants and they also haven’t helped for the anxiety. My anxiety has gotten to the point I find it hard to leave the house by myself, I don’t go anywhere unless accompanied by my mother, I don’t take public transport anymore because I get anxious and worried about not finding my way around. I don’t have friends or a social life.

I failed in school. I was in the lower sets for all of my classes. Again I found it hard to engage or ask for help. I feel like classroom environments, the noise, distractions, constantly observing myself and trying to fit in made it hard for me to focus. I pretty much remember day dreaming and zoning out in all my lessons and wasn’t able to process or take in what the teachers were saying. I had some support from a supply teacher but it was never 1 on 1 so it wasn’t that helpful. 

I enjoy alone time, I prefer being at home on my own or with my mum. 
After socialisation I need alone time to recoup. In some social settings I will even try to remove myself by leaving early or going to a more quiet place away from others. 

I did not enjoy school, hated getting up in the mornings and still do. My mum used to bribe me into school with food or saying she’ll treat me afterwards. I never had tantrums or anything I would just look grumpy and be cold in mood. 

I enjoyed some imaginary games with friends as a kid, I feel like this was because there was less pressure to be social if that makes any sense?
I also preferred games were there wasn’t a need for much communication involved. 

Sometimes when there’s loud noises or if someone next to me is taking loud I cover my ears with my hands instead of asking people if they can talk quieter. 

I have found it hard to keep a job. The longest was a week. My last job was night shifts at a warehouse, I purposely chose night shifts hoping there would be less people but I don’t think that made a difference. After 3 10 hour shifts I quit. I physically felt unable to keep up with demands and was falling behind. I did enjoy elements of the job and if I were able to only do those things and not the others, I probably would’ve stayed longer. I also always feel a pressure to make friends with colleagues and don’t want to be left out. I feel like I’m the target of bullying or judgement if I don’t make friends. I don’t know why it’s such an important thing for me to make friends and be liked at work. I guess it makes it more enjoyable for me. 

Reasons I think I might not be autistic: 

I have never had / have no special interests or obsessions. When I told the psychiatrist this I could tell they were taken back and probably expected me to at least have 1. 

I don’t have any attachments to physical/material things. Apart from my phone and tablet, but that’s common in this generation right? Using my phone and tablet is my hobby I guess you could say. 
If anything, I would probably say I’d get more attached to people than to things. For instance I’ve always had a close bond and attachment to my mother, I stayed friends with the same person from primary school into secondary school because it felt familiar and safe. Age 5 I had the same friend till adulthood. 

I have never had / don’t have emotional outbursts. I hold my emotions in and then have a meltdown when I’m by myself in my home. 

I don’t think I have many sensory issues. Strong / bad smells are main ones but again that’s ‘normal’ right?

I don’t have picky or disordered eating. I’ve always enjoyed various foods. 

I feel pretty good at telling how someone is thinking or feeling by tone of voice, body language, behaviour. 

I get sarcasm mostly. 

PS. There’s so much more I could go into but I wont lol. 

I mean if I don’t get the diagnosis, what do I do? Do I accept that I’m not autistic? Should I still say that I am because I can sort of relate? Do I seek another diagnosis?",1,autism
"Something broke inside of me on Monday. A dam I've kept up for years and suddenly I have to come to terms with how much of a loser I am at 35. No job. No feasible education. Fat. And a decade old romantic relationship gone. 

Oh also in debt. It's not huge debt, but It's there and affecting my credit score. And I can't change it until I get a job. Which I've applied for but no calls so far. My resume probably sucked. 

But it's hard to be this functional. Or dysfunctional. Saying jokes. Laughing at things. But inside I can't breathe. All I think is death. I can't go to the gym. I don't deserve to do things I enjoy. Because I'm a filthy loser. An important loser to some people so I can't die. I can't do the undoable but i wish I could. 

I can't eat either. I have the opposite of a binge eating disorder. Food feels wrong. It feels undeserved. Every time I eat something I want to vomit it back up because I don't want nourishment. I want to die. I'm getting physical pains throughout now because I'm so tense. How I wish I was somehow somebody else. Is this the dark side of the soul? 

Feeling the shame I have inside me feels like cutting my insides with a razor. I haven't bitten off all my nails so I can't be that bad. I smile and I act empathetic to distract me from the tearing sting of existing in a body that I have failed repeatedly. People that I've failed repeatedly. Someone I never became. Someone who hyperventilates at will. Quietly. And wonders if it will show up on my fitness watch. Some proof of the darkness filled with scathing flames of pain.

"Hi I'm new to this subreddit but I need help I'm not even sure what to do but I just need to talk I guess, context first I'm 14 years old and all of this started (or at least started affecting my life) about a year and a half ago. I'm scared all the time, no I'm not being dramatic but I really am never calm my memory isn't very good honestly I think I'm getting dumber to my memories deterating I'm scared and sometimes I just can't understand text or people when there explaining complex things I could have before anyways back to the memory problems I can't even rember how I was before I know I wasnt like this but I can't rember not being so terrified [SORRY FOR LONG POST IN ADVANCE]

I have nothing to hide but when someone's behind me while I'm on my phone I panic I could be playing a normal game or just reading and I want to cry because someone can SEE, I can't talk about the music I like or the shows/games I enjoy without feeling like I'm going to puke for the entire day I can't be by myself because I feel like something if someones there but I can't be around people without feeling like they can read my mind? Or I'm actually thinking out loud but somehow I don't hear it which I know is impossible but I still feel that way, because of this I have a really bad habit of biting down on my tongue every single day all day I'm biting down on my tongue and puasing before I talk because what if I don't say what I meant to or just start screaming or something? Which couldn't happen I know but I still feel like it
I can't post things or like things or even watch things on my phone because I get scared somehow I'm going to send it to my contacts or I'm broadcasting it to everyone around me or someone's constantly watching me through my phone/computer or what's on my phone/computer even writing this post is hard.

If someone touches me I scream even if I know there going to do it, but when I touch someone I'm fine? Someone walks fast behind me on the stairs I start running and I panic, someone walks into the same room as me and I scream, someone sleeping in the same room as me? No just no I feel like I'm going to puke and scream or cry or just all three at once my whole life has been affected. I've tried talking to my brother sense where really close but I don't think he really understands, I can't write in my journal because my mom READS. EVERYTHING. And I know that for a fact she's admitted to it, I think that started it when I found out she was going through my things I am never alone it's like she knows everything she hears everything she see everything and there nothing I can do about it I'm alone I'm helpless I hate that feeling I can't even talk to my therapist because she's friends with my mom I know she legally can't tell her anything but everytime I try to talk I freeze up and I just can't. Please I need help I don't know whats wrong with me what do I do about this please I feel like I'm dying like I'm decompossing everyday it's so hard everything is so hard all I do is go to school, eat, lay down, eat, sleep, go to school but I'm not happy Im scared so scared and everything feels so REAL to real when I stressed I just imagine things, dumb scenarios stuff like that but none of that is real and no of those make believe people are real and I'll never have that I'll never have anything because I am messed up and I'll probably always be and I'm just getting worse I know I am but no one cares I just want someone to ask if I'm okay I just want someone to hold me and for me to not be scared I want to be content I'm sorry for the rambling I got of track sorry just idk I don't know",5,paranoia

Ive slowly noticed the joy disappear from my life and ability to enjoy things diminish. I used to be able to pretend like everything was fine and put on the cheerful front like nothing was wrong. Now when im out and around people, i feel hollow, speaking hollow words. 

I accidentally got pregnant earlier this year, and had the abortion several weeks ago. My boyfriend had been supportive throughout, but recently we got into a huge fight, because he thinks the relationship is extremely one sided. I dont blame him, i know it has been. I realise finally that it is due to my depression that i havent had the capacity to give what he needs, but i dont want to lose him. He told me he needs space and time, but i want him to understand where all of this is coming from from my point of view.

"(warning for very brief mention of US political events; transphobia)
A big part of my anxiety has always been that I convince myself that something is a massive issue when it really isn't, so coping with that has meant a lot of just taking the time to reassess the situation and realize that I'm not in danger.
So what am I supposed to do when something actually is a problem? 
I dealt with this issue when covid first started, and I'm dealing with it now as a trans teen in the US. I'm medicated now and it's definitely helped a little, but things are still bad. How do I keep my anxiety from becoming debilitating when I can't just reason my way out of it? How do I look a situation in the face and acknowledge that it is shit and then just keep going? If anyone has any advice please share because I've been struggling pretty bad lately. I seem to swing between overwhelming panic when I acknowledge the situation or feeling fine and just ignoring it completely. Neither are sustainable, is there anything I can do?",4,anxiety

"This is really one of the few only communities i feel comfortable posting this in; I've been suffering a lot, I've sacrificed my own mental health for these past few years to be a genuinely good person. I helped local homeless people by giving them a safe place to stay, do laundry, eat food, give them a contact for applying, etc and i've begun to realize the help ive done is negligible, none of them have I substantially changed their lives for the better, and in rare cases there are people that take advantage of my kindness and charity. I have taken in local feral kittens as a foster parent, but it hasnt reduced the overpopulation of cats, and the people who feed them. I have helped run a political organization, i networked and made other contacts, i wrote theory and did commissions so our org would get sponsers, only for it all to fall in on itself as other leadership fell into dogma and ideological division. I have made a nice community of friends online, but I have made even more enemies because of my convictions, untop of that as cool as internet friends are, by all intense and purposes, irl i am a hermit, i have no real friends near me, and it has made me feel emotionally isolated. My mental health doesnt get better whether im online or offline, and psychiatrists have betrayed my trust, choosing to target the voices i hear, even though they helped my mental health, rather than targeting my anxiety, anger issues, depression, insomnia, and nihilistic thoughts. Everything in my life has also just gotten worse, I'm extremely poor, and even worse now as my food stamps dropped. I have neurological conditions that are progressively getting worse, which has led me to applying for disability.

Also the enemies i have developed, were all once longstanding friends i used to have, who built trust up overtime, which id difficult with my bpd and other prior betrayals of trust, but many still betrayed me to stand with my former abusers, because they didnt like my backlash to him. They also have gaslighted me, minimized my issues as being online too much, even though im the only person in the community who has repeatedly left the internet for extended periods of time. Also many have started lying about me, and calling into question the validity of my neurodivergency, my past traumas, my grandfather being anishinaabe, my disabilities, and even my queer identity. And to top it all off, because of my constant excommunication from leftist communities, and my low economic standing, theyve been able to do more for others than i have, even though i put more of my energy into it, which its good, except because of that, theyve been holding that over my head as well. They have done a lot to stain my image, and have made this a constant topic, simply to use me as a lolcow.

"26M: I think I'm pretty high functioning - I have a well-paying, stable job, good habits (sleep well and work out daily), eat healthy, etc. Yet despite these I feel like I'm never happy. I think one of my biggest problems right now is just a lack of feeling any sort of emotion at all. As an example, before when I would go on vacation to new places, or see family/friends after not seeing them for a long time, I used to get an excited feeling. I used to be genuinely happy/joyous doing these things. But now everything is just so whatever - its like I know how I *should* feel in these situations, but I just *don't*. I don't know if my emotions are suppressed, or just gone, or what. A lot of times after work I come home and lie in bed watching Youtube for hours together until its time to go to sleep. I don't think I have any serious thoughts about suicide, but I can't say it hasn't crossed my mind once or twice (although I don't think I could ever act on it). Additionally when I'm talking with anyone (friends, families, coworkers), I struggle to empathize with them. I remember when I was younger when someone told me something sad, I would feel sad with them. Now I don't feel that anymore. Again, I know how I *should* feel, so I can fake it, but I get the feeling it comes off as inauthentic and fake. And then I get mad at myself for that, which in turn makes me feel upset. I also have bad anxiety and often find myself obsessing over and thinking about inconsequential things, especially in social situations. But contrary to most other people, I don't feel any physical symptoms? (maybe my muscles tightening?), but I don't feel my heart racing or out of breath or any of that. Idk what's going on, but the whole thing has just had me really down for the past couple of years. It's like a switch flipped in my brain and I've just lost all emotion, energy, and enjoyment in life. Can anyone relate?",2,depression

"For context I’m 30 and I am trying to go back to school to become a nurse cuz I made a bunch of decisions that didn’t pan out and I’m broke and having a quarter life crisis.

I’m really mentally ill and I just got out of a really abusive relationship so I’m all fucked up inside and out.

I’m old and I just want to enjoy my life but I can’t because 20+ year old me made a bunch of stupid and uninformed decisions and I ruined my entire life and I hate myself for it everyday.

Now I have to study things I don’t care about like Chemistry and Statistics and once I get those done (and if I pass) I’ll have to move to Ohio for 15 months and do even more school which I hate the thought of too in hopes that I can become a nurse and make a living so that I won’t have to rely on my abusive parents for help.

What is the point of it all? I just want to give up. Working is miserable. Life is miserable. Nobody cares. Everything costs too much.

"I’m not talking about the voices that we are here for the negative “ inner monologue” that people tell us that we are hear, I’m not talking about our own view of our self worth. I’m talking about literally other people in the external world looking at us and watching us and harshly judging and criticising. Absolutely everything in anything we do, when they very well know but they’re commenting and judging a person going through what we go through! I mean it’s like the people that deliberately mess with someone’s head, just because they think it’s fun! To me that is more sickening that absolutely anything to induce a traumatic episode and experience, for someone is to literally put them through harm worse than any physical harm in my opinion. Because that physical wound you can heal from, but that mental wound is something that someone either cannot recover from, or it has to try incredibly hard to even come to terms with recovering. Anyone who knows anyone else has a diagnosis of schizophrenia and knowingly pokes find them and judges them is worse than any scumbag out there in my opinion. Because they are just trying to make anyone feel bad and project, their own insecurities there, too afraid to face in themselves. that’s cowardice. Anyway, I know it’s not just in my hair because I literally have voice recordings of my neighbours are looking at me and point to me and judging me for my diagnosis. And that’s a family too, encouraging the entire of their own family to poke and prod at me. I don’t know what’s happening to the world, but sometimes it feels like I’m in an ultimate reality.

So I’ve been severely depress before but it all kind of faded away when I started realizing how stupid it felt for me to hold my own self back from living life. I’ve hurt myself before but only when I was really low in life. But I’ve been fine for almost a year and then all of a sudden after reading a chapter in a book about abuse I felt like I was dying and couldn’t breathe and then passed out and my blood pressure dropped pretty low. Ever since all I can think about is hurting my self again. I don’t feel depressed like how I was before I feel fine and only sometimes feel like my body is not my own. But these thoughts about mutilating myself and doing awful things to myself are in my mind on loop. It was especially intensified after I started talking to this guy I really like. Thoughts like committing suicide together and or being hurt by him or vise versus roam my head. I don’t know how to feel or what to do about these thoughts. I just think them but I don’t think anything of it until recently. Now I feel like I might actually try something. But I’m not scared. Maybe it’s because I’ve hurt myself already and I remember the burning I felt. Maybe I’m just crazy. I decided to post this here because I was diagnosed with pretty bad anxiety and have been taking meds but I don’t really feel different. I just figured maybe I was stressed.,4,anxiety
I am so tired of being treated as if I'm less than others. I hate how I'm talked down on and seen as a joke. I hate being talked to the way you would talk to a dog. I'm so embarrassed. Everything I do embarrasses me. I wonder what I have done to deserve this. I wouldn't be typing this if I hadn't seen someone I used to know. I wonder how it was so coincidental that I was parked next to them. As soon as they got out of there car my heart dropped to my stomach. When they got back to their car they took a picture right Infront of the window I was sitting by. They were happy and smiling with a friend. While I sat there like a loser with no one. I have no friends. They could try to fight me and then convince everyone I did something wrong. I feel like a joke and an idiot. Why did I have to see them today in the spot I chose. How can you treat someone like that and then not care. Why am I the one who is embarrassed. One minute everyone's calling her a whore and the next they are all siding with her. They don't even know me how can people who don't know me treat me so shitty.,4,anxiety

"Good evening everyone, I don’t know where to start.

I can’t do this anymore.

Long story short, I have social anxiety and I always overthink.

I am a college student in a business school (I finish in a year) and I have 0 friends.

What I’m about to describe always happens to me ever since high school but today I’m just wondering why this keeps happening to me.

We often have teamwork during classes. When I’m in teams with other students, I feel very uncomfortable, especially around girls my age. I don’t come from a nice background and I feel so fucking worthless in front of these people. They all seem to be doing better than me in every spheres of life and that directly affects me. When we do group work, I have a hard time speaking up because I feel so uncomfortable around them and I feel like I can’t speak. I kid you not I panic so much i can’t talk.

Then when i do talk, I’m not even joking people ignore me and don’t even make eye contact, as if I were a ghost. I am never acknowledged and seen by people and it really is hurting my mental health. Can you imagine the courage it takes for me to speak up and then be fucking ignored by 4 people?

Whenever I’m in class i can’t concentrate as my mind is always thinking about how ugly and how useless and inferior i am to the rest of these people. 

I feel like a loser whenever I’m in class. I feel worthless. I feel that all these other students are far better than me in every aspects of life. And they probably are. They’re all good looking people while I’m the most ugliest guy out there (I’m 23 y/o and still never had a gf, it’s a me issue at this point). 

I really want to get a girlfriend who will be there by me and from who I’ll learn things and possibly improve my wellbeing. I just want to have a shoulder on which I can rest my heavy head.

I just can’t no more guys.

Idk what’s so bad about me that people feel disgusted about to treat me in such a way.

I’m often tired and when I do feel energized, I get totally overwhelmed by the way people treat me. I see all these other students talking with other students they never met, smiling and laughing and no soul even dares to ask me my pathetic name.

Wishing the best to the rest of you all.

"That's my motto rn. I feel as if I'm about to combust mentally, but I'm totally fine. Everything is fine. I told myself to just get up and start doing something anything in life. I feel stagnate but it's my own fault. All you have to depend on is urself. I'm tired of dealing with myself. All the mental gymnastics all the thoughts all the breakdowns. I'm exhausting. 

So I'm gonna try my best to not wallow or drown in the gloom and actually do something worthwhile. I know it's not like I wanted to be a giant failure at 21 then proceded to accomplish it, but nor did I take the proper actions to keep myself from careening off a cliff. So I'm gonna try for the umpteenth time to fix what I have left in this life. Either that or one day I figure I'm too tired too keep myself from doing something I won't live to regret. 

It's all good got hella energy until I get up to actually do something then I'm immediately exhausted. Life's just like that though for me anyway. I hope there is no afterlife cause I don't think I could or want to live again while dead. That would be pretty ironic to live in torment already just to get fed up, unalive urself just to wake up in hell after death.",2,depression

Until then I sit and hide. Imagine you had a drone following you around 24/7 and everyone you know is watching you through it. You wouldn't be able to think huh? Ultimately I just want to be free to do the things that I want without fear of criticism or attacks. I'd like to learn something new, work out and improve my life but can't. I need to be alone to do things. It feels like I'm constantly being looked down upon so I never take the steps to improve my situation, and I'd not like to be seen as an idiot so I don't even try.",5,paranoia

Hi I'm an 18 year  old Indian guy  First of all if you are reading this and even if you don't respond I thank you as you might be going through an even greater pain compared to me. I'm about to finish high school and it is truly a crucial point in my life as My further education and my career relies upon this year's academic performance the exams were   to be held in two semesters I fucked up the first one even though I believe I gave it my all and there's extremely fragile hope that I could go  for thee second semester considering the pandemic as the as it is to be conducted through online platform and the scores would be just taken primarily from the first semester as it was offline the thing is I cannot concentrate on my studies as my whole family has got covid though I moved out of town for education my mom and sisters were with me and we were safe  my mom had to move back as my whole family has got covid except me and my sister I havee noticed hairfall a couple of months ago and I got really paranoiad about it I even visited a derm and they prescribed mintop some vitamins and another lotion  but my parents wouldn't let me take it as they are a bit misinformed i know that topical min does nat have any side effects two my cousins have almost lost their hairs i have been post ing in every sub related to hair loss but I realized it's  not going  worsen it i cant even keep track of my hairall everyime theres a little sensation on my head or my face or head it gives  me the impression that  I'm losing great amout of hair and i cant even see my hair they are naturally thin and are probably thinning out more now a part of me is ready to embrace baldness but somewhere Im scared that its happening so fast. I have always been an envious individual im insecure and jealous of others my father is a very hardworking guy I regret neverr being able to help  him in the store mom and dad never aspired anything from me they kept it to themselves i believe they don't want to put pressure on me  and so does the  rest of my family they have satisfied my requirements in materialistic manners  but I feel like my father didn't understand me emotionally he wouldn't let me do what my peers did at different stages of their life which sometimes makes me feel very upset I cried myself to sleep because I felt lonely but the fact that makes me feel even more disgusted and sucidal towards myself is that at hard times like these where the health of my loved ones is at risk I could only think about my self and this stupid hair loss I have no sense of my duties im just worthless trash,5,paranoia

My grades are doing awful because I kept procrastinating and struggled to keep up with work. My motivation is so low it feels impossible to get started. Today I tried to finish a project today removing my phone so I won’t get distracted and sat near my teacher to stay on task. I just sat there for an hour struggling to do something. I could not focus at all my mind was going back and forth between reality and daydreaming. I kept moving and messing with my hair desperately wanting to do something but just couldn’t. It’s bad enough my mom is on my back about this. She says she’s willing to do anything so I won’t stress her out about school anymore but she won’t let me on medication.

"I isolated myself from society because I want to recover and finally give me some time for my mental health. My doctor thinks I'm bipolar, so we're working to hopefully have a diagnosis of my case (28y now, have been dealing with severe depression since my early teens, and have been through a lot of traumatic situations and drug addiction)

Now I've been sober for 1month, but isolating from social apps was a decision that had to be made, so I usually don't go outside unless necessary, and the only people I socialize with are my parents, and a couple of friends like once a week.

I know it's a process, a very long process, but it's inevitable to feel pathetic, alone, miserable. I don't have a job because of agoraphobia, and a lot of mood swings. My friends are busy with their life and also dealing their own wars. To cope with all this, I've been taking antidepressives, mood stabilizers, and Clonazepam for panic attacks.

I don't know anymore, I just needed to vent, these years have been the roughest of my life. I apologize if my English may be confusing sometimes, not my native language. I also apologize if what I wrote doesn't have a very good narrative, I'm kinda threwing up my feelings.

"I'm so close to just giving up on life no matter what I do things just keep getting worse, I'm trying to stay positive I really am and I'm doing things to help me cope and feel better but nothings working or even when I get to a spot in my life where everything is alright and stuff sucks alot less than usually its like my life doesn't want that for me or maybe it's karma or something..

but it feels like I'm climbing a mountain and when I get to an area where I can take a break life just pushes me down that mountain. People see me at the bottom and say ""keep going its not even that hard"" or will assume I'm not even trying but in reality I've been trying to climb this long everlasting mountain for years and I keep ending up at the starting point... Maybe one could say ""just leave the mountain alone if that keeps on happening"" but I have to climb this mountain if I stop trying I'll die and I want that of course, obviously I want the easy way out but some STUPID part of me says ""we've been doing this for awhile now we have to keep going... we have to..""

"Fairly isolated due to the shitty mental health system of California. Currently institutionalized and medicated with haliperidol injection.

I have no idea how much pain I'm causing others, but I am afraid people are having to relive large portions of their lives every time I lie down or sleep, as nonsensical as that sounds. Or that they are restarting their whole day after each word they say to me. 

It's too late for me to find love - I think all I'm supposed to do now is be miserable until I literally run away from this place.

The awkwardness coupled with a lack of any noticeable redeeming qualities means I don't really know what to do with myself. There is no point left to live (if what I'm doing can be called living). What good is it to live with nothing left to give (Coldplay)?

It's especially bad when I go outside, I feel my heart beating so fast and can barely catch my breath, I am so afraid. I make eye contact with other people, but only for a split second to try and see their intentions. If it looks like they are going to walk too close to me, or worse still brush past me and touch me, I will honestly cross the road. I do this multiple times in every journey, to the point where I think I must look like a lunatic. 

If somebody has to cross my path and walk behind me, I will turn my neck and follow them to make sure they don't come too close. 

Plus, I feel like nearly everyone is watching me. As in, when I walk past another person they will turn their head and look at me, I never know why and it just makes me even more uncomfortable than I already am. It's like they can see into my mind and know how scared I am.

"Hello all,

I’m not a part of this sub, but I’m here because I don’t know what other sub I can talk to about this issue. My mother in law is an amazing woman, I love her, she’s always gone above and beyond for her son, me and our 3 kids. The past couple of years she’s been talking about people watching her from electronic devices. She refuses to share Wi-Fi passwords with people, even us and when we bought her a smart tv, she put it in storage because she swore someone was watching her. She has two phones, an iPhone and a flip phone. She mainly uses the flip phone with a bandaid covering the camera. She leaves her iPhone in the garage most of the time. We figured that it’s probably just her not knowing how electronics work, but today she said something that truly worried me. 

She said that she went out to eat at a restaurant the other day and she usually leaves her purse with her iPhone at the table with her husband while she goes to the bathroom. This time she forgot and took her purse with her. When she noticed she took her purse, she decided to leave it in another stall while she went to another to use the toilet. I told her if she has her phone in her purse no one can see her, she said that they can see through her purse! 

We (my husband, i and her husband) have tried talking to her and explaining that no one is watching her, but she insists that God told her they are. I’m scared of leaving my children with her now. What if she starts to think they are sick and gives them medicine that they shouldn’t have? Which is something she did once. 

She’s never gone to the doctor for this, she refuses to, but my husband thinks the medications she takes daily are causing her to be schizophrenic. What can I do to help her? I don’t want to have to keep her from being alone with my kids, they love her so much.",5,paranoia

I'm having incredible anxiety now about this ruining my favorite hoodie.

"Ever since taking a few acid trips I started feeling like people are going to kidnap me when I’m in groups of people I don’t know.

"I am struggling to communicate ADHD to my partner

I’ve been struggling with this for a while now but it doesn’t seem like I can do anything at the right quality or speed to help. My gf and I have been together for 5 years and recently moved in together last year. Over the last year my gf and I have had what I consider to be pretty normal disagreements about cleanliness and chores divided. She has much higher standards than I do which I have tried to meet but we have an argument once a month where she says she feels like I’m ignoring chores until she just has to do them. 

Yesterday we talked again and she said that she expected me to improve more than I have in the last year. I keep telling her I will try to change my system to help me achieve what I need to but she told me not to try but to just do it. I feel like all I have every been able to do is try. I feel like I have been taking on half and have been getting better at cleaning to her requirements. (for example: we split dinner prep and cleaning and a year ago I didn’t consider wiping down all the counters and table part of cleaning up after dinner but I do now) I can definitely get the tunnel vision. She has insisted that she doesn’t want to nag me and I don’t want to make extra work for her by her nagging me but I’m struggling to meet this expectation. 

I have tried a few systems to try to clean different parts of the house on a schedule but it doesn’t always work for me because sometimes I run out of time after work or I’m so tired I get distracted in the middle of the chore and it doesn’t get done. She always tells me I should just listen and not make her repeat herself. 

I struggle to communicate that I have been trying. I asked her last night if there was a way that going forward we could discuss these issues positively when I’m obviously trying but not hitting the mark. For example if I sweep but forget to get under the couch, she could say “I appreciate you sweeping but I noticed that you might have forgotten about under the couch.” She said this creates more work for her and she doesn’t want that. I’m struggling to find a system that will work for us and not make me feel like I’m failing until I achieve perfection. 

We have a dog that causes some dirt/dander and I bought a Roomba to compensate but she won’t let me automate the Roomba routine because she works from home and it constantly goes off in the mornings during her meeting when I leave for work. (Trigger based on when I leave the house) I think I struggle a lot with this topic also because I want to move forward with this person in my relationship and I feel that if we were to have kids and the kids were to struggle with adhd the same ways that I do she would be really mean about it. I love my parter but I just feel so stupid for not being able to communicate the difficulties that I have had for the last 2 decades to them.",3,adhd
"At my new job last Friday the boss got burgers for everyone, I ate that shit so fast right in front of them, no one else really picked at theirs. I’m suspicious that they may have tried to poison my burger? 

When I left yesterday to go home, the other guy said “take care”. Well this morning, Wednesday, I had really high blood pressure and dizziness and went in to get checked out. they prescribed beta blockers. When I picked up the meds, On the pamphlet in big ass letters is “take care”. 

I suspect there is a plan at the new place I work at to kill me. Probably an extension of some bigger plan from some hardcore criminals that I got too close with because I liked skating at the skatepark, and now they have to extend their arms out to people I know to try and end me. 

I don’t see why they would actually hire me, I’m such an undesirable person to be around. Boss man said “alright be careful with this let’s make sure nobody gets…. Toxified” about some other shit. 

Obviously a hint that they made me sick on purpose. 

And the best part is my mom said she’s “in heart surgery” the second I text her about it. She is definitely also in on it. Wish it was harder to believe this shit is just happening right in front of my eyes. Everyone around me really is in on a plot to kill me for I don’t know what. Dirty lying fuckers.

"Usually I’ve learned pretty well to gauge through context and experience that a lot of things that people say/do have either a fairly consistent meaning, or don’t have a conscious meaning behind them at all, at least in how they’re communicating with me. Like, I can *typically* tell if someone is being passive aggressive, or if they’re hinting at something about me, or if they’re alluding to certain ideas. The problem is, there are still a lot of times in which I am either totally unaware of any sort of deeper meaning to things they’re saying like irony or if they’re even joking at all, or I overthink things because I’m afraid of the former scenario and end up coming to a wrong conclusion and having an awkward interaction. Also sometimes this leads to me overthinking and taking things personally because I just **genuinely** don’t know what they think or if they’re subtly communicating something that I’m missing. I hate not being able to tell if they’re joking, being insulting/annoyed or expressing an actual opinion, and I hate it even more when I read too deep into it and think that they’re doing something that they’re not because I feel dumb for not just knowing what they mean because apparently it was obvious, or at least it always feels that way in hindsight.",1,autism
"Hello everyone, I(21F) have been diagnosed with ASD since I was 5 years old. Along with ASD I have: Anxiety, Chronic Depression, PTSD, and ADD.

Ever since I can remember I've always had a strained relationship with my mother(neurotypical) and I've grown up wanting nothing more than to feel loved, cared, respected, and listened to by her ever since I could remember. As time went on, I slowly came to realize she was never going to, at least, not the way that I wanted her to. I wanted her to say, ""I'm proud of you,"" ""You're doing a great job,"" or even ""I love you,"" but she never said anything like that. Not unless I said ""I love you"" first, she half-heartedly said it back. She's the type that if you don't meet expectations, she belittles, shames, and berates until you have a breakdown. 

The worst part?

Every time I tried to leave the situation to calm down, she would follow and keep going. 

This is what it's been like recently: I got a new job(all by myself might I add, super proud of myself) - I was a CNA at a local hospital on 12 hour night shifts, but got a new job at a pediatric clinic that was days and a nice 8-5 - and recently I've noticed I get sick really easily. I got sick with a throat virus that the doctors couldn't do anything about, but let it take its course. This morning- after almost 2 weeks off from a fever coming off and on- I got really excited to go but had a low-grade fever(99.4°F Oral), so I had to call out. My mom woke up and saw me home, came to me in my personal space without any warning, took my temperature and said: ""You're lying, you should have gone to work, your being lazy and I hope they fire you because I know I sure would if you were my employee."" (Note here, she's a high-ranking person in my county's health department).

She took it 2 hours after I had taken Tylenol and Pepto bismal to help(Note: my stomach was upset because she made me eat food that doesn't settle well with my stomach) She claims I'm recontaminating myself by staying locked up in my room and having the germs all over my bed spread. I don't think she's wrong, but her words recently have made my depression so horrible that I thought about getting their gun and ending it all.. I haven't had those thoughts in so long, and it really hurts to be having them again all over just because of a few words she's said. Before anyone suggests I talk to her: I've tried. All my life. Therapists, other family members, and friends have all told her to be a little nicer, but she never changes, and she probably never will. 

At this point, I'm mostly staying home because of my depression kicking my ass but I'm regretting staying home because of her treatment towards me. I have nowhere else to go, very little money since starting the new job, and feel super alone through it all since I'm the only person in my family diagnosed with ASD and have a difficult time reaching out for help because whenever I tried when I was under 18, my mom would step in, threaten that the police would take me away(a giant fear of mine she knew all about), and she would never come back to get me.

I'm really at a loss of what to do or what I can do.. I want to go back to work because I absolutely adore and love my job, but I fear I will get fired if I'm gone for much longer. I'm terrified of losing this job, I'm scared of what my mom will say/do to me if I even try to bring up my depression, and.. I'm just scared of everything right now.

"I was diagnosed and medicated in kindergarten, thanks to my mom being a specialist. I never knew any ‘struggle’ associated with my school career. I excelled in elementary and middle school, and ‘learning’ was nothing more than just arriving at school, doing work, and then going home. I never really studied or saw the deeper meaning of an education.

When I went into high school, I had no reason to change my ways. And I started to get horrible grades. I couldn’t understand the concepts, I had no scheduling or organization skills, and more importantly, I had no ethic to get shit done. Because I never needed those things.

Every time I try to independently look into a topic outside of school (for example, trigonometry today), my brain crashes again and again into an obsidian wall, and I get frustrated. I know that education is something that I can do. But it’s been heavily stained by these experiences.

My last day is tomorrow, and I’m graduating later this month. My peers are accelerating rapidly towards job applications, prestigious colleges and the like, but I’m sat here struggling to understand trigonometry.

"I'm just a terrible husband for her, and I tried her into thinking I wasn't our whole dating life by saying and doing all the right things to put on a facade of someone who was bound for success and being the caring person she needed. But it was all because I was so afraid of being alone again, I was willing to do anything and pretend to be anyone to be loved. 

But I am not that person, I fail at everything I do, and past the facade I am a weak, insecure and self-absorbed person who can barely care for himself, let alone a marriage. She never makes mistakes, and I'm always the reason something is wrong or that she has a problem in life.

Hey only mistake was being tricked into loving me, but I can't undo it now. It's been too long, and I've wasted too much of her time. She wants kids and doesn't want to be too old to avoid issues, so it would betray her greatest goal in life for me to admit that we should separate, because she's already 30, and it might be too late now to start all over with else, someone better for her.

But since I'm so awful, it's such a terrible idea for me to have children. Even if they aren't genetically fucked in the head like I must be, then having me as a father will certainly hurt them for their entire lives. I will fail as a father and I know it, but I can't bring myself to just end this whole thing before it starts because I don't want to hurt her even more.

I've been going over it, and it just feels like the best option would for me to have an accident, something fatal that makes it all end. I have a very large life insurance policy, so while it won't make up for the time I've wasted, maybe it will help her live comfortably, and find someone who will be better for her. Then outside of the initial heartbreak of my death, I won't be able to hurt her anymore, and she'll be happier overall when she finds someone who can be the person she needs them to be, and hopefully forget I was ever in her life.

Edit: I think I should clarify that I've never been abusive to her or cheated on her. Im just an awful husband who can't be who she needs me to be, and tricked her into thinking I could be because I'm entirely selfish. I am so self-focused that I think I'll never do a good thing for another person in my life, so the best thing I can do is be removed from life.",2,depression

"26 years old, male. 

Military veteran. College-educated scientist. Definitely been ""gifted"" and ""higher learning ability"" all my life at the cost of severe social and generalized anxiety disorder and major clinical depression.

Bounced between careers. Army, secondary education, laboratories, warehouses. Bounced around multiple states. Don't have many real-life friends anymore. Cost of living has officially spiraled, and probably going to try to live in the car and try to figure out communal places for vets/homeless or something due to rent being this unreal.

Had girlfriends before, but haven't met a woman my age in like 3-4 years. All the apps are infested with bots. Definitely missing intimacy and just flirting in general.

Was a gamer for 24 years since before I could read, write, or talk. Played so many games on so many platforms that it all feels the same. Gaming isn't really fun anymore.

Got into drawing and painting, had fun, but got tired of it real quick.

Body works fine for now albeit unable to eat much or put on any weight and tired of being this skinny or weak but always had stomach problems i.e. nausea, unable to consume large quantities of food.

Feel like I really REALLY messed up somewhere along the way with the majority of my life and goals, and not sure to do, or where I messed up, but I don't find enjoyment from anything I used to, I've tried enough new things for a lifetime, and I don't see stability in my career, financially, and without those - DEFINITELY not in finding a partner or connecting with humans again emotionally.

I can't be the only one.... right?! Oh, please tell me this feeling is normal. Just lie to make me feel better even if it's not LOL!

Don't know what to do, don't know what to think, don't know what to feel because whatever i'm doing thinking, feeling, it doesn't feel human at this point.",2,depression

"I wake up with agonizing muscle ache listening to the wind whispering to me while giving me a strong feminine grasp. I watch as the world, no, the universe, move around and I only keep watching the gloomy streets while the wind speaks to me. The feeling of warmth is what is desired but only the coldness of the breeze comes to me. Watching my mind slowly but inevitably corrupt itself due to the humanity that surrounds me. Wishing I was unraped mentally and physically in order for my childhood to be full of glee and rather left in isolation and peace with the beautiful roses and daffodils giving me the soft touch that I keep yearning for as the cold wind finally blows the flowers sweet smell. I hold a child's hand as I sit on the rock facing my mother's grave and cry solemnly knowing I'll be there to give her a rose or two a day. For her warm spirit will finally allow me to achieve comfort with the hand of the child that I will raise, safeguarding me from the trauma that I was yielded upon.",2,depression
"For context ,I'm from Hungary but I love in Italy since I was 6 because my mom found a job here.
I passed trough a lot of shit during my life,my weak ass father killed himself,I changed schools like 6 times,I had to go to live in Germany for 3 years with my grandparents,to then come back to Italy,in a different place.
Fast forward to middle school,never been good at a single thing except English.My votes were always terrible because I didn't see the point in studying stuff I'll never need in life.During those 3 years I got a fell in love with a girl but got rejected, twice.That hurt ,a lot, but I didn't want to talk about It to anyone ,especially my mother cause we already had enough trouble to go trough(she and her bf broke up,they still are In contact and good friends tho,they just didn't understand each other well).
Middle school ends.My mother worked as a barista at the time and she barley could pay rent ,she wasn't sure if she could pay a highschool for me.To my ""luck"" she eventually hooked up with his asshole that's she could use as a credit card to an extent ,on thing pulls the other and we move in with him.That place sucked ass.Small city,nothing really to do,not even a normal park.Whatever,I basically just stayed in my room all day.

Now it takes a bad turn.
Slowly but surely ,he came out to be a narcissist fuck ,he fucking ruined our life's ,but we couldn't escape cause my mother fell pregnant.My sister was born eventually ,and the fuck just became more and more psycho.He hated me,he always game me bad looks,alywas had some shitty comment to say about me because I never go out(don't have friends there and wasn't gonna get any).

Fast forward a little

Things escalated,he wanted my sister and cut us out.My mother managed to find a lawyer that's Hungarian and he was understanding enough to do the job upfront with payment later on the road.


After some more suffering ,we are free.We went to live in a BNB for 3 ish months ,the fuck gives use 400€ monthly child support.Stayimg at the bnb sucked ,we lived all 3 in one room ,no privacy,no silence,and I was working at the time Aswell.

Thank god ,literally.And acquaintance of my mother knew the cities church caretaker who had an apartment for rent.We moved in ,the place was underwhelming honestly,pretty old,the  guy rented it to bypasses occasionally ,people who would spend a week or so here.It tool a lot of cleaning to make it shine.


Fast forward to the present.
Here I am 21 male,working to maintainy family.

Let's talk about me now;
I work a 7 to 5 ,forklift operator and wearhouse worker.I liked it at the start ,but with months passing I hate it more and more.I don't know why ,I just keep committing little stupid mistakes that make me look like a retarded to my superiors.No matter how hard I try ,there is no one day without either me saying something stupid to my coworker that makes me look like a retard or having trouble with something stupid.

This last week has been really ruff for me mentally.The supervisors always pretent too much,there is always good much work and organized the warehouse is a mess cause the stock amounts make no sense.

I stated to feel a pain inside of me,the fact that I have to live trough life,the mere fact that I exists is giving me a pain in my soul.I snapped twice this week.While in bed I just went blank for a minute and realized that I can't get out of this.I just screamed ,screamed untill it hurt ,then cried.

"I think one day I will end up taking my own life. It’s not a matter of If, just a matter of when.

I’m currently unemployed, a college dropout, I barely have any friends, no romantic partner. 

I have nothing going for me. The only good thing people can say about me are that I’m “smart” and “pretty”.

Whenever I try to make friends I get ghosted. Whenever I date someone it always ends badly. I’m not good at anything I can make money off of, so I struggle financially. I have extreme trust issues, extreme abandonment issues. Because everyone in my life has ghosted me or stabbed me in the back. Everyone betrays me, so I rarely feel comfortable with other people.

I have panic attacks nearly every single night because when I lay in bed alone in the dark with my thoughts, my mind becomes overwhelmed with intense negative emotions and it’s given me insomnia.

I tried to see a therapist and I saw her for a few weeks but gave up because she didn’t seem empathetic at all nor did I feel like she understand how serious my issues were.

And maybe that’s partially my fault because I am very, very good at making it seem like I have everything together when on the inside I’m falling apart. Even the mask of normalcy I put on is slipping because I cut myself and I don’t even care enough to hide it anymore. I walk around in public with large, gaping, bleeding cuts all over my left arm because I just don’t care to hide it anymore.

 I have gone to therapists for ten years and have tried nearly every anti depression and anti psychotic on the market. All of them do little for me. 

The few moments in my life where I have been happy are so fleeting and few in number. I don’t have a strong will to live. If it wasn’t for my sister and the very small amount of friends I have on the internet, I would have killed myself a long time ago.",2,depression

"  
Crippling indecision. Depressed people can be consumed by an overwhelming inability to make decisions. Everything is questioned right down to the granular level. This constant self-questioning and evaluating leaves the person paralysed and unable to function. For instance the depressed person might make a decision to take a shower. What follows next is a tsunami of questions “should I wait to later” “what if I don’t have the energy” “why do I need a shower anyhow I am not going anywhere?” This can literally play out for hours and hours until the sufferer finally says something along the lines of “what’s the point?” Needless to say this self-doubting will be followed by recrimination and more than likely self-hatred for being so weak, which in turn feeds the depression, an almost perfect vicious circle.  
Critical self-judgment. Depressed people don’t really see themselves as ill. They rarely give themselves that good a break. Instead they can very easily view their depression as a personal weakness they could overcome if they just tried hard enough. This train of thought is perpetuated by other people telling them to just snap out of it, or a thousand other platitudes they have heard a million times before. Instead of seeing this nonsense for what it really is they turn it internally and berate themselves for having a character flaw that doesn’t allow them to function like normal people. They don’t need other people to be judgmental as they are expert at doing it to themselves a thousand times worse.  
Interaction is painful. It’s something most people take for granted. Interaction, conversing and relating are things we mostly don’t have to think about. For someone suffering depression this natural ability can become excruciatingly difficult. In most instances we pull on a socially acceptable mask and pretend everything is fine. We are present but not really there if you know what I mean? We can be surrounded by people and feel painfully alone lost in the quicksand of depression. We are experts at hearing but not really listening. We are ninja warriors at the art of avoiding talking about how we are feeling. Everything is great and fine when in reality we are dying inside. While you are talking about how your day went we can be reliving the worst moments of ours and at the same time making sure you don’t see our pain.  
Fear of the future. Ask a depressed person what they think their future looks like and they will more than likely tell you “more of the same or worse” Depending on the severity of the depression a sufferer doesn’t see a future. A future is something other people have not them. Their future is the struggle they are going to have tomorrow morning when they wake up and think to themselves “please, not this again, I don’t think I can go on like this” We think about the future by comparing it to our past. It’s very difficult to imagine a nice future when all the evidence from the past is telling you it isn’t going to happen. For the vast majority of people a future is something they can feel optimistic about. For a depressed person it can feel like something to dread. Something filled with hopelessness and helplessness. Not living in the present is extremely common; it can feel like we are adrift in an ocean of misery and torment stuck in a no man’s land of despair and apathy. Once hope is lost, everything is lost.  
Even the good times can be bad. Imagine not even being happy at the birth of your child or in fact any landmark occasion that marks a supposedly joyous event in our lives. A chronically depressed person doesn’t have to imagine it. For millions of people this is a reality and is something that is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. Guilt and shame which feed the depression are experienced in equal measure. They know on a rational logical level they should be happy, unfortunately they have lost the ability. Their happiness has been replaced by numbness and indifference which they have seemingly no control over. I well remember when I was going through my own depression someone asking me what I would do if I won a million pounds. Without even having to think I said I would probably give it away as no amount of money could ever make me happy again. These are the depths a depressed mind can sink to.  
Observing not participating. There is a song from the movie midnight cowboy sung by Harry Nilsson that I think sums up depression beautifully. Here it is. “Everybody’s talking at me, I don’t hear a word they’re saying only the echoes of my mind”. Severe depression is probably like having an out of body experience. You can see and hear everything happening around you but you are not part of it. It can feel very lonely and isolating to realise that you are a spectator to your own life. Your heart aches to be part of something that will make you feel like a human being again but your depressed mind is constantly telling you that this is for other people to experience, not you. Just like the song you literally do hear what everybody is saying but you are lost in mire of the echoes of your own mind. It can feel like you are living a life where the pause button is permanently pressed. A state of non-existing if you like.  
Dysfunctional relating and relationships. It’s no coincidence that the rate of breakups and divorces amongst people suffering depression is quite high. Relating to another human being requires motivation that is sadly lacking as they struggle with their illness. Maintaining relationships requires effort and energy both of which have been sucked out of them. It’s not that they don’t care it’s because they have lost the ability to care and they feel powerless to do anything about it. When you don’t care if you live or die yourself it can be very difficult to care for someone else. They are trapped inside the prison of their own mind desperately hoping for someone or something to set them free. For a depressed person isolating themselves can be preferable to relating even though they absolutely know this is doing them real harm. A depressed mind doesn’t think rationally it will push away the very thing that could help them. It can see relationships as having very little consequence, even though the opposite is true, such is the contradictory nature of depression.  
Lack of autonomy. The most important thing to every human being on the planet is having a sense of autonomy or control over their lives. When depression comes into a person’s life that sense of control is taken away. Choices start to become very limited and the person’s world can become microscopic. In an effort to fill that emotional void many people turn to food, alcohol, drugs, shopping anything in fact that alleviates, however temporarily, the crushing feeling of being out of control of their own destiny. These strategies can of course bring about bigger problems to add to the depression. A sense of meaning or purpose to their lives is missing and in its place is a gaping hole. This can set some people off on a journey to find that missing piece in the vain hope that it will complete them. They never find that thing that will make them whole again because it doesn’t exist. It is a depression generated wild goose chase that can easily turn into an obsession. Depression holds out the promise that if you could just find that thing outside yourself everything would return to normal and the depression would vanish. Unfortunately as many people have found to their cost, including myself, it’s simply not true. The answer lies internally not externally.  
There are a countless different ways that people can experience depression. There are however quite a few commonalities between the different types. If any of the above resonated with you it’s time to seek professional help. These types of symptoms won’t be exercised away, prayed away, snapped out of or ignored. If left unaddressed they have the ability to devastate your life for a very long period of time.

I am a diagnosed autistic and I have been in services like special education and ABA therapy since I was young, however my parents didn’t really do any research outside of what professionals have told them and the basics and I’ve had to teach them about meltdowns, stimming, masking etc and it’s exhausting. I am no way insinuating my parents are stupid but it’s low key kind of exhausting teaching them about things they honestly should’ve already known about. I’m convinced they think autism is just little quirkiness with your brain but otherwise your like everyone else, which is not true. 

They think things like meltdowns are like toddlers having a tantrum and deny I have sensory issues at places like school and church and that I need to grow up and deal with responsibility. I get overwhelmed quite easily and I can meltdown and start crying and when I start I can’t stop and it takes me a while to calm down. They act like I’m a toddler who needs to control my emotions but I’m not and it’s incredibly hurtful.

"It started when I was bored at school. I was imagining how my life would look like if I was in a relationship with my teachers or classmates (I often wonder how my life would look like if I did something differently. It's not because I'm not satisfied with my life but because I'm curious or just have nothing else to do). This combined with the fact I just changed schools and was excited to meet new people made me panic a lot because I was afraid I had a crush on someone else than my bf.


At one point a year ago I wanted to masturbate to having a threesome with me, my bf and someone else. For some reason I didn't just imagined a random person but one of my classmates. I've been paranoid I have a crush on that guy ever since. 


The thing is, I don't even remember that he exists when I'm not panicking. We don't even talk to eachother anymore because I don't want to.


My bf knows about all of this. He forgave me and still trusts me. I would never cheat, I was just a dumbass who thought that imagining things is harmless (I stopped doing that after I realised how wrong it was).


I'm not paranoid about cheating with only that guy, I'm afraid I'll cheat with every single man I talk to (which is pretty funny since I'm bi). Talking to someone even when it's my freaking cousin? Cheating. Doing makeup for my crossdresser friend? Cheating. Being hit on even though I'm telling this person that I'm not interested? Cheating. Sitting next to a man? Cheating. Looking at a man and thinking he has nice clothes or just looks good? Cheating. Ironically, thinking a girl looks gorgeous and sexy isn't cheating... Fangirling over a freaking character in a movie? Cheating. Hugging my own fucking boyfriend? Cheating. Wtf brain?? 


Unfortuneatley it started evolving. My female bff, who's the type of person who kisses her homies goodnight, told me she loves me. Nothing unusual. Like I said, she tells it to everybody. But now I'm afraid I had a crush on her in the past too even though when she offered to kiss me two years ago (she never kissed a girl before and wanted to know how it feels like) I refused. 


I know I don't have crush on someone other than my bf. I'm afraid I HAD a crush in the past even though I havent. This possibility disgusts me even though I don't think catching feelings towards someone else while being in a relationship is wrong as long as you don't cheat. I love my bf and would never forgive myself if I'd develop a crush on someone else even if I'd ignore it and would work on fixing our relationship.",5,paranoia
"I’m being a bit short and brief with this because Reddit crashed midway through writing the first one and I’m a bit upset about it

I’ve always had a bit of paranoia ever since possibly 5th grade. Although back then it was a minor “someone is watching me” when I walked home from school, and eventually I grew out of it. After that I’ve had an issue with trust. Unless there’s is reasonable evidence that someone isn’t lying, their words mean next to nothing to me. Whenever my own mother says “I love you”, I dont believe her. I’ve been like this since I remember. Eventually I got a gf and it all settled down for a bit. I felt like I could be truthful with her. I placed my trust in her and told her things I’d never tell anyone. Mid way into last year, her friends started to test my patience and found one of my weak points, Anger. They abused the fact that I was easily angerable as much as possible. They used it to lie to her and pretend like I was a mentally unstable psycho. And they won, she broke up with me, which has enhanced these issues greatly. If there is one thing I’m certain in all of my distrust, theories, and paranoia, they did it on purpose. Once is an event, twice is a coincidence, daily is a pattern. And after the fact, she completely changed how she acted to one of our mutual friends, allowing her friends to do the same shit they did to me (although I didn’t find out until much later). After our breakup my life went terrible. They, in a way, gaslit me into believing it was entirely my fault. It made the original issue of not believing people’s words 100x worse. Even now, I dont believe some of my friends and don’t even hang out anymore with one of them just because I don’t think they like me.

Now we get to the part I’m most unsure of. Recently got into a fight with a friend. They let their friends pass on some shit I didn’t like. Nothing I’m paranoid about, they were being assholes and he didn’t want me calling them out on it. Well it lead to us falling out, then randomly he added me on discord. Never got a text from him and minutes later he unfriended me. I texted him to ask why he did that and he said “You're too paranoid people are out to get you and I don't want to deal with that again”. The thing that gets me is I dont know what he means by that. I never was paranoid or thought any of them were out to get me. All I noticed was the pattern of him being a dick to myself and multiple other people. But multiple people, even my closest current friend, said that I was acting paranoid. It worries me about what I was acting like to make them think that.

Finally I should talk about my worries about being alone. I hate being alone. I can’t stand it. Past 2 or 3 times I’ve been alone I swear I’ve heard a door open/slam.

"My life is so just slightly not great. I have a job, I live with my mother and my free time is spent however I please. But with the lack of apparent friends and incredibly ill brain I have, I get depressed super easily. Whether it be dwelling in the shame of not going to college or wallowing in self pity and lack of a social circle, I always turn around after a lil bit. I usually end up in trains of thought similar to:

""Nope, I'm fine, might as well be happy, cause lingering in any other feeling does me no good.""

And then I just act completely fine and inevitably feel fine. I'm always cracking up my co workers, making them smile and laugh. But I get so sick of it sometimes. I'm the only damn person who's positive. Despite how depressed I feel when I'm not working. It feels like a role that I've adapted to. And I just keep going with it. 

You can only fake it so much before you get exhausted and give up trying. Trying to act like I'm fine, and/or that things will get better. Cause at this pace, it's not. I barely have anyone in my life that I'm real with. The extent of my social circle is really just friends online, which are great dont get me wrong I love each and every one of them. But being able to see and touch an actual human being is very different. 

Anyways yippee, I'll feel better in the morning after a bit of work. I'm typing this at just before midnight when I have work at 6am",2,depression

"(For those checking my post history, I either randomize or conceal gender to avoid identification and bias.  Sometimes it's hard to write genderless.)

Sorry if this doesn't belong on this forum but I really need to get this out there because it's tearing at me.

A few nights ago my wife was 100% convinced that our 5 year old daughter was sexually assaulted by an intruder in the middle of the night.  There was no evidence of an intruder and the idea that there has been an intruder coming in just about every night has persisted for a long time now and I'm making no progress trying to convince my wife that it isn't happening.

Eventually my wife managed to convince me to take our daughter in to the hospital for an examination, but she wouldn't take her in herself -- like some secret part of herself knows she's mentally unwell and is trying to keep it a secret, and knows that the doctors will think she's got issues but *somehow* if **I** take our daughter in they'll take it seriously.

They did a urine test and a superficial examination and said they found no evidence of abuse or drugging.  They advised me not to go for the more invasive examination, feeling it would be an *actual* trauma to my daughter just to be *extra* sure that trauma hadn't occurred, so I didn't go for it.

The doctor's word and the lab results didn't change my wife's mind.  The assault 100% happened and they were just careful to use a drug that hospitals don't test for and careful not to do any damage.  Just like they can avoid all the cameras (or edit footage) and get in and out without leaving any sign.

"Hi! I made a post about it yesterday but I deleted it because of my anxiety.


So, I'm 19 [F] and the day before yesterday I saw someone on the train taking pictures of me (at least that's what it looked like -i wasn't wearing something weird or have dyed hair or piercings or anything like that) and now I'm extremely paranoid that people are watching and following me waiting for the right moment to kidnap me. Im already scared that people are stalking my house and will try to break in and now I'm even more afraid something bad will happen to me.


 The thing is, everytime I try to calm myself down I think that I am just being extremely observant or that the universe is sending me messages so that I can be ready when the right time comes. Basically it tries to protect me by making me paranoid and scared all the time. I know this probably sounds kind of crazy but I can't stop thinking that way.


I'm seeing a psychiatrist and I've been taking antipsychotics for some months now (I currently take 3 kinds of antipsychotics every day) but that doesn't seem to help me at all. How can I stop this madness? I can't live like that. I'm so tired. Do my thought make any sense? What did the person who took photos of me want? I think I'm going insane. I can't leave the house alone and I can't stay home alone either bc I feel that someone will break in and kidnap me. Does someone have any advice or have been in a similar place before? I would rather stay in a mental hospital than having to live with this fear. I'm even scared of posting this because I think that people are watching my phone too.",5,paranoia

"I apologize in advance, I tend to go on tangents and this post doesn't really have a goal in mind. I'm also fairly new to reddit. Anyhow..

Fresh off a breakup from a relationship of 5 years, having to move back home with my family. It's barely been a month but my sense of time has been distorted. Some days seem to fly by, some days feel like an eternity. I am facing loneliness for the first time in years, despite knowing I have a good support circle of coworkers and friends who have been really crucial to my well being in this time. I've always found myself latching on/jumping into relationships very quickly because I never really liked the idea of being alone and the negative connotation I attached to it. The thought of going to the movies alone, or taking myself out to eat alone, still makes me really uncomfortable. I'm scared because I want to go out and explore more of the bustling bay area, but I can't bring myself to go to these places as an individual and potentially seek out new friendships, relationships, or just to distract myself.

The icing on the cake is that I have always struggled with perfectionism, am subject to spiral and catastrophize more often, and generally just always feeling like I need to figure what it is I want to do with my life and distancing myself from people I labeled as ""stagnant"".  I've struggled with MDD since I was a pre-teen and was formally diagnosed a few years ago. I was on anti-depressants when I was about 19, and pre-emptively requested a prescription in Nov. of last year as I was anticipating a major change (transitioning from my job of 4 yrs). I think this is what has been keeping me afloat. I didn't anticipate to break up with my partner, but by then I was pretty adjusted to the medication.

(I feel) I've always valued and contributed to my emotional well being and ways to be a better friend/communicator. I've had many therapists throughout the years and always appreciated the value in opening up, as well as how understood I felt by each of my therapists. On the other side of that coin I know I am an irritable person and struggle with regulating my emotions. I tell myself that as long as I try every day to be better, things will work themselves out.

It's hard most days. I have all this momentum with job interviews, teaching myself new things like riding a motorcycle and how to (finally) swim, reading more books, discovering more podcasts, but it all is just busy work. Stuff to distract me. I often find myself asking, or more so stating, ""What's the point?"" All these things, don't seem to matter because I can't envision a future where I move on from this split and feel good about my accomplishments. Even comparing myself to 5 years ago, I know I've come a long way and I know I have my whole life ahead of me, but I can't accept it. I can't come to terms with it.

The universe works out in ways we cannot foresee, and it is unfolding as it should. I fear the unknown and what lies beyond this plane of existence, so I know I have to see this one life through. I allow myself to cry and feel my emotions, and find myself feeling a bit easier afterwards. I know it gets easier. It has to. There's a point to all of this, I just am not privy to it.

I've listened to this Sinatra song once a day, I know this is a popular song. I just hope someone else feels a bit better after listening.

"Hello  everyone, this might be a long post but I'll try to keep things clear and concise. My middle aged disabled mother  thinks the government is spying on her. She rarely leaves the house and  when she does, she doesn't leave the car. She thinks there are  undercover people taking pictures of her, listening to her through electronics, and trying to arrest her for god knows what. She has been  putting towels over phones, putting paper over random electronics (e.g. the lights on a ps3 even though I told her there's no camera in it), and  is very suspicious of all strangers I'm unsure if this is the cause of  her medication (she takes plenty of meds for her pain), her lack of friends/social activity (she mostly talks with me and my two siblings), or something else.

I've been very calm and rational with addressing this problem with her, but she has told me that she knows she seems crazy, but at least God understands her. She's very stubborn and gets  angry whenever we have conversations that makes her feel uncomfortable.  When I asked her about how this all will end, she said she'll either end  up arrested or God will ""deliver her"" from this. Idk what she means by  this but she comes off as if she's given up. Her disability has made life very painful for her and she usually just watches TV everyday while  dealing with her pains.

I live about about an hour or two away from her for work and don't have a car  for easy transportation to help her. I'm trying my best to be calm and  supportive but I hate that I can't do much while my mom's mind is deteriorating. My siblings are a double edge sword in all of this since  they're both helpful and toxic for my mother. They're easily frustrated  and emotional whenever my mom gets too overbearing (she can get very  angry and mean when things doesn't turn out her way). My brother helps  sometimes since he lives with her but he is very junky, stubborn, and conceited. My mom likes a clean house and my brother constantly dirties  up the place. My sister on the other hand can be supportive but her  awful relationships and financial troubles causes her to be very toxic. She constantly borrows money from us, manipulates/lies, and can be  downright rude at times.

My sister  and I have been wanting to do an intervention on my mother but my  brother doesn't want to do it. I'm trying to listen and be supportive of  everyone, but I don't know what to do and I'm tired of all this  emotional labor. Action needs to happen but with my brother constantly working and focusing on his own interests while my sister is working and  focusing on relationships/partying/etc, it can't happen. I've been telling my mom I think she should go to counseling/therapy, but I don't think she's going to do it. She only trusts one counselor she went to  years ago, and has told me she would try to find her ""one of these days.""

For 20 some years, I'd never hear anybody mention anything about this softball field. But just the other day this guy does and I tell him there's a league that plays there. and he blocks me.

I want this to end and I want to find out who's doing this! I previously got a new phone because I was so paranoid somebody had hacked into my phone. Now I think somebody is able to generate fake profiles on whim on this app and fuck with me through it. 

Idk if anybody can help. Reassuring me that it's just my paranoia won't do it. I've been in therapy for years, and nothing. I feel helpless.",5,paranoia

This is the second time I score high at a test for paranoia. But I dont think im like really paranoid. I think its just because of trauma? And like a symptom of ptsd but not like full blown paranoia and it makes me scared ppl think I do have it. What do you think?

Why does she think I am paranoid/ May be psychotic
Is because I think ppl are talking about me when I sit in my garden. I know its probably not true but its real to me at that moment and I will go inside because of the fear and anger.
When I am outside and walk along houses I feel like I am on a catwalk of shame. Like everybody thinks I suck ( i always have had the thoughts of ppl disliking me but not to this extend, this has been going on for 2 years or something)
I get anxiety when walking by ppl because the May think I am ugly or crazy or whatever.. or they will judge me on how I walk because if my physical problems.
I sometimes see mouses when I have insomnia or hear people talking but that's just because of the lack of sleep.
I think my friends secretly hate me, like im some kind of punishment to them that they have to entertain.
I can't relax when im in lot of physical pain in my house cause im afraid someone will find me lazy 
I haven't told my therapists but I also have this thing when ppl go down stairs I see them falling and crying and hurt in my mind

But a lot of it is trauma related I guess.. and I think its more anxiety/ptsd than paranoia/ psychoses? But it makes me afraid.  I do have most of theese symptoms for over 2 years. So it can be psychoses cause that doesn't last so long I guess?
And when I was younger I used to see and hear ppl.. thought I could hear ghosts. So there was probably always something like that in my system.",5,paranoia

"Struggling to live normally in my own home

(Long a** read) - anxiety and paranoia.

Hi all, 

TLDR; anxious and paranoid  about neighbours listening to everything I do. So I live in complete silence and it’s driving me insane. Help!

_____________

I moved into an apartment a few years ago. And when I first moved in I felt great. I played music a lot and everything else no problem. My neighbours were also a lot noisier, like I could hear my next door neighbours TV, general chatter. It was really nice and homely. 

Anyway, I went through a rough patch and started drinking heavily, during which time I would go on rants & argue with people.. i was very loud & obnoxious. I also fell out with a few of my neighbours, because I was blasting music until early hours and just being an all around prick really. Once I quit drinking I managed to make up with everyone expect my next door neighbour. Deep down I’m also embarrassed how I was when I was drinking, and I genuinely think some of my neighbours want to listen in on me for entertainment now & probably didn’t realise I was going through some BS and drinking. 

My issue is that when I do anything I feel like people are listening in, and it’s like people stop what they’re doing. The only time I hear “normal” neighbour sounds is when they don’t realise I’m at home. I’ve been living so quietly that my downstairs neighbour commented to me “oh you’re alive then” sometime last year.. a few months back he mentioned that he can’t hear anything, but just my footsteps.. and now I’ve resulted to learning how to step silently and placing thick cloth or thick material on where my main walking paths are in the house so I can walk silently. 


Some more examples: 

* I have a loud mechanical typing keyboard, which sounds similar to tapping — and my neighbours aren’t too young, 50+ mainly and I’m 28,— & multiple times I’ve heard people tapping back. Not just one tap. But  consecutively, mimicking me typing. I don’t think they realise it a a keyboard. I’ve resulted to learning how to type without noise and placing a foam pad under my keyboard. I’ve not heard the tapping since. Another example is when I was using a normal computer mouse with a loud click. I would hear a neighbour flicking things on and off asif mimicking me. I’ve resulted to getting a silence mouse — now I never hear that.   

* when I want to use my oven or washing machine which both slam into their latch, I hear someone slamming back. 

The one strange thing is, when someone else is with me none of this happens, and actually when other people are here my anxiety completely goes. 

My only remedy is putting my washing mashing on a long wash, or leaving my heating on which makes listening through the walls nearly impossible and masks my noise. The only issue with the heating is, when it’s pressure is low and on a timer, where it turns on and off frequently it sounds like a tap turning on and off —  one of my neighbours started copying it.. until a few days ago where i was speaking to a neighbour and I told him I always have my heating on, he looked a bit puzzle and now I never hear someone copying it. Another remedy was leaving my kitchen fan on, but the noise was unbearable. 



I’m unable to cook, clean or socialise. I can’t watch TV out loud or have conversations on the phone. Im also a music recording artist, and I cannot record my vocals. It’s driving me insane. Im struggling on a incomprehensible level. This is holding me back, and I feel like I’m trapped when I’m at home. I can’t ask my neighbours if they’re listening to me because no one would admit to that. Today, I was playing music, heard taps on the wall asif someone is listening and it resulted in me playing my music lower and lower until it was all the way down and I snuck into my room silently to lay on my bed in silence & write this reddit post. 

I have told my doctor about this but he doesn’t really understand, and it’s something that sounds so ridiculous it’s hard for me to convey & express. I’ve told my parents. my mum just thinks  I’m scared of someone & doesn’t understand.  some friends know, but they can’t grasp the idea of someone suffering with this so can’t relate or give advice.  The response is usually them telling me how good their neighbours are. I am currently taking anxiety and depression medication partly as a result of this anxiety I have at home . But the medication is becoming less affective as time goes on & all my doctors wants to do is increase the dose and call it a day. I don’t hear voices or sign in my head, I’m not schizophrenic or anything else. 



Help 😔!

Edit — also times I feel like I can’t even breath or chew on food. This isn’t an issue that I struggle with anywhere else, though I do have social anxiety which can be really bad or non existent depending on my extent of depression. Also, if I’m wearing headphone then the anxiety and paranoia just goes away",5,paranoia

"I just can’t take it anymore. I’m tired of being sad and so fucking lonely. I crave human touch so badly. I just don’t see the point on living. We kill viruses to heal ourselves why can we kill the pain by just dying. Who am I living for? Even my family didn’t bat an eye when I said I could die as a joke and they took me seriously. I just want this train wreck I call a life to end. We are going to die anyways there is nothing special about living. Catastrophe is inevitable why bother? I’m tired and lonely and tired of being both. Everywhere I go I look for ways to kill myself with the things I have at my disposal.jumping off a roof, hair dryer in the bath tub. I recently survived a suicide attempt and all I got for it was a forearm with no feeling anymore and 9 stitches.

"Hi❤️ I’m a F23 with two troubled parents, I have BPD, my mom has ADHD and my dad was just diagnosed w schizophrenia today, he is 42 years old and has always been depressed and dissociative ever since I can remember. He begun having manic / psychotic behaviour beginning 2018. 

He is highly intelligent and sensitive, loves movies, music, video games and the cosmos. 

I want to be there for my dad. I want to know how it has been for those of u who are diagnosed to have ur condition and what to be mindful of. I also do have a few friends who are sc and I want to be as mindful as possible of what I can do to help when they are very triggered. I always make sure to ask them myself what they need too ofc in a soft manner.

I just got the «news» of his final diagnosis today, though he started experiencing drug induced (Ritalin / Amfethamine / Weed ) psychosis in 2018 and ever since then was he ever the same.

Up until now I thought he might be autistic with isolated incidents of drug induced psychosis’ that turned to the psychosis lingering for years after.

In his very intense episodes he mostly sees demons and wants to fulfill some sort of prophecy, and / or he thinks he’s being followed and is suspicious of everyone but me and my grandma.

I remember him as being calm, witty, sensitive and smart my whole childhood / young adulthood leading to 2018. Though, apparantly whenever he was ill I would stay at my grandma’s house and she would tell me he had a fever or stomach bug instead.. 

Since 2018 he has been aggressive, accusive, he breaks things (electronics, his windows and walls). He was recently forced to sell his apartment because he’s been screaming a lot, and broke things constantly and I guess my worry now is will he with his diagnosis and finally getting the right medication be able to lead a good life again?

I don’t want to be insensitive to my dad but I really miss the way he used to be so much, we were best friends and talked every day pre 2018, and I guess I thought there was a possibility that he would go back to his «normal» self again but I now understand that he has actually always been like this and I actually just never knew. He has been in a good psychiatric hospital for half a year now and after careful observation they finally diagnosed him 

I am curious to hear from those of you who have been diagnosed with sc yourselves in your later years and how it affected you. Also those who have sc parents and how it has been for u.❤️",6,schizophrenia

"I’ve been struggling with paranoia and anxious thoughts since I had a major mental health episode last year. Long story short I stopped talking to a bunch of people and withdrew socially.

I have these thoughts that people I was friends with in the past are making fun of me and mocking me, posting about me, relaying screenshots between each other about me, etc. I have had this happen to me before so it’s something that makes me quite anxious. I have paranoia about being hacked/having my info leaked too.

I also get worried people try to ‘scope me out’ and say things that trigger me and then make judgments on my character based on how I respond, and use the way I respond as proof of my character. I’ve had people bring up words/phrases from music I like and had them mirror it back to me and the tone of it has felt like they’re trying to send me a message/make me reflect. I keep making connections, linking up conversations, words/phrases mentioned, and trying to ‘understand’ the link.

It’s exhausting.

It’s to the point that I have these thoughts for hours each day, thinking about past conversations and interactions. It’s pretty rough and I’m really sick of it.

Does anyone have tips/suggestions for how to gain some distance from these thoughts, address these thoughts, or shift the pattern somehow? Thanks!",5,paranoia

"hey everyone, so I have been depressed ever since I can remember. I have extreme fatigue. I remember as a teenager I would just feel so tired and I would feel very guilty. recently, I went through a phase in which I was extremely suicidal, and my fatigue was just very bad. I was also working the night shift which made my fatigue even worse. Now I am trying to do more things during my days just so I am not in bed all the time . however, it is extremely rough. For example today, I took a walk with my mom in the morning, I did some laundry, and I went to target & ulta. Right as I was getting home, I couldn't take the exhaustion anymore. I had to lay Down for a little bit. my mom was in the kitchen cooking and I felt bad for her because she's doing all the work by herself. I wish I had the energy to help her around in the kitchen. I asked her if it was OK if I rest a little bit, and she said yes. Regardless, I still feel pretty guilty about not helping her out. later on today I have to go to therapy and a friend is coming over because I need to give her her birthday gift. this is a very busy day and I'm just exhausted. i have to be in bed by 9pm bc I work tomorrow early in the morning. I also wanted to review some work stuff. I mean it's good that im busy because I don't think about negative stuff but I'm just very exhausted. I have come a long way though because two months ago I couldn't even get out of bed and my mom would have to do my laundry. I feel so bad for putting my mom through this, so I helped by buying the detergent & softener for the clothes. I also bought groceries and pay for food. it's just I don't know how to stop feeling guilty when my body starts getting tired.

"My sister has been dealing with eczema for 2+ years now and has isolated herself because of it. She has been doing all things to heal including dietary changes, exercise, etc. but her condition with eczema isn’t getting better. She isn’t ready for therapy, she says. She admitted to feeling deeply depressed and has mentioned not wanting to live and not wanting to wake up.

"TW for suicidal ideation. I 100% understand if my post gets deleted. I'm posting this to anywhere I think I can find somebody, ANYbody who could give me some semblance of advice.

I'm a 24yo American male and I'm completely lacking in motivation and purpose.

I've always been a lonely and mentally ill person. Anxiety, depression, suicidal, etc. I feel very little positivity and joy. I lack the motivation for self-improvement and self-reliance.

Ever since my youth, I've never been much good at making friends. Was never a very social or motivated kid. I've seen it said many times that charisma and having connections are essential to success in life. I severly lack social skills/people skills and fear that this has crippled my ability to live a well-off life.

I suffered a mental/emotional breakdown in 7th grade due to the stress of the workload. I got diagnosed with Asperger's and spent proceeded to spend most of my time in the special needs classroom. I've suffered several breakdowns throughout my years as a middle and high school student. Lots of banging on walls, lots of crying, lots of screaming, etc. I was the stereotypical ""psycho"", the quiet loner kid with no friends and no social skills. I dropped out of several high-demand classes and clubs as a result of never being able to handle the workload/responsibility (APUSH, robotics, Beta Club, National Honor Society, etc.). I never took the SATs or anything like that. I feel horrifically ashamed and guilty and useless and worthless because I could never make it in these classes/clubs. It's resulted in me feeling constantly suicidal to this day due to never living up to my own hefty expectations of myself.

In 10th grade, I confessed how sad and angry and suicidal I am to a guidance counselor and it landed me a week in a juvenile mental facility. I wasn't allowed to return to school for half a year after that. I totally screwed myself even further. Shoulda just kept my mouth shut.

I'm still living with my parents and am totally dependent on them for everything. I never learned how to do all the things kids are supposed to learn. How to make friends, how to swim, ride a bike, etc. I'm 24 and I don't know how to drive! And as an adult, I know diddly-squat about insurance, homeowning, taxes, etc., or any other important adult stuff. I've been working part-time as a dishwasher at Cracker Barrel for the past 8 years, less than 20 hours every week. I still rely on my parents and grandparents to get me to and from work. I feel like such a massive burden and have attempted to take my own life multiple times.

Sis got accepted into college recently. She's absolutely amazing, an extremely talented and intelligent young woman. An artist, musician, writer, etc. Recently, I overheard Dad telling her how great she is while talking trash about me behind my back. Said I'll always be dependent on him and Ma. He's sick of it and moving out in September. I'm absolutely terrified of what'll happen to us once he goes.

I confided in Sis about what I heard and she told me she wanted to yell at Dad and tell him to shut up right then and there. That a parent should never talk like that about their child. She offered to help me learn how to drive and she offered to help me apply for college. But I'm so genuinely terrifed that I'll crash and burn in college (see my previous academic history of stress and mental breakdowns). I'm so, so, so genuinely scared outta my mind that I'll never make it. That I'll never amount to anything, so why bother accumulating debt if I'm probably just gonna drop out like I always do?

I've become hyper-fixated on the concept of euthanasia. Death with dignity, the right to die, etc. This suffering is just too much to bear. I'm so sick of myself. I wish I was normal. I wish I wasn't so emotional and outbursty. I wish I wasn't so socially inept and helpless. I wish I leaned how to swim and how to bike and how to drive when I was a kid. I wish I knew how to be responsible and own my own place and do taxes. I'm the type of person who needs firm directions from others in order to achieve some semblance of function. Can anybody give me direct and concise orders on what to do next? I can't do this alone...

I apologize if all this comes off as whining and complaining, I'm just so very sick and tired of myself. Seriously, what should I do? What CAN I do?",2,depression

It goes up and down through the day but it’s been worse on average, affecting everyday life, and it might be that I’m not getting enough sleep. Mainly I’m really scared people are looking at me and thinking badly about me, that cashiers/waiters are judging food that I ordered if it’s “kid food” or something and things like that. At home, I also sometimes feel that someone is inside my house who shouldn’t be (nobody specific, but it’s humanoid and doesn’t have a face), I don’t see hallucinations but I get the feeling that they’re there and watching me and I sometimes get images in my head that they’re in my room watching me lay in bed.

"I typically never feel the urge to post about my negative feelings but this instance really left me broken. Today, my parent kept “jokingly” referring to me and a bum, as I graduated a semester early and don’t work (I guess tutoring doesn’t count…) or drive. Taking a difficult course load with depression last year and the first of last year really exhausted me and I needed this semester for a mental break. My cognitive difficulties make learning news things very difficult and I have a very difficult time processing most things, so the smallest tasks feel like a difficult struggle. Because these tasks feel so difficult, I fall into a vicious cycle of fear and avoidance. 

However, my parent referring to me as a bum today really hurt, as they have done this before in the past but I shrugged it off.  This really hurt, because the smallest task feels so difficult, and I would do anything to get rid of my cognitive difficulties and lead a productive life, buts it’s not so simple. Being called a bum reminds me of how much of a loser I really am and makes me want to give up on life. Maybe I’m not good enough and will never be able to do well in university. I feel so broken right now and feel like there’s no hope for the future if I have trouble understanding the smallest things. Maybe I am just a bum, and objectively they would be right. I have no job, can’t drive, and absolutely no friends. If I were to die, very few people would care…I don’t  know why I’m especially sensitive today, but this really hurt because I’m trying my best (working hard on a driving course and preparing for several musical competitions) but don’t see any progress…

Has anyone else experienced being called lazy or a bum when they are really struggling? I feel like the signs are so obvious (not eating, sleeping too much, social isolation) but people are quick to judge tiredness and sadness as being lazy…",2,depression

"Im going through a no contact era with someone who I cared about a lot. And it's got me sad obviously, but I feel relatively healed from it. Grieving is a process, so I don't fully expect the feeling to go away.

It's just I feel so stuck, I do have things or life goals I want to do, but I can't help but feel like it'd be easier to actually do them/start them if I had him doing his own life things with me, if that makes sense. I know body doubling is your productivity increase when someone is in the room or on the phone with you. So I'm not sure if it applies to just being in my life makes things easier. 

And thinking back I've always been like this, not just with this person. I hope this is relatable, and to hear about some other experiences. Im trying to seek a official diagnosis btw. So grain of salt",3,adhd

"okay so i want to start out by saying this is me reaching out asking what exactly to do..
stats: 
age - 15
height - 5’5
weight - 137lbs
sex - female
amount of dxm consumed - probably 3000mg ish over 6 days. 

it all started off as me doing dph over a year ago, i quit ts since. i have known about dxm for a little over 6 months now but decided to give it a try about a month ago. 
the first two times did nothing exceot make me tired, this was with robotussin syrup. then, i found out about coricidin, this is where my memory gets blurry. 
about 2 weeks ago i went to my local cvs and borrowed from the generous store about 3 boxes. i popped 8ps (240 ish mg) the first night. this was the beginning of my binge. i then proceeded to pop another 4, and then another 4 all in the same night within 5 hours. i stayed up the whole night, it was amazing, i never wanted it to stop. 
the next night i did the same (night before being friday night) so it now being saturday night i dosed up 13ps. (390mgs). 
i didnt do any sunday night as i had school monday (or at least i dont think i did).
i took 300mgs monday morning before school. i didnt want to go through the day sober. 
i had an amazing time being out of my mind and going through my classes in a daze. 
i did the same routine gradually upping the dose the next few days. 
whenever i stop i get extremely depressed, ive burned myself oretty badly during all of this (second degree). 
keep in mind i havent smoked thc at all during this. the triples were enough. 
then this is where it starts to get crazy. 
on wednesday night my friend came over unnanounced, it really confused me, i thought she was a hallucination. 
she smoked me up (by that i mean one bong rip) by then i had already taken 400mg of triples. she found out about it and just really confused me. 
listen, I can’t even tell at this point who’s fake and who’s not. I can’t tell who’s real and who’s not. I don’t know what’s going on. I am living through my days in a daze and I can’t tell anything from reality. 
i really want to just end it. i need help but idk what to do. someone pls tell me what to do. i cant even recall most of this past week. the morning after my friend came over i was so fucked up and shaking so mf bad and was so paranoid i flushed the rest of my pills away. (sometimes during my binge i went out and got 7 more boxes). i just dont know what to do. after smoking the thc w my friend i was having paranoid delusions about getting sent to hell and my mom finding out and calling everyone who i thought was against me. i thought my friend was doing this on purpose. i just dont know ehat to do. 

i should probably mention i did all of this coming off an antipsychotic (abilify). so probs not a good idea (haha).

"Hey Guys!

My best friend has been through abuse by his Nmum. Coming from a toxic family has impaired his mental health since an early adult. He has substance addiction. We always used to think his paranoia about being harmed and persecuted were due to his drug. But later I realised when he’s high yes they became worst but it was an onset condition that he probably didn’t even realise. He hasn’t even realised where and how these thoughts and mental torture started. With my knowledge I feel he might be suffering from CPTSD. The psychological damage from Nmum left him with huge paranoia of people out there to get him, control issues, fear of government institutions and etc. Now he is on a recovery programme and he needs to do mandatory urine test every week. The state will charge him if he fails to report or if tested positive. However, since he has this huge paranoia he feels this procedure is a plot/artificial and thus has failed to show up for it. He has been absent without valid reason for two months. If he doesn’t report in the following weeks, he will be charged severely. We can’t seem to get him help such as seeing a mental health professional or anyone as he is rather avoidant. He just wishes isolation. Many times he even suspects me and mistrust me. Right now he has isolated. How do we get him help and what’s running through his mind? 

He has substance addiction too to cope with the cptsd. I really don’t know how to help him.",5,paranoia

"Hi, I am a 22 year old female. I am in the deepest depression I have ever experienced.

I got my degree this year and am in the middle of my Honors program. I have put so much pressure on myself for the last 5 years of studying, that I've been suppressing my anxiety and depression almost the entire time. I have been in fight or flight mode for years, and am so burnt out I can't get myself to do anything. A few weeks ago, I was put under a lot of stress with my studies and the flood gates just opened without warning. Now, I can't open an assignment, textbook or anything academic related without having debilitating waves of panic attacks. It feels like my mental capacity has been deteriorating exponentially since then. I can't enjoy anything I love anymore either. I am lucky enough to have a very supportive family, however none of them have experienced this (aside from my sister that has moved away). They do not understand how crippling my anxiety has been. I have no apatite, and I cant even get myself to go shower, let alone get any work done. It has come to the point where thoughts I am having thoughts of self harm and even sometimes suicidal ones. I've secluded myself from all of my friends, and only see my boyfriend and family (whom I have been loving with throughout my studies). I am at the point where I feel nothing but pain. It feels like I can not mentally function.

I have no idea what to do about my studies. I have adopted an avoidant lifestyle, even though I love what I am studying. I feel like I need to terminate or pause my studies until next year, and give myself time to work through all of this, but am so embarrassed about my mental state that I don't know what to do. I have a therapy appointment on the 22nd of this month, but I have no idea how to make this decision without counseling, and I need to make this decision as soon as possible because of the financial implications of my studies. I don't know what to do.",2,depression

"Advice and also discussion:

I'm convinced that people think I'm bad looking or plain.

Looking at people who look how I want to look makes me feel so sick that it stops me from leaving the house sometimes. When I do go out, I tend to keep my hood up and not wear my glasses so people can't see me and I can't see people.

I've tried to talk about it with my closest friend and my elder sibling but both of them told me that the looks I'm seeing on instagram are 'unattainable' and that 'we can't all be models'. I just felt like they were calling me ugly, or at least, not beautiful. I want people to think I'm beautiful so, so, so badly.

I also do have a therapist but I don't seem to be making progress regarding this source of anxiety. 

I have really bad anxiety about this and it's making it harder to make friends. Every time I think about it too hard I have to spend hours calming myself down to get on with my day.

Does anyone else feel this way? How have you coped? Does it get better with time? What do you advise?",4,anxiety

" Hello redditors, I came here to share a story that might be of some benefit for people like us. Several years ago, I started univer-isty in a town far away from my home town, because I hated living with my parents, even though I have two little brothers that I love very dearly and enjoy being around them.

So my university started with a lot of excitement and sense of freedom, I was going to university to party and have fun, studying was the last think on my list; I was very anxious, a virgin, no friends in the new town, very self-conscious, I felt ugly and had a generally bad attitude towards myself. So with this shitty baggage, I was drinking multiple times a week partying as much as I can and making as many friends as possible. I was basically playing the popularity game, yet at the same time avoiding all of my insecurities and not working on any of them, since I hated myself there was no room for the thoughts to fix them. Not long after drugs came into the picture and I was ""testing"" all the different drugs a student could try, psychadelics were my favorite, since they take you to a different dimension far from reality. Once in a while when I would feel very down, I'd go back to my mothers house and spend a few weeks with my brothers and that seem to recover me for the time being.

After doing this for about 9-12 months, having very little emotional or mental idea of some sort of breakdown, that is soon to happen, I just continued. Not long after about a year into, I woke up one morning, just a usual day but I was feeling like something big was missing on the inside, I litterally could feel a massive void inside of me, like my soul/being was missing. Really weird and scary feeling that I again tried to escape, by being ""productive"" to keep my mind off it. Same night, as I am going to bed to lay there, I am left with that feeling inside and if I look into it, I have an instant panic attack, where my brain is telling me that I will die if I continue, so I stop and shake uncontrollably for a few hours, I call myself an ambulance because I'm not sure what is going on, for some reason I get distracted and forget that I had an ambulance coming in so I miss it. Next day it's exactly the same and for the next two weeks my days look completely exact, I feel like I'm running away from someone for the whole day and at night time I shake uncontrollably for hours, sweating and feeling like my heart will stop any minute.

I wanted it to stop.

So I seeked help and found help in books, within the next few weeks I read like 8 books on emotions, depression, fear, mindfullness, budism, stoicism. I was applying all the practises that were being recommended, basically taking non-traditional health path. Within a month I was meditating, journaling and observing myself. During that time I gathered some courage to look at this void of a feeling that I am overwhelmed by. My brain is going crazy as I am taking my attention toward that feeling, I am hearing loud hallucinations, of a siren of some sort, loud alarms ringing in my ears, I am seeing exclamation marks in my mind eye, warning signs and everything else my paranoic brain could come up with and simply decided to laugh at it, which made me trancend it immediately it was almost shut down by my attitude towards it. Yet there was still the feeling in my body, as I sank my attention into it, the feeling was growing and it was taking over my body, I was feeling cold, empty and dead. This feeling was growing and consuming my body, I felt like I'm either going unconcious or dying. Because I was in my bed, I knew that I couldn't die just like that and as the feeling was taking my body into death, I allowed it. I was okay to die there and then, laying in bed. As I accepted my death, the void feeling that was in my body, instanly switched to a feeling of ecstasy, please kind in mind that I was sober for a month now and feeling of ecstasy in your body is not something that you feel every day. As this feeling exploded in my body, I was seeing angels in my mind eye, probably due to christian culture I was raised in, my mind symbolised, love and peace in that imagery.

After this event the feeling of a void was gone, never to be seen again and with it, the paranoia and panic attacks dissapeared from my life. I felt at peace with myself for the next 3 months and then old thought patterns came back, the hateful ones toward myself. When I realised that these thoughts and beliefs about myself were the root of the problem, I started addressing them one by one, every single day for the next year, I went sober for a whole year, no alco nothing. Everything I became aware of a pattern in my mind that I didn't like, I would take a journal, question my assumtions and beliefs, write them out on paper, and make for and against argument on them, review the experience that caused that belief and try to view it from a different perspective, one that isn't as damaging to me. Usually it meant that some people needed to hear something from me and some difficult conversations were held to settle old issues, sometimes it was so easy that I simply got emotional as a kind and assumed the worst and ended up believing it.

Now 3 years later I am mentally in the right place at the right time, I know what is important to me, I live my life by my own rules. I got a girlfriend, a job I like, an apartment, a new car, I eat what I want, I go on vacations several times a year, I been helping a few friends with their mental health for the past few years, recommending books and ideas, in the end it comes down to if we want to solve the problem and it comes from an honset and genuine place inside of us, if we do, we find a way to do it. Sometimes it means confessing something to a stranged or a friend, and them listening to you is really enough to let go on the situation. So my fellow redditors, if any of you feel like you want to talk, dm me and we can talk about it, playing a game or doing whatever.",5,paranoia

I was at an appointment and when talking to the receptionist, I noticed she had shaved her arms. After that I began noticing it in women and realised I did not, and had never, shaved my own arms. I started obsessing over it as something I should do, did I miss this in my “what women should do to be accepted in public” repertoire, is anyone noticing my arms are different, etc.

So, yesterday I finally shaved my arms, and I hate it. I don’t feel like myself anymore. It feels like my arms are not mine.

"I guess that in God's infinite plan for you, everything that is happening to you, he's already seen all the possible outcomes of it and he knows how it all ends.

I wonder if free will really exists then.

Of course, being the good Christian that I am, the first voices immediately felt like demonic possession,...

Even after I was led to believe that I was born with a defective brain...

Even after They hooked me on meds that strangely and shockingly numbed down the voices ..

I still believe they were demons...

I mean how could I not?

Oh how scared I was ...

How many Ave Marias I recited...

How crazy I became...

After the first few shots, after the voices disappeared, the trauma I was left in forced me to not even trust my own thoughts...

Imagine believing that you're not alone in your head, only to then be really alone...which is scary? The former opens doors to a world you never thought possible and the latter leaves you in utter confusion. You live in terror which is then replaced by fear of the unknown.

I don't know if I am starting to sound cryptic but you have to experience it to understand.

It has been years and I am still taking the shots. Why? On the off chance I was really born with a defective brain, why not take them?

As for the demons, well I'm no saint, I guess it was bound to happen somehow, not really a good Christian and I know for a fact that God never cared about me in the first place.

I'm just tired of trying to make sense of things that I don't understand...

I feel like no matter how much I try to live a better life, I always hit a wall...I guess that with how unpredictable nature is, even when I ve got somethings figured out, I'll keep hitting a wall until I reach the real hell to be tormented by the same demons for all eternity.

"I made a post yesterday asking how to know when you need to seek professional help. Today, I happened to end up in the situation perfect for me to seek the school counselor. Such a coincidence right? And I guess I must've been insane because I decided to. And lol that essentially felt like public humiliation and I'm  never seeking help ever again.

First of all, they informed me that discussing anything related to self-harm or suicide obliged them to inform parents and the relevant authorities. Although, I guess I expected it. But that just means that the only legitimate reason I had for seeking help couldn't be a reason anymore. 

Still, I decided to talk about friendship-related stuff instead. I even teared up a few times (which made it worse because why did I break so easily and why did the person's words even mean anything when I knew they thought I was a joke). They were judging me the entire time I was there, as if I was an immature teenager who was overly concerned with friends and obviously lacking life experience because life isn't all about friends. Fair enough, I am. But I wasn't expecting it. I used the term 'emotionally unavailable' at some point, which may have been slightly off because I just wanted to describe being too emotionally overwhelmed for anything, but then the counsellor basically clowned me for the rest of the session with that term lmao. They kept laughing whenever they said it 'to put it in my words', along with things.

Not that I want to discourage anyone else from seeking help. Please do. This is just my personal experience. Perhaps I expected too much of a school counselor. Perhaps I didn't even need to seek help in the first place. Either way, I'm never doing it again. I tried taking a step towards getting better and now I'm two steps back.

"Hello everyone,

I am carrying out an **online study** as part of my clinical psychology doctoral training. I am interested in understanding more about how people’s relationships are related to their experiences of psychosis.

This study is open to **everyone who has experienced psychosis** (no formal diagnosis required), which might include experiences of things like hallucinations and/or paranoia. 

The study involves completing some online questionnaires, which will take around 30 minutes to complete. There is an opportunity to enter a prize draw once you have completed the survey to say thank you for your time 😊.

Your participation would be greatly appreciated, and please do feel free to share this link!

"This is my first time in this community, but I figured this would be the best place to ask.

I have had anxiety and panic related issues for as long as I can remember. I have put a lot of effort into trying to maintain it and live normally, breathing exercises and whatnot. However, somewhat recently, I have begun to have vivid, memorable nightmares. I won't go into detail about them, but its gotten to the point that I've been often sleep depriving myself just so I don't go to sleep. Its hard for me to call them nightmares because, I used to have nightmares, but never ever to this degree of intensity. I tried explaining this to my roommates, but they didn't really seem to understand it as a problem, saying ""that just sounds like a bad dream"".

My doctor recommended that I should probably start taking anxiety medication, but my (also quite anxious) mom is very against it, saying she has had nothing but bad experiences with anxiety meds. I also worry how the medication would clash with marijuana use, as that is currently how I manage stress, which has been pretty helpful for whenever I've been too stuck in my own thoughts.

I'm incredibly indecisive, but I know something has to be done, because I have to sleep in order to work. So, should I ask my doctor to start me on medication? Or perhaps there is something else I could be doing to help   myself out? I also want to start therapy, but I don't know if I can afford to cover it, even with insurance.

"im 33 and ever since ive left college i feel like i've just been consistently trying to process/deal with feeling overwhelmed by how lonely and isolating adulthood is. Everyone i know is busy enough where i only see my 'friends' once every 3 months(at best). I get it, kids, jobs, im not blaming people. When trying to meet people, its like swimming upstream to find people with any common interests, and even harder finding someone that has chemistry with you. i have chronic digestive problems so i cant really go out to eat or drink, which makes up a majority of how adults socialize from what i can tell. To be entirely honest, i dont like doing that anyways, i find no joy in being surrounded by loud strangers, so while most people are grabbing a drink to feel connected, i only feel isolated. 

 I have a helpful strategy of being paranoid of my depressive thinking patterns, but its not as effective here because while I feel like ive lost my passion for anything i was passionate for, im starting to get paranoid that my depression is either so invasive that its tricking me into believing life is this empty, or (when i think about it logically) being a lonely human all the time is making me depressed and passionless. I spoke to my girlfriend about joining clubs to try to meet people and i literally have zero interest. I hate large groups of people, and meeting new people in this manner. I just get anxiety and i will feel uncomfortable the entire time, and not to be overtly negative, but ive tried it enough times with no success that ive lost my desire to 'get back out there' so to speak, because its always amounted to lost time and stressful experiences, and having a lot of phone numbers i dont want to call.

Anyways, the one thing i miss about my college experience was having a community of people i would see every day that was working on the same goals and could help eachother out, or hangout regularly. Now it just feels like im floating in a sea of nothing, waiting for a random ship to sail by, and im not looking forward to doing this for another 20, 30, or 40 years. This isnt fulfilling.

"Yesterday I had a constant high level of anxiety that was so crippling I thought I was losing control and lost my mind and losing my life. I also had poor stomach health, and felt so nauseous, weak and sick. 

I’m on meds for stomach (IBS) etc so I thought it was the meds that gave me anxiety and that it was just my stomach displeased with the foods I ate. I sleep it off and I’m ok, had a pleasant day. 

At night after decorating cakes my narcissist grandma hurls some passive aggressive insults that sent me spiraling. It hurt me so bad, and then I felt nauseous as hell and I kept feeling light headed, dizzy, faint conscious and like puking. I’m sure she knew what she was doing.

Then I recalled an art TikTok where the commenters were bashing a beginner artist with things like “are u 8 drawing like that” and I clicked on their profiles and I laughed thinking THEY WERE THE 8 Y/OS, with their appearance being literal children and felt so bad thinking they must be parroting awful things they’ve heard from people and when my grandma said this I was haha.

"As i've grown older I've became more happy in my own company I have got rid of friends that I felt didn't treat me the way I treated them and I felt happy with these decisions but with this then gradually spent a lot more time on my own.

With this I've then also noticed i'm now unable to keep a job for any longer than a few month before I lose/leave it.

It's hard to explain but whenever I start a job I go into it with the set plan of i'm going to just do the job professionally like I'm a robot, Limit my interactions with others to nothing more than small talk and everyday will run like clockwork same rules/structure/plans etc and this is how I am able to keep my mind happy.... I thrive on structure/plans and organised.

However this can itself lead to paranoia as I start to feel others might find me boring/cold etc.... but I dont mind too much as this is when I do the job best but also I know there is no way I could have said or done anything to have offended anyone or be judged on as i've limited my interactions to the bare minimum and I always do my work on time/correctly.

I purposely try to behave this way because I know if I let it slip that I can be very chatty/goofy and an oversharer and with these qualities might say/do something to offend someone or lose respect from others.

What I mean by this is my natural personality is very chatty/weird/kind and goofy and over time when people get to know me they begin to take liberties with me as something about my personality screams "" we can take the mickey out of them and they will be cool with it "" and also when I let it slip my paranoia begins to kick in as i'm constantly analyzing all my interaction I've had that day combing for anything I could have said that may have offended someone or given them reason to think less of me/mock me or talk about me to others.

I dont seem to have a middle ground... 

I'm either Robocop - Super serious, controlled, work is done on time and very well organised with zero chance of having said or done anything to offend anyone and i leave work fairly happy only worrying people think I'm a dick for not interacting but fear nothing more.

Or

I let my guard down and then begin to slip into goofy mode... work turns to crap and i become a paranoid weirdo that overshares and regrets every interaction I make and then spends the rest of the day worrying I've said or done something wrong to someone and it starts to spiral.......

At this point is when I end up leaving my job.. I can't seem to keep the charade up.

"\[tw: mentions of suicide\]

i'm 18 now, turning 19 in a month. i don't feel like an adult, let alone a functioning one

im currently in university, but it's horribly overwhelming. everytime i'm on campus i end up getting overwhelmed and having to go to the bathroom to cry or have a meltdown. i need to bring my sweater and headphones with me otherwise i start bawling and become non-functional when im outside. i regularly get overwhelmed in public and end up just crying for no reason

i don't know how to cook. or clean. or even sweep the floor. going out of my room is a struggle. even making a sandwich is too much for me sometimes. one time when i did manage to make one, the butter i'd put on it tasted wrong and i had a breakdown. i know this makes me sound extremely privileged, but i grew up with a domestic helper doing everything for me so essentially ive never lived independently.

showering is also near impossible for me, i can only force myself to after weeks when my hair gets horribly greasy and gives me awful sensory overload. i dont think ive brushed my teeth in two or three years either because of the way it feels on my gums

i don't mask well. everytime i talk to nt people, im just dead silent with a poker face. i can talk to people like waiters or cashiers but even then my speech is incredibly stilted and awkward. talking itself also feels physically painful sometimes idk hwo to describe it. the only thing i can focus on are my special interests. everything else feels impossible. it's cliche but i really cannot even begin to understand how im ""supposed"" to act. i can be quiet and not stim in public but that's it. and half the time i do stim at home i end up injuring myself out of my control

and whenever i think about living on my own i start breaking down. i don't think i can do it. i'm convinced im either going to die in my parents' house or end up committing suicide in some way

whenever i hear about autistic adults who can function independently and just require a little structure  in their lives or something i get really envious. i know it's not a competition but i feel like im mentally 12 years old at all times and i don't know how to take care of myself or do anything by myself; even my younger brother has told me i act ""so autistic"" and he ends up taking care of me a lot of the time",1,autism

"Hi everyone,

I've written on this subreddit a few times. I have schizophrenia and my condition has always been very stable. I've always been positive and really my condition has worked out reasonably well, although it took a lot of time (years really) for it to become just a normal part of my life. I once wrote on this subreddit that the voices in my auditory hallucinations are my friends. This has always been true, the slight murmur of these kindly voices has always helped me. They tell me they care, and in some way are my companions. They are not very real just in the background really, but somehow I find them comforting - and certainly my medication helps me manage this constant part of my life (as it can be distracting.. amongst other things it keeps the energy low somehow).

I did not really understand that there could be bad hallucinations until recently. In my experience up until then I thought they (the hallucinations) could be tamed just by talking to them, or saying comforting things - I learned this as a coping strategy for when things seemed a bit surreal. It wasn't always easy with the voices there, certainly not all the time, and I could misunderstand how my feelings were projected by the voices - in a way they just respond to what's happening around me it seems. I have always loved them as a part of my life, it just makes me be me, although there were times I wished I could just be normal. In a way it was just that I was generally stressed at the time (it isn't easy finding out you have schizophrenia) - although now so long as I can find my peace, I just realize that I am normal.

However I did have a bad voice. I now think I did not understand how others felt on this subreddit, although I really did relate on people's situations. The way the bad hallucination spoke to me, I could tell the voice hated me. I don't know why this would have appeared to me, as my medication still works wonders. The voice really tried to torment me and wished every curse and hatred upon me.

I did not ever give up hope, and I knew this hallucination is nothing I personally consider about myself, and it has got better. Just by talking my way through it and staying strong I withstood it. I also distracted myself with plenty of other things to do - and filled my life with all the good things I could (as I try to do anyway). (I really like looking for free activities to do, or just stuff online etc.)

In a way this wasn't the first time a voice like this had occurred, but it had only ever lasted for a few hours - and so infrequently (maybe twice ever), I did not really remember or think of it as a bad symptom. There has been quite a lot of negative stimulus in the media which may have triggered it - and I find any negative stimulus can make my situation a bit worse (but generally I just don't watch TV anyway).

&#x200B;

So I just wanted to reach out to all of you, and say I really feel for you everyone. Keep safe, stay well. Wishing you peace.

&#x200B;

Edit: I should also say that it got a lot better, but it did take some time. I had to rest pretty much for quite a long time. Also I just did small things to keep active.

This hallucination was a new one also - it was very strange. I'm glad it's gone, but I'm going to look up some more techniques for strategies to cope in case something like this could occur again.",6,schizophrenia

When I'm somewhat calm my oxygen levels are kinda steady around 98%, only sometimes dipping to 97, 96ish and quickly getting back up again.

Not quite 2 years ago I had an X-ray done, when having similar symptoms, with the report showing no acute pathological findings. 

Went to the pulmonologist who told me my lungs look fine.

"I want to provide some context.
When I was 8 I was adopted by my Aunt and uncle (my uncle is my blood, my mother’s brother.) They already had one son which they shared together (let’s call him Teal Blue) and one from my uncle’s previous marriage (let’s call him Rose Red.) 
Rose Red usually split his time between his mother and his dad (my uncle) so Teal Blue and I were raised primarily by my Aunt and Uncle.. Now that you have back story about the family dynamic I want to get to the real point…
So my Aunt has always had body image issues.. she even shared with me that in her early adult years she suffered from anorexia. Ever since I moved in with them at the age of eight I’ve known her to be insecure about her weight and she runs at minimum 5 miles a day.
Even now in her mid 50s she runs sometimes 10 miles in one day. She’s thin and weighs about 120 pounds but still calls me and says “Omg I need to lose weight.” Now this bothers me at times because I’m much heavier than her but that’s not my issue because I’m not insecure about my weight at all.
My issue is that both me and her bio son (Teal Blue) have always been a bit on the heavy side. Again, Rose Red lived with his mom most of the time so he doesn’t struggle as much with weight because he didn’t really eat my Aunt’s cooking. AND SHE COOKED AND GOT FAST FOOD A LOT.
The fact that me and Teal Blue have been overweight and struggled with bad eating habits really bothers me since my Aunt is a health and fitness coach and she herself is thin. (I’ve expressed that to her.)
Once I moved out there was one time that I’d actually become pretty thin because I was eating healthy and running about two miles per day. I’d come home from a college break to visit my Aunt and uncle and my uncle was impressed and called me HOT (in a very normal not weird at all way).. he just wanted to express that he was proud of my weight loss. His wife, my Aunt, responded to him (in front of the kids) “you’ve never called me HOT.” That was almost 9 years ago and it haunts me until this day that she would show jealousy towards a child she raised. 
Now to the REAL point. Anytime I visit them which is very rare these days (mainly on holidays) she always makes me my own “separate batch” of something which I never ask for. I used to think she was just being kind but because of her obvious insecurities I’ve become curious about it. She’ll say to me “I made Mac and cheese but I made you your own separate batch to take home.” When I return home I’ll usually get a text asking if I ate it. Not if I liked it but if I ATE IT. As if she’s making sure I consumed it. This Christmas she offered me coffee and I accepted. She literally asked me five times if I finished it “hey did you finish the coffee?”
… “did you finish your coffee” over and over again she asked and she did not make it herself so it’s not like she’s wondering if I liked it. And not once did she ask if I liked it only if I finished it. Now I’m paranoid because as I said me and her son have always struggled with our weight as kids even though she professionalizes in health and fitness and now that I’m grown and can control my own intake it’s like she forces food down my throat whenever I visit. I know she has this thing where she likes to be the thinnest person in group pictures and I just don’t know how to feel. Maybe she never wanted us to have body image issues and over fed us out of love? How would you feel?",5,paranoia

"Hi from Germany! 
I have negative thoughts all day long. 
When I have a very (paranoid) episode, I am completely convinced that someone has all information about me and is spreading it. In 2014 I lost my smartphone and when I got it back all the pictures were gone. At that time I was already struggling with negative thoughts about other things and was very suspicious of my surroundings.
Strangely enough, in 2014 I didn't have any obsessive thoughts after my smartphone disappeared. In the meantime, however, I think about it all day long. I think in all situations that people have private information about me. When people around me laugh, I think that they are talking about me.
But not only that, I also have other (paranoid) thoughts that keep coming from time to time. In the meantime I also suspect that former friends want to harm me.
When I am in a bad phase, I also look for evidence and spend a lot of time with it. So for all my negative thoughts I find evidence if I search.
At the beginning I thought that only my pictures were stolen. Meanwhile I think that they have synchronized my Google account or installed a spy app. 

Finally, I can say that since 2014 it has never happened that a picture or something similar was ""published"" about me.
The only thing I feel is that since 2016, I have been treated extremely unfairly in my work. For this I also have concrete facts. I do not have a plausible reason for this. Therefore, I can only speculate.
Physically, the compulsive brooding costs me a lot of strength.
Especially when I have an (paranoid) episode, then I can not sleep, have to throw up and feel extreme restlessness. I have realized that I have to change something.

Even if my fears are true, how can I stop the negative obsessive thoughts?
And how do I know what are paranoid delusions and what are legitimate fears and worries?",5,paranoia

"For context, I live in Canada and I work for a large financial co-operative in the Property and Casualty insurance sector going on nearly 7 years now. I work from home which I enjoy tremendously. I like the work I do although it can get overwhelming at times. I like the people I work with and I really like the organization as well. We have had many restructures at work; teams have been amalgamated, managers have come and gone, temp assignment coworkers stepping in place of managers while the role is being filled... it's been a wild ride. I received my ADHD diagnosis 3 years ago. During my time with said employer, I have had my fair share of ups and downs being put on Attendance Plans for taking too much sick time off, Performance Improvement Plans due to my inconsistency at work, and was given 2 write-ups for performance related actions (these only stay on HR file for 3 years and have since expired). In the past 2 years I have been consistent and done excellent work, but as anyone with ADHD knows these flashes in the pan can fade and you're hit with little to no motivation - this is where I am now.

During year 4 with my employer I went on a leave for 1 year which led to my ADHD diagnosis with a psychologist after years of struggling with depression and anxiety along with on and off alcohol abuse. I do take medication but it's effectiveness varies. I am speaking with a therapist but effectiveness also varies. Right now in the midst of yet another restructure, one of the best managers I have ever had the joy of working under left after 2 weeks. This was devastating as he had given me so much support with my issues; lots of guidance, empathy and understanding. I am yet again in limbo waiting on a permanent manager and I am anxious to see what kind of individual this person will be.

To get to the meat of it - I am on a ""Sick Note Program"". This means that I must provide a sick note from my GP (who is amazing and very helpful) every time I am off. This has been no issue. Since the temp assignment manager has shown up they have now told me I need to list my ""limitations"" in the note in order to get paid. This has been a struggle since any time I tell my GP I need the note to list my limitations she hesitates. She tells me they do not need to know this information. I had one manager ask me to get a write-up of my diagnosis from my doctor, to which my GP politely said ""the fuck you don't"". I have also been taking too many breaks at work as my mental health has declined and I am into the alcohol again... I was then notified by my temp assignment manager that this may put me on another Performance Improvement Plan which I *really* do not want to go through again. I was only just advised very recently that I can use a certain ""time off unpaid"" code on my schedule if I need a longer break here and there and I am floored as to why I was never told earlier as I could have utilized it sooner.

I want to put heavy emphasis on the fact that **I know employers are not friends or family and they only care about their bottom line.** The organization I work for puts a strong emphasis on mental health and employee support at work but I feel left out. I have made each manager/temp manager aware of my diagnosis/struggles/need for accommodations but since management has been coming and going this is getting very tiring and I am feeling ashamed/burned out. I took this week off to regroup and get back on the bandwagon - I have a call with my GP today and we are going to work on a new action plan. Mental health struggles are never linear. We go through ups and downs, set backs and great strides. I am frustrated by what I feel to be a lack of transparency on employer's side, but I also feel great fear of losing my job. I don't know what sort of accommodations I can have made, and I am worried I am going to be let go. HR is not your friend, but I want to protect myself as much as possible yet I am afraid of reprisal.

Thanks for reading.

"Some neurotypical people say that people with autism don't show empathy, and sometimes seem like disturbing psychopaths. As a person with autism, I think the argument can be understood that neurotypical people don't show empathy and seem like disturbing psychopaths. To be clear, I do not believe this in the slightest and am using a metaphor to better explain how autism does have empathy. Instead, my point is that both arguments are incredibly similar.

I can't speak for other people with autism, but personally, I experience empathy through having an intellectual understanding that someone is feeling an emotion. I think it's rather obvious, but if I don't know someone is feeling an emotion, I can't really feel empathy. It just doesn't make sense, and wouldn't be genuine anyway.  


I've heard some neurotypical people (who I am not suggesting in any way are representative of all neurotypical people, but are a large enough group to bother me) say that people with autism don't have empathy, and are cold in the face of people suffering. Specifically, I've seen the argument made multiple times that people with autism could watch someone suffer and just... not care.

&#x200B;

However, I can easily imagine some people with autism making nearly that exact argument against neurotypical people (which again, is not an argument I support, it just illustrates why the first is bad). The argument goes something like this: neurotypical people only show caring for those whose suffering they can see, and not for anyone else. Specifically, the argument would say that neurotypical people care more about the aesthetics of suffering than anyone's actual pain. There is evidence that could be presented for such a thing too. Check the amount of media coverage, legislative action, and concern whenever a massive, violent event happens and people are hurt or killed. However, anything that doesn't have that violent flair to it is often left forgotten even when it affects many more people. So neurotypical people (so says this hypothetical argument which is WRONG) would condemn people to pain and suffering because of aesthetics outside of these people's control.

&#x200B;

I obviously don't agree with that argument, neurotypical people DO have empathy (obviously), but I thought it would be interesting to share because it illustrates exactly why it's sister argument is wrong too. Autistic people (like me) DO have empathy, we just show and understand it different. It's precisely BEAUSE we care and want people to be happy, that some neurotypical people think we don't.

&#x200B;

In one of my classes at school, we had a discussion about 9/11 which prompted me to feel rather horrified at how important the event is considered, and the rest of the class seemed put off that I suggested it is given too much weight. So I wanted to share my feelings about that here cause it is sorta bothering me. Like, numbers-wise, compare something like terrorism to something like overdoses or workplace injuries... just, wow...",1,autism
"So basically I (F20) met a guy(M23) on tinder. He lives across the world, I’m from Kazakhstan, he’s from the US. We got really close through texting over more than a half a year and we had one call. I would tell him about my problems, he’d tell me about his and all of that. 

Then one time I complained how I had a hard time making a living on my job. So he offered me money. First time I refused, but next time he insisted and I took it. It was $120. Then he gave me $200-400 every month (april-june). And when I got uncomfortable with it, I told him I don’t want it anymore.

We planned living together in September for a month. He’s going to come to Kazakhstan, which is kind of weird in the first place. And I was excited for it to happen but now I have this sick fear about him being some murderer because of how weird our relationship is.

Also he gets very offended if someone doesn’t reply to him or leaves him on read, and it’s understandable. But these occurrences make him doubt humanity. 

He also doesn’t have any friends irl, hasn’t had a girlfriend and is a virgin. He has trouble with relationships because he doesn’t really like a lot of people. So he decided to stay away and be a loner because he’s more comfortable with that.

And one more thing, he’s very into serial killers and darknet, reads stuff about them. He says it’s because he’s interested in psychology and history. But it kind of makes me anxious.

And lately I just don’t really want to talk to him because he makes a big deal of people stopping talking to him (online). He thinks everything is a waste of time if he stops talking to someone. And he can be really mean when he has these episodes, tho he always apologizes afterwards.

But generally he was sweet to me and supporting, willing to talk about my problems. He helped me in many ways over this time that we’re friends.

But now I started worrying because I realized that I’m going to live with a guy I never met irl and could know nothing about, like what if he lied to me? What if it’s he’s evil plan? I’m like… paranoid.

I’m scared to calling it all off because he already bought the tickets, booked a place and started packing. I don’t want to be that friend who cancels last minute. And I myself was very pumped and happy about this trip. But I’m very uncomfortable going. I was also diagnosed with schizotypal disorder that can trigger paranoia.

In a month she is shipping out to basic training and I’m just really scared because she’s a big role in my life. She’s always pushed me to achieve my goals and to never give up.i literally remember staying after school with her for her volleyball games and practice just watching her play and helping her out I enjoyed those moments with her. She would stay after school with me while I’m at my track practices and always wish me luck on all my meets and tell me how I can accomplish anything. And she’s literally leaving soon and I’m just so happy for her but so sad that I won’t be able to see her again until a year or two later. At first I was fine since she wasn’t going to be active be now that shes decided that she is going to be active now and wants to travel which I love that for her but I just won’t be able to close to her anymore and it’s just so frustrating because she’s always there for me and now she won’t be around anymore.,4,anxiety

"Hi 
I’m 20, went through a lot of fucked up stuff (abuse etc etc), and still live in the same environment of abuse and all the good stuff you know 
My main issue now is my Major Depressive Disorder , I started anti-depressants at 14-15 years old, I would take it , a while will pass like a year and a half , then it stops working , same happens to the others ( molecules) I would take after the previous stops working but the “working period” gets shorter and shorter , so I’ll take this one , would work for a year , then stops, take the next chosen molecule, works for a little less than a year , then stops working , and it goes on to today, where the last one I tried  , nothing, I don’t respond to anti depressants anymore 


Anti depressants not working = depression symptoms ( and ofc they worsened with time progressively all over thoses years as if it wasn’t enough ) 

I’m doing bad , really bad , I have no word to describe what I’m going through , and no will to since i’ve wrote all the long texts expressing it that all I wanna say now is “I’m living in everyday torture”

I’m currently taking “break yearS” ( yes pluriel) because of my depression, I can’t go finish highschool-> because I can’t study -> because of depression ( right at my last year of highschool🤩 , how lovely isn’t it ?)

Let’s say I went to every psychiatrist in my city so far over the years , and like, 5 psychiatrists when it was official that anti depressants aren’t doing anything ( I didn’t stop taking them and prescribed medication ) 

Everyday is hell , I really don’t have the energy to write a lot about details now, specially that I suffer from other things (anxiety disorder , conversion disorder (hysterical attacks) etc etc) , and  , specially that I just came from the ER for a panic/hysterical attack and first time deciding to tell them I’m extremely suicidal and need assistance ( idk why , Idk how I’m still here despite being extremely suicidal/attempted , let alone ask for help to not do it , I don’t get why it is so hard for me to just do it ) and my “mother” made a scene once here home as she religiously do to make it about her , and my father and “brother” are abusive so I have now flashbacks of all the abuse because my “brother” is being loud with slamming the doors to join her to wherever she took the car keys to go 

Well , back to what I was saying, I did rTMS ( for simplifying to the ones that don’t know about it , basically a machine put on your head that send magnetic waves to create changes in your brain to hopefully fix the hormonal mess in it, you are awake (no anesthesia no nothing, you feel it vibrating and irritating your scalp kinda , that’s it) , and well , IT DIDNT WORK 🤩✨ 

Now the “true plan” is ECT ( yeah electro convulsive therapy , where you are under general anesthesia and they shock you with electricity to create a brief convulsion to , again, fix the mess in your brain) 

Knowing that nothing is for sure when it even comes to the ECT even if it’s the most effective treatment out of everything ( and results don’t last “permanently” anyways ), and that I could , just not feel a change or relapse ( I don’t believe something good can happen to me anymore lol ) 

The question: Am I ever gonna come out of this? Do I just got to accept that : “yep, I’ll never be okay enough to function “almost” like a normal human , this is it , you are now part of the unwanted people in this society my friend, doctors for sure can’t tell you that since it will be contradicting to what they are told as a protocol , but we all know that this is it , this is the end , all that striving so you can come back to having a treatment or something that makes you “almost like others” is from the past now, the reality is , you lost everything , this is it, this is all you’re ever gonna be from now on  ” ?",2,depression

"I had a friend that meant a lot to me. I loved and trusted him a lot, he was among the first people I told when I was diagnosed with ADHD over a year ago. He told me he would support me no matter what, and I believed him. We had a bad falling out 6 months ago and he ended our friendship. I've been grieving and trying to move on, and honestly I've been making progress.  

But a couple days ago I remembered some things he said to me, like ""You require so much reassurance"". He also said things to me like, ""Are you stupid?"",  ""You're trying to manipulate me."", and ""After all I've done for you. After all the accommodations I've made for you"". That one hurts the worst. And yeah, maybe I did ask for reassurance from him more than other friends,  but with the things he said to me,  I never really knew where I stood with him. I would never, ever speak to a friend the way he did to me.

Now I'm sitting here realizing he never cared for me the way I did him. I was nothing but a burden to him.  My heart is breaking all over again.",3,adhd

"Just like the title says, my anxiety and depression is affecting every aspect of my life. Let me start with a little backstory for context of where my anxiety and depression started, if there is indeed even a start point.

Growing up, we were poor. Not just poor, but very poor. Some weeks we couldn't even afford food, so I had to steal food from the Safeway down the road just to eat. Imagine being a 10 year old kid, stuffing all sorts of things down super baggy jeans you wore specifically for that purpose. Hot dogs, macaroni and cheese, basically anything that is ready to eat or easy to cook. When we had money for food, it was $1 12 packs of ramen noodles. 25 cent boxes of macaroni and cheese. 2 dollar boxes of instant mashed potatoes. That was my diet for the first 12 years of life.

Mother was always either married temporarily, or having promiscuous sexual encounters with many many different men weekly. Sometimes both, which is why I put temporarily married, because she's been married 4 times at this point. She's also always abused many kinds of illicit drugs and always been a drunk, I can't remember more than 3 occasions in my entire life where she was sober longer than a week or 2. We never had a car, I walked or rode a bike everywhere I went. 2 hour walk to my first job literally every day. She wouldn't have been able to drive anyway because she spent most waking moments drunk or high on meth (that was always the preferred drug but she would always take what she could get).

Biological father was never around. He was court ordered to pay a grand total of $7.31 a week in child support to help support me and my mother raising me as a single mother my whole life. That's about 30 bucks a month, which covered above stated crappy diet. Mom spent most of our money on the bills we could barely afford on waitress pay, a whopping $2.33/hr (she's only ever been wait staff literally my entire life, never had any other profession besides a short time working for Quiznos as assistant manager but that's a tale for another day).

I spent a lot of time as a kid emulating her behavior. I smoked weed, tried other drugs, and drank a lot. Dropped out of high school junior year to get a full time job to help pay bills. Even with my job, we were still barely making it because the more we had, the more she spent on drugs. It got bad enough at one point she was spending over half our money every month on drugs. Just enough for the crappy diet to continue and bills paid. It was horrible and there's a lot more to it, so if you'd like further information on my childhood, I can get to it in the comments but this post is already getting long as is so I'll leave my childhood where it's at.

Fast forward to the summer of 2008. I was 19 and I was trying to get away from my life slumming it on people's couches and smoking weed until I felt nothing, and drinking until I forgot everything. I needed a change. I had met a girl on Facebook and she sent me money to move. This is a long story as well, so let's suffice to say I thought I was in love with her so I moved to California to be with her (from Wyoming where most of what happened above took place). Long story short, things did not go as planned and we went our separate ways. Except that I didn't have anywhere to go because I was broke in the middle of California with no job and nowhere to live. I ended up joining a weird almost culty Christian sober living program and ended up in a household with 5 other people who used to be drunks and drug addicts. I was going nowhere with this as well, so I did the most sensible thing I could (that's what I thought at the time) and joined the Marines. 

My time in the military can be summarized in one statement of two facts: I was drunk and lonely. I spent most of my time working obviously, but every spare second I wasn't working I was drunk. I got admitted to a rehab program the Navy offered at the time and was booted out of the Marines literally a couple days before my End of Active Service date, because I failed the program. Someone brought in vodka in a water bottle and I was busted with them. I ended up losing the promotion I was about to receive to NCO, and because it was a general under honorable conditions separation, it's still considered an honorable discharge but I lost my benefits, mainly the one that could've helped me. My college benefits under the Post 9/11 GI Bill. 

So I went back to Wyoming and continued crashing on couches for a while until an old childhood friend, who also joined the military but different branch, offered to let me move up to live with him and get on my feet in a different state. Time for another change, this one ended differently though. I moved in with him, got a job, and actually started improving. Met my wonderful wife at that point and we've now been married for almost 10 years, so there's a silver lining. Problem is, I've been through lots of life threatening situations, I've been through lots of drugs and drinking. My brain at best feels like it's incomplete. I'm constantly worried about health problems but also worried about the money it would take to get looked at by a doctor. I'm also worried because I don't feel good enough for my wife and most aspects of our lives together have been affected. Sex life, mental health (we both have anxiety and depression, I also think I still have ADHD that I was diagnosed with as a kid and never ""grew out of"") and financial wellness. Again, I won't go into detail, as this post is long already and we have the comments to discuss. 

I guess this is just to vent, but I honestly don't know what to do because I'm constantly irritated by everything and always angry. Constantly depressed and worried about things. Also not good at communication. Get mad or irritated with the stupidest little things. I'm trying to be a better husband but also have almost zero motivation to even get up and move around let alone go do something for her as a gesture to show her how much I love her. Any advice for someone who is having a hard time understanding life at this point?",4,anxiety
"I don't understand why everything I do need to be quick. I don't understand why even when I am doing chores or if I'm doing my things before chores I need to be quick. If I don't, I'll get scolded. I don't understand why I'm not allowed to take my time.

 My parents always scolded me ""I'm always the one doing this, that. You never do anything you're always so slow!"" They said without fail every single day. You might think maybe I'm overreacting or if I'm actually the problem because of what they said. I think so too. But this has been going for so long and it actually affected my mental health and my daily life.

I've always felt rushed. I feel like if I don't do anything soon or if I'm even resting not doing anything I'm useless, I'm garbage, human waste, I never ever do anything! For example, when I'm waiting for the bus even if it is a little late I would be nervous as if I've done something wrong and started waiting outside of my house eventhough it's actually still early.(my bus comes to my house) or when my father came to pick me up from school I need to get on the car fast. Even if I'm a little late because I waited for the kid in front of me to get on their car, I'll be scolded. 

I don't like the feeling of being rushed as if I don't do nothing I'm useless. I can't even take my time because I felt like I'm being wastefull. If someone does something for me I feel like a burden. I always feel restless because I think I don't deserve the time to rest. I need to do anything fast. Fast. I guess that was when I started to hate that word. 

Why do we need to be fast in everything to do? Does this mean we have to die fast too? If we can then I would be glad. But that is the only thing god wouldn't gave me. Even if I prayed I guess I would die if I get little older? I've always wanted to take a look of the afterlife. Whatever it is I hate the need to be fast. But I can't rest myself because it has been embedded in my mind that I need to do something fast. The only time stop was when I'm sleeping. Then I wouldn't have had to worry about anything. In that dream, it was a given that we would be so slow. If only I coulde sleep eternally, like aurora except without the true love kiss. 

When I don't do anything fast, there will be consequences. I.will.be.scolded. No matter where it is. I hate living so much. But I don't have the courage to end my life. I can only hope my natural death would be near.",2,depression

"I just realized how bad my depression has gotten, and I’m not even sure that I care. My life has been long and tiring and sad. My mom died when I was 7. My first husband committed suicide when I was 26 (he was 27) on Christmas leaving me with 3 and 1 year old daughters. My second husband abused me, cheated on me, broke me into a million pieces. I eventually got the strength to leave him and start over, but it left me in a terribly financial place. I was laid off last year. I finally have a good job again but I feel like an imposter. 

I don’t think that my kids (now 21 and 19) need me anymore, or particularly want me around. I’m alone most days, with my cats. It’s lonely. 

Due to my layoff, I just had to file bankruptcy. Which, because I was trying to keep my house, meant filing Ch 13. Those payments will leave me with barely enough to pay my utilities. 

I cashed in my entire retirement between leaving the ex and being laid off. I’m flat broke. I will never be able to retire. (I’m in my mid 40s). 

In 3 years, my life insurance through work would pay out enough to leave my kids with a solid nest egg, and my youngest should be through college. I’m just not sure that I can make it that long. 

I’m not even sure why I’m posting. I usually get high when I feel like this, and I’m better for about a week. But then the numbing darkness comes back. I’m sober as a judge and will keep being so since I cannot afford weed anymore. I’m on meds for depression but I’m not sure that they even make a dent. Because if I feel this shitty on them, what would I be like OFF them? 

Thanks for reading. I guess that I just needed to get this out. I have a large family and I cannot talk to any of them about this because I don’t want to disappoint them. Or worse, have them not care and tell me it’s all in my head. I know it’s in my head. What I don’t know is how to fix it. I know that other people in the world have had a worse/harder life.

"I feel like I’ve finally reached the last stage of depression which is acceptance. I think there’s 5 stages to depression, or, there has been for me anyway that are the same 5 stages of grief. The first stage was denial, this was stage I was in for the longest, I simply denied that I was depressed. Of course at first I wasn’t actually sure if it was depression, I was only 12 not long started high school so I wasn’t sure if I even fully understood what depression was further than just being ‘sad all the time’. I denied that something was wrong when my parents started to question why I was sleeping at any point I could and why I slowly withdrew from everything that previously granted me joy. I denied that I was suicidal and that I had thoughts about how I would kill myself to the school counsellor at 14 who had been asked to see me due to my declining behaviour in school and increasing distribution to lessons or the increasing amount of times I’d not turn up to the lessons all together. I even denied that I was depressed to myself for a long time, I wrote it off as being a teenager and the crazy hormones that occur when you are that age. 

Anger was the second stage. I was absolutely furious that I felt like this, that I had to be miserable and bitter, that I had to struggle to do even the most basic of things and most of all that it was something so difficult to fight. I was aggressive and mean towards everyone, taking my self hatred and anger out any anything and anyone. Third came bargaining, I rang the GP at least once a week asking about therapy or some form of counselling and was told at least once a week that there is a very long waiting list to see any sort of counsellor and that I was looking at around a year long waiting list until I’d even be able to start counselling over the phone. I prayed to every god or form of omnipotence that I could, I am not religious but I prayed, I begged for god or the universe or anything to help. To make me feel normal, to make me want to socialise with my friends, to let me be satisfied, to let me feel joy, to let me sleep or eat normally, to give me desire to want to do anything with my life, for luck friendship love anything, just to feel happy again. 

Depression was the fourth stage. I know what you’re thinking how can depression be the fourth stage if I’m taking about the stages of depression. To be as frank as possible I was depressed that I was depressed. I was in despair, There was not one single drop of hope left, it’s as if any last bit of light that was still shining in my life  lost power. No therapist or doctor was going to help me, no friend or family member, no god or higher power, nothing I was going to be depressed forever, and this broke me even further. 

I have finally reached the final stage. Acceptance. I have accepted that this is my life. I will always be depressed and thats that kind of. I will never beat this and things won’t get better because I’m 21 and by now they would have. I have no talent, no luck on my side, no future, no hope, no qualifications, no romantic experience what so ever, no good looks, I have nothing. And that is how it will be, that is my life’s path, someone has to be the person that you knew in school who went absolutely no where and lived on a council estate with no job on benefits for there whole adult life and that will be me. I quit my job two days ago. I’ve given up. I’ve accepted it for what it is.

I’m just wondering if anyone else feels like there at this stage or has been in this stage or way for longer and if there is any next steps I’m unaware of. I’m sorry if I’ve gone on too much, I’m not too familiar with posting and once I started typing i couldn’t stop. 

Also I’d anyones wondering why if I’m at this point why don’t I just end it all. I cannot currently do that due to be told by more than one person that if I were to die they themselves would bring about their own death. As you can imagine I do not want to be that cause of someone else’s death especially knowing the people that would be affected by there’s.",2,depression

"Hey reddit.  
  
I've never made a post on reddit before, but I've read alot of post lately because I'm going through some sh\*t and it makes me happy to see a community support eachother, so I thought I maybe give it a shot.  
  
I'm M 24 and I live at a university dorm. Some weeks ago we had a easter party with my dorm kitchen and our neighbour kitchen. When I arrived at the party I saw a girl I havn't seen before and she just moved in a few days ago. I remember looking at her and the thought of her was amazing, but that would never happen. Fast forward a couple of hours and we're making out in the kitchen and after the party we hooked up.  
  
After the party everything just felt right. She's so nice and pretty and I definitely liked her. We found a day where I could help her find some stuff for her dorm room and after that we just sat and chatted in her room for hours. I found out that she was really drunk at the easter party, I was also a little drunk, but I didn't remember her being that drunk. So I started questioning myself if she actually liked me at the party or if she was just drunk. But after that day I just liked her even more cause we have so much in common and I really enjoy being around her.  
  
Fast forward to last saturday (may 6th). We had another party, this time with alot of other kitchens. I hoped that at this party I could figure out what me and this girl had, if it was something or if it was something I just made up. I wanted to be around her all the time, but I didn't want to feel clingy, so I gave her some space and enjoyed the party. After some hours i noticed that she has been talking alot with this guy from my dorm kitchen and I was starting to get at bit jealous. At some point they were in his room, with the door open so I guess they didn't do anything, but my thoughts were all over the place, I decided I had to talk with her about us. So I did that and yeahhh.... She didn't like me back, but would still like to be friends and I told her I was okay with that, I'm not btw, but it was better than it being awkward between us.  
  
Fast forward to now. I've thought alot about everything. I've never had succes with finding someone i really liked like me back, so it's not like this is new to me, but it's just like eveything felt so right this time and I really had my hopes up, but after alot of unsuccessful atempts at finding someone who likes me back I'm starting to lose hope. I get attached to people so quick and I hate myself for it. If I just didn't get attached to her so quick, then this wouldn't be so difficult. I mean, I've known her for maybe a month and that I feel so much for her already irritates me. I'm realy starting to lose hope and hating myself alot for making things so difficult. I'm seeing her again this monday, just to hangout. A part of me wants to keep being around her and try to become friends instead and another part wants to forget about her and just move on even though it would be hard cause we live like 3 dorm rooms between eachother.  
  
I don't actually know what I want to get from posting about this. Maybe it's a cry for help, maybe I want some guidance or maybe I just want to know that I'm not alone in this and that everything is going to be alright. I've just not talked to anyone about this, I've actually not talked to anyone in person for the last 6 days. I just keep to myself cause I'm scared to have a breakdown infront of someone and show them what a mess I am. I feel so hopeless all the time and so alone. I have nothing to look forward to. Every day is just a day I have to get through and I just don't feel like I have anything to enjoy anymore. I sleep most of the day because I enjoy the few seconds when I wake up before I realise what a mess my life is. I'm not thinking about ending it all, I could never do that to my family, but it's starting to worry me that it's actually just my family that's stopping me from doing it. I just feel so depressed all the time and I don't have any motivation to do something with my life.  
  
I'm sorry for grammar mistakes, english is not my first language, but I hope it's readable. Thanks if you've made it this far and if you feel like you could have written some of this then I'm sorry and I want to believe that everything is going to be alright for us.

"I have been severely depressed since I was a child. I have survived several suicide attempts over the course of my life and I honestly don't understand why everyone around me is always surprised when my depression completely takes over.

I suffered at the hands of an alcoholic and abusive father as I grew up. I spent most of my childhood alone and afraid that I would be berated or beaten for the tiniest bit of non-compliance. I didn't even have any real friends until midway through elementary school. I even tried to talk to my parents about how lonely I felt and how I struggled to make friends, but that was met with ""What the fuck is wrong with you? How do you not understand how to make friends? This is normal kid shit. Get the fuck out of my face before I throw something at you.""

Even when I did make friends, my father would go out of his way to embarrass me in front of any friends I had. From forcing my friends to help me perform chores while they came to visit my home, to screaming at me for not doing something as simple as picking up our family dog's poop when my dad wanted to cut the grass, to even saying that my friends are not welcome in the house if they wouldn't help prepare a meal. My friends just stopped coming over and I spent more and more time out of my house. Honestly, my best friend's parents were closer to me throughout childhood and high school than my own family. But it never fixed the gaping hole within my spirit. I always felt so broken and alone.

I was also ruthlessly bullied in elementary and high school. People around me would see me getting punched, kicked, choked, and one time even literally having my bully stomp on my throat in the school cafeteria. No one would ever step up and help, even teachers looked the other way. I'd show up at home with bruises and a couple times with a broken nose, only to have my parents ignore the obvious signs of bullying and abuse. I eventually stopped trying to defend myself. It only made things worse.

My mother was too afraid to challenge my dad as well. They both drank for years until my mother realized how miserable my dad was making her and she decided to stop drinking so much and start exercising.

Things only got worse as I got to post-secondary school. In my first year, my father was so controlling that I got so depressed that I stopped going to my classes altogether. I tried to date to help me find some value in myself, but I began gaining weight so quickly as soon as I stopped playing sports. I gained between 35-50 Lbs in my freshman year and the self-loathing only increased. I was completely unsuccessful in finding a partner, and rejection after rejection only deepened the black hole that is my soul. I tried to off myself again that year for the 5th time in my life, my first time being hospitalized for a suicide attempt.

My father seemed to finally understand how much pressure and damage he had done to me while he saw me lying in a hospital bed, barely clinging to life, but it didn't actually flip a switch in his brain to realize that he needed to change anything. After my required time in a psych ward to ensure that I wouldn't try to kill myself again, I went home, only for my dad to immediately revert to his old, shitty ways.

I continued to try to finish my schooling, switching subjects several times, but I was too depressed to succeed. Any time I started failing tests or assignments, I dropped my class. Three and a half years of this did not result in a degree, infuriating my father to no end. My father refused to hear me when I told him that I was lost and none of my majors interested me. I mentioned that the only solace I had in life was video games, as they were the only things I felt like I excelled in, but that was not a valid option to my father. I tried to take programming courses, but was so depressed that I kept failing out of them, and my father was fed up with paying for my schooling. The only thing left to do was drop out completely, as I did not have the funds to continue going to school.

My parents were also on the brink of divorce at this point. I moved home from school and started to work a minimum wage, dead-end job, which seemed fitting for a pathetic loser like myself.

My father tried with all of his might to pressure me to go back to school, and once he realized that I wouldn't go and I was depressed beyond measure, he tried to force me to go to a psych ward because he was so ashamed of me. I tried to kill myself for the 6th time, and was hospitalized again. That seemned to have put the nail in the coffin for my parents' marriage, as my mother and I completely blamed my father for pushing me straight to the edge of my rope. ""Apologetically"", he offered to take me to a mental health clinic in the city that he worked in, trying to claim that he only wanted the best for me. Sadly, I overheard the truth behind his actions while at his job. He was deeply ashamed of his pathetic excuse of a son. He figured that this was the only way that he would ever be able to get me out of his house and potentially able to work for a living.

I spent multiple more years languishing, literally praying that I would develop cancer and would finally be able to die without any guilt, but I would have no such luck.

I am still alive a decade after my last suicide attempt, and after cutting my father off for a period of time, I was finally able to cobble some form of a life together, going back to school, graduating, and getting a decent job, but the depression has never left and is now back in full force.

The older that I have gotten, the more broken I feel. I've been trapped in a never-ending pit of despair and loneliness, unable to properly connect with all of the wonderful people that have come into my life. I've dated a couple people over the past decade, but never to a point where I could honestly say that I have ever loved my partner, even if they told me that they loved me. If anything, my partners telling me that they loved me immediately scared me and made me push them away. I literally could not understand how they felt or even how they were attracted to me in the first place. Every single one of those relationships ended when my partner eventually got tired of trying to connect with me or they would meet someone better (which to me would be 99.99% of the population). I am now convinced that I am too broken to actually feel love, let alone any form of intimacy, even though it's the thing I want most in the world. I simply don't deserve a partner. I have nothing positive to offer.

I hate myself beyond all measure. I literally feel like I am worth more as an organ donor than a human being. I am tired of existing. I am tired of the constant fucking pain, suffering, loneliness, and the abject nature of my life. I feel like a poison in everyone's lives around me, dragging everyone down, making this world a darker place every day.

I will likely be required to be on medication for the rest of my life in order to be a barely functioning member of society. I am a leech of my region's socialized healthcare system, requiring inordinate amounts of funding to barely hang on. There are so many more worthy people than me. Beyond all of the refugees across the world, there has to be someone who could easily and happily replace me.

All I want is a painless death. My country is contemplating legalizing euthanasia for people whose sole detriment is mental health. If the law is passed, I feel like I will have no other means of escape other than to sign myself up on day one.

My family and the few friends I have are aware of this desire, but the only respond they have had is to tell me some bullshit, placating me, with empty promises of a brighter future. That, or a guilt trip.

So, again, I ask... what's the point of trying to continue when life feels empty and meaningless?",2,depression

Personally I've never celebrated mother's day . My mom left when I was 3 .After a while my family moved in right next to my grandma. I spent so much time with her I basically lived at her house. She got me to go to church to do sports and really everything I did in my life.I would say she was the mom I didnt have. She died though and honestly I miss her so much.She would be so disappointed to see me now anyways.Though maybe I could go for a visit and spend mother's day with her one more time.,2,depression

"Sometimes you just need to get it out of your head and into the world. That's all this post is..
(I don't have these 24/7, but these are the thoughts that fill my brain and really freak me out on bad days.)

My Delusions and Paranoid Thoughts:

- I live in a time loop that has happened over and over again. My life has already happened and I have lived through most moments multiple times already. Each time is slightly different but mostly very similar. 
- Scientists are studying my ideas and actions for research on individuals with non neurotypical brains. My entire life is a lie.
- There are cameras outside my window. Or someone can see through it eventhough the blinds are down. (Sometimes I have to put a sheet over the window to feel better)
- I can empathize with my cats and read their emotions.
- The love of my life is only pretending to love me. It's all a science experiment, or maybe a big joke. Maybe its televised to thousands of people. Maybe the entire thing is a rouse. They don't trust me enough to really love me.
- This life is not real. It's all a dream. Or in my head. I will wake up some day in a mental ward and that's when I'll really have lost my mind.
- People in my daily life are part of an elaborate scam. Not all of them, but some. So you can never fully trust anyone.
- There is a seperate personality living inside my body. Silent and always observing. 
- If I did something crazy enough (like spontaneously go skydiving) then I could break the system I'm stuck inside and  get my free will back.
- My inner thoughts speak to me while I'm drifting off to sleep, but I'm to close minded to hear them.
- If I get high enough someday (on weed, shrooms, acid, or what have you) My personality will fully split and I will be two seperate people. One good and one bad.
- My body speaks to me. (In a phantom way) 
- The art I make gets analyzed by professionals and archived to be used in treating patients with mental disorders.
- My controlling parents have trapped me in their own fake world. Where I believe I have freedom, but it's all in their control.
- The choices I make are pre determined. I can only have so many options.
- People (Managers) at work watch me while I'm on the job. They have to make sure I'm on task.
- I've read all the books in my personal library (I haven't), so what's the point in reading them again if I'm only being studied.
- The tv shows I watch are all directed towards me. They all have a different message to convey. Whether it's about my life, my relationships, my mental health, the fact that I think the tv is narrating my fucking life. (Same with the radio) They are always trying to help though, so it doesn't bother me too much.
- I get baited to watch the same shows over and over again (with gaps in between) to see how I react to them. That data is given to people who analyze my personality. 
- The manifestation of my childhood dragon friend lives in the spirit world and sleeps in the tree next to my old college dorm room. (This one's real interesting).
- My partner brings up the same conversations to see how I react (Similar to the tv shows)
- If I don't double check the door at night to make sure its locked someone will come in and murder my partner. There would be nothing I could do about it.
- If I tell my partner all these intrusive thoughts, they will be terrified and send me to shock therapy.
- Certain tasks in my life have been constructed to measure my strength and endurance. (This makes me work extra hard for no reason)


I might make a part 2 later bc this isn't all of them. It's making me emotional to wrote them down. It's good to get it all out though. 

Real Quick! I have been to therapy, not currently because of my finances. I'm planning on seeing a physiologist or psychiatrist asap. My partner knows I have paranoia and is always very helpful and understanding. Sorry for any typos :)",5,paranoia

"Sorry for the long post
I try to summarize it as hard as it really is for me. 
I have always had a bad relationship with my parents, especially with my mother where since she tended to be very rude because I am the son she never wanted as I was already the 3 'and during pregnancy my father who was an alcoholic at the time beat her so this has already marked (as if I were at fault) being labeled as the unwanted child, the black sheep etc. ...
Being strong in character since I was 4-5 years old when I saw my mother's verbal abuse towards me I (wrongly eh) raised my hands to my mother. Of course how much physical strength could I have at that age? Almost nothing. And after several times that this happened my mother tried to kill me by grabbing me by the hair and making me hit my head on the sink several times. As luck would have it, my older brother saved me.
The abuse from my mother after this event never subsided. But I simply learned to ignore her and keep it all inside (at most telling my father if it was really bad).
The verbal abuse growing up became comparisons to my brother, how he was, better looking, better behaved, more independent etc.... Taking me to make me hate him when I had no envy towards him, on the contrary, I have only good memories.
All this has carried obviously to other consequences, between closing me, distrust in the persons etc... So much so that then I suffered bullying and so on. I have always been happy in my ""loneliness"" because after elementary school I discovered video games (obviously also targeted by my mother). My whole childhood was like this: always fighting with my mother, one day she is the best person in the world, the next day she criticizes anything I do.
After middle school it was always a grow up until I had dozens of friends in high school and up to two groups where I was always among the most loved by the group.
In 5 'high finally I get engaged but after a fight with my girlfriend I get my first panic attack that affects everything I love, questioning everything (and if she does not love you, and if you are actually in the various groups of friends to be teased and if you have always hated even video games etc. ...)
After this event the end. After being the one who listened to his friends for years, he asks for advice for the first time and by doing so everyone looks at me wrong as if I were crazy. The question was just a confirmation of what I was thinking to push away the anxieties (i.e. asked them if it was just stuff in my head or something else). I get looked at sideways and almost made fun of by everyone and no one knows what to tell me. Some people almost forcibly tell me it's like I say, my girlfriend gets mad at me for doubting myself and takes it personally like I don't really love her.
I don't trust my friends anymore and I'm gradually closing my bridges with everyone, even those who used to agree with me (because I wasn't convinced by their answers).
After two years I ask my mother for help now exhausted and my mother every time I bring up something from the past, even if something stupid says that either it's different or it didn't happen at all. For example a few days ago I scold her saying that she is a superficial person who every time she can says if a certain person is fat or has gained weight. And after pointing it out to her she says ""but if you do it all the time too"", I tell her I never did it and she looks at me all weird asking me and: ""and how many times have you done it, few, many, medium"" as if to humor me because she is afraid of her crazy son. 


I have only talked about it with her, my father and my aunt, and a couple of my close friends. One of my friends gave me all his support one day by believing me and reassuring me and the next day he acted almost as if we had never talked about it. My mother acts this way.
A friend of mine also understood me completely but I'm afraid the same thing will happen as with my old friend.
The only ones who continue to always behave are my father and my aunt. 
I don't know what to believe anymore, what if these three people who agree with me are just in my head? 
I really want to understand if it's my mom manipulating me so much and it's my anxiety that overeacts or something else
Until a while ago I was more confident but then one day arguing with my mother she said I always had very few friends. It really makes me doubt everything....",5,paranoia

"Recently, I got into a minor fender bender as I was trying to park my car in for the night. It was slow speed, nobody got hurt and we both exchanged info so it was nothing out of the ordinary. After getting into contact with the other person, I find out they filed an insurance claim right away which I’ll be the first to admit is a smart move.

However, after a bit of back and forth texting, told them that paying out of pocket would be better than dealing with insurance. They said they’d talk to their parents and get back to me which they did a day later and said that it would be ok to do that. So I called up my insurance and told them the situation. At this point, my anxiety really shut off because I won’t have to worry about a mark on my record and paying extra money for insurance for years.

Fast forward to today, they tell me they talked to someone else now they want to go through insurance. I had already called my insurance and told them to cancel the claim after confirming with that person that we were going to settle this on our own. Now they go back on their word and I’ve been trying to convince them otherwise the whole day but they won’t budge.

Now obviously if they want to go through insurance I won’t stop them. But it’s seriously a massive inconvenience to me because instead of paying them $200 to fix a broken headlight and scratched bumper, I’ll instead have to pay probably close to and extra $100 a month on insurance for 3 years until the ticket is off my record. 

So I’ve basically been in and off freaking out with every indecision they make. I’ve spent the week at school and work trying to keep my composure in front of my peers and today I was so stressed, I couldn’t even eat lunch which is usually my main meal of the day. Man, I’ve been saving up for a new car for years now and now I’ll have to wait more because it won’t be worth the extra money insurance is going to scam me out of.

Idk what more I can do to prove I’m trustworthy and that I promise to pay them every cent of the repair. I’ve given them every step they need to take to get a repair quote including a body shop location. I wish they could just open up their heart this one time and let me pay them out of pocket. Even mentioning insurance is like torture to my brain.",4,anxiety

Hey guys, I'm not really sure why I'm posting this, but I just wanted to put myself out there for once. I'm a 19-year-old guy, and I'm really struggling with some stuff. I don't even know if anyone will read this, but I figured it couldn't hurt to try.

I've been dealing with some pretty severe depression for a while now. It's hard to describe exactly how I feel, but I just feel really lost and hopeless all the time. I don't really have anyone to talk to about it, and I don't think anyone really notices me or my problems. I actually don't have anyone to talk about anything except my weird confusion and poor self image.

I've been isolated for most of my teenage years and even some of my childhood. I don't really blame anyone for that, it's just the way things worked out. But for the past 5 years, I've been completely alone, and it's really taking a toll on my mental health.

I don't have any goals or anyone to live for, and I just feel like I'm drifting through life with no purpose. I've tried to find things that interest me, but I always seem to lose motivation pretty quickly. I feel like I've failed at just about everything I've tried, and anything good that's happened to me has just been luck.

I know this might sound irrational, but I feel like the only thing that might work for me is finding someone who's going through the same thing. Someone who's just as confused and lost as I am, so we can figure things out together. But I don't want advice or a mentor or anything like that. I just want to connect with someone on an equal level.

Anyway, sorry for rambling on. I don't really expect anything to come of this, but it feels good to at least try to put myself out there. Thanks for reading, whoever you are.",2,depression

"We are there for him. We are willing to do whatever it takes to help him through this. We talk a lot and have a good relationship. Except he has such a massive secret life that he constantly lies to keep us from finding out about the real him. We have had many glimpses though. 

I wish he would just tell us 'fuck you i wanna smoke pot with my friends forever and bang a bunch of skanks' because that's sure what it looks like.

Instead he strings us along with how he wants to get into tradeschool but he's interested in a break after high school. he says he's suicidal or struggling with cutting 'relapses' sometimes, and its always when we are asking him about his plans for the future. 
he mentions these things as if we knew it, but he never told us before.

he is probably not going to live with us, because we would get him into training and make sure he stayed on track.

he wants to go live in his grammas basement and work at dunkin with his stoner friends.

he doesn't have hobbies except gaming. when he's with us, he doesn't have him games, so he just goes to bed *very* early.

he has an online therapist. when he tells us his depression was flaring up and that's why he had to skip school, we ask did you talk about it with your therapist? he says 'no, i'm usually just telling her all the things that happened here' which means complaining about us giving him shit for skipping school.

He smokes weed and clearly has this whole pot head dark guy image that he's rocking right now, but he insists he doesn't use it much and will never use harder drugs, but he also hangs out with drug dealers and his friends have had cocaine parties.
we tried to get him to quit weed when we first found out and it was impossible. he says it helps him. he also takes antidepressants that the doc gave him without our consent.

**He keeps going back to how he wants to choose differently but *unfortunately* he has this curse of depression that won't let him do better.**

He has reasons to be struggling with depression. He's been through 3 divorces. It sucked.

But the rest of his complaints about life are almost headline buzzwords like 'the world is falling apart and i don't wanna just get right into working some 9-5 until i die'

I just wish he would stop leaning on this depression thing. It feels like an utter excuse and an insult to people who have been through really bad stuff.",2,depression

"Hello I’m(24f) paranoid beyond belief about my health and life. I am overweight with a high BMI. I’ve never had much concern until I had my child and then decided to get weight loss surgery. The process for the surgery is long and many different doctor visits. However recently I’ve had a lot of chest pain going constantly to the hospital and each time they said I’m perfectly fine, I follow up with my primary care physician and he even says I’m perfectly fine and the chances of myself having anything wrong with my heart at all are very low. However, with all of that I still fear this upcoming cardiologist appointment that I’ll find out something is wrong and won’t get the weight loss surgery or I’ll die before the appointment or die before I can even get the surgery. It’s gotten so bad where I barely leave bed anymore, the anxiety medications I’m on don’t stop the panic attacks and I’ve cried myself to sleep multiple times in a row. I’m scared my child will go to bed next to mom and wake up to a corpse. I’ve been so paranoid to eat I’ve lost 10lbs in less than a week. I also believe my past eating disorder is returning because if I do manage to eat I immediately become scared I’ll have a heart attack and begging to call myself disgusting for eating when I shouldn’t. I’m very low income so I’m on the waiting list to get therapy and I’m scared I won’t make it to the date for my therapy.

"Idk if this is considered paranoia but I needed somewhere to put this. Today I (M) was at my girls house and everything was good as per usual and I left, as usual now bear in mind I’ve walked this way home around 50 -60 times and never experienced anything like this it’s about a 1.5 mile walk takes me around 30 minutes. As I’m walking out of my girlfriends block of houses I start to hear like a quite deep sobbing sound almost of that of a middle age woman. I shrug it off and continue walking, as I’m walking by the school near her house I then start to hear the sobbing again, this time  much higher pitched also this time I actually heard it as if I could pinpoint where it was coming from whereas last time I could only pinpoint a general direction. While I’m hearing this a man comes out and starts walking his dog and continues paying no attention at all to what I’m hearing. I continue walking but now I start doubting myself so I start videoing and cannot hear it in the video I took. As I’m walking I’m growing more and more scared so I phone my friend and at which point I now hear the voice again this time it was humming some sort of tune in a lower tone it was humming the song of one of those old music boxes. So I kept walking and at this point I start running in attempt to lose this voice but when I stopped running (about half a mile from where I’d first heard it) I started hearing the sobbing again and I was getting really freaked out and felt like this thing was following me. I continued running and got to about (a mile from where I’d first heard it) and thought I’d lost it. I then heard the sobbing again from a garden near me and sprinted again right up into a housing estate where I could no longer hear the noise. I then got to me house (1.5 miles away from where I first heard the noise) and while I was waiting on my little brother to answer the door I heard it for one more time before entering my house I don’t know what to think of this do I need peoples opinion on what I should do.",5,paranoia

"25 year old male

August 2022:

Finished an intensive masters straight after a 4 year undergrad.

September:

Job offers and interviews
End of relationship

October:

Moved into a 'party' flat and Starting work in the IT department of a Martime management company

November:

Mood decline begins - began to realise I want this job and lifestyle to just be temporary and work towards a better future for myself

December:

Dog passes away over Christmas.
New Years eve party my friend asked if I want to take his place on a new years day surf so he could do MDMA all night instead, I decided to go instead of him (I was drunk and didn't go to sleep until 6am)

January 2023:

Hit on the back of my head by a surf board while in the water.

Attended A&E to close up a bleeding wound on the back of my head, tetanus shot and advise to 'take it easy' before going back to work in 3 days.
I took it easy and tried to get back into a routine before starting back at work.

The day before I started back I vommit (thought it was something I ate - even my flatmate said 'is that the concussion?') - tried to sleep it off.

Worked for 3 extremely stressful days where I got no sleep what so ever and after the third day I just got home from work and went straight to bed extremely exhausted and just couldn't sleep all weekend.

Monday 9th of January:

Requested the day of sick and went to my GP and tried to explain my situation while getting things all muddled up and with slurred speech. The GP wrote me a letter that referred me to go back to A&E.

Arrive at A&E and handed in the letter and had to wait for half an hour to get seen. 

Got into the briefing room and tried to explain my situation to the nurse while again getting things all muddled up and with slurred speech.
The nurse without hesitation leaves the room and comes back in with a doctor.
 
That doctor brings me into the hospital bed area where I had to take off most of my clothes and get a heart pulse scan - all ok.

Then came about 3 nurses who all did the limb tests to see if I had control over them.
Sent for a CT scan of my head.

After the scan I had a chat with the doctor who tended to my wound on new years day who said the head scan was all clear and that I was suffering from the effects of concussion and discharged me on the same day. 

I walk outside the hospital all dazed and confused with a banging headache.

Got an Uber back to my flat and took a week off work went back to my GP the following Monday who was shocked I was back and thought I was drunk the last time he saw me, signs me off work for 4 weeks with a sick note that said 'Head Injury' and advised that I just try to stay in a routine and my symptoms would eventually go away. 

I did just that but for those 4 weeks I could not sleep what so ever and my mental health just got worse and worse and my flatmates just kept on partying and partying while I was getting clinically depressed with extreme anxiety trying to get better from a concussion.

February 2023:

I got so unwell by the 4th week of my sick note I had to get another 4 weeks off and go home to my parents just to get my physical health okay with 7 days worth of sleeping tablets from my GP who also referred me to a brain injury unit.

March 2023:

Went back to my GP and got perscribed a low dose of sertaline due to my mental health decline.
I started having suicidal thoughts but just thought they would go away after a while.

Had meetings with the brain injury unit over the web and they basically said I was all okay to do a phased return to work due to my head scan being all okay.

April 2023:

My thoughts of suicide got worse to the point where I had to tell my dad and the next day we went to A&E and I talked with the mental health crisis team and voluntarily went into a physciatric ward where I was diagnosed with clinical depression, my sertaline was uped, had another CT scan and an EEG (all okay) and I was discharged 3 weeks later.

May 2023:

Still have those thoughts and had to make an appointment with a pychcologist because I am still having so much trouble processing all this.

I just keep on saying to myself 
""just get through another day"" and ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem""
everyday.

This is the most messed up year of my life and I have no idea how I am going to be okay as there is so much uncertainty that lies ahead :(

"In theory, I’m a pretty ambitious person - I’m studying to be a social worker, I volunteer, I care a lot about social issues,  I crochet, blah blah blah - but a lot of the time I kinda feel like it’s not really me doing all this, or at least not doing it for myself. I do care about the world, and other people, and there are things that genuinely make me happy, but when I pull back and think about it, I sort of feel like an automaton. I don’t really feel any driving force to achieve my goals, I just do stuff because I feel like that’s what I should be doing. 

I recently got hired at a job I applied to, and I had to pretend to be excited when I told my parents because they were thrilled and I felt like I should be too. Now I’m going through the motions of onboarding and training, and it just feels like it’s not really me doing it. I don’t dissociate as far as I’m aware, but I’ve been getting this weird detached feeling with pretty much everything I do, and I hate it. Not sure what to do about it except keep trucking along and hope that I just miraculously wake up one day feeling like my heart is finally in it. For now I can’t do much more than live in the present, I guess.",2,depression

I am 20 and technically diagnosed schizoaffective but I believe it’s schizophrenia but I have not met very many schizophrenic people who were older and were doing ok. As the years pass I seem to keep getting more delusional and less attached to reality. I have slowly become a person who gets rewarded for doing dishes. It feels like my only two paths for my future are drugs or hospitals. I can’t work atm so I’m completely reliant on my bf which is exactly what happened with my ex. I cannot care for myself I don’t seem to understand how to do it. People don’t trust me alone and therapists have been extremely difficult to find. I don’t see a future ahead of me.

"So basically I really don’t stay home alone that often. I’m thirteen and I’ve only really stayed home for 10-20 minutes at a time, however, today my parents needed to go somewhere and I couldn’t come because I had homework. In the hour that I was home alone, I felt as if I was being watched. When my parents got home, my dad asked, “why was the light on in the garage, and, “why isn’t the dishwasher running anymore?” To this I freaked out. I hadn’t left the dining room table the entire time I was there, and I’m afraid there’s someone in my house. I know this sounds so fucking stupid, but I’ve heard stories of people living in other’s basements, attics, etc, and I’m afraid the same might be happening to me. Am I just being paranoid, or should I be concerned?

UPDATE: My father checked up in the attic and nobody was there, and my sister sleeps in the basement, so she would probably know if someone was down there. So no creepy psycho in my house today! lol",5,paranoia

"these thoughts are consistent and common enough that I don't recognize them as alarming thoughts rly. today's thoughts: 

the government sees everything I do say and think and let me do bad things and ruin my life, because encouraging criminal actions of the undesirables like me ensures the celebration of our execution. I am intrinsically evil, something wrong in my core. despite my resistance and pleading to God I'll eventually become a murderer, rapist or smth. they will wait until I become completely insane, arrest me, and kill me in jail. people will celebrate my death as I was a burden on all of society and did horrible things. this creates the allusion that justice was served.

In reality they know my decay is happening and they know how to help me, but they won't. they want me to become a horrible criminal, they could stop me and save people, save me, but they won't because a local villian distracts the masses from wanting justice of the elites. its all a distraction letting ppl like me fall to the extreme so they can maintain power.

people in my life are in on it. anyone except for like my mom & dad are all fake in a ploy to trick me. all my friends are nice to me to get dhit out of me, get me talking, fill out a file idk maybe it's just a game, laughing at me while I get a panic attack from someone smiling at me. everyone who needs to know knows and acts like they don't to ruin my life, they want to see how far it goes.


why are you talking to me? what do you want? what do you know? why are you being nice?

you want to get close to me to learn more to encourage more to worsen me to drive me closer and closer to the destructive ends.

"I’m not gonna give a long prefacing ramble, so let’s just get straight to the heart of the issue- I am paranoid that my dad drugs me in my sleep and possibly rapes me while I am drugged. Yes, I know, that’s kind of heavy. These thoughts come and go, but when they stick around I find myself becoming completely lost in them. I find it all so disgusting and terrifying and disturbing. My mind and body instantly become riddled with anxiety. I feel like I am constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown, because of how much this paranoia weighs on me.

I just don’t know what to do. I don’t trust my dad, which is probably why I am paranoid in the first place. What makes it all worse is that I currently live with my parent’s, though I am trying to save up money to move out. I just feel so confused and stressed over this all. It’s like when I start having these thoughts my capacity for rational thinking and reasoning completely disappears, and I feel truly unable to discern reality from what sinister scenarios my mind has conjured up. 

My worst fear is that the drugging my dad is doing to me (supposedly, according to the paranoia) is going to give me permanent brain damage, and eventually my brain will be so damaged that I will be rendered a human vegetable, more or less. And then maybe I will no longer be functional enough to live on my own, and so I will be trapped, forced to live out the rest of my days with my parents while being in a nearly brain-dead stupor. Even writing all of this out right now is giving me massive amounts of anxiety. 

I don’t know where to turn next. I have a therapist, but I am worried that she will think I’m really mentally ill if I tell her these thoughts. I’m a generally competent and functional person in most areas of my life so I feel as if this paranoia is too “out there” and dark to confess to her. But admittedly I also feel at my wit’s end, and I have this sense that if I don’t take action soon, I may end up in an even worse place than I already am. Sigh…I feel so scared.",5,paranoia

"I just lost a bunch of friends for various reasons and I’m realizing I have a pattern of letting people use me or not realizing and then they discard me when they’re done. I get a lot of positive attention from strangers because I am conventionally attractive, but then nobody seems to care about my feelings or the things I like. They project their own desires and feelings on me, and then when they’re done or they realize I’m not a typical person with typical interests and personality traits they don’t feel the need to treat me with basic decency anymore. And sometimes in a really cruel way. 

For example I recently had someone who I thought was a friend essentially say that now that she isn’t attracted to me romantically anymore (probably because she realized I’m a little to weird), she doesn’t want anyone thinking she still is if we hang out because she doesn’t want that to get in the way of other people being interested in her. It made me feel completely objectified and undervalued as a human.

Shakespeare was correct about this statement. Our world revolves on chaos, relies on it even to function. I know everyone reading this and on this sub has experienced chaotic times in their lives as we all have. Our experiences may not be equal but we all understand the pain of this world. Some of us better than others but regardless we understand it. Once you understand the world everything becomes meaningless. Sure you could give meaning to things but for what? Eventually everything will perish and that is the single truth of this universe. The reason everyone clings to life is because of desire. Without desire you’re a walking shell and at that point what do you do? Do you find something or someone to desire? Do you continue on realising this truth? Only you can answer these questions for yourself.

I’m always in constant fear that I’m going to get in trouble even when I haven’t done anything. I’m not a bad kid but I am constantly checking my phone and deleting my search history and apps, even if I just googled something harmless like “How to make an apple pie” or something, because I’m terrified of them checking my phone (even though they never have before). I lie when my parents ask me basic questions because I’m scared I will get interrogated.

Another thing is I keep heat stomping at night, like the sounds of my parents foot steps, but it’s never them. Idk, this probably isn’t normal but is it anything I should worry about?

"TL;DR: Always tired. Don't enjoy things. Want to sleep forever but also feel waking up makes sleep feel special. Just wished I didn't chicken out on my suicide attempts.

I'm always just so damn tired, life just feels like I'm surviving everyday and not truly living. I can't even think back to the last time I felt like I was truly living life. 

I haven't been enjoying any of my hobbies or felt connections in my social life. All of it just feels like nothing to me. No real good feelings or bad are associated with it. I can't even think much on events after they happen, it's just like ""This thing is done now, time to forget the emotions that should be attached to that moment.""

Thus my title, I want to sleep forever. Sleeping is a void where I simply am not conscious. It is concerning that I want this so bad, some of my best moments are when I'm under the influence of something that lessens my consciousness and thus I feel better but sleeping is the ultimate way to get there because well I'm not conscious then. That peaceful moment of nothingness is something I deeply crave and that is concerning, death scares because eternity of nothingness is terrifying if that's what it'll be but the brief moments in sleep are just comforting. I both want that forever but I also feel what makes it special is the fact I wake up and have to suffer being awake and then be rewarded with sleep.

It's sad I know but sure I guess that's why I'm writing this here. Just yeah would be a hell of a lot easier if I didn't chicken out on the suicide attempts I made in the past that's for sure anyway haha.",2,depression

"I've been playing Minecraft for a LONG time, since I was around 14 maybe (I'm 22 now, I know, I'm a late bloomer when it comes to video games). I used to stay up for hours and hours playing Minecraft on my Xbox 360. I finally moved to PC within the last couple of years, and don't play it as much as I used to when I did on console. Around October of last year, I had what I would call a time of extreme paranoia. I didn't leave my room unless it was for class, I thought my roommates hated me (and avoided them), I thought that everyone was staring at me and hated being seen outside. Whenever I would play Minecraft, I would be incredibly paranoid to the point where I'd see things peek out from behind the trees, and run from far away (I have no mods installed, and at this point in time no one but me ever got on my PC). I hated playing because I knew that I was the only sentient being in the whole game, or sometimes I would think that I wasn't the only thing playing the game. I avoided it for a long time and couldn't play without my mind racing and overthinking. Now, that's all I can think about when I play Minecraft. I really don't know what to do, because I'm not as paranoid anymore but keep overthinking.",5,paranoia

Recently, I went on a trip and noticed that these intense thoughts were getting so much worse. The weeks leading up the trip i was obsessively imaging the plane crashing, and during the flight I really thought we going to crash several times. 
we were going to go kayaking, and my brain told me that i was going to flip over and wouldn’t be able to get back up or an animal was going to attack. We also went on a safari drive and through out the whole week i was almost hoping it would be canceled because every single day i convinced myself that we were going to be attacked by one of the animals. 

I can’t even step outside my house because my brain has told me that someone is going to hurt me. something is going to happen.

it’s gotten pretty bad with my social life too where i’m convinced people hate me. it’s made talking to others difficult to the point where i’m pushing people away.

"I have anxiety problems that I am in therapy for.  More specifically, I have rage issues in my family (grandfather and father all have rage problems) and while I know I have it in smaller increments than they do, I want to be able to control it or prevent it from getting worse.  That is one of my biggest goals in therapy (along with working on my anxiety in general).  I've had maybe \~5 major rage episode in my life (including today).  So it isn't as big of a problem for me as it is in my dad, I just don't want it to get worse.  I am the first person in my family to go to therapy that I'm aware of so I AM taking steps...

&#x200B;

I was driving home from the therapy session when this happened.  I was talking with my mom and she  she put me on hold.  I was getting off on a highway and merging onto another one, and there was a really slow car in front of me + a car behind me tailgaiting me.   So she came back onto the phone and I said ""please hold on"" (I was getting stressed from the tailgaiting) to which she spoke over, so I said it again - and she continued to talk.  I then yelled ""I said hold on"" and got pissed and hung up on her.  

&#x200B;

Once I was safely on the highway I called her back to explain that I was asking her to hold on and she was just talking over me.  (My mom has a habit of talking over me and I've mentioned it in the past to her.  I do the same and she also gets frustrated.  I AM trying to be aware of this and stop).  So she kept cutting me off & talking over me as I was saying this, so I started getting angry and saying that what happened 5 minutes ago was happening again...right now.  But she was cutting me off/talking over now to apologize for what happened 5 minutes ago (in a dismissive way ""fine,  I'm sorry"".)  So I said what she was doing before is literally still happening (dismissing what I'm saying and just talking over me).  Like she doesn't let you finish your sentence, she kind of just cuts in and talks over you.  And she was saying she's not talking over me....And then I lost control.   I went into rage mode.  I didn't just yell but I went like a notch higher and I feel REALLY bad about this now.  It lasted like a minute of me cursing at her and yelling at how she is always so dismissive & that is literally happening as we are talking about it.

&#x200B;

So she (rightfully so) said she's upset with me now and doesn't want to talk and hung up.  I drove another 5 minutes and called her back to apologize.  This is where I'm trying to get control of the rage and take responsibility (something my father never does).  I said I was sorry and that I wanted to talk about why I'm upset.  I did say that it was ""two notches too high"" and that my screaming was overboard.  I went on to discuss in a much more calm manner this talking over/dismissive talking that was happening is what caused me to get so angry.  But then she was saying she wasn't talking over me at all...so this kind of went back and forth in a MUCH more calm way (from me).  She said sorry a few times but kept denying she was doing it...so I said her sorry doesn't mean anything if she doesn't understand what I am complaining about in the first place.  Like she isn't acknowledging that she is talking over me or cutting into when I'm speaking (she IS doing it)...the conversation went on a bit longer and then we hung up (can't remember if we said bye or it was another abrupt hangup).

&#x200B;

I got to my house and I broke down in my car.  I started crying about that rage incident (that lasted a minute).  It's the exact thing I'm trying to avoid/focus on, and yet it is happening.  It hasn't happened THAT much in my life -- I think it was the stress of the overall day for me + not eating since breakfast (this was 6PM) and my mom was cutting me off too -- I lost it and I took it out on  her.  

&#x200B;

I called her again (from my car still) to talk about all of this.  We both said we were upset with each other.  I said again that I was REALLY SORRY for how angry I got.  She tried to keep defending herself and saying she wasn't cutting me off...and so that conversation began again about how she IS cutting me off and I keep telling her this (others tell her as well...).  We got back to the rage and by this point we were both in tears (she could hear my voice trembling) and I was sincerely sorry for the rage portion of what happened - but I wanted to address what was causing me to snap.

&#x200B;

I compared the situation to my dad who NEVER apologizes for getting into these rage modes.  He just ignores it and pretends like it doesn't happen.  I told my mom that I'm calling her because I don't want to be like him.  I wanted to discuss (in a calm manner) what was causing me to get angry, rather than not addressing the issue.  We went on to talk for another 5-10 minutes and said our goodbyes (said ""I love you"" to each other which I almost never say to my mom).  We spoke again after she had dinner and I mentioned to her that I was in therapy for this exact reason (to deal with the rage stuff).  We then spoke for another 20 minutes about unrelated stuff...

&#x200B;

\*Now I think after the initial yelling/rage episode I should NOT have called my mom back so soon.  I should have waited until after I was done driving and kind of given myself a chance to cool off but at the time I wanted to address it head on.  I plan to discuss this with my therapist next week but after that will not see her for almost a month.  I'm kind of looking for general advice on working on that kind of rage issues.  TBH I'm not sure if the therapist I'm seeing is even helping me with this (we were talking about it today but that is my vibe in general after \~8 months).  My doctor mentioned Lexapro for me two weeks ago as a suggestion if I'm not able to control my anxiety and if it is getting worse....  Is that a good idea?  I do have some Alprazolam (Xanax) that I have and I DON'T want to rely on that at (I did take one today but it is rare for me to take these).  I want to keep practicing what I'm learning about techniques about anxiety but this rage issue is what I'm truly focusing on figuring out how to deal with.",4,anxiety
"Hi, everyone, last Thursday i went to a psychiatrist after a long period of struggle and he diagnosed me with depression. I got prescribed fluoxetine and i just started 3 days ago. 

My whole ordeal started with health anxiety and after a ton of tests I decided to see a psychiatrist who said that, if everything else is ruled out we have to consider depression.

I have to be onest, i am very afraid of the possibility of a misdiagnosis. I feel so weak and tired every day. I used to run almost every day and now i can bearly do it at all. I feel light headed 24/7. I feel like I'm wasting away day by day. Can depression really do that? I am afraid my doctors missed something...

"From the outside my life is perfect. I'm well educated, have an interesting job in a field I'm passionate about, my own place, hobbies, a caring girlfriend and fantastic friends. I seem to excel at almost everything I do. I've largely got it all figured out. I am very fortunate. 

Yet, under the surface, I feel nothing. My life is joyless. At least half of the days over the last decade I've thought about how nice it would be to just be dead; to not have to deal with life anymore. I've always thought the saying ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" is stupid. To me suicide is a permanent solution to every problem I'll ever have. I've spent countless hours planning on how I would do it and how I can minimise the pain on others. I am honestly surprised I'm still here.

I'm currently at a crossroads. My depression is getting worse and it's becoming visible. I am already starting to lose people because of it. But, I feel like I can't talk to anyone close to me. I worry as soon as people know just how fucked I am I'll be treated differently and things will never be the same. It's also just not in me to ask. I am not the person who needs help from others. I've made token attempts before, seen doctors and underplayed my symptoms to avoid being sectioned. I've been prescribed antidepressants and seen therapists but all to no avail. What's to say if I ask for help this time will be any different.

As stupid as it feels to write this, knowing the advice I would give to others I feel this is a journey I must continue to take alone. I also wonder if it's even worth being fixed. I am incredibly fortunate to be in the position I am and yet and still this miserable. What does that really say about me.",2,depression

"Hello, hope all are doing well 

I am wondering if anyone on here experiences anxiety triggered by noise, specifically at night and when trying to sleep. 

The sounds that trigger me are neighbours who are loud, even unintentional. These people are usual nice and respectful but I can’t help but be filled with anger and frustration when I’m exposed to these sounds or the expectation of them. 

I’ve been dealing with it for years and my last marriage ended because I just could not deal with kids noise at night from around the house even if it was reasonable. 

Has anybody found anything that helps?

"I'm an entrepreneur, and after a couple of years of burnout, my condition has significantly worsened two months ago, and I've been diagnosed with moderate/severe clinical depression.

"I was just in an accident on my way to work at the beginning of the month. I'm really lucky it wasn't worse.

  
I wasn't found at fault, but I can't help but think that if I had taken my meds before getting in my car for the 45 minute drive that I could have had a faster reaction time.. I saw the car coming at me, I could have slowed down or gone into the next lane but I just wasn't in the mindset without my meds. Now my car has been in the shop since the 8th and I won't be able to get it until the 26th where I'll be out of the state and there's a holiday on monday meaning I won't be able to pick it up until the tuesday.   
So I'm working from home staring at my email trying to let them know that it will be even longer before I can return to the office. I can't even begin to write this email because I feel like a failure. I'm scared that because I've been out of the office for so long they will be upset with me or something I don't even know what, but I'm always on edge about being fired. I feel awful and haven't been able to get out of bed on time or take care of myself as well. Idk maybe it's just taking me back to my last accident where I actually totaled my car and couldn't get a car for 6 years. I know this isn't my fault... any of it really but I can't shake feeling like a teen again and being scolded for being so stupid or inattentive or whatever they want to think.  
Anyway it's so fucking hard and adhd in general or causing things like this takes a huge chunk out of me. It feels like, because I'll always have this and always need meds that there is no getting over this. There isn't a light at the end of the tunnel it feels like if not this there will be something I will mess up next week like forgetting an important appointment or leaving a candle lit in my office. I just feel like having this disability just makes the chances of disaster so much more probable. UGHHHH

"When I was little I also had this long-running delusion (I think it would be called a delusion?) that my dad was going to kill my mom and I. I had no basis for this except that he owned knives, a gun, and he was very avoidant so if I suspected he was annoyed I thought it gave evidence for him wanting to kill us. This delusion got weaker over time and now I don't believe it at all. I told a therapist about this but she never commented on it or brought it up again.

A few years ago I was so depressed that I felt like I was losing touch with reality. I was convinced that my family and my ex knew I was planning to kms. My ex had texted me asking how I was and I remember being so paranoid and thinking, ""How does he know?"" I texted my cousin asking if she said anything to him since they he had contacted her before asking about me. I thought my parents had contacted him and told him to text me. I texted her again saying, ""I feel like I'm going crazy, everyone is trying to stop me but they're not confronting me"" or something along those lines.

Now it's 3 years later and I'm really depressed. I worry that I'll start being paranoid again because I feel pretty detached from everything and hopeless. I also have trauma and I've been triggered lately, which causes me to dissociate. That feeling is really scary because I'm already worrying about losing touch with reality to the extent that I become psychotic.

I watched like two videos of psychotic depression and they said how nihilistic delusions can be stuff about how nothing matters, you don't matter, etc. I mean isn't that just depressive thinking? I feel that way now so am I delusional? Please someone tell me I'm not crazy.",2,depression

I later found out that the website did not contain any malware, but after doing so much research i got worried by the fact that when i was younger, i was not careful with downloading stuff ,and i decided to scan my moms computer for such stuff since she uses it for work and because i might have had downloaded malicious stuff when i was younger there. I scanned, it detected some stuff and that was it. However, due to all the videos i watched and stuff i read, i couldnt help but be paranoid that the computers might still be infected by stuff that could not be detected or by the fact that it might be hacked, despite all of the scans ive done and all the signs that my computer is alright.
