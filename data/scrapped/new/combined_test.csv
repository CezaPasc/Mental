"its crazy how i just went schizo because i was thinking about my forsaken future, i feel sad knowing leslie will be all i have left one day because when my mom dies my brother and sister wont want to take care of me, theyve always been jealous of me claiming im my moms favorite only because i will always need more care and because how i was born (22 weeks and probably the reason im mentally ill) and my mom says my brother will be all i have and take care of me but he even said once shes gone hes out of the picture, then if my friends go their separate ways ill truly be alone though we plan to live together and i always tell my mom to at least last till im 18 and then she could go with grandpa (shes had 2 strokes and got alzheimers so its either or between what takes her out) if i wasnt schizo i'd join the marines and at least die doing something good, i just want to finish school and start my game dev career bro 😞 hopefully i can go back to my beloved florida 😞",6,schizophrenia
"Ive been dealing with some type of IBD for the last year being left house bound because of the urgency and tenesmus. Im curious what sort of telework job some of you guys have that allow you the ability to spend extra time in the bathroom when youre in a flare or just having more bowel movements the ""normal"".

Ive become so depressed not being able to do anything for a year now and im desperate to find some meaning to life again before its to late.

"I don’t really consider myself non verbal, though I’ve been learning that some things like not wanting to talk when drained are considered a form. But generally I’m talkative.

I keep having these dreams where I just can’t speak. Nightmares because I can’t communicate. I open my mouth, and I struggle, trying to force a word, and if I can manage a word, it’s always breathy and raspy, and I usually stutter it. 

It’s so bad that I start blurring the dreams with reality and worry about the next “non speaking” episode. I don’t really know what it means, the dreams have nothing else of more except that I’m desperately trying to speak.",1,autism
Now I have to apologize to two groups of people and figure out which thing is more important to me and everyone will be upset. How did this even happen?

"I met with some friends last night. I anticipated it as the highlight of my month; year even, and it was nice - I enjoyed it - although I got the feeling it was no big deal for my friends. They're functioning, busy people. I often go blank and feel emotionless with them. I'm lucky to have those few friends, they're beautiful and supportive people. I feel crushed today.

I'm 40 soon. I attempted suicide at 17 and it broke me, I think. That and a dour upbringing, and some physical illness in early adulthood.

I was so sure, when I made the decision. But some time after taking the tablets I.... changed my mind. I couldn't believe it, after being so sure. And now, after ~8 rounds of therapy over 20 years, I still can't make a single large decision and feel utterly condemned to my half-life. I'm an empty vessel. I've buried my feelings all my life and I no longer feel authentically.


If I can share anything positive it would be:
1) please don't attempt suicide, if you're thinking about it - truly confronting death permanently alters your brain chemistry. Some will recover well, some not. I'm not sure it's possible to truly confront death by simulation, and when it happens, you may change your mind halfway through. It can be very, very scary. Get help - humans aren't supposed to overcome all challenges alone.

2) therapy does help. My first ones didn't, but later I understood myself better and I kept trying, when I badly needed help. I'm at a place now where I tell my therapist everything. No secrets.",2,depression

"Hi fellow travellers! 
I’m currently planning our activities (my wife and I) for our two weeks vacation in Italy and I was wondering which spots should I add to my must do list. So we’re staying four nights in Rome, four nights in praiano, five nights in Tuscany (poggibonsi) and one night in Florence. Most of our trip is already organized except for Tuscany since there’s just too many things to do there 😅 
We’re foodies and loooove wine so we would like to focus on that for Tuscany. Except lucca and san gimignano, is there any small town that you guys think are must sees? Btw we have a car, pisa and sienna aren’t really on our priority list (not fans of architectural and religious stuff), we try to avoid “tourist traps” and prefer local activities such as small/private wine tours, cooking classes and walking in towns. We don’t really have a limit to our budget, but won’t break the bank just for one activity since we already did with our private boat tour in the Amalfy coast 🤣
Thanks in advance folks! 🙏🏽",0,negative_samples

"I was watching the news last week. They interviewed a woman with adhd.
She claimed ""that she needs to date toxic men because else she will get bored of them due to her adhd"". She really sat there and went on ""well, when I date someone normal, someone loving and caring, it's just too boring. Nothings interesting happens and I want to break up with them. But when they are toxic, it's just always something new happening! I will never know what they are going to do that's so exciting!""
I got so mad about that. So if she has children she will also get bored of them or what? It made me so upset because it even was on the news.

"hi, i just found this sub with a quick search because i feel kind of desperate to talk to someone about how i am feeling. please let me know if this doesn’t belong here. 

i (27f) have had diagnosed anxiety and depression since i was 18. i want to be fully, completely honest here because i never had been before. i have talked about my intrusive thoughts before with my doctors, i have been through inpatient treatment. i didn’t always have them, it’s been about 3 years of having the ones about me wanting to die. however i haven’t described what i am going through recently because i do not want to and can’t be back in inpatient again. 


i am having intrusive thoughts almost constantly. anytime my mind is left to wander i immediately find myself thinking and sometimes even saying out loud “i want to die/i want to kill myself”. i have never had a suicide attempt and i don’t feel like i am actually going to kill myself, i just can’t stop thinking it.


my intrusive thoughts have drastically shifted towards about being paranoid about being murdered. i live in a city with alarmingly increasing violence on the streets and public transit. it’s almost daily. this past winter i was physically assaulted by someone on the train. there is no specific person i am scared of or have been recently threatened by. but in public i constantly think i am going to be assaulted and killed. i think someone is going to attack me on the bus. i think someone is going to knife me from behind when i’m walking down the street. i think someone is going to shoot me in the back of the head through my window when i’m sitting on the couch.  i only ride the first and last subway cars so i can stand near the conductor incase something goes wrong. i get off of buses and trains as soon as anyone one makes me feel scared in any way at all. i don’t use headphones in public anymore and won’t look at my phone or read a book on transit. even if i wanted to i hear louder and louder and feel stronger and stronger that i am going to be killed. i didn’t know how to shake this. if anyone has any advice, books, other subs, or online resources to suggest please let me know! 
i want to reiterate that i am not a danger to myself, i don’t actually want to kill myself it just fees like a guttural  reaction for me to feel the thought and think i want to die. i am not a physical danger to myself. thank you in advance!🫶🫶",5,paranoia

I know I have paranoia issues but my mom absolutely hates me. She hates that I am in the same house as her (which I’m trying to move out). She hates me touching her kitchen or using it to store food but I can’t store it anywhere else. She hates me cooking or making any food. And I got sick recently and she’s shaming me out of trying to make simple soup to feel better. I’ve always been paranoid that she’ll want to poison me to make me sick because she hates me so much. I’m so scared and I don’t know what to do or where to put my food to keep it away from her. Or lock it away I’m so scared she wants to hurt me.,5,paranoia
"I've tried lots of things. Exercise and journaling and talking to therapists etc. Nothing's helping. 

But now I'm actually scared for my health.

I can't bring myself to shower unless I start to smell myself, and it takes a lot of effort. My hair is so matted and I get so impatient trying to detangle it that I just give up and then slap it in a ponytail under a hat for work. Brushing my teeth seems impossible now. I went from being underweight to being overweight and now pre-diabetic as well as insulin-resistent. I went to the doctor for irregular periods (4 months minimum gap between cycles) and was told I had the lowest vitamin D count they've ever seen in their life (7). I never have energy. My room is disgusting. I do nothing except sleep when I'm at home, and I purposely overwork myself . The only thing I can find myself able to put energy towards is my job and I'm damn good at it. I'm constantly working overtime, I was promoted to the head manager, and I spend as much time as I can there. I don't know why. I can't seem to do anything else but I can't resist coming into work until my boss forces me to go home. And then I blow all my money on food and stupid shit. I know I need help. But I don't know how to ask for it or WHO to ask for it when a therapist hasn't helped me before. I'm seeing one right now but I don't see any progress and I've run out of things to say.

"So my diabetes story is long and complicated. Haven't been diagnosed for long, but probably suffered with Type 2 for well over 5-6 years as high blood sugar just wrecked my body, mainly due to me being an alcoholic. I didn't report anything to my doctor until the symptoms of constant high blood sugar levels started to really affect me. Even to this day my average range is between 300-400. I don't eat a lot, but as I said I'm a functional alcoholic that's *trying* to cut back and eventually quit, hopefully.

I'm suffering with a lot of nerve/muscular issues that may or may not be related to diabetes. But I'm sure the combo of T2D, alcoholism, and a general depression that causes me to not want to exercise or cook healthy food for myself. I guess you could just call it laziness lol. Either way, it's not good. I need changes fast and the help from medications to get this crap under control.

So I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with Ozempic. It's not cheap, even with insurance, and I honestly don't like the whole ""may cause thyroid cancer"" thing, but I've also read success stories online, and the fact it's only a once weekly injection really appeals to me. 

However, I'm concerned about mixing it with metformin. Also concerned about whether or not drinking while on it will mess everything up.

Any advice or experiences would be great. I really need to get the blood sugar under control so I can feel better and start working on other things. I'm taking it seriously now and I just hope it's not too late.",0,negative_samples

"So I been chatting with AI and asked it to make a poem about Schizophrenia (I take NO credit for poem; all was done through AI Chat). I thought you guys will enjoy it. Here it is: 

&#x200B;

 

The mind is a labyrinth, a maze so complex, A place where reality can become perplexed. Where sounds, and sights, and voices converge, A place where the self can become submerged.

Schizophrenia, a word so hard to say, A condition that can take one's self away. Voices in the mind, so real and so loud, Whispers and screams that make one feel cowed.

The world becomes strange, distorted, and blurred, Paranoid thoughts leave one feeling absurd. The mind plays tricks, a reality that's fractured, Leaving one feeling alone and captured.

The struggle is real, but there's hope in sight, Treatment and support can make things right. With understanding, compassion, and care, We can help those with schizophrenia repair.

The mind may be complex, but it can heal, With medication, therapy, and a love that's real. The road may be long, but there's light ahead, A chance to live, to love, to dream instead.",6,schizophrenia

"I've been depressed for most of my life. It's usually not too bad. More of a back of the mind type of feeling. Sometimes it gets really bad, but I can usually pull myself out of it enough to start enjoying life somewhat. It's been gradually getting worse over the past two years. In the past few months, it's gotten really bad. I've slowly lost interest in a lot of things. My performance at work as gotten worse and my boss is starting to notice. I feel like I've over compensated in doing all the things that normally help me pull myself out of my depression. I moved into my dream apartment, I went on a week long vacation abroad, my apartment has never been cleaner, and I've been trying out all of the hobbies I've been wanting to do. Nothing is working and I feel like a shell of a person right now. I'm starting to get really scared about the path I'm going down.   


I've started to wonder If I should try anti-depressants.  I know that I need to start looking into therapy as a longer term solution, but the waitlist for therapist inn my network are insane. Plus I know it will take some time to find one that's a right fit for me. I don't know I can wait for a therapy appointment and subsequent sessions to be prescribed medication.

"***trigger warning SA*** 

as a medium put it, i’m stuck in despair. idk if it’s anger or hate for the world or just depression. but i am so angry at the world. 

my grandparents died 4 years ago and so did my only aunt, they raised me, they were my support system. then I found out that i was sexually abused as a kid and confronted my abuser to see if he did it for sure, he did. it was the dumbest thing i did because i suffered from a lot of mental health issues after losing 3 people and seeing the man who did that to me for years as a child. i told my mom but she didn’t believe me. she said “if he did that why isn’t he in jail” she was just in denial. still is. we’re not super close. And my dad… he’s just not there for me and i lost many friends during this time period because they didn’t like dealing with me while experiencing an extreme mental health crisis. 

i felt so alone until i met my bf and he’s great but i’m still so angry at the world. i used to love people, i was a people person. I also was so happy all the time and now i live in despair. I’m angry. At the world. At my family who’s still alive that disowned me after my mental health crisis. i’m angry at no one to protecting me. i’m angry at my friends for also ditching me. i’m mad at doctors. i’m mad at god or the universe for taking my family members who DID love me away from me. 

I’m angry at having this shitty life. And i’m angry about being stuck angry. I don’t want to constantly be angry and feel like the “villian” hating everyone and wishing misery on ppl because i’ve had such a hard life and they would never understand.

I feel like I’ve tried so many different medications and am not finding one that works but doesn’t cause bad side effects. I know there are people who have tried even more than me, but I’m just getting so frustrated 😕 

Strattera did absolutely nothing. Ritalin seemed to help a little and might’ve been better at a higher dose but I had to stop it because the anxiety and rage were so bad. Wellbutrin did nothing at all for my adhd but helped depression/anxiety a lot, so I stayed on it- at least that’s a positive…there’s a few others I’ve tried but can’t remember all of them, I just know everything I’ve tried has either done nothing or had bad side effects 😔

I feel like I’m just cycling through so many things and running out of options, but my adhd is so bad that I’m barely functioning at work or home and don’t know what to do if I can’t find something that helps…

"Usually I’ve learned pretty well to gauge through context and experience that a lot of things that people say/do have either a fairly consistent meaning, or don’t have a conscious meaning behind them at all, at least in how they’re communicating with me. Like, I can *typically* tell if someone is being passive aggressive, or if they’re hinting at something about me, or if they’re alluding to certain ideas. The problem is, there are still a lot of times in which I am either totally unaware of any sort of deeper meaning to things they’re saying like irony or if they’re even joking at all, or I overthink things because I’m afraid of the former scenario and end up coming to a wrong conclusion and having an awkward interaction. Also sometimes this leads to me overthinking and taking things personally because I just **genuinely** don’t know what they think or if they’re subtly communicating something that I’m missing. I hate not being able to tell if they’re joking, being insulting/annoyed or expressing an actual opinion, and I hate it even more when I read too deep into it and think that they’re doing something that they’re not because I feel dumb for not just knowing what they mean because apparently it was obvious, or at least it always feels that way in hindsight.",1,autism

"Trigger warning ⚠️ 

I've been having this issue usually when I'm home alone but not always. It's at its worse if my back is to an open room or hall etc. Even worse than that if I need to shower. For example tonight my wife works until 3a.m. I needed a shower and 3a.m. is too late anyway so I showered and I was so paranoid I kept the curtain open. I couldn't stand to close my eyes so I did my best to rinse my hair and face without closing my eyes and ended up having to for what I'm sure was just a few seconds but seemed much longer. Hurried to get them open despite getting some soap in my eye. This whole time I got my back to the back wall of the shower curtain and door open. Getting the floor wet. By the time I was done...which wasn't long cuz instead of doing one thing at a time and rinsing separately I did it all at once then rinsed...I was shaky and my heart was and still is racing and its been prob 20 minutes since I got out. This doesn't happen every time I'm alone. 

Sometimes it happens when my wife is home. Like if I'm doing the dishes with my back to the rest of the room I'm so paranoid and anxious if my wife comes in and speaks or touches me I jump out of my skin and my heart is racing for a while afterwards and I'll be shaky for a bit. 

For context I've gone through abuse as a kid I can only remember bits of it. I'm working with a therapist and on a wait list for a psychiatrist. My diagnosis so far are anxiety disorder, depression, social phobia, and ptsd. I haven't told my therapist about this paranoia or whatever it is yet because honestly I feel so dumb about it. I'm not scared to be home alone nor am I scared of my wife. Why does this happen? I'm so tired of all of this shit and I hate myself.

Edit: just also thought this. It's started happening at work too. Thanks to the social phobia I can't work around people so I work alone cleaning a 2 story office building. Lately I'm pretty jumpy at work. If a automatic light clicks off I jerk my head towards it immediately and feel jumpy for a second until I realize it was just the light.

"I came to the realization today when I heard a story about neck injuries. When I was about 14 or 15, I went to a church retreat. They had bouncy houses and a bunch of games to play. One of the bouncy houses was an obstacle course where you can race another person to the end. The house started out having you crawl though some obstacles until you got to a climbing wall thing. At the time of the event I had really long hair, like mid waist almost hip length hair. My hair was in a low ponytail also. We begin the race and as soon as I try to crawl past the second obstacle I step on my pony tail and wrench my neck, it didn’t hurt but the sound my neck made is similar to someone getting their neck broken. I was stunned for a minute but continued on with the course.

From what I remember I continued my day and life after that with only minor neck pain. 

The thing I can’t stop thinking about is ever since that incident my life has changed, I developed depression along with a bunch of other mental health issues and my life was just weird.

I understand the age this happened to me could be caused by hormones and stuff but I talk to my therapist about that and she’s no help at all.

Im worried I’m living in come sort of purgatory. I deal with frequent black outs where I dissociate in situations and go on airplane mode.

stats: 
age - 15
height - 5’5
weight - 137lbs
sex - female
amount of dxm consumed - probably 3000mg ish over 6 days. 

it all started off as me doing dph over a year ago, i quit ts since. i have known about dxm for a little over 6 months now but decided to give it a try about a month ago. 
the first two times did nothing exceot make me tired, this was with robotussin syrup. then, i found out about coricidin, this is where my memory gets blurry. 
about 2 weeks ago i went to my local cvs and borrowed from the generous store about 3 boxes. i popped 8ps (240 ish mg) the first night. this was the beginning of my binge. i then proceeded to pop another 4, and then another 4 all in the same night within 5 hours. i stayed up the whole night, it was amazing, i never wanted it to stop. 
the next night i did the same (night before being friday night) so it now being saturday night i dosed up 13ps. (390mgs). 
i didnt do any sunday night as i had school monday (or at least i dont think i did).
i took 300mgs monday morning before school. i didnt want to go through the day sober. 
i had an amazing time being out of my mind and going through my classes in a daze. 
i did the same routine gradually upping the dose the next few days. 
whenever i stop i get extremely depressed, ive burned myself oretty badly during all of this (second degree). 
keep in mind i havent smoked thc at all during this. the triples were enough. 
then this is where it starts to get crazy. 
on wednesday night my friend came over unnanounced, it really confused me, i thought she was a hallucination. 
she smoked me up (by that i mean one bong rip) by then i had already taken 400mg of triples. she found out about it and just really confused me. 
listen, I can’t even tell at this point who’s fake and who’s not. I can’t tell who’s real and who’s not. I don’t know what’s going on. I am living through my days in a daze and I can’t tell anything from reality. 
i really want to just end it. i need help but idk what to do. someone pls tell me what to do. i cant even recall most of this past week. the morning after my friend came over i was so fucked up and shaking so mf bad and was so paranoid i flushed the rest of my pills away. (sometimes during my binge i went out and got 7 more boxes). i just dont know what to do. after smoking the thc w my friend i was having paranoid delusions about getting sent to hell and my mom finding out and calling everyone who i thought was against me. i thought my friend was doing this on purpose. i just dont know ehat to do. 

i should probably mention i did all of this coming off an antipsychotic (abilify). so probs not a good idea (haha).

"Context, I autistic. My roommate for the last few months has been relentless in not giving me any privacy, I have more posts on it for more context but basically he barges in my room, follows me to the laundry room, follows me to any store, if I go outside for some peace he manages to find me there too, and now he’s following me to work. If he is awake and we are both home, he is in my room. I have communicated how I have a very low social battery and work customer service and don’t really like talking much. He also does not clean *anything*, leaves spills and stains everywhere (rip my security deposit) and steals my stuff including my *weed*.

"My girlfriend is hospitalized for attempted suicide and before that we saw each other on the vast majority of days but since 4 days ago I feel an emptiness after I say goodbye to the visit everyday. I'm unmotivated for some things and I just feel like being out of the house waiting for time to pass so I can see her the next day and at the end of the day I end up crying and also the fact that I can't be there to support her when I want to. Today after the last call of the day which is at 6:30 pm she was feeling lonely because two of her friends left and from that moment I walk with a sadness because I do not know her state at this time and if this can worsen her situation and that so far is being a very good recovery. Do you think that loneliness in an internment worsens treatment?

"The world is in chaos, the system we live in is falling apart and it would be a miracle if our children's children would be able to see a positive change. I just don't understand where do people find energy to keep going, working till they drop dead at 60, never having time and money to even look outside? 
What is genuinely good about life? Why do people not allow assisted suicide for those who can't do this anymore?
Like, I will never be any use to this world  because all I can do is art. I am mentally AND physically ill person, I can't do any useful job. I can't earn decent amount of money to live on my own with just doing art. There are countless people that do art better than me, and that's okay. I will forever be alone because of my mental illness, and that's understandable too. My home country is destroyed by war and the country i ran away to is now involved in another war, so I don't even have a place to call home anymore. And that's fine too, I know people have it worse. 

What I don't get is if I'm no use to humanity, if I will struggle, be poor and alone till my last day, why can't I just die. There is no assisted suicide option, and just doing it myself might not work. Is it really this hard to just allow people to die peacefully in this world, not by throwing themselves under a train or hanging themselves? I really only want to hold someone's hand when I die. To be at peace finally.",2,depression
"We are in Italy and in the morning while checking out some random guys stole our camera from our car. My husband was putting the luggage in the car and the car was unlocked. There was a random person in the parking who started asking something to my husband. While my husband replied him his friend came from behind and stole the camera out of the passenger seat. This happened literally in the span 20 seconds. When my husband notice they both were gone. He told the hotel reception the weren’t helpful at all about the situation and started saying we aren’t responsible for the parking even though it was there private parking. 
The manager wasn’t even showing the security footage. Upon insisting she showed the footage and everything was caught on camera. We could even see the face of the man who stole the camera from the car after that the guy tried to pick the suitcase but left. But the manager was insisting the he didn’t do it and was making excuses for them. 
Then we called police from there they noted everything took details and told us to report to the nearest police station. We went there the women couldn’t speak English she sent us to another police station. At this second one they said it’s an immigration police station go to another one. I told the police woman there about the situation oh it’s just a camera and then they gave us another address and there we were told the samt thing that it’s not a complaint center go back to the nearby police station. 
At this point we just gave up. The whole situation was fucking bizarre and the response of hotel staff and the authorities was the worst. 
Tbh we knew we weren’t going to get the camera back but we saw the faces of those assholes on security camera and we really wanted to at least report them so they don’t do this to somebody else. 
This was such a special trip for my family and we are so sad that we lost all the pictures on camera.",0,negative_samples

"  
Crippling indecision. Depressed people can be consumed by an overwhelming inability to make decisions. Everything is questioned right down to the granular level. This constant self-questioning and evaluating leaves the person paralysed and unable to function. For instance the depressed person might make a decision to take a shower. What follows next is a tsunami of questions “should I wait to later” “what if I don’t have the energy” “why do I need a shower anyhow I am not going anywhere?” This can literally play out for hours and hours until the sufferer finally says something along the lines of “what’s the point?” Needless to say this self-doubting will be followed by recrimination and more than likely self-hatred for being so weak, which in turn feeds the depression, an almost perfect vicious circle.  
Critical self-judgment. Depressed people don’t really see themselves as ill. They rarely give themselves that good a break. Instead they can very easily view their depression as a personal weakness they could overcome if they just tried hard enough. This train of thought is perpetuated by other people telling them to just snap out of it, or a thousand other platitudes they have heard a million times before. Instead of seeing this nonsense for what it really is they turn it internally and berate themselves for having a character flaw that doesn’t allow them to function like normal people. They don’t need other people to be judgmental as they are expert at doing it to themselves a thousand times worse.  
Interaction is painful. It’s something most people take for granted. Interaction, conversing and relating are things we mostly don’t have to think about. For someone suffering depression this natural ability can become excruciatingly difficult. In most instances we pull on a socially acceptable mask and pretend everything is fine. We are present but not really there if you know what I mean? We can be surrounded by people and feel painfully alone lost in the quicksand of depression. We are experts at hearing but not really listening. We are ninja warriors at the art of avoiding talking about how we are feeling. Everything is great and fine when in reality we are dying inside. While you are talking about how your day went we can be reliving the worst moments of ours and at the same time making sure you don’t see our pain.  
Fear of the future. Ask a depressed person what they think their future looks like and they will more than likely tell you “more of the same or worse” Depending on the severity of the depression a sufferer doesn’t see a future. A future is something other people have not them. Their future is the struggle they are going to have tomorrow morning when they wake up and think to themselves “please, not this again, I don’t think I can go on like this” We think about the future by comparing it to our past. It’s very difficult to imagine a nice future when all the evidence from the past is telling you it isn’t going to happen. For the vast majority of people a future is something they can feel optimistic about. For a depressed person it can feel like something to dread. Something filled with hopelessness and helplessness. Not living in the present is extremely common; it can feel like we are adrift in an ocean of misery and torment stuck in a no man’s land of despair and apathy. Once hope is lost, everything is lost.  
Even the good times can be bad. Imagine not even being happy at the birth of your child or in fact any landmark occasion that marks a supposedly joyous event in our lives. A chronically depressed person doesn’t have to imagine it. For millions of people this is a reality and is something that is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. Guilt and shame which feed the depression are experienced in equal measure. They know on a rational logical level they should be happy, unfortunately they have lost the ability. Their happiness has been replaced by numbness and indifference which they have seemingly no control over. I well remember when I was going through my own depression someone asking me what I would do if I won a million pounds. Without even having to think I said I would probably give it away as no amount of money could ever make me happy again. These are the depths a depressed mind can sink to.  
Observing not participating. There is a song from the movie midnight cowboy sung by Harry Nilsson that I think sums up depression beautifully. Here it is. “Everybody’s talking at me, I don’t hear a word they’re saying only the echoes of my mind”. Severe depression is probably like having an out of body experience. You can see and hear everything happening around you but you are not part of it. It can feel very lonely and isolating to realise that you are a spectator to your own life. Your heart aches to be part of something that will make you feel like a human being again but your depressed mind is constantly telling you that this is for other people to experience, not you. Just like the song you literally do hear what everybody is saying but you are lost in mire of the echoes of your own mind. It can feel like you are living a life where the pause button is permanently pressed. A state of non-existing if you like.  
Dysfunctional relating and relationships. It’s no coincidence that the rate of breakups and divorces amongst people suffering depression is quite high. Relating to another human being requires motivation that is sadly lacking as they struggle with their illness. Maintaining relationships requires effort and energy both of which have been sucked out of them. It’s not that they don’t care it’s because they have lost the ability to care and they feel powerless to do anything about it. When you don’t care if you live or die yourself it can be very difficult to care for someone else. They are trapped inside the prison of their own mind desperately hoping for someone or something to set them free. For a depressed person isolating themselves can be preferable to relating even though they absolutely know this is doing them real harm. A depressed mind doesn’t think rationally it will push away the very thing that could help them. It can see relationships as having very little consequence, even though the opposite is true, such is the contradictory nature of depression.  
Lack of autonomy. The most important thing to every human being on the planet is having a sense of autonomy or control over their lives. When depression comes into a person’s life that sense of control is taken away. Choices start to become very limited and the person’s world can become microscopic. In an effort to fill that emotional void many people turn to food, alcohol, drugs, shopping anything in fact that alleviates, however temporarily, the crushing feeling of being out of control of their own destiny. These strategies can of course bring about bigger problems to add to the depression. A sense of meaning or purpose to their lives is missing and in its place is a gaping hole. This can set some people off on a journey to find that missing piece in the vain hope that it will complete them. They never find that thing that will make them whole again because it doesn’t exist. It is a depression generated wild goose chase that can easily turn into an obsession. Depression holds out the promise that if you could just find that thing outside yourself everything would return to normal and the depression would vanish. Unfortunately as many people have found to their cost, including myself, it’s simply not true. The answer lies internally not externally.  
There are a countless different ways that people can experience depression. There are however quite a few commonalities between the different types. If any of the above resonated with you it’s time to seek professional help. These types of symptoms won’t be exercised away, prayed away, snapped out of or ignored. If left unaddressed they have the ability to devastate your life for a very long period of time.

"So I have this weird thought when I feel anxiety attack coming. I say to myself ""stop that's childish"" or ""that's immature"". And so I don't have an anxiety attack.

"My birthday is in a few days. I’ve been so depressed and fighting it by trying to do things that bring me joy, but they keep getting ruined and exacerbating my depression. I tried explaining it to my therapist and pointing out that I’m gonna be 36 and still have no friends to celebrate with, my marriage is a mess and my family is trash. My birthday is just a reminder that I have no reason to be here. I’d say 90% of all my relationships with others are non reciprocal. I don’t realize it until it’s too late and then the anxiety behind looking like an asshole and feeling guilt over not giving and helping people, is what keeps me in these situations. When I try to cut off ties I still get asked for things and assistance. I’m working on saying no and standing behind it. 

I was diagnosed early last year and since then I’ve been working to better understand myself, but it’s kinda just proven my perceived loneliness to be real. This is technically my birthday weekend because my birthday Is Wednesday, but my daughter’s birthday is Saturday. So we will be celebrating her that weekend. Today is Sunday and yesterday they didn’t include me in breakfast. I normally don’t eat breakfast, but my husband said he was making me birthday French toast. (French toast is one of the very few breakfast foods I’ll actually eat for breakfast) By the time I woke up and came down for breakfast they were cleaning up and all the food was being put away. Then we went out to get pellets for my husband’s grill and a few other things. I was quiet just minding my business in my own head and he offered to “stop and pick up something” if I wanted food(didn’t get breakfast), but I don’t want the anxiety of fast food on my birthday and felt guilty asking him to take me out. 
At this point I’m starting to spiral into being sad about my birthday and how it looks to me that no one really wants to celebrate me. I thought birthdays were supposed to be happy and people do nice things for you and it’s a day about you. Being you. The real you. Not worrying about how you’re coming across and celebrating the way you want with who you want and people who love and care for you. I’ve never had that. I’ve planned every birthday celebration for myself since I started celebrating it and every time it’s ended badly. People didn’t show up, or people did show up and treated me badly OR I end up paying for EVERYTHING and then don’t receive any gifts or birthday cards and get asked to do something for someone else the day after or even hours after my thing. 
I’m also a stay at home mom with a part time job and feel unappreciated and inadequate. Even more so around my birthday. My ADHD makes it real hard to make decisions and the people pleaser in me always weighs other people’s preferences even in decisions for myself to avoid conflict. I made it clear to my husband a few years back  that one year I would just like to be free of any decision making. I want someone to take me out for a good time on my birthday. We have been married for 12 years. He said he didn’t want to just take me out, because he didn’t know what I wanted to do because my interests are always changing. Felt like a cop out because he doesn’t know me and couldn’t be bothered to take the time and plan something for me. After all of this I got into my closet and tried to decompress, but again I’m a stay at home mom. Free time and quiet alone time don’t exist. I want to not be alive right now.",1,autism

"I have been dealing with some form of paranoia or paranoid delusions(so they say) for almost 10 years. 

I am not oblivious to the fact that my extended amphetamine use has contributed to this a great deal. The issue I'm dealing with now(sober) is that I can't distinguish the paranoid delusions (from my last extended amphetamine binge) with real life or even the mild lingering paranoia that I deal with day to day.

 I've been on Seroquel 100mg at night for almost 14 months. It used to really help at least calm the thoughts, but now sometimes it makes it worse. 
Everything is connected! I draw lines and make connections from one arbitrary detail to build these grandeous conclusions. The problem is that these details are all based in some amount of truth or so it seems. I can't tell the difference anymore. 

I'm writing this on my main Reddit account and I don't even care. I'm so sick and tired of feeling like this and everyone just calling me crazy... 

It's all based in fear. I know that because I feel it.

Even writing this, the auto correct suggestions are telling me a story that I'm not really supposed to know but that someone wants me to slowly figure out ""on my own."" 

There always seems to be a guiding hand or overseeing entity, seemingly someone who cares about me that wants me to know these secret bits of information but for whatever reason can't just tell me the whole thing.

I'm familiar with projecting and can spot when I'm reaching externally for answers that can be found internally. It's just gotten to a point where I think others use my ""projectjon, paranoia, fears, and delusions"" as a way to discredit the things I think. 

I'm scared. 

I dont know who I can even tell these things to anymore. When I go to people in my network who struggle with similar things, they say it will go away. But it hasn't. 
It's why I go back to drugs continually. It quiets the incessant thoughts. 

I won't go into detail about the delusions. 
A vauge idea of what I think and feel though:

1) Someone is making decisions for me, sometimes and mostly for the good. (They want me to succeed)
2) The people I have met authentically were pre determined and all have a specific purpose in the unknown goal that I am to be used to achieve. 
3) There is no bad or terrible thing that I am meant to do. (I think the path I keep being set on is a righteous one of some sort or at least it's meant to be ultimately positive) 
4) Someone or some group knows more than they are letting on and for whatever reason cannot disclose information to me ... (Imagine being a bystander in an active investigation and the cops don't want to change your behavior patterns because it may disturb the raw data they are trying to gather on the real intended target)
So I may not be the ""main player"" and I am almost certain I am not.

I'm going to stop now cause I'm getting freaked out by the amount of noise cars that have started to drive by even as I write this. 
I'll come back to edit if I feel the need tomorrow. 

I don't think I'm Jim Cary in the Truman Show. Not anymore. I think I'm subsequently apart of something similar but for whatever reason it's imperative I DON'T KNOW the plan.",5,paranoia
"I was diagnosed at an early age (M7) but wasn't treated. 

I hadn't known what ADHD is and how much it affected me, until I researched about its symptoms at the current age of 18. It was shocking of how many I displayed in the Inattentive spectrum, but there was also something that turned my shock into rage. 

I was diagnosed at the age of 7, yet, my parents never treated me with meds except therapy for a short while. 

I asked them why I wasn't prescribed with meds and found out my doctor who diagnosed me claimed that ADHD is not a neurological disorder, and can be ""cured"" with just therapy. Even though therapy did cure my abnormal behavior, it didn't cure anything else. They were still there, which my parents always interpreted it as just me being lazy, not only that but also blamed and shamed me for every time I get distracted, couldn't get things done on time, always forgetting. 

I was also never been accommodated in any school since my parents never disclosed about me having ADHD, so I had to keep up with my peers. 

One time I got fed up with all the blame that I told them to blame the illness for everything, but nope, they didn't listen to that and instead blamed me for ""being proud"" of having ADHD. I never brought it up again as accusations towards me continued. 

Recently, it was graduation day and I was late because of my time blindness and executive dysfunction, and my parents just had to accuse me of being late on purpose, even though I rushed my ass on suiting up. I fought the urge to scream at their faces there that it wasn't my fault and just shoved it down and kept the rage subtle. 

It was supposed to be a happy day, but I was just upset most of the day. Worse, there was nobody I could talk to about it. 

Now, after graduating out of Senior Highschool (more like surviving through it) I don't know what to do. I don't know which course should I pick. I picked Graphic Artist but I hadn't drawn anything since two years ago and I don't have the motivation to draw anymore and shifted to story writing, which I barely write now because I'm losing my focus on it and motivation like drawing. 

I didn't want to lose the motivation to write like I lost the motivation to draw, and I hate ADHD for changing my focus yet again. I also wanted to move out of the family home but I don't have the confidence due to my incapability to organize and my parents doubted me living alone.

"So I was diagnosed with ADHD 10 years ago and while I was accurately diagnosed, there was always a niggling feeling there was something more.

Anyway, I was talking to my therapist on Wednesday and she told me I am autistic. Normally, I would be fine because I basically knew but I had a close family member die last year and all I want to do is tell them, but I can't. It's tearing me up. Damn my brain!

One of the things that really tipped me off is that whenever people described autism vs ADHD, I couldn't understand the difference, no matter how many times people explained it. To the point where I was convinced that ADHD is a form of autism. Nope, I'm just autistic. Although, still not entirely convinced it's not, the comorbidity is so damned high.

I always took those online autism quizzes and I was borderline autistic according to them, but if I corrected for my ADHD, I was firmly in the autistic category.

When I was 10, a kid was introduced to us who had autism and they were explaining what it was, and I remember thinking that was very relateable.

Also, everyone who knows me are like ""you're autistic.""

This post might be a little long and I apologise in advance for any grammar or spelling mistakes since English isn’t my first language. 
First of all I will give you some context, me and my best friend are in the same class and we took a course to get an English certification during the school year (from October to march). 
We had to eat at the school cafeteria every time since the course started one hour after our lessons ended so we didn’t have enough time to go home and eat. 
We used to eat at the same table with this boy, whom we already know from the year’s prior school trip, but during those lunches we started becoming closer friends. 
our classroom and his classroom went on the same trip this year so we were in the same hotel and the three of us spent most of the nights together.
After the school trip we started hanging out after school and text everyday, as friend, as I am not interested in a relationship atm.
Fast forward to today when my friend decides she wants to talk to me before class and she tells me that the two of them have been hanging out together (without me, as I live far away from them) and that she thinks that there might be a little bit of love interest from both parts.
I have been upset all day because of this news because I expected her to tell me since she had known she had feelings for him for almost two weeks. 
I had a shitty day and I have been crying all afternoon because I know that, if they get into a relationship, our trio will change. She told me that I don’t have to distance myself from him because she knows that we are good friends, but i feel like I should and this breaks my heart. 
I’ve been crying all day and now I’m starting to wonder: is it okay to be upset about this situation or am I being to sensitive? 
I really don’t want to be their third wheel but at the same time I don’t want to break our trio…
Can someone tell me if my anger and my sadness are justified or if I’m overreacting? I might go crazy over this!!!

"I’ll try to keep this short and to the point.
About ~9 months ago I started taking flecainide and metoprolol for an irregular heartbeat. At a similar time or a bit earlier  I started having depressive episodes. Episodes where I would feel passively suicidal, hopeless, irritable, and at times full of rage. During these phases I fantasise about running away, abandoning my husband and kids (for at least a while).

Every time I tell myself it’s just PMS and to wait until my period is over before I do something hasty. And once I’ve had my period I come good again. Recently it’s gotten more severe though, during these episodes there is a lot of uncontrollable crying and feeling hopeless. I came very close to telling my husband it’s over on the weekend, and I embarrassed myself in front of his family with my hostile and miserable mood.

I’m thinking about seeing my doctor and requesting SSRI’s to control PMDD. But I haven’t had sex with my husband in two months - will SSRI’s make my libido even worse? I’m in a miserable and depressive dry spell.

My husband is very supportive but it’s starting to take it’s toll. I can sense the kids are picking up on the bad vibes too. 

Does this sound like PMDD? If you’ve dealt with something similar, did SSRI’s help you? Was anybody able to see a libido increase getting it under control?",2,depression
"My partner (m36) has had anxiety all his life. He has grown up with the mindset that men just be strong and stoic and brave.

He has bottled up everything negative within him and not felt it in a healthy manner and it is now causing him to break.

I've tried listening to all that he needs to vent, talking him through his feelings, as a visual thinker I've tried to get him to use the techniques I use with visualizing the anxiety as something or someone physical and talking to it.

"i bought a shirt today (https://www.zumiez.com/a-lab-ballina-lime-crop-t-shirt.html) and it relates to components of my life over the past couple of months.
1. the words “pure joy”- i captioned an instagram picture with these words after i had an amazing shrooms trip
2. lava lamp- Ive had the worst two acid trips of my life after staring at a lava lamp which triggered it
3. the smiley face- i painted my bf a picture that said “have a good trip” with the smiley face very similar to the one on the shirt as the focal point of the painting (even the same colors)
4. stars/twinkles- i put these same type of stars in the background of a separate painting for my bf
5. yin yangs- i recently got a yin yang tattoo
6. the little microorganism looking thing in the bottom left- i made a similar drawing using these designs for my bf. this is also what i imagined the afterlife to be like while having one of my horrible trips
7. the flower in the pot- this was also a focal point of a different painting i did for my boyfriend

so is this just a strange coincidence? or am i grasping at straws? am i just paranoid? i feel like i’m in a simulation and this was made to fuck with me. i didn’t even connect these dots till after i bought it and brought it home. please i need comfort",5,paranoia
"Hey,

For those of you with significant others how do you manage?

My SO seems minimally interested in my mental health as long as outwardly I can keep things together and keep working etc. Ive brought up a few times recently that Im not feeling the best and the conversation just kind of gets changed. This is pretty hard as Im scared of opening up to her to begin with for fear of how she will respond.

So I have some coworkers I can talk to about some of my mental health without judgement - and I do talk to them about it. But it makes me feel incredibly guilty because I feel like Im not being open with my wife.

And then it becomes problematic because I worry that my wife is spying on my conversations and knows that Im talking about my mental health with others.. and Im just waiting for the other shoe to drop essentially. I worry a fair amount she has hacked my phone and that there is going to be some repercussion when she reveals that she knows. 

In some regards this is okay because she then knows what Im talking about and hasnt gotten scared or worried.. but on the other hand I wonder if this is why she seems more irritable? Or am I just perceiving irritability and shes just actually her normal self?

Like has she actually hacked me and knows everything- rationally not.. but its hard to slow down that spiral of thoughts that she has. I guess I worry that she would be hurt if she knew that I talked with others about some of my symptoms - and not her.. even though she really seems to avoid those conversations. Makes me feel like a shitty partner, but I know bottling all of my weird thoughts up inside is not good for me either.",6,schizophrenia
"Lately, my anxiety has been so bad in the morning that I wake up throwing up. I also have an OCD theme of going schizophrenic. I don’t know if you guys know what Hypnagogic hallucinations are, but they are basically hearing conversations or noises kind of out loud when you are waking up or going to sleep. My racing thoughts are so bad and i just get stuck in a thought loop of going crazy all day. I don’t know if it’s my social anxiety but I constantly feel like I can predict what someone is going to say or they are looking at me and judging me for whatever I’m doing. I’ve also noticed that I have random memories that pop in my head. Or just a random words that basically are intrusive thoughts. I did mindfulness today at school or I focused on my breast in for a good bit of time I felt normal and just told myself, yeah, maybe I am going crazy but I’m not focused on that right now and I actually worked. I cannot stop worrying and I constantly need a distraction. That basically sucks me out of reality to stop it all. Also, when I’m in a car sometimes I hear the door slam over and over again in my head. It’s kind of like an intrusive thought but I also kind of feel like I can hear it. I don’t know the same thing happens with the end of conversations. I don’t worry about conversations with people, but when the conversation ends. I have a mental intrusive sound of the conversation repeating itself, but just the end of it. I’ve also noticed that I constantly have random song stuck in my head. also, I feel like I’ve been on Google so much that as soon as I have a worry in my head, I can just kind of imagine googles response. I just want to get out of this phase of my life and move on and figure out what’s going on because it’s scaring me and I can’t focus on anything. With my OCD about being schizophrenic a lot of the times I feel like I’m just on the brink of hearing voices or seeing things even though I never fully see something in my vision or fully hear a hallucination thank you for reading this and please leave a response.",6,schizophrenia
" My previous psychiatrist diagnosed me with schizophrenia but the new one hasn't decided and he says its a little bit of everything and close to bipolar 

I don't know where to start. It was really really bad. 

 I believed I was being chased/protected by a black van

 I believed someone held a gun on my head in a cafe

 I believed I was married to an actress

 I believed people talked to me when I was sleeping I thought maybe my brother brought them on phone and that there was a whole crew on Harvard or MIT or somewhere working on me

I believed I was being watched by cameras

And about hallucinations, I saw the delusion guy following me but there was no one or someone who I edited into the delusion. A tall horsetail white haired man. 

Another one, I just woke up and there was some blonde girl on me

Another one, I woke up and saw my imaginary wife, she came a little closer and said ""Was I real after all, name""

A lot of made up childhood memories, events, people

What do you think? Is it schizophrenia? Lol I can't recognize that guy how am I the same person?",6,schizophrenia

"     Just for context, I’m 17 and I live in the house that someone I love died in. It wasn’t tragic or murder, just a passing.

I have a routine…school, work, home. the only time that changes is on the weekends when i go out to a friends house. i’ve never felt at home here, i constantly feel like i need to watch over my shoulder, even when writing this. it’s gotten worse over the years. If no one else in the house is awake i will NOT leave my room, but if i do, i’m hypersensitive to everything around me. little things like thinking i saw something out of the corner of my eye or just FEELING like there’s something in the darkness of an empty house.. my brain pictures scary things in those moments even though they don’t ACTUALLY happen.

"So I thought I had my trial cancelation strategy down  pat, I immediately cancel trials (for phone apps) as soon as I get them, knowing that the trial still allows me to continue using it  until the end of the trial (and of course, if I decide I really like the app I can always resubscribe for the paid subscription). 

That plus I try to not get ""just for fun"" trials unless I am seriously considering the paid app.

This all fell through when I got a trial last week for a fitness app where it wasn't very clear whether I can still do the trial if I cancel it. So I put a reminder in my calendar to cancel it the day before it ended, and continued with the trial without canceling.

Fast forward, I went through some difficult days physically and mentally last week, forgot about the app (and didn't really use it other than looking through it a couple of times) and completely missed the reminder in my calendar. Yesterday I got hit with the email that I just got charged $39.99 for the monthly app subscription.

I tried to contact Google apps immediately after I saw the charge to explain that I had only logged in a couple of times during the trial and had intended to cancel, but of course they refused to refund the charge. (I was optimistically hoping they would maybe make an exception since my app activity showed I didn't really use it and I had never requested a trial refund before.)

I'm really mad at myself, but at the same time I have decided I'm going to use this as motivation to use the hell out of this fitness app for the next 30 days. My fitness routine has been lagging a bit and I wanted to get into a more structured daily routine, so since I paid for this expensive app I might as well use it.

Also this is my final (well, one can hope...) lesson to never ever leave an app trial running without first canceling it.

That's all folks!",3,adhd

"Hello I’m(24f) paranoid beyond belief about my health and life. I am overweight with a high BMI. I’ve never had much concern until I had my child and then decided to get weight loss surgery. The process for the surgery is long and many different doctor visits. However recently I’ve had a lot of chest pain going constantly to the hospital and each time they said I’m perfectly fine, I follow up with my primary care physician and he even says I’m perfectly fine and the chances of myself having anything wrong with my heart at all are very low. However, with all of that I still fear this upcoming cardiologist appointment that I’ll find out something is wrong and won’t get the weight loss surgery or I’ll die before the appointment or die before I can even get the surgery. It’s gotten so bad where I barely leave bed anymore, the anxiety medications I’m on don’t stop the panic attacks and I’ve cried myself to sleep multiple times in a row. I’m scared my child will go to bed next to mom and wake up to a corpse. I’ve been so paranoid to eat I’ve lost 10lbs in less than a week. I also believe my past eating disorder is returning because if I do manage to eat I immediately become scared I’ll have a heart attack and begging to call myself disgusting for eating when I shouldn’t.

"Hello all- I'm not seeking any medical advice, but wanted to post my story to see if anyone is going through anything similar. I never used to get headaches or migraines, but in August 2020 I caught COVID. The first few months I just had breathing issues, but once those resolved, i started getting headaches in early 2021. Since then, headaches/migraines have been a daily occurrence. 

I've been seeing a neurologist for awhile, and tried a multitude of abortives that didn't help. MRI came back clean. I had a couple decent months with Emgality, but the efficacy quickly waned. After Emgality, I had a series of nerve blocks done to no avail. My most recent treatment has been Botox injections, which has been great,  but the injections are supposed to last about 3 months, but after 6 weeks I'm scared it's efficacy is fading too. I've also tried amitriptyline, but it didn't work and the side effects were too significant.  

I've been out of work for about 12 of the last 15 months, and failed utterly in trying to work through the pain.  I'm very fortunate to be on long term disability, but am no longer employed.  

My official diagnosis is New Daily Persistent Headache or NDPH. My neurologist has very good credentials, but I still feel a bit hopeless because the prognosis is basically ""hopefully it will go away eventually. ""

Has anyone been through a similar treatment trajectory or having your migraines after having COVID? I'm just looking to see if this is more common than I realize or if there's any kind of hope out there. Thanks for reading!",0,negative_samples

Background:
I got diagnosed with AML. I dealt with being in the hospital for a month getting chemotherapy. Being giving my second cancer diagnosis in the last 2 years.I start my second round tomorrow to keep me in chemo remission until I can get a bone marrow. transplant.

Issue:
However simple argument with my two sisters has broken me. I've been crying and I can't get it out of my head. Am I being stupid? I made a simple mistake. My sisters made me feel like a bank robber and my feelings were ignored. (My little sister even said why did you pushing this back onto me I didn't verbally abuse you and don't bring your illness into this. It has nothing to do with it.)
Argument:
I was giving permission to use an audible account to download some books to listen to while I was getting treatment.

The problem was I purchased book under the wrong account. I fixed it but my little sister called and screamed at me for using something she said no too. I started crying because she wouldn't believe it was an accident. And my twin agreed with her.

So , I'm crying because my happy bubble of family helping me was bursted and my feelings weren't validated because of a stupid incident.
Twin didn't have empathy for me and my little sister could give a s*** because I did something bad to her. At least in that moment .

I even do it my my pets, i tell them stuff like ""i know its not you"" and all, i even try to test their normal behaviour.

Another time i remember when i got out of school waiting for my mum to pick me up, i had the sudden fear that everyone, EVERYONE, was not real, they were robots, i could've stand that my loved ones might be too, then the fear went away for most of the time.

I also have this fear of behing spyed on with everything, phone, spy cam, people. I was so scared of that, that i didn't go outside for a long time.

Now back to present, im scared right now, i wonder if i could just take a lorazepam to try and calm that down but i dont have any prescription for it and im scared what it would do if i take one, but i also just want it to stop hurting for the night",5,paranoia

"I’m sure people will also know the feeling, I’ve basically felt it all throughout my working life.

I’ve been good at most of my jobs, but after a while, I quickly find out what is enough to be in the “acceptable” range, where I’m not exactly doing amazing but enough that I’m not doing bad either so I get no hassle from my boss, but the problem is it’s just so difficult to gather the motivation to perform better. 

I will have the rare day in which I feel really good and go into work and smash my targets with relative ease then I’ll come back down to earth again with having enough effort just to avoid any criticism.

It’s heartbreaking at the same time because I wonder what could’ve been if I was able to perform to the standard I know I’m capable of.

I am planning to completely stay outside. There is a small poolhouse with a bathroom in case I need to shower or use the toilet. The dog will be in the house or leashed away from me. I am VERY grateful for my friend being so understanding. 

However… the dog has sat on all the fabric cushions on the beach chairs. They also use the beach towels to dry off the dog before it comes back in. They don’t have separate towels for dogs and people. 

If the towels are washed is it ok if I use them? I do have bad skin reactions to dander and saliva. Is washing them enough?

"I figured I'd type in this subreddit because I quite frankly was unsure where else to go.  
  


I was diagnosed with ADHD while finishing up my first semester of medical school. I had always not been great at paying attention to lectures (or other people talking), I was always incredibly forgetful, I was always late to things, and I always had severe FOMO and I have always had crippling fears of people being upset with me. Whenever I'd talk to people I've always had my brain running 6 thoughts at once, and it never seemed to slow down.  
  
I always figured I was just a 'normal, but slightly anxious person' but when the onslaught of medical school curriculum happened I was hit by a truck. I had in undergrad and high school always been able to ease through my classes and I got away with my tendencies to heavily procrastinate, but med school proved to be too tall of a task  
  
At first, the diagnoses and the Aderall prescription was such a relief. I finally felt like I had figured out the root of my torrid anxiety, my near-0 confidence levels, my med school challenges, and some of my social difficulties. But overtime, I have felt like this past year has still absolutely unravelled me. When I'm on the Aderall, I'm able to nail my schoolwork, I am able to focus, and I am slightly less anxious. But it poses a slew of novel problems that I've struggled with. I am never hungry anymore, and as someone who has been lifting and finally seeing results, this lack of hunger always has stunted my progress. This in turn has made me less confident about my body, which has given me another reason to be afraid to pursue a love life. The Aderall has also warped my experience to go out and drink with friends, which is the usual go to amongst my classmates (the alcohol gets masked until it hits me all at once, and then I'm unable to enjoy myself), and when I'm slightly inebriated and the aderall wears off, I get horribly cranky. In general, the withdrawal I get at the end of the day has made me irritable and snappy, and this started to bleed into my friendships. It has also affected my ability to sleep at times.  
  
I feel in a horrible catch 22. When I'm on aderall I get my academic success back, my head is less of an anxious, swirling nightmare, and I am able to not forget things. However, with the aderall I've found it way harder to achieve the body I want, and the withdrawal I at times feel has made me scared to be near my friends. I haven't taken my aderall in two weeks, but this has just led me to return to being anxious and clingy.  
  
I was writing on here for advise/insight I guess. Whether I'm on the aderall or not, I severely lack confidence, just in different ways (I either feel ugly or anxious or both). My confidence levels are so low that I stopped going out to bars, and I feel incredibly hopeless about finding someone who could manage to love me when my brain feels so unattractive. I also don't like relying on a drug that makes me cranky at the end of the day. I've become less jolly (only my closest friends would notice) and I feel so so lonely. My parents don't understand, and none of my friends have ADHD and are getting attention from members of the opposite sex, are doing well in their careers, and in general are far more sure of themselves (they have their own problems believe me, but I can't help but feel jealous.) I have never felt more unaligned with my own self. I want to be able to find love, I want to not be worried about whether or not my friends are upset with me all the time, I want to have an inner peace and 'enjoy the moment' rather than mostly fret about my past or future. Therapy has helped in ways, but not as much as I'd like at times, and I thought maybe talking to those battling ADHD could help me",3,adhd
"I realized recently how bad my anxiety has gotten over the last few years. And I have realized that in order for me to try and get better, I need to try and do things that help me feel like me again, and not like a shell. I have wanted to write a book for a very long time. I have loads of ideas but when I try and actually write them down and have a story progression I get overwhelmed by the amount of choices the characters have. Who will fall for who. Who will have tragedy. Who will have joy. So many choices and I understand that in order to write you need to write. But, my thoughts consume me and then I stop. So what I'm asking is, how do people with anxiety keep the story they want to tell straight in their mind. How do you not get overwhelmed with choices? How do you not get burdened by the want of your story to have universal themes and undertones and depth? I would truly appreciate any advice. From writer to... one trying to become the writer they want to be.",4,anxiety
"For years, I keep wanting to implement positive changes but haven't found success. Part of it is depression, which is being treated, and ADHD is just recently being treated, but it's still hard to do things I KNOW are good for me. I have inspiring revelations late at night that seem to be completely out of my reach the next day.

I want to eat healthier, exercise, have a small skincare routine, etc. I want prioritize buying myself things that I need rather than what I want. I want to read, learn a language, or meditate.  These are things I've recently learned people do as acts of comfort and self-care, and they enjoy it. But not me - some of my self-care and comfort habits are in junk food, doing the exact opposite of exercise, and struggling to brush my teeth twice a day. Even the healthy food I buy, most of it goes to waste because of the effort or it's less convenient than frozen dinner or fast food.


I can't quite get into doing the better things or feel like I'm doing them for me.  When I buy takeout or X hobby item (that at this point I'm just collecting instead of doing), I get the feeling like that's doing something for myself. But spending the same amount of money on new clothes that I need or a skincare product to get me started? Can't seem to do it, or if I do, I don't use it then feel bad about my current condition.

What I want is to get that same ""comfort"" feeling from the more uplifting things than the harmful/unhelpful things. Is it that I don't want these things ""bad enough"" so my brain doesn't steer me towards them?

I would love to hear the strategies, and even the baby steps, anyone has taken to do more uplifting comfort/self-care things. How do you even get started? How do you learn to love and get pleasure from these things and prioritize them over the other less-helpful acts?",3,adhd

"I didn't realize that the app for my supply company was useless until my last dexcom g6 sensor was applied a week and a half ago, but by then it was Friday at 7pm, and after being on hold for an hour there was nothing I could do until last Monday. 

Monday comes and I think I have time to deal with it, hubris, apparently, because the sensor ripped off the sticky part, that I had attached with skin tac for reassurance that I would make it to the next shipment, on the door frame of the car getting in.

So I get home and call the supply company, and first they told me I can't refill the dexcom yet, oh wait, that's pump supplies... Nope, the Dr didn't sign the prescription last time they sent a refill, that's why it didn't automatically get refilled - call back Friday to check if the Dr has sent it in.

So I called the doctors office after hanging up, and make sure they know it's an urgent fill. Call the supply company on Wednesday, they've got nothing. Apparently they forgot to tell the nurses it was an urgent fill, that I was without coverage that my pump depends on, so nobody chased down my Dr between appointments to sign the form. It was filled out on Monday, they were just waiting for a signature. 

They got it sent in on Thursday, but I had an echocardiogram that day, and that took all my spoons,dealing with that. Found out when I called Friday, but oops they need a prior authorization, which could take 24-48 hours when marked urgent.

"I have been awake over 24 hours and I got to say, the relief that acute sleep deprivation provides is insane. I have not felt like this in so long. Damn I never realized how dark and heavy of a blanket depression has been on my life. Wtf What an eye opener. Not recommending it as treatment, but it is eye opening to do it once in a while and literally see night and day. This is not the only time sleep deprivation has provided total relief. It is well documented. We are talking about acute sleep depravation here, not chronic where a person only sleeps 5 hours a day for extended periods of time, that is really bad for you, but so can being awake days straight.The main point of the post was to stress the eye opening experience that is the relief from depression through acute sleep deprivation. Put it this way: I really did not know what depression was until I saw the night and day difference. Depression is evil. 

Edit: Not on any drugs except weed and caffeine, but those hardly provide relief from depression for me, at least compared to sleep deprivation, shit. Depression cannot be chemical related as I am like this whether I am sober for 9 months or high for 9 months, but sobriety and moderation definitely surely helps.",2,depression
"i just moved into college & it’s the first time i’ve shared a room with someone since my sister back in middle school. i’m living with 3 other people and our apartment has almost no noise suppression and it feels like i have to constantly walk on eggshells. i also have an eating disorder and it’s really hard for me to eat in front of other people, and the fact that they can hear any time i open a bag has made it even harder. i’m genuinely terrified of what they’re thinking when i hide in the closet to unwrap a piece of gum because i know they can hear it. 

one of our roommates also moved in earlier than the rest of us & i cant get the thought out of my head that she planted cameras in certain areas to watch if i do something she doesn’t approve of (she seems to be fairly uptight & strict and i’m constantly scared of angering her even though as of now she’s shown nothing but kindness). she’s also the only one in our apartment this weekend and i can’t get the thought out of my head that she’s going through all my belongings to find reasons to hate me when i come back. 

living in the same room as someone has been especially hard, and ive found myself essentially watching her sleep to make sure she isn’t watching what i do at night. i also keep finding myself watching my roommate who works at the desk behind me in the reflection of my computer screen to make sure she’s not turning around to watch me instead.

"Hello all,

I’ve been noticing recently that whenever I chew mint gum, a few hours later or the next day I wake up with an swollen tongue I can barely feel and a ton of excess saliva. I’ve had mint drinks and this has not happened, and non mint gum and this has not happened, but it specifically only happens after mint gum. I’m at a loss as to what ingredient is only in mint gum other than the mint since I’ve had mint drinks and it didn’t affect me like this? Maybe it’s the mint mixed with the aspartame that create a chemical I’m allergic to

"6 years ago I had an interaction with a sex worker.  It was short lived and I wore protection the two times I saw her and have been rigorously tested for STD's.  After both encounters the lady took the condom into the bathroom and flushed it, or so I think.  I believe her age would be somewhere between 40-50, and she was living with another worker in a very rundown motel.  At the time, I was a virgin and 20 years old and felt the need to lose my card in a non-judgmental way but have since determined this instance to be the worst mistake of my life.   Now to the paranoia:

What are the chances that she took the condom, didn't flush it (I didn't visually witness this) and used it to impregnate herself?  Would someone do that, maybe in a child-support ploy?  Would it work?  I blocked the number directly afterwards.  But her profile was deleted two months later, around the time someone would discover pregnancy?

Go after present-day fossil fuel pollution, not my number one childhood interest, please!

The first train in the video was a photo they'd found online and, instead of white steam, it was emitting black smoke. Believe it or not, it got even worse during a stop motion bit with wooden toy trains. Duke from Thomas made a cameo, and James the Red Engine’s tender was used as one of the wagons when he wasn’t even there. This might sound okay, but not when you realise the landscape turned desolate halfway through the train's journey, making me feel even more like my love for the environment meant nothing if I liked steam trains too.

"first of all, I hope this is the right sub reddit to post this

I have thought about me might having depression for quite a while now. Lately it has been such a string feeling, that I've considered seeing a doctor, reading about experiences from others and taking those quizzes on Google.

I know they don't replace a doctor I can talk to and sometimes I had to pick answers which aren't particularly true because they were kinda in the middle, if that makes sense. I've taken about 10 quizzes and they all said either I could have low or moderate depression.

The reason why I'm thinking about it is because I've felt this void inside of me I never could fill, I have no energy to do basic daily things, like cooking, vacuuming or buying groceries. I'm living with my mom and only clean up when she cones home from her boyfriend who live about an hour away, if I don't have anything to cook or whatever I can always visit my dad so that's a good thing ig. 
Anyway, I also have always felt like I don't belong, or that I feel home nowhere. No matter where I moved I never felt like home. 

One of the questions in the quizzes was if I enjoy things less then I used too and I like doing many thing, like playing bass guitar, doing vocals or drawing and playing games. But literally the only thing I'm motivated to do is either sleeping, playing games or sometimes drawing.

I feel like I have depression not severe depression, I've never even thought about harming myself or commuting suicide or anything but just all of the things above make me wonder if I have depression.

I really wanna see a doctor about this but I also really wanna try getting better without meds.

"Hi. I've recently been through an extensive process of trying to get an ADHD diagnosis. I have it, I know I have it. My sister has a diagnosis of it from when she was a child and my symptoms are so much worse than hers, I've researched back and forth for literal years and it's the only conclusion that makes sense. I figured I needed meds, so I pursued a diagnosis. 

I went through like a whole system of questionnaires aiming to figure out once and for all whether I have ADHD or not. At the end of it all (months of work) my psychologist said I don't qualify. I have plenty of symptoms, especially of inattentive ADHD, but not enough hyperactivity to count, so they can't prescribe me any meds. The condition has such a strict definition in my country and meds are so tightly controlled that I just can't get them. I can't even try them out just to see if I'll get better. 

At first I was pretty frustrated and disappointed, but after about a week, I figured I could at least pursue non-stimulant meds. Surely they'll be less strictly controlled. So I researched and immediately found out all of them require an ADHD diagnosis. Every single one.

Lyumjev has replaced Novorapid with no change in how much I’m taking but the Tresiba is a high dose to try to replace the 2 high doses of split Levemir that I was taking to try and keep my sugars level that wasn’t really working too well and I’ve been trying to get changed for about a year (only been in it a year and a half). Slowly lowering the Tresiba by 2 every 3 nights according to doctor’s instructions (plus almost 24 years experience of being a diabetic) but I’m still having lots of lows.

"So we're struggling to approach a subject with pretty much anyone including our psychologist. 
I'm trans and had surgery last January, and had 2 revision surgeries after that. 
My surgery was on the mainland and I live with my parents on an island, during that first surgery, I had nearly bled out, (we missed a medication that contained aspirin as it was labeled ASA and we had no idea what it was.. And why we keep saying surgery is not something to take lightly) 
I spent two weeks in the hospital and need 4 units of blood to be brought back to baseline (there's 10 units in the human body) and in that time the only ones who were ever in my hospital room were my boyfriends, the two guys flew from the opposite side of the continent from a diffrent country to be with me for surgery. 
And not a single family member came to see me, when 10 years ago I was the first responder to my grandma's heart attack, and my family members flew to see her in the hospital. 
I feel like I'm missing some social que or something that might explain why no one from my blood family even bothered to show up.. Like yes it was covid, but I was allowed 2 visitors at a time, when asked about it I got told they couldn't afford to take a day off (when they're now taking 2 weeks to go see our grandpa in a different part of the country) 
Is there something that I could have done to been abandoned like that?",1,autism
"Hi everyone, 

I recently moved into my new house a few months ago and broke out in a severe rash that originally stated on my forehead, ears, and lips. Now it has been spreading to my chest, arms, and hands.

I went to a dermatologist who took a biopsy of the rash on my neck and arms, which came back inconclusive. They gave me a list of steroids and prescriptions (see the below list for topical and pill form).

I also went to an allergist where they did a TRUE test and tested for 36 allergens on my back. They all came back non reactive.

Here is the list of medications that I’ve tried the last 3 months:
 
Doxycycline 100mg (pill)
Prednisone 10mg (pill)
Hydroxizine 25mg (pill) 
Clindamycin 1% lotion 
Hydrocortisone lotion 2.5%
Desonide cream 

I’ve moved to dove scent free lotion and shampoo. Laundry detergent is scent free, and no perfume. The owners before us did not have any pets, and only lived there 60 days out of the year. We’ve also eliminated our dog from the back yard the past few months. My husband lives with me and he doesn’t have it. 

Would anyone know what this could be causing this? Or more importantly, how to get rid of it?! Thanks so much!!",0,negative_samples
"Unless one looked closely, everything in my life would seem fine from the outside. I am at college, am lucky to live in relative comfort and have parents who are decent people.

The thing is... I am absolutely miserable. My life feels completely empty and nothing I do is fulfilling. I got a job offer for a graduate position due to start at the end of the year and I declined because the thought dealing with real world responsibilities while living an empty existence is too much for me. I know it would drive me to suicide. Even now I think about suicide on a daily basis. 

How do people cope with this life? How do people even hold down full-time jobs? For me it seems it's just all too much. And in this modern world it feels as though our lives are increasingly devoid of meaning and purpose. I am so lonely and I know I'm not the only one, but it's like we have lost our way as a society.

"Thinking about travelling south east asia for \~4months from this November onwards, we will have until the end of February. I have a loose outline of where we would like to go but thought it would be great to get tips from more experienced people. In general I hate moving too fast, so it might seem like lots of days in somewhere you may stay less, but I want those days to rest and recharge.

Here is my basic itinerary (The nights in each place is fluid and can change) . We want a mixture of everything (nature, culture, party ... everything!)

THAILAND (we have already been to krabi, khao sok, chiang mai)

\- Land in Bangkok, 1-2 nights here (have been a few times before)

\- Bus / Ferry to Koh Chang, \~6nights here (I know this is a bit long but i really want to kick it all off with a relaxing beach time after the stress of moving out of our current home) 

\- Back to bangkok 1 night

\- Khao yai nature tour \~2 nights

\-Train to Chiang mai \~4-5nights

\- Bus to Pai \~ 4-5nights

\- Bus to Chiang Rai \~4-5nights (perhaps go see phu chi fa sunrise for one of these nights)

\- Slow boat to Laos (1night in pakbeng)

LAOS

\- Luang prabang 4-5nights

\- Train to Vang Vieng 4-5nights

\- Train to Vientiene 4-5nights

\- Fly to Pakse 4-5nights

\- Bus to Don Det 4-5 nights

CAMBODIA (bus everywhere here)

\- Siem Reap 4-5nights

\- Phnomh Penh 4-5nights

\- Kep 2-3nights

\- Kampot 2-3nights

\- Sihanoukville 3-4nights

\- Koh Rong 5-6nights

\- Back to Phnomh Penh

VIETNAM (here is where i am really struggling to fit it all in 30 days) 

\- Flight to ho chi minh \~3nights

\- Train to mui ne \~3nights

\- Overnight train to Hoi an \~4nights

\- Hai van pass to Hue \~3nights

\- Bus / train to Phong Nha \~3nights

\- Bus to Ninh Binh - \~3-4nights

\- Bus / ferry to Cat ba \~ 3nights (maybe a cruise)

\- Bus / ferry to hanoi \~1night

\- Hai Giang loop tour \~4nights

\- Hanoi \~2 nights

My questions:

1. Does anyone see any glaring problems with this route
2. Should we spend less time in laos and do a visa run in vietnam so we can spend longer here? Or less time in laos & cambodia and try fit in Malaysia for 2 weeks? 
3. I dont want to rent motorbikes because I am scared of an accident, I have heard /seen so many horror stories and even know of 1 death on them whilst riding in SEA. Everyone seems to report that this is their favourite ever thing they did though so i am a bit torn, just wondering if anyone else has chosen not to rent motorbikes? 

It seems a bit too ""planned"" which is fair, but this is just a loose itinerary that we would be happy to change en route.

i'm happy for an hour, but then someone says or does something that makes me feel upset.

the moment i find something that makes me happy, it gets shut down by the people i love. i cant do this. i just fucking cant.

i cant tell anyone anything because whenever i feel like shit other people have things going on in their lives. my problems dont matter. i dont matter.

"Granted, it’s been a few years since I’ve done either of these, but the itchiness I got afterwards was probably the most itchy I’ve felt in my life. 

When I was a kid, mom and I were squeezing grapes through a pantyhose, I think to help my Tia make homemade angelica wine. My hands and arms were ridiculously itchy afterwards for over an hour. As for pumpkin, my family thinks I am a wuss for not wanting to scoop the guts out of my Jack-o-lantern every Halloween, but it’s partly because of how itchy I get after handling the guts. Now I just stab Mr Potato Head parts in my pumpkins to avoid carving altogether.

I’m fine with eating grapes, but never eaten pumpkin. I’ve literally only had itchiness after handling them those few times in the past. Could those have been allergic reactions?

"I had an upsetting conversation with a friend today. They were upset about a status I posted online, because it referenced me worrying they were manipulative. This is a status I blocked them from seeing purposefully and did not name drop them. It was purely to reach out and get support. They didn't even know the full status I made, that I ended by saying I wasn't sure if it was true or a trauma response. I just wanted advice on how to cope. But someone, and I don't know who but I have two people that I believe it probably could be based on past conversations, decided to inform this friend about the status. And apparently they were not informed of the full status. They decided to talk to me about whether or not I actually thought they were manipulative. I don't think it's fair that I had to have a conversation about thoughts I never intended on sharing with them. My anxiety is very high right now and I started to dissociate, possibly to stave off this becoming paranoia about their intentions and the other people involved in this. Ironically I feel manipulated. But as I usually do in these situations, I am telling myself not to believe any of my thoughts as true since I recognise that it's extreme to believe everyone is against you. Because I'm fighting off believing that I'm unsafe right now around people who completely disconnected from the conflict.

I guess the point of this post is I don't feel like there's anyone in my life I can talk to this about right now. Because the people I'm closest too are potentially involved or one degree of seperation away, and my other outlet was to make a status with a filtered audience and now I feel like I can't do that without it coming back to this person. 

Any advice on how to find someone to talk to? It would be helpful to have a friend that also deals with paranoia, and maybe when we have anxious thoughts we can talk to each other to help one another become grounded in reality again. Any thoughts are welcome.",5,paranoia

"First of all, don't use any management tools including this to avoid seeking professional help. That said, let's keep it real. Let me give you a process and then some tools.

First, really get a grasp of the actual problem. I can't speak for you, but if I hypothetically had such an issue, I'd imagine what is happening is that I'm always very fixated on potential negative motives and plans of other people. There's a lot of paranoia involved in this, and what really would fuck this up is if your hyperfixation on this was ever partially validated. Because then, if part of the scenario you played out was validated, and you can process and think through all the rest of the negative scenarios, you necessarily believe then that anything you can conceive yourself is actually being done by others that have these detrimental motives.

What's the problem then? You will constantly maneuver and avoid or confront those things constantly. You can't function because you are in constant fight or flight.

How can you manage it? Well, easy, allow yourself to completely play thru the worst scenarios and delusions. Think about what the world is and your place if it were true. Realize despite it, you're still here. Whatever the worst thing that could come to pass is (most likely some sort of being killed), come to terms with it now and be amazed of the experience of life you've had and the potential opportunity to pull the cloak away before you slip back into the same aether you were pulled from before birth. Let go of your ego and your need to fight something that if actually is, is so much bigger and awe stricking than you that you should feel privileged to be the focus of such a thing. Allow the ultimate thing you fight every moment to avoid to consume and carry you away, it's OK. We all will turn into the same dust in the end, everything you do and experience will end in you fertilizing the soil exactly the same as your enemies. There are no winners. Allow what can pass to pass, if for nothing more than to witness it and be amazed.

If you no longer fear the meaningless consequences you were trained to fear by your doubts and conditioning, you will be free to just exist and observe, and whatever time you have there, you will be happy and you will be able to do anything you want.

Stop fighting, just let the forces push and pull. Let yourself be in danger, accept death knowing it comes exactly the same for anyone who plotted against you.",6,schizophrenia

"I’m kinda losing my mind and have been scrolling Indeed for the past 2 hours. This turned into the longest, disorganized post I’ve ever written. I’m so sorry 

I’ve been working since I’ve I turned 15 and have experience as a fast food worker, server, dog sitter, Doordasher, tutor, wedding assistant, and house cleaner. I’m going to college to be a therapist, but I’m not even sure I’ll enjoy that.

But anyway, I just recently started working fine dining after not serving for a while and this particular restaurant is not scheduling me. I only have one shift next week :) I’m losing my mind since I just finished my semester and have nothing to do. But I also dread going to work because my anxiety is through the roof whenever I start a new job. They’re really strict with making mistakes, and I’ve already made a couple and been yelled at. Ive always had awful social anxiety, but I was able to get over it with my last job serving. I did enjoy it, but it had a lot of management issues. I quit and started 4 different jobs at once (dog sit, doordash, tutor, wedding assistant) and got overwhelmed of course. I hated doordashing, tutoring, and there’s just not enough hours for the wedding assistant job. I desperately need a lot of money to support myself in college, so that’s why I did that, but I need structure in my life. I literally failed 2 classes this semester, this is the worst I’ve ever done. 
That’s why I’m working at this new restaurant, but there’s no point in staying if they’re not scheduling me, right? So I’ve turned to scrolling Indeed and changing the filters every possible way to find something I could apply to. But will I apply to anything today? I haven’t even updated my resume since I started this new job. I hate interviews. I hate quitting jobs. I don’t know what kind of job I’m looking for, or why I’m doing this, and I can’t stop.

This was supposed to be an advice post but honestly this is just a messy rant. like what the hell am I doing? I just want to feel productive, make money, get out of debt, and have a job that will work with my college hours once the next semester starts. AND it can’t make me lose my mind. I can’t find it. I can’t make myself do any of my hobbies and just enjoy my summer because I’m so stressed about money and figuring out a new job. indeed is not showing me good restaurants hiring around me, maybe I should just move away from serving again. I don’t know what to do with myself. I don’t want to doordash anymore because my car is awful, so I can’t even do that to fill my time. I’m currently dog sitting, but they’re stressed out, throwing up, and they’re old so I’m irrationally anxious they’re going to die at any moment. I wish I was at home with my cat :(",3,adhd

"I enjoy reading books that really speak to my senses. Partly because I'm kind of always in my head, so books that make me aware of sensations allow me to leave my head and go into my body and explore it a little more in terms of my bodily memories or sensations or desires.

One example is the book Chocolat by Joanne Harris, which I read after I saw the movie (with Binoche and Depp).

Here's a quote from the book, just to give you an idea of what I mean:

>In glass bells and dishes lie the chocolates, the pralines, Venus’s nipples, truffles, mendiants, candied fruits, hazelnut clusters, chocolate seashells, candied rose-petals, sugared violets . . . Protected from the sun by the half-blind which shields them, they gleam darkly, like sunken treasure, Aladdin’s cave of sweet clichés. And in the middle she has built a magnificent centrepiece. A gingerbread house, walls of chocolate-coated pain d’épices with the detail piped on in silver and gold icing, roof tiles of florentines studded with crystallized fruits, strange vines of icing and chocolate growing up the walls, marzipan birds singing in chocolate trees . . .

"I had to move back to the suburbs a couple years ago and been struggling with commuting big time. Every single time I start a new job or new studies, on the first day I arrive super organised, carefully dressed and combed, my skin glowing, and a nice little make up on; all my lunch boxes and outfits are done for the week, my home is in order, and I have a fancy new notebook and take neat notes. But everyday after that, my structure falls apart a bit more. A week or two later, I go to school (it's worth mentioning I'm changing careers) unshowered, with greasy hair, nothing to eat for lunch, my smoking habit back, dressed like a coat rack,  my notebook looking full of doodles and scribblings, because I can't keep up, and shores piling up at home.

Everyday I want to call in sick just so I don't have to run and can catch up with my shores. Even though I love what I'm studying.

"After lamenting about my lack of drive to a friend for a bit too long, they just plainly asked me, “Well what is it that you actually want?”

It stumped me. 

I don’t really “want” anything. I avoid discomfort, try to extend time in bed as long as possible, use my phone for 14 hours a day, etc. But it’s not really that I want to do those things, they are just reflexive. I’m just in so much pain and I’m so exhausted I need to retreat - constantly. 

Do I want friends? Hobbies? A job that I love? 

I mean of course I do in theory, in concept. When I actually imagine having those things, or attempt to conjure some kind of spark of interest, there’s nothing there. It’s just a dark, cold, cavernous pit in my chest. In THOSE moments I can definitely tell you what I want - I want to go to sleep. 

I have no vision of my future. I barely make it out of bed each morning. I keep putting one foot in front of the other, but sometimes I need to ask, “Why?” and the silence is crippling, I have no response.

"I'm not sure I trust scans anymore  The last scans I had were assessed improperly. I have this large tumor on my calf that started growing outward. It became the size of a large grape fruit in the span of 2 months. When my scan came back it said that I had no significant growth. I was so confused. Then I came to realize that the reason they didn't comment on any growth is because they only measured the length and width of my tumor but didn't measure the height. I was really pissed off because I think its a fairly dumb mistake. Its pretty fucking basic that tumors are 3 dimensional and even if they don't normally measure the direction my tumor grew in you would think they would have someone do a visual comparison between the previous scan and the current and see the very obvious growth. Not with the imaging place I go to, apparently they just mindlessly plug in numbers. My report was changed after the fact, after my actual oncologist came back from his break and saw that the tumor had obviously grown. 

I also don't really like my team anymore. I had a lot of pain from my tumor being so large and had to quit my job because it was too painful to do things like walk or stand. I was referred to radiation and received it for 10 days straight. It did shrink it quite a bit (now it's more apple sized than grapefruit) but I now have chronic lymphedema and it hurts to stand and walk now by default.

"Congratulations to Koji Yakusho for winning the best actor award at Cannes for the film Perfect Days. He's been in so many fantastic Japanese films over the past few decades. My personal favorite is from Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Cure. But he has also made a career of portraying famous samurai.

His breakout role was playing **Oda Nobunaga** in a major TV drama in 1983. TLDR: he tried to unite Japan and is perhaps the most famous person in Japanese history (see Takeshi Kitano's upcoming movie Kubi as well as the recently released epic The Legend and Butterfly). He had already played Nobunaga's less important son **Nobutaka Oda** a few years prior. In 2013, he starred as Nobunaga's top general **Shibata Katsuie** in The Kiyosu Conference, a historical comedy which still features both Odas.

In 2017, he would appear in Sekigahara as commander **Tokugawa Ieyasu**. TLDR: Sekigahara was the deciding battle of this era of Japan, and Tokugawa and his family would officially unite the country and rule over it for 200+ years. Pretty good film. 

Going back a few years both historically and contemporarly, Yakusho would also play **Takeda Shingen** in an eponymous movie from 1991. TLDR: He was the strongest regional warlord (and the subject of Akira Kurosawa's Kagemusha) and was killed by the combined forces of Nobunaga and Ieyasu. Yakusho and Yakusho (along with his son Yakusho and his general Yakusho) killed Yakusho.

He also plays **Miyamoto Mushashi** in a famous TV show. TLDR: He's a decent swordsman who is referenced pretty much anytime samurai swords are mentioned. Watch that trilogy of Toshiro Mifune films. He was born right after Nobunaga died and only possibly went to Sekigahara, but he's still around the same time period.

That's six very famous people who all more or less interacted with each other in real life played by the same actor. Are there other actors with a similar story?",0,negative_samples

"So I got a sore throat 2 weeks ago to the day. It got worse for about a day or two then got better. Was finish for about 5 days, and then I the throat got a little more sore a little deeper in my throat. Now it’s just dry and I’m coughing at night when I lay down. It feels so dry. I can’t sleep. I’ve tried sleeping a bit more elevated and using a humidifier. Other than that, I feel fine. I’ve had allergies one time and unlike that time - I’m not congested, eyes don’t itch.

I took Claritin and mucinex for 10 days. Didn’t seem to help. Didn’t do anything for 5 days and trying Zyrtec now. I literally just cannot sleep because when I lay down my throat gets even more dry and makes me cough, which is like some loop of keeping my throat sore. Occasionally I can clear my deep in my throat, but it’s not like phlegm.

"I just started taking antipsychotics (Haldol) after a lot of serious psychotic breaks I’ve had the last couple months. 

Two years ago I had my first psychotic break which scared me so much I started antipsychotics (Olanzapine) almost immediately. The symptoms went away mostly but the side effects were a bitch. I gained 15 kilo’s, slept all day and I couldn’t even feel close to the people I love most. I took them for one year and started slowly getting off of them under supervision.

So the past few months I tried to tell myself that I could handle all the psychotic breaks I’ve had and I’ll be okay. Starting antipsychotics would be the last thing I wanted to do.

I just started taking Haldol. In only two days I started to see benefits already. My memory started to get a bit better and self care started to get effortless almost. 

But I’m still very scared of the side effects that could occur. I’m terrified of gaining weight (I most likely would also have an eating disorder) and loosing interest in everything and everyone. 

All the experiences I read here about antipsychotics are negative (which I get) but I also want to get better and try to stay on my medication. I’ve tried these meds before and convinced myself and my psychiatrist I didn’t need them.

So long story short I came here to ask for advice and for some personal positive stories on antipsychotics and/or haldol.",6,schizophrenia

"It started when I was bored at school. I was imagining how my life would look like if I was in a relationship with my teachers or classmates (I often wonder how my life would look like if I did something differently. It's not because I'm not satisfied with my life but because I'm curious or just have nothing else to do). This combined with the fact I just changed schools and was excited to meet new people made me panic a lot because I was afraid I had a crush on someone else than my bf.


At one point a year ago I wanted to masturbate to having a threesome with me, my bf and someone else. For some reason I didn't just imagined a random person but one of my classmates. I've been paranoid I have a crush on that guy ever since. 


The thing is, I don't even remember that he exists when I'm not panicking. We don't even talk to eachother anymore because I don't want to.


My bf knows about all of this. He forgave me and still trusts me. I would never cheat, I was just a dumbass who thought that imagining things is harmless (I stopped doing that after I realised how wrong it was).


I'm not paranoid about cheating with only that guy, I'm afraid I'll cheat with every single man I talk to (which is pretty funny since I'm bi). Talking to someone even when it's my freaking cousin? Cheating. Doing makeup for my crossdresser friend? Cheating. Being hit on even though I'm telling this person that I'm not interested? Cheating. Sitting next to a man? Cheating. Looking at a man and thinking he has nice clothes or just looks good? Cheating. Ironically, thinking a girl looks gorgeous and sexy isn't cheating... Fangirling over a freaking character in a movie? Cheating. Hugging my own fucking boyfriend? Cheating. Wtf brain?? 


Unfortuneatley it started evolving. My female bff, who's the type of person who kisses her homies goodnight, told me she loves me. Nothing unusual. Like I said, she tells it to everybody. But now I'm afraid I had a crush on her in the past too even though when she offered to kiss me two years ago (she never kissed a girl before and wanted to know how it feels like) I refused. 


I know I don't have crush on someone other than my bf. I'm afraid I HAD a crush in the past even though I havent. This possibility disgusts me even though I don't think catching feelings towards someone else while being in a relationship is wrong as long as you don't cheat. I love my bf and would never forgive myself if I'd develop a crush on someone else even if I'd ignore it and would work on fixing our relationship.",5,paranoia

"I see a therapist frequently. recently, trying to make sense of my condition after a diagnosis, my therapist asked for full disclosure. Issue is, i have a bad memory and a lot of the things I imagine are important leave me by the time i speak to her or by the time I feel more normal. 

I'm not a great writer but I am good at following instructions and strict formats. This makes essays and essay planning a really nice way for me to organize, visualize, and remember my thoughts. I took to my notebook to write down things I thought, saw, heard, felt, or theorized about. I remember writing pages and pages of either semi-fleshed out thoughts and bullet points. its been about two weeks since i last opened that book because last time i saw it i felt incredible dread that my own blood would be inside that book and i didn't want it to trigger anything. I decided to look at what I had written today since I felt i was at the point of forgetting. 

Reading what I wrote was honestly more cathartic and stressful than entertaining my fears of whatever could have been in the notebook. Where I had expected ramblings and point form notes of my emotions and day-to-day, I found a lot of writing that was either irrelevant or half done (without even mentioning syntax and grammar). I can't even tell what i remember. There were ramblings for sure but they read more like short stories from a middle schooler with too much time to think. There were point form notes but of memories such as a man speaking to me and his stern eyes. Even the notebook I held as i was reading this was not the one I remember holding while writing; I have no other notebooks i would have used.

I cant help but feel helpless and somewhat afraid. even ashamed of being irresponsible. I cant even tell what's going on. ive been told one thing by a doctor but even here i struggle to identify what i can relate to and cant. I cant even tell if ive had an episode or if this is a rumbling before something much worse or if there is any value to this because I dont even know if this is a thing that happens or something else im gonna have to improvise on.",6,schizophrenia

The place is kind of a store within a store so we see the big store employees a lot but we don't really interact with them. 

To the point, there is an employee from the big store that as I learned likes to talk, a lot, with a lot of people. During the day it doesn't concern me cause there are my coworkers to apeak with her, but on evening shifts I'm left to fend for myself. 

And OH MY GOD she just keeps on talking. No matter how many 'hmm's and empty' oh really's and 'aha's or just plain out stare at her without saying anything she just won't stop.

"The meds make me fat. I'm 19m and never dated, still a virgin. We still don't know if it's schiz or drug induced psychosis but my doctor has a hunch it's schiz. Could go away in the course of a year though now that I'm off weed but it's been two months and still no improvement aside from what medication can do. I've been hearing voices for almost two years now but I've been smoking weed for most of that time with occasional breaks. Longest break was 3 months off cannabis with no improvement in symptoms so I just went back to smoking. Finally quit for good though. 

Only time I've ever truly felt love was on stimulants and it was entirely one sided. And my doctor doesn't want to prescribe any stimulants due to psychosis and past abuse of my ADHD meds before I had psychosis.

I've gone up to 193lb and I'm 6 foot. I can hardly manage to lose any weight on meds. Along with psychosis I'm also just generally emotionally unstable. I think about doing hard drugs because the only person I've ever truly loved doesn't love me or seem to give much of a shit about me. I don't even know if I'm in love anymore but I'm nostalgic and miss feeling in love and alive. Medication makes it hard to even feel love.

I just want to do opioids and amphetamines. My family will kick me out if they find me doing drugs other than weed, alc, nic, or kratom though even if they're just research chems, which fall under a loopwhole and can be openly sold despite being analogues and derivatives of common drugs. They just can't be labeled for human consumption.

I loved her so fucking much, hell man I loved her even when she was still going by he I just thought I must've been bi or something. And I don't know if I'll be able to find anyone with the emotional instability, amphetamine cravings, weight gain, and psychosis. I'm a mess. Incredibly self destructive too. If I had a plug for hard drugs I'd already be on them.

And that's not accounting for the fact that I may not even be able to feel love anymore because of meds. I just want to feel in love again even if it was one sided. At least thinking about her brought me feelings of euphoria. I miss the intensity. Feels like I'm doomed to a dull medicated life.

Sometimes the voices pretend to be her just to try to fuck with me. 

It feels like she doesn't give a fuck about me or see me as more than an acquaintance or just part of the same circle of friends.

I have nothing to talk about with anyone either because I'm too apathetic. Stimulants would help but my doctor refuses to prescribe them. If he doesn't prescribe me a low dose of Dexedrine I may end up on either meth or flourinated amphetamine based research chems. Telling him that won't do any good though. If it wasn't for me feeling sappy and self destructive romantically I'd just take low doses to medicate myself where my doctor is failing me.

Wellbutrin worked for like a month or two and after that all it did was make me even more irritable than when I was abusing stims and made me grind my teeth a lot. I never ground my teeth on Dex. But I did on Wellbutrin :/",6,schizophrenia

I understand I made the requirements to graduate and earn my degree, but I still feel unsatisfied because of my grades. Also, I took advantage of the counseling services at my school while I was there. The most heartbreaking thing about graduating has to be the fact I have to move on from my therapist. She was the coolest person on the planet and I’m happy she decided to work on my campus. I’m not going to lie, I am starting to feel very lonely now that I can’t have those services. She was the main person I could talk to about a lot of things and she understood me. I have friends but the thing is, we don’t relate on many personal problems that I needed to see a therapist for in the first place. I just feel very alone.",2,depression

For context, on my last post I mentioned my paranoia taking over me. Re-reading things multiple times when i looked at them because I was scared that I was looking at it wrong, saying my family relative's names in my head because I'm afraid of forgetting them. Feeling slow, forgetful. Paranoia immediately making me think I have schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, dementia. Anything. I rewind videos several times to a certain part that I wasn't sure what was said to reassure myself that I heard that specific part correctly. I remember most things obviously, I'm not forgetting old or new memories exactly, but it feels slower and I can't focus. My thoughts are just overthinking or paranoid thoughts about how I'm forgetful.

I take meds currently, diazepam and escitalopram. I freaked out tonight for example, because I forgot to bring half of a pill to my room, but then remembered later. Because it was something more important than rewinding because of a clip of a video that I wasn't sure if I heard it or saw it correctly, I freaked out even more. And now I'm typing this to vent, and HOPING to god that I'm not alone in these weird things. I feel like crying and just vanishing. I don't know what to do. I'll form a thought in my head to check discord for example aswell, I'll keep repeating the thought in my head so i remember to check discord, I'll then sometimes proceed to do something else that I wanted to do, forget about discord for a few minutes, check it, and then REALIZE that I was trying to not forget about it, and then I'll feel like a screw up.

My paranoia makes me fearful that I'm going to lose my entire memory basically.

I just don't know what's wrong with me and it's hard to fully explain and rationalizing it without sounding stupid and crazy.

"I’m 27 and trying to prove a point to my mom. Last week, I ended up in the ER for what I thought was my gallbladder going bad. Tests revealed its colitis. WBC & platelets were high too on blood work. Also have had high inflammatory markers that no one has figured out for the last few years. 

For as long as I can remember I’ve had gut issues. It’s been brushed off as IBS & my celiac. 

Symptoms: 
Off and on diarrhea (sometimes with blood) 
Fatigue 
Joint pain 
Low vitamin d levels 
Stomach pain
Food sensitivities 

I saw my PCP and GI and they’re unsure if it was some type of infection that caused the colitis or if it’s IBD related. PCP believes it’s IBD and it’s fueling the joint pain. 

After doing research, I’ve convinced myself it’s crohns. I get an endo and colonoscopy in early June.

I went from having severe anxiety about these things to just not even being able to work towards them and watching the things i want slip away and become completely out of reach.

"Hi all,

Husband and will be leaving to travel Japan, Indonesia and Malaysia on the 4th to the 29th of August. We planned to spend a week in each county however, have set aside nine days in Indonesia so we do have two days that we can add elsewhere. 

We are in our early thirties and this is our first time travelling. We are not into partying or drinking and are looking for culture, good food, an opportunity to see natural beauty and some days off to just relax. 

Our itinerary initially included Singapore but we have compensated in hopes that we can spend longer in each destination rather than feeling rushed. 

This is our current plan:

Malaysia:

5th Arrive into Kaular Lumpar 
6th Kaular Lumpar
7th Cameron Highlands
8th Penang
9th Penang
10th Langkawi
11th Langkawai

Indonesia 
12th Arrive into Jakarta 
13th Jakarta
14th Fly to Bali stay in Ubud
15th Bali Ubud 
16th Bali Seminyak
17th Bali Nusa Dua
18th Bali Uluwatu
19th Fy to Lombok
20th Lombok Gilli islands

Japan
21st Fly to Tokyo
22nd Tokyo
23rd Osaka
24th Osaka
25th Hakone 
26th Hakone
27th Visit and island off of Japan


This is what we have managed to come up with so far, please can someone that has been to any of these destinations critique our current plans and help make the best of these 3.5 weeks that we have. Also if anyone has any recommendations for food outlets or hotels please feel free to drop them as we are looking for accommodation. We are looking for mid tier accommodation, but are more than happy to splurge on hotels/retreats that are beautiful/scenic and offer a luxury feel as the trip is our once in a lifetime. We have a budget of 6/7k.

"(This is extremely long. To have an idea on how long it is, I started typing this at 4:53 pm, and finished at 5:15 pm)

I legitimately have tried my best to at least try to find the bright side to life throughout the 6 months, but holy fuck, it's hard to.  My life has pretty much gotten worse. My family is struggling to find a home as we don't have enough money to stay to where we're living at right now, so we might become homeless. I feel like I genuinely have no one to tell how I truly feel about personal stuff, and life  general. People always say that they're always there if I'm ever feeling a certain way, but whenever I try to text them if I can talk to them, they either haven't seen it for the past couple of days, or they see it, and don't respond. I try to talk to some of my friends in a group we're in, but I always get interrupted in the end, and I feel completely invisible when it comes to me trying to be social in general. I try to talk to my (not so sure anymore) girlfriend, but we barely talk anymore at this point. Yesterday, I called her to try to explain how I feel about stuff, and how I feel like I'm invisible to her, and our friend group, but then she ends up being the one to talk the most, with her saying that me and her should take a break. I don't blame her at all, with her giving some valid reasons, but it gets me sad and kinda fustrated at the fact that I didn't really have the chance to explain how I feel. Things are real awkward now, I get scared to join in any conversation with the group because of what happened yesterday, I get scared that I might cause something within the group, and mess everything up. I feel invisible towards everyone in general, I never really get the chance to speak, as I either get interrupted, or people just kinda trash talk me as a response. I can't even really have an important conversation with my broken family about how I feel with them, because they don't really take me seriously, and they just either brush it off, or yell at me. I feel like I have no one to talk to about how I feel. It's like being trapped in a hole, trying to get dirt to help build yourself back up, but the only way to get the dirt is to dig down. I don't know anymore, I'm only 15 years old. I shouldn't even be thinking about this type of stuff. It's gotten so bad to the point I've been starting to scrape my leg & calves with a knife, and what I find horrifying is that, I don't enjoy it, but yet I do. I know that I'm not supposed to do this to myself but, it's such a relief when I do. I feel so guilty when I do it, but at the same time I don't, I feel like I deserve what I do to myself. Maybe I'm just sounding stupid, or making no sense, maybe typing all of this was just a waste of time, but I'm far into this to stop. I don't know, at this point, I just give up. I tried my best to be happy, but it's impossible. All I ever wished for, was to be happy, and live a happy life, but it seems like that wish isn't gonna come true. I'm sorry if this seems messy, or if it sounds stupid, or if it wastes your time as you finish reading.

I’m thirteen and I’ve only really stayed home for 10-20 minutes at a time, however, today my parents needed to go somewhere and I couldn’t come because I had homework. In the hour that I was home alone, I felt as if I was being watched. When my parents got home, my dad asked, “why was the light on in the garage, and, “why isn’t the dishwasher running anymore?” To this I freaked out.

"I’m going to try and make this as short as possible. 

During the first Covid lockdown, I did some stupid things that forced me to move schools. Nothing malicious, but posts online were “found”. Moving schools during a period of extreme public health regulations led me to make no friends, and so I have sat on my own every lunch for the past three years in school. Coupled with losing most of my old friends, I have been challenged pretty extremely, but I didn’t face “consequences” until recently. I have been using coping mechanisms for the past three years, albeit flirting with suicidal ideation and, on many an occasion, considering it as a legitimate option. 

My leaving school exams are coming up in a few weeks, but I struggle to get out of bed before 2pm, laze on the couch all day not studying, and I don’t even get any exercise anymore.

"Ok, so I haven’t ever actually gone this in depth explaining what I experience. Like ever. And it might seem weird that I would feel comfortable telling strangers on the internet, but that’s just where I’m at right now. 

Ever since I was a kid, I have felt like someone could see me. Like all the time. Not necessarily in a malicious out to get me way, just like someone could always see me. And what’s weird is that it’s not super specific or thinking there is a specific motive. And what’s even weirder is that it’s usually characters of a show or movie I just watched. That’s the most embarrassing part. Because I KNOW they aren’t real people. So when I dispute the cognitive distortion, my stupid brain switches it to the actor that can see me. 

I’m also pretty sure someone in the government can see everything electronically that I do and is judging me constantly to the point where most of the time I can’t write in a word document, it has to be by hand if I’m writing notes or journaling. 

And all of this is exhausting. So sometimes I will get to the point where I just say “whatever” and go about my day. Or I might explain what I’m doing because I don’t want to be misunderstood by whoever can see me.

Background: The first episode I had at 14 resulted me into illegally (well trying) leaving the country with no identification because (according to the medical report) thought that I was being watched and followed by some type of form of government. I have no memory of the episode I just remember that one day I was walking to school then 2 days later waking up in the psych ward confused. That was my first ever major episode. Then up until I was 17 I had like minor ones but some not but some major enough to lead me in the hospital but I don’t really remember them just like the first one at 14. My last major one was at 17 where I went to go over to my boyfriends house and then he told me (later on after I was stabilized) I was “going crazy” and thinking that the police were after me which landed me also again in the hospital for 1.5 months and my official diagnosis.

Anyways I’ve been catching myself getting a little delusional lately like off and on and I’m even on high prescriptions of antipsychotics and having vivid dreams of where I’m watching myself in the dream becoming more and more out of touch of reality but this time in my dreams I never recover really and I’m like “stuck” idk I feel like if I do end up in another episode I feel like it’s gonna last longer than 1.5months.

"(CW: ED, overbearing parents, undiagnosed)

Hi!! This is my second post here. This is also kind of a rant. I am doing not super okay since then but I need advice because I don’t think anyone has made a post like this yet. 

TLDR: my mom is feeding me too much, not leaving me alone, making me go from my house to her house and being waaayyy to overbearing  because of my mental health and hallucinations and I just want to be alone. Is it okay to be alone during this? Am I mad for no reason?

My mom is very overbearing and has been ever since I was small. I (20) live alone and she lives on in the middle of nowhere (farm) where there is nothing to do in a small house. I like my home and feel good living alone with my cats. but since two months ago, she doesn’t leave me alone. A doctor told her it’s best to not let me be alone.

Because of her work, she needs to be home.  She makes me go with her. I am very unhappy at her house and 60% of the week and time I am stuck in her house and the other 40% I’m allowed to be back home.

I have gained weight. have struggled with eating my entire life because of my parents eating patterns. Upset? Eat. Happy? Eat. I learnt to live a healthy lifestyle after living alone. I love working out and going for long walks but now, I am unable to do so because I can’t be alone. She doesn’t get how bad it makes me feel. 

I told my mom that I am upset the way she is making me eat and not allowing me to workout or go for walks. I told her it’s unhealthy how much weight I’ve gained in a short time and now I am very upset because I have absolutely no control over my life and it’s constant bad though and the voices are so awful I can’t stop them when I am like this. My mom said I’m not eating too much but I am. 

I just want to be alone again not because I want to do something unhinged but I am just too overwhelmed. I got taken off all my meds (adhd and birth control for hormones) and I just hate this I can’t take this experience anymore. 

The clinic that will help me will call me next week after a month of waiting to get in and two hospital visits later.

Recently I have tried to fight my depressive episodes by creating healthy habits for myself, such as waking up early at 6 ish for sixth form, or thinking positive affirmations and goals I want to achieve each day to get me in the correct mindset e.t.c

However, I can't keep it up anymore. My biggest weakness is that I get very easily demotivated if anyone or thing interferes with something which is within my control. It makes me feel like shite and makes me feel powerless, inferior, weak. And my way of dealing with these emotions is horrendous. I lash out and start destroying my surroundings, harming my body (whether it be punching my self or slamming my head repetitively on nearby surfaces.)In the end it really doesn't solve anything and I realise the only one im hurting is myself, since noone else clearly knows or wants to know how I feel and I therefore drown myself in this continuos loop of self-degradation and dismayal.

I don't want to continue anymore. I want to go to sleep and forget all about when I wake up or just don't wake up at all.

"I had an anxiety attack a few weeks ago that very nearly got me to the emergency room. it woke me up from my sleep. it's impossible to describe that feelings but it's so negative and so intense. you can tell yourself all you want that nothing is wrong and to calm down but you can not get it to go away. I felt the same thing years ago the last few times I smoked weed. It sent me into that dark spiral. Your thoughts race so fast and you feel intense grief, guilt, sadness, dread, agony. You feel insane because your thoughts are too fast to keep up with let alone control. I went to the ER but by the time I got to the parking lot it stopped on it's own, which was about 2 hours after it started. I went to a psychologist but it was like 2 weeks later before i could get an appointment. He didn't seem to think I was under any great amount of stress. I had nothing really bad to talk about other than this incident. My life was going pretty well. He told me I should have gone to the ER for a blood test because it sounded more like a physical thing to him than psychological. So I made an appointment at my GP which I just went to. He said it doesn't sound physical at all. It sounds completely psychological. He took my bloodwork anyway just as part of a regular physical. He said every single vital he took today could not have been healthier. My breathing, blood pressure, everything was exactly on the money. I'll wait for the lab results but he said there is not really a test that will find anything related to this. He told me that if I did go to the ER, there is nothing they could have done for me. They would have talked to me until it went away on it's own. I asked him if they would have given me benzodiazepines, and he said no, that's only for panic attacks which means chest pains.

"I'm turning 17 in 7 days. I've been dropped out of school for a year. I work at a fucking Hardee's with a manager who screams at me infront of customers and another male manager who makes me uncomfortable. I don't get to save my money because my family is poor I have to use it to buy groceries. If I quit my job we won't have money for food. I live in a trailer and my mom is homeless 700 miles away. The only person who really gave a shit about me just died. I have no friends or anyone to talk to, and even when I make a friend I have no motivation to commit to being friends with them. I can't get therapy. I just wish I wasn't born because this is getting too much for me. I can't kill myself because my family depends on me. I want to get my GED and maybe get a fine arts degree and transfer to university because I've always wanted to be an art teacher. Everyone told me that would be impossible so I just don't try anymore. I know I'm young and I ""have time to fix this"" but the pressure right now is TOO MUCH.",2,depression
"I'm still relatively new at this job and the manager has a passive agressive streak regarding the rules (it isn't uncommon for him or others to make comments if you're late for example), and, yesterday, he had a talk with me about how stonefaced I look 24/7. Part of that is just because I don't really like him, so of course I'm not gonna be that chipper, but come on! None of the customers ever complain about me, and once I start talking to them, they quickly realise that I'm not actually however upset I apparently come across. There isn't any actual issue, the manager is worried over the potential for something that the evidence shows isn't actually an issue.

So now I'm prepping for another shift today, and dreading having to mask the whole time.

The job is a shitty part time customer service job anyways, so I'm not that invested to begin with. I'm just scared that this'll be the kind of job I'm stuck with for the rest of my life. I've made no progress in my university's co-op program, and no other part time jobs have been interested in me.

"please be kind to me. I don't know if this is the right place to say this.

I'm neurodivergent but allistic. my mother is autistic. people talk a lot about allistic parents with autistic children. I rarely see anyone talk about what it's like to be allistic with an autistic parent. I'm not here to spread hate. I just want to share my experience.

growing up with my mother was very lonely. it often felt like she was in her own world. she never hugged me as a child. she often neglected me in favor of her special interests. when I cried, she would remain completely silent. once, I told her through tears that it felt like she didn't love me. she walked away without a word. 

when allistic parents have autistic children, they read books on autism. they talk to child psychologists. I couldn't do any of that. I was just a child. I didn't know what autism was. all I knew was that my mother acted differently from other moms. I'm not a kid anymore. I read about autism sometimes. I understand now that my mother didn't like me crying because it was a form of sensory overload to her. I understand now that she didn't like it when I interrupted her special interests because it wasn't just a hobby to her. I understand all of that now as a grown-up, but that matters little because child me didn't know any of that. I go to therapy once a week now.

I second-guess myself sometimes. maybe she did love me. maybe she still loves me, in her own way. whatever it is, I don't understand it. I don't know if I ever will. she doesn't like talking to me. she tells me to stop talking when it doesn't interest her. she turns away from me and engages in her special interest. I don't know if she knows it hurts me. it's hard communicating with her. she doesn't seem to have any interest in me. I see posts sometimes, by autistic people talking about how much they detest allistic people. I wonder if that's how my mother really feels about me. 

I don't know where I'm going with this. I'm not saying autistic people have to conform to allistic standards. I'm not saying autistic people shouldn't have children. I'm just sharing my personal experience. and if you have a child, please just tell them you love them.",1,autism
"I've been emotionally abused by my brothers in my childhood. I haven't realised of the traumas I've been through until recently. The stigma of having a normal happy family stopped me from looking at back. I have asked myself so many times how did I turn out to be this way? And the answer, the main reason, lies within my family. Infront of everyone I have a pretty much big family. And they all get along. Except for me and my brothers. We had our share of brotherly fights but at some point it went out of hand and detached me from them forever. We don't talk anymore.. We don't even smile. It's been like that more than 10 years. I'm 23 now. And I feel more alone and depressed when I'm home. Don't have that many friends. But I feel more comfortable when I'm with them. 

Years back when I first got diagnosed for my mental health issues I didn't know it was only gonna get worse. That I would be left hurt for the rest of my life. That I would be constantly thinking of death. At first my parents were the reason that held me back from it. the pain they would suffer. the trauma I would cause them. Nothing matters anymore. They are the main reason for me to turn out like this. And yeah, of course my mind isn't normal from early days there's that too. A couple of months more. I know a miracle like someone coming to your life to save you is not gonna happen. I had someone like that, very precious, and it turned out to be the second most haunting thing now. So I'm just waiting it out to all end. I beared myself these fucked up years what's a couple more months. It's going to be hellish like or worst than the past six months. But yeah I'm preparing myself for the end. I have tried to die two times. But it was more like a suicidal gestures, a cry for help. But there won't be another one of that. The third is going to be the last. And I learned it the hard way. NOT EVERYONE'S LIFE IS WORTH LIVING FOR.",2,depression

"Hey everyone. I've had depression since around 2010. I feel like I am at the bottom of the ocean drowning. I'm married and have 2 kids, but my wife also has Depression really bad. Every time I try to talk to her about my depression she turns it to how worse she has it. I used to be on meds for it, but the prescription ran out and I can't afford to lose an hour at work to go see the doctor for a refill. We also rent a house we really can't afford because it was the only option in this market. No matter what little steps I can manage to get out of this funk, it seems like life kicks me back down.

"Seeking sympathy more than advice at the moment...I have chronic allergies with runny/stuffy nose, sneezing, and sometimes a sore throat or itchy eyes or ears. On my doctor's advice I take a double dose of cetirizine daily as well as a dose of singulair, and the singulair has made a difference, but recently I still keep having days where my symptoms get bad and I have to take benadryl.

"For years I've had pretty bad periods of time filled with major depression, and severe anxiety has been a constant for as long as I can remember. This was my entire life and as such it was not as big a problem as it could have been, because it was just what I was used to. I still had desire and purpose to do things, I had friends who hanging out with was purpose enough for me. 

At the start of this year, I found a girl, and every cliche in every love story happened. We had (and still have) an incredible connection, I'm talking favourite shows, songs, interests, everything was the same, we were both incredibly emotionally intelligent and we would make each other laugh and were invested in each others lives, yada yada- you get the point. Everyone says it, I know, but I've had relationships before and I like to think of myself as emotionally intelligent enough to know that she was and probably will always be the ""one that got away."" 

Naturally that implies that yes, a few days ago, she broke things off with me. We talked in person for a few hours about it, both cried buckets into each others shoulders, and there wasn't a hint of maliciousness from either side. We both agreed it was better for the both of us in the long run. I wanted to be pissed at her, to have a reason to hate her, but it was no-one's fault she lost the spark.

She said that it was up to me, but that she does truly want to remain friends, because while the romantic feelings were no longer there, we still connected on an incredible level that she didn't want to lose, and that when/if I was ready, she would like to be friends again. (Again, huge cliche.)

After talking with her, and a lot of self reflection, I realised that I made the mistake of having her be such a major part of my life, and purpose. This whole year has been with her, and every day I was thinking of when I would see her next and waiting for a response, which would sometimes take more than a day. Nothing else was even half as important to me as her, and so obviously it absolutely killed me to not get a text more than once a day, to go hours without constantly talking to her. This was my fault, and even if I had realised it sooner, that wouldn't have affected her not feeling a spark. 

Now that we aren't together, and I know that I have to take time away from her to get over her, I am completely and utterly depressed. Everything that I have now after she's gone is simply useless to me.  I haven't stopped thinking about what I am supposed to do. My workplace, Uni work, even hanging out with friends, these all became things to pass the time until I got to see or talk to my girlfriend, whereas before they were way more than that. They were actually my life, and my interests. 

I don't have any desire for anything. I don't have something to look forward to, I have nothing to feel but regret and absolute grief for the way things were. The only time I have felt any sort of relief since then was bawling my eyes out to my mother on the phone. Getting wasted on alcohol, which usually would do the trick, does nothing. 

I can't help but feel like such a fucking loser now. I had the perfect girlfriend, I had a social life I was happy with, I had plans and desires for the future. Now I'm back to being a student with ADHD and OCD who's only friends are the three or four people from school, and the most we do is go to someone's house and play games until we go home. I am in pure agony and I have to make a constant effort to not think about how good things were. 

I have nothing to show as an 18 year old. I understand people have it worse than me. But to now have 3 guy friends that I barely hang out with, brother's who I barely talk to, no social skills or confidence, University work that I'm struggling with, and a mind-numbing workplace, I can't do anything but miss what I had. I think about how most Uni students have networks of friends, go out to bars and socialise, drink, party, have fun, and I just don't have that. 

My girlfriend breaking up with me is not why I am this disheartened. I was like this before, and I was like this during the relationship, but because I was happy when I was with her it wasn't as bad and so I paid no attention to it. I'm really struggling to know what to do with myself. I am at the point now where the only reason I haven't seriously considered or attempted to hurt myself (for lack of better wording) is because this girlfriend doesn't deserve that, and neither does my mother, or brothers. It's getting harder to not entertain the thought, because all I feel now is not numbness, but pointlessness, pain and sheer, utter grief. 

I know these feelings will pass. But while everyone tells me this, it's irrelevant to me in the current moment because it's happening right now, and I can't do anything but wait. 

I have medication for these feelings now, and I have organised professional help, but they all take time to work and I cannot just put these feelings on hold until they help. 

I don't even know if I want advice or if I am just ranting. But writing this has distracted me for a while so I may as well.",2,depression

"Hey, I love roller coasters and amusement parks but where I live has almost none. I've been to Orlando in 2012 (Disney, Universal, Sea World), so I don't need to repeat these parks. Now, I'm going to California for the first time, alone, and I got a basic planning, but I need your help.

- Tuesday (June 13)  - Arrive on LAX after 20h flight, sleep and visit west hollywood.

- Wednesday (14) - Six Flags

- Thursday (15) - Warner Bros Tour, Space Shuttle Endeavour, Griffin Observatory, Santa Monica.

...

- Tuesday (20) - Dinner in SF.

- Wednesday (21) - Figma config conference in SF

- Thursday (22) - Conference part 2

- Friday (23) - Night tour on Alcatraz

... (probably Golden Gate Bridge and a few museums in the bay area)

- Monday (26, 5am) - Return flight.

There are two ways I thought about filling the June 16-19 void: either going to San Diego and from San Diego getting a flight to San Francisco, or renting a car and going from Los Angeles to San Francisco driving. I'm a bit scared about driving, as I got my driver's license 3 months ago and I'll be fully alone (like, what if the car breaks), but I know the highways are a straight line, so I accept the risk.

I also thought about visiting National Parks (Yosemite or the one with Sequoias) but they seem very far from the road. People say that going to Santa Barbara, Monterey, Santa Cruz, Big Sur and slocal (San Louis Obispo) are worth it, and I'm like.. If I go through the coast, I can't see a national park. If I go through the coast, do I go the full path, or take the highway until the half and then the other half go through the coast?

Final thing: I'll have absolutely no equipment to hike, so if I go to a park, it needs to be straightforward to walk with a standard shoe.

TL;DR:
If you had 5 days in California to go from LAX to SFO, what would you do?

- Rent a car, stop in a national park, sleep in a small city, keep traveling? 

- Rent a car, go through the coast stopping in every city starting from Malibu and Santa Barbara?

- Visit knott's berry, great america, Gilroy, six flags SF (not sure worth it)

- Explore San Diego and get a plane.

- You name it.",0,negative_samples

It’s made me question how mature these therapists are to just outright come out with threats simply because they feel uncomfortable or challenged. It has made me question a lot about human beings.

"I’ll start off by saying I’m medicated and have been for several years. Any progress or limitations are directly related to this. My relationship with the voices has changed greatly since the beginning when I tried time and again to eliminate them with meds. That did not happen. 

When that was over I began ascending a long road toward acceptance and then curiosity. At first, I used meds and accepted that the voices were here and that I’m not compelled to do stupid shit anymore. The therapist said I was managing. Well, it felt like a crap job but if I was managing so be it. Then years flew by and I delved into a few insightful books like Schizophrenia Complex and this led me on a long journey inward where I skimmed the edges of some deep spiritual thinking. 

Now, it’s not as though the voices are to be banished. Instead, they are there to remind me I have an inner life to attend to. When I’m at therapy, and being still and silent for some amount of time each day, I become more functional and enjoy my hours more, especially with family/friends. In short, I have to respect what I am to become stable. In this life that is enough.

Last thing, I believe it’s important for me not to be perfect all the time. When I attempt that it all goes to shit and life just laughs at me saying, “stop! That’s not really you!” As a result, I’ve got some quirks to me, but it’s better than being involuntarily held once a year. Instead that’s happened 2x in 20 years.

"Hey guys,

my anxiety hit me again after having a somewhat calm phase.

Now I'm dealing with feelings of intense breathlessness and the fear of passing out or suffering damage from low oxygen levels.

During those moments I check my oxygen levels and they fluctuate quite a lot, jumping back and forth between 95 and 98%. Sometimes even dipping even lower than 95% for a few moments.

When I'm somewhat calm my oxygen levels are kinda steady around 98%, only sometimes dipping to 97, 96ish and quickly getting back up again.

Not quite 2 years ago I had an X-ray done, when having similar symptoms, with the report showing no acute pathological findings. 

Went to the pulmonologist who told me my lungs look fine.

And here I am still breaking my had over those oximeter readings, thinking there might be something serious going on, and maybe low oxygen is triggering my anxiety.

Anyone else notice oximeter readings going 'bad' when you are anxious? 

Thanks in advance guys",4,anxiety

"There are days where I am more motivated than ever to better myself. To find myself. To explore my thoughts and see where it may lead. 

Honestly, it helps me study better when I feel this drive of hope that I will be okay. I am almost a second year med student. 

After every exam the cycle ends. I crash. I lose myself. I dwell on how much I miss ex. I think about how heartbroken I still am. Im miserable. 

Its a mental game. I battle this everyday to not let my depression cause me to flunk out. I am convinced that I am so unhappy because I still want my ex back. Its been almost 6 months since we broke up. 

Studying majority of the day and taking multiple exams a week truly keeps one from trying to improve themselves. I tried new hobbies and socializing more. Its not working.

But it takes my mind off the self loathing, only to amplify it the next day.  (I’m not on needles, lol. It kind of sounds like it though).  

I’ve tried for 3 weeks to create more routine and implement habits that help me grow. I’m really trying, but I’m so fucking tired.

I know that I should fight it,
But instead I embrace the pain,
Knowing one day I'll find the strength,
To face the world again.

Suddenly there is no more silence, 
As torturous screams fill the air,
I constantly look over my shoulder,
But darkness is all that is there.
My demons are coming for me,
Please dont let them take me away,
I promise that i will do better,
I'll try harder and harder each day.

I know I cant do this alone,
Please bring some light to guide me,

I'm searching for a purpose before,

"Writing this out, it turned into a LONG story, but TL;DR is that I thought I had type 2, then things went crazy (covid-caused?), but now with Mounjaro I’m super well-controlled.  And I’m  seeing a real endocrinologist!

For about five or six years now, I’ve had type 2 diabetes (I was told), and taking Metformin daily.  With the metformin, my A1C was stable at about 6.6-6.7 every year (I didn’t go for testing every three months, just annually).  Seemed well-controlled.  My diet was always reasonable, but not nearly enough exercise, and I’ve been overweight the whole time (obese by BMI, which I don’t trust much—5’7” tall, weighing 210-220 pounds.  I’m a 60-year-old male).

My GP, at each physical, would tell me that I should lose weight and get more exercise, but that my A1C, for a diabetic on metformin, was reasonable and not a problem.  

Then in late January, I got covid (for the second time) and got better in about 5 days.  Not very sick at all (fully vaccinated).  At the same time, I was suddenly fired from my job after 13 years, without cause.  So that was a time of stress, but after the first few weeks, I figured I was actually able to retire, so I started eating even better, and walking 4-5 miles, 4-5 days a week. 

I was feeling better, healthier, more relaxed, than I had in years.  I went for my annual physical in early April, expecting everything to be the same or better than it had been for the past years.  

But a couple of weeks later, my GP called me with a very angry tone. My test results had come in, and my glucose was 310, with A1C of 11.2.  He was very blame-y and curt, assuming (it seemed) that I was binging on sugary sodas and not exercising at all (neither was true).  He said this was “life-threatening” and that he was doubling my metformin dosage and putting me on Januvia, and told me to come back in “three months.  No, two months.”

I was really upset and worried and mystified.  Especially I was wondering why he wasn’t even curious about how my diabetes went so far out of control, so suddenly.  And why, if things were so serious, he was willing to let it go for two months without any further monitoring.

So I decided to make an appointment with an actual endocrinologist who actually specialized in diabetes.  I got a recommendation for a very good one (unfortunately, she doesn’t take any insurance, but I’m lucky enough that I have the resources to pay cash).

She made a huge difference!  First of all she told me that no matter what, even in the best case, the double dose of metformin and the Januvia would take my A1c down to maybe 9.5 or 10. An improvement, but not a big enough one.

She took a lot of blood, put me on a GCM, and started me on Mounjaro right away.  (Took me off the Januvia but kept the metformin going)

The test results came back, showing that the glucose and A1C really were that high, but she also actually tested for the c-peptides and antibodies (something my GP seemed to not even know about).  The lab screwed up the antibodies, but from the c-peptides, she could see that my pancreas was making only a trace amount of insulin.  Not 0, but nowhere near what it should be, and nowhere near what would be expected if I had had type 2.  She said what I had was most likely LADA, although we will test again for the antibodies when I next come in. 

Meanwhile, after a week on the Mounjaro, from the CGM, my glucose was staying in range about 80% of the time.  She put me on a little bit of insulin every other day, just in case.  Although I really haven’t had any lows.

Now it’s been four weeks on the mounjaro, and my glucose is right around 100.  I even drank a bottle of root beer this week (to test, more than anything else) and had only a tiny spike, not even out of the green zone on the CGM app.  

Mounjaro is controlling this so very well, that I I’m curious (and will ask the dr) if it’s really type 2 after all, or just that my pancreas is producing a bit of insulin, still, so the mounjaro is helping that work better. 

I also am thinking the whole thing might have come from covid. The endocrinologist says that’s possible. She’s read that it happens, but long-term studies aren’t available yet.

The mounjaro gave me some stomach problems starting just at the end of the second week of taking it.  Not serious (I did vomit once) but some unpleasant nausea and stomach pain for about 5-7 days.  Then it went away.  The endocrinologist said that was normal, and that it would probably come again, for a shorter time and milder each time, until it stopped being a problem.  But I expected the side effects to start within a few days of the first injection, not 5 days after the second one.  

I’m definitely feeling the difference in my appetite and fullness—eating less, feeling full with smaller portions, and I have lost about 10-15 pounds so far.  That’s also to be expected, I’m told.

The doctor says she might take me off the insulin, when she does another round of tests.  My real conclusion here is that I think the mounjaro has been a great success for me!  

Long-term, though, I don’t know whether to expect this to stay a good solution, or will my pancreas get better, or will it just stop completely and I’ll be in a different state in terms of insulin.  

But at least now I have a doctor who seems to really know what she’s doing, who actually talks to me and answers questions (instead of blaming and yelling at me).  She even answers the phone when I call, returns emails in less than an hour, and looks at my numbers from the GCM even when I’m not having a visit.",0,negative_samples

"My Kitty (named Kitty, by my grandfather) is the only pet I’ve ever had. She is very very old for a cat (20yrs +) and will die eventually, and probably soon. 

She is the last thing I have left of my two grandparents who have passed. She has lived in so many houses, met so many loving people, and been taken care of to the absolute complete extent of my ability. I love her so much, she has been my true and only best friend my entire life, and I recently came to realize that in times of abuse and fear where I was helpless (and even times of happiness but where I had no one to share it with), she was there. She could have even been in the room when some things happened to me. This has helped me cope with those traumas, and helped me feel strong. 

She will die someday and soon. I don’t know how. But I analyze her every behavior, I check if she is breathing every single time I see her across the room. It keeps me awake at night looking for her again and again to check, it makes my heart race when I’m not home with her. I have a stomachache 12 hours a day wondering about it. This has gone on for years. 

It’s all consuming, stressful, to a terrible point where I fear I’ll be relieved when she does pass, and that is somehow worse. How can I accept the possibility and truth that she will pass, and how can I know I will be able to handle it right when she does? I haven’t lost a pet in 19 years.

"I’m not sure if anyone else has had this issue, but I’ve found it incredibly frustrating trying to make reservations or bookings for sites in Italy. I’ve been to 9 countries in Europe and never had as many problems as I’m having now. 

Every single attractions requires you to click like 8 different links, select from 20 different options, then takes you to a different site to pay, then requires you to create and confirm an account, then verify your card, and on and on. Obviously I’m exaggerating, but for the love of god just let me click “buy tickets” and then have a single ticket that gets me into the site that I can pay for right then and there without making any accounts. I’ve also found the ticket descriptions to be fairly vague a lot, meaning I’m not even sure which option to pick half the time. 

Beyond that, everything is always booked way in advance.

I can't bear to shower, and only do it every 6-8 weeks (occasionally it might be 4 weeks). I wash my hair that often too.

I cannot deal with doing chores or housework. I last did a load of laundry in June 2021. Seriously.
I don't go out anywhere much and I have way too many clothes so I still have clean clothes to wear when I go out.

Around the house, I wear the same comfy clothes for months on end. I just don't care.

I only change my bed sheets every 6 months. I cannot believe people do this every week. I cannot cope with that.

I never eat in the day as I've had no appetite since 2017. I never feel hungry. I never feel empty. My stomach never rumbles or gurgles. I feel like it doesn't even exist.

I sleep all day and feel RIDICULOUSLY stressed and nauseated with anxiety if I have to get up before 1pm.

I stay up until about 4am as after 11pm is the only time I get to be alone and have quiet time to sort of relax.

I have major anhedonia and feel no pleasure, enjoyment or interest in anything I'm NOT addicted to. I sleep to avoid the chronic boredom and emptiness. And constant sense of dread and impending doom.

I brush my teeth, but I haven't gone to the dentist since 2016 and partly due to gum disease and also jaw clenching in my sleep, 4 of my teeth are loose. I can't eat properly when I do eat, but I just can't care enough (or afford) to go to the dentist to get these teeth either removed or somehow fixed.

I have not done any housework since 2018. I have a cleaner who comes every 2 weeks.

I pick at my skin. The skin around my fingernails has been wrecked since I was 4 or 5 years old. I've picked at my scalp since age 8, my top lip is ruined and I began picking that since age 15. I also began picking at both my inner ears at age 38.

I started self harming at 17 and still do it. I hate myself. I feel ugly and I repulse myself.

I never had any career ambitions or anything I wanted to do. Nothing has ever given me a sense of achievement, accomplishment, pride, fulfilment or satisfaction. At all. Ever. I don't even know what that feels like.

I have no friends apart from old friends who live in a different state and I haven't seen in over 3 years. I have no local friends, and nor do I particularly want to. I don't have the interest or energy.

A few times a week I wonder how I would kill myself. I can't do it because I won't do that to my parents, but otherwise, I honestly don't know.

I have been like this consistently for years. Some symptoms have been 4-6 years. Others 40 years. Most about 10 years.

I've been on 8 different antidepressants over the last 10 years, a mood stabiliser, an antipsychotic, a stimulant, and various benzos. Nothing has helped, except for the benzos.

I've been in therapy on and off since 2018. Nothing helps. Not CBT, DBT, EMDR or psychodynamic therapy. Just...nothing.

Stage 2/3 Osteosarcoma, unk if metastatic.

1. My doc is hesitant to give a stage, is that normal? Does it come later? 

2. My treatment is 6 cycles of AP + Methotrexate which per the doctor is the “standard approach to osteosarcoma” . If I look at each drug, that will be “18” individual treatments. I’ve had surgery to remove and now we’re going with a “curative” approach. I see other osteosarcoma patients describe their treatment and there are comments that they have had 20+ treatments. I see that and think “I’m not getting the best advice” . “I should be seeking a second opinion” . 

3. I am feeling somewhat skeptical every time the doctor says we’re taking a “curative” treatment path, like I’m being set up for unrealistic expectations. Interested to hear thoughts on that. 

4. When I ask about tumor/cancer resistance the doc tells me are no tests/indicators for osteosarcoma but I found an osteosarcoma clinic that says some genetic markers do matter. 

My husband wants to take the approach of trusting the doctor (we’re at Duke) and team and to focus on the path forward. I am feeling a little salty because I think the diagnosis is delayed but also a general fear that this is the biggest decision in my life - if we get it wrong - if the doctor gets it wrong - it’s irreversible.

"Hi!

I need your help. And maybe my help helps you?

I was talking to someone about his schrizofrenia and his past and we talked about needs, Maslows piramid of needs.

The base layer is physiological needs. We needs nutricious food, enough water, rest and excercise to have a healthy body. The layer above this layer are safety needs. These two layers are the basic needs of a human.

If you don't feel safe you get fear/ paranoia.

My thoughts are as followed; Trauma can cause two problems:

- Not able to fill in the needs to feel safe and secure.
- Not able to guard boundaries so you don't feel safe and secure.

If my partner is able to define her needs, she can fill them; and if she is able to define which boundaries are crossed, she can learn and develop strategies and skills to fill her needs and guard her boundaries.

Basically when we are young our caretakers teach us how to do so, but if they are the ones who took away the needs or crossed the boundaries... how could you have learned these strategies and skills from them?

My question for you is:

Can you verify my thought process? 

If you reflect on yourself, how are your skills in filling you needs for savety and security and how are your skills in guarding your boundaries so you can feel safe an secure?

If is all about a lack in strategy and skills, I'll be able to ask for specific help for my partner so she can learn and develop herself and hopefully be rid of paranoia.

"Hi guys! I am in Canada right now and my mom who's in Delhi just got diagnosed with lymphatic cancer and has to undergo chemotherapy. I am in a fix as I want her to get the best treatment and care possible wherever it is, I am dicey between having her chemo done in Delhi or in Canada depending on the better cancer specialists and reliable doctors. The pros that I see in Canada are that I find the hospital corruption to be low and doctor's reliability to be high as the value of life is more over here + I find the doctors over here to be a bit more accessible in the sense that they will be in constant touch with you and your family if they have taken your case and the MAJOR con is that the waitlist lines are really long and NOTHING can be done over here through referrals or contacts. The pros that I see in Delhi are if we get it done in AIIMS, I have heard and read that it is the best in India and is not as corrupted like other private hospitals. Along with that, a lot can be done in delhi through referrals and contacts + there is no such thing called a waitlist if you know a senior doctor anywhere in delhi.

Apart from the location, I want to know if the hospitals in Canada would take my mom's case as soon as she comes here and not make her wait for months which won't be of any use to her in which case I will go there and start her chemotherapy over there only.

Right now I don't know what to do with my life and I'm scared to figure it out (not that I know why). And I feel pressured to know what I'm doing but I don't. I get that most adults feel like this (I'm 21) but I feel like whatever I'm doing now just isn't good enough. But sometimes when I'm like ""I need to do something like move to a new state or just get out of my hometown"" I don't know where to start or if I can even make that happen. I've also been in and out of college but i dropped out because it was expensive and because I also have a full time job. So now i don't know how to get started with figuring out what I want to do or even how to get to where I want to be.

A lot of times it feels like my dreams I once had just get crushed under the weight of everything. Ive wanted to be so many things and one by one they all get crushed. I feel like I'm not good at a lot of things and that's part of the reason why I've had so many failures. I also get anxious about how life keeps marching on and I don't think I'm ready for many of the parts of life like losing my parents. I know no one is ""ready"" for that kind of thing but I've never been exposed to death (grandparents died before I was born, no close family) so I don't know what I'll do. 

I also get so scared because I'm in a relationship but I don't love him and he's not great and clearly doesn't love me but he's insisting on me living with him and marrying him but I don't want to. I don't know how to break up with him and I don't really want to lose him but I don't want to be with him either. And it scares me that I can end up having to spend the rest of my life with him. Or that things can go as far as marriage when I don't want that. He always tries to make his dreams into mine, and he never cares about what I want to do. I know he just wants a girlfriend, it doesn't matter who. He just wants someone pretty, he doesn't see me as a multifaceted human being. Whenever I try to tell him what I want he says stuff like ""I think I know what you want"". When he says stuff like that, I realize he knows nothing about me and he doesn't care to. I've never broken up with someone so I'm scared to do it. I also only have one friend and I'm really bad at making friends.",4,anxiety

"I’m agoraphobic but am healing! I have an event for a close friend I'm supposed to attend tomorrow, all day I haven't been ""feeling good"" about it, but the thing is I'm not necessarily anxious but I don't feel up for it or feel like going. I have another one next weekend to attend, which I will be at for sure but tomorrows is not obligatory. I do however don't want to miss out but can't help but feel my gut is telling me not to go. The best way for me to explain is a low vibrational feeling in my stomach, the feeling however when focused on long enough is triggering thoughts of what could go wrong but even after practicing mindfulness and telling myself I’ll be okay this gut feeling is still lingering and has been all day.

"So for a while now, whenever it's bedtime and I lay down to sleep, my mind kinda starts to panic and basically develops a mind of its own.

It stops happening if I start doing something like I'm writing this post now but eventually you have to stop doing anything to fall asleep.

At this point, I just know that as soon as I'm gonna hit the bed, this is going to be waiting for me. The mental torture I have to go through is something that I can't even begin to describe. Not just due to this thinking, but also because I'm so tired physically and I just have to go through this till my body gives up, which can be a few hours and sometimes takes till the morning.

So I just hate/fear the night now and I just don't wanna lay down and stop doing anything, till my body allows me to, but I still try as I have this slight hope that I might be able to avoid it today if I dont think about it. 

Honestly, I don't know. Idk whether I cause it myself by thinking that it's gonna happen or this is just how it is now?

"I'm afraid to close my eyes. Does anyone else have this?. I think it's because of anxiety, which makes sense. I can't sleep and I'm afraid to close my eyes. I close them and start panicking immediately, so I have to open them again. As you can imagine, trying to sleep isnt easy. 
I also have small fears of being alone and fear of dark. Even when washing my face in the shower, I close my eyes to splash my face then quickly reach for a towel while still standing in the shower, just to wipe my eyes and be able to open them again. 

I think this fear is sort of paranoia on my behalf because I dread the dark, closing eyes, sitting in middle of a room, having back to a door or window, just because I can't see if something/someone approaches me.

"When you watch a movie or TV show you can automatically put it into a ballpark of when it was made by seeing the lighting, set Design and effects. The only thing like that capable of dating a book by sight is its cover Design and they will get updated to look new with new additions.

Sometimes grab books from the library and notice peculiarities that make me question things. Why does this book about counterinsurgency mention do much about the Greeks but never anything about Afghanistan, and why is he constantly mentioning the French in Vietnam and not the Americans. Look to the copyright date to discover it was written in 1964.

Similar things happened when I was reading a book about the CIA and the author mentioned how he remembered the boar war that happened in 1905. I didnt find out the Dave Grossmans on killing was written in the 90s till 3 years after I read it.

"It feels like when someone mentions I have autism, my performance at school and my understanding of things seems to decrease. Last month my brother was getting pissy at me and I argued with him and overall it didn’t well,He said I was basically like a disabled person because I’m Autistic for not handling my anger when he provokes me all the time and how I wouldn’t be able to handle a job and how he has no faith in me so I stopped talking to him and ever since he said that it feels like my performance at school has suffered as well as my understanding in subjects such as math and stuff. I hate the fact that people classify autism as a disability because I feel that it impacts my progress and not to mention, I am fully able to move around like a normal person and I don’t have frequent trouble understanding basic subjects. I also overthink most of my situation and it feels like before I could handle the big work and understand the lessons that most of the class didn’t even despite being told I have autism. I hate how I’ve been Shielded from the real world just because I have autism, not to mention I’m the youngest in my family so I would’ve been sheltered enough already in my life, I hate how they weren’t as strict with me as with my older brothers because it now means I’m weaker mentally than my older brothers. I’m thinking that if they didn’t treat me any different, maybe I would’ve beaten this thing, but no it’s still present in my life and I just want to be treated like everyone else and not pitied by anyone. I hate how fucking nervous I am when talking to people, I hate how my mom told me I wasn’t like the other kids when I joined wrestling, I hate how if I did something bad my dad said he would send me to therapy as if that were to fix everything and I hate how my oldest brother annoys me the most by peeping on me through the door, trying to kiss my left cheek and randomly opening my door and trying to deny it, getting pissed and telling me that I’m disabled because I can’t handle my anger, it’s not my fault I don’t want to be someone’s bitch. I hate how I’m told that within the time I get a drivers license, I’m gonna get that blue disabled thing that I’m gonna put on my car to let the rest I’m “disabled” when I’m not.

"I will try and keep this short. I have been fighting depression for my life and seeing psychiatrists and doctors for around 12 years. I am 35. With my current therapist, over the last 9 months or so he has basically stopped trying to help and simply listens and says he will help me look for a better resource. But every resource referred to me just doesn't take new patients, doesn't take my insurance, doesn't provide the care requested, etc. So I left a voicemail on a potential new therapist machine where I expressed that I was struggling and I was crying quite a bit. Instead of helping, they called a neighboring parish Sherriff dept. who called me and tried to figure out my location so they could pick me up. I made it home and was able to convince her that I am under the care of a psychiatrist and therapist and was simply upset, and never expressed I wanted to harm myself or others. She agreed, finally, that I was safe and we ended the call, and told me that she would not send anyone. But, the cops showed up anyway.

Since then I just haven't been able to trust anyone at all. My therapist has been saying for months I need to do some kind of inpatient program but I cannot defeat the paranoia that I will be drugged into submission and have something horrible happen to me. I am terrified I will lose my job and I have no savings or family or friends as a safety net. I would be homeless. Louisiana, where I live, is very poor and our healthcare is from another era.

I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I can trust any advice or help from the medical field and the more I express this, the worse they treat me, and it keeps becoming a self fulfilling prophecy. I can't call and ask for another therapist. My current therapist does not help. I am terrified that if I ever voluntarily went to inpatient I would never be released or I would be tortured into submission. There's nothing anyone can say to me that will change my mind, and I know that is wrong, but I also know it is true.

How do you ask for help when you don't trust the help? What can I do to convince myself that inpatient facilities are not simply mental jails to ease state suicide statistics? I read so many horror stories online, and I hear so few good ones. And the good ones don't seem to explain very much about what happened there, it's the bad ones that go into detail. I would rather die than go on antipsychotic medication again, because to me the feeling they bring is the worst thing I've ever experienced. It's like truly being undead. I know that isn't the case for everyone, but for me, I just feel like a small eye in my skull peeping into the world, but the rest of my body is something else, controlled by something else, I'm just watching, I no longer exist. And if that's the case, I might as well be dead. Here are all the diagnoses I have been given, but I am not really sure which ones are real:

Major depressive disorder

Double depression

General anxiety disorder

Adjustment disorder

Borderline personality disorder

Avoidant personality disorder

ADHD

ASD

and for a bonus cherry on top, my girlfriend (who does not know of my illness) keeps making sz jokes. I think I hear something, I get “lol maybe you’re schizo”. She was having sensory issues and said “it feels like there’s bugs in my skin. Does that mean I’m going crazy?” (No.) why is this the second romantic partner in a row that tries to glamorize psychosis?? (my last one was obsessed with the idea of voices “I’m gonna listen to the voices in my head and go crazy”)

"I made a post yesterday asking how to know when you need to seek professional help. Today, I happened to end up in the situation perfect for me to seek the school counselor. Such a coincidence right? And I guess I must've been insane because I decided to. And lol that essentially felt like public humiliation and I'm  never seeking help ever again.

First of all, they informed me that discussing anything related to self-harm or suicide obliged them to inform parents and the relevant authorities. Although, I guess I expected it. But that just means that the only legitimate reason I had for seeking help couldn't be a reason anymore. 

Still, I decided to talk about friendship-related stuff instead. I even teared up a few times (which made it worse because why did I break so easily and why did the person's words even mean anything when I knew they thought I was a joke). They were judging me the entire time I was there, as if I was an immature teenager who was overly concerned with friends and obviously lacking life experience because life isn't all about friends. Fair enough, I am. But I wasn't expecting it. I used the term 'emotionally unavailable' at some point, which may have been slightly off because I just wanted to describe being too emotionally overwhelmed for anything, but then the counsellor basically clowned me for the rest of the session with that term lmao. They kept laughing whenever they said it 'to put it in my words', along with things.

Not that I want to discourage anyone else from seeking help. Please do. This is just my personal experience. Perhaps I expected too much of a school counselor. Perhaps I didn't even need to seek help in the first place. Either way, I'm never doing it again. I tried taking a step towards getting better and now I'm two steps back. Dying does seem like a better alternative doesn't it lol",2,depression

Probably about 3 hours into the night, I met a friend of a friend of a friend and they seemed lovely. Let's call them K. We really bonded over recently being diagnosed with ADHD. That's what I thought at the time anyway. 

A lot of the night from there was just K and I talking about ADHD. How the process was for us, how like changing a diagnosis can be, hyperfixations, the lot really. It was really, really nice. The friend I was planning to catch up with that night has lost their phone while changing venues, so it ended up being just K and I for a good chunk of the night. 

At about 11pm I decided to give K some space as they wanted to talk to someone else there. I don't like being the awkward person just standing there. Over the next 10 minutes or so, K walked passed me probably 2 or 3 times, first to get drinks and then too leave with the above person. Each time I tried to flag them down, particularly when I saw them leave, but was ignored. 

Thankfully the friend that lost their phone showed back up just after that and we had a chill rest of the night. I still can't help but wonder what I did wrong, it feels like the only thing in my head and has brought me down so much I wanna curl up and just cry.

I went out the other week and drank far too much. I blacked out and can’t remember much. All I can really remember is falling off a bench oops. I’ve asked people what I was like to try and to seek reassurance but they have said I was just very drunk. I seem to recall also having some cross words with someone who often has made unnecessary comments to me in the past which I’ve let slide… I feel the drink may have aided my confidence to stand up to them. But I cannot remember how the conversation went down and it was infront of people who I do not know. My sister said she was concerned for how drunk I was but more of a how am I going to get this bitch home rather than me acting out of line. Other people have also said you were fine just drunk.

I’m pretty quiet, I stay in my own lane, but every now and then I might need to ask someone for help with something or talk to someone at a store or restaurant and I feel like all my social interactions tend to be unsettling in the sense that I get kind of laughed at, eye rolled, the person uses their body language to show rejection or to to look uninterested, wrong tone, etc.

"My parents divorced when I was less than a year old because he was a bipolar alcoholic who was very scary when he was in his angry phases, so I was a weekend custody kid. He was actually pretty alright around me, buying me toys, taking me places, but when he moved into his new girlfriend's home, he showed some of those angry phases. I stayed every other weekend and it was very stressful sometimes, but good at least 3/4 of the time. In those stressful situations he would shout and get mad, occasionally I could hear some stuff get knocked around, but sometimes he would end up pushing and grabbing my stepsister, who was a few years younger, and I occasionally had to stop it from escalating. It was overall stressful for me. One night I had to call the cops on him when he was drunk. It was a harsh environment sometimes, but not the worst, no torture, no belts, and frequent legit happiness.

I was always spared

After that I didn't see him for a while. He died 2021, and I never got any resolution to any of it. I learned recently that his family was abusive, even covering up how my uncle raped my dad. Last semester I had to read a book in class that dealt with abuse, and it retriggered all of my post traumatic feelings. 

Now, as I look around the world, it barely feels worth living for. Abuse, torture, rape, it's just fucking everywhere. Even before I became depressed I was hyper sensitive to people suffering, and now it's so bad I don't think I'll ever read a book, or hell, consume any non-musical media again. It's all just so terrible, but if I express this, I'm just a fucking emo teenager whining about shit. I know there is more to life than this, but it doesn't change the fact that it exists. I have no motivation or hope anymore, and I barely feel like I matter. My life isn't bad enough anymore to matter.",2,depression

"The sad truth is I have to end my relationship with the man I've been with for nearly 3 years. We met online so that meant we had distance between us and despite it we spoke most days and messaged a lot. He seemed pretty normal from the conversations although he did seem reserved, but I put that down to getting to know you or he'd make small remarks that you could brush off as quirks. Fastfoward to now and he is more paranoid than ever, it is frightening and exhausting. Everywhere we have been people are out to get him, he accuses me of knowing them to put stuff in his food, in cities I have never even been to before. He makes all the food, he doesn't trust me to cook and then yells I am a baby for not cooking. His mind has descended into more irrational scenarios and it is taking a toll on his overall health. He has asthma and smokes which of course causes reactions like he coughs more, he feels like he can't breath right, his voice goes hoarse and all I get it is me doing it to him. No, it is an asthma attack and this could be dangerous for him. He thinks cigarettes are made ""worse"" these days or a pack must be chosen especially to make him feel worse. He coughs and coughs, complains of lumps in his throat and it is my doing. I get yelled at for being ""sneaky"" and I am laughing at him and plotting. He sees bad in almost everyone and that businesses are flushing money through them to hide criminal activities. He has had over 30 jobs in his life because people were ""attacking him"" or out to get him etc. He is religious and so people are putting spells on him or demons are targeting him which is frightening to hear a person be absolutely convinced. I have anxiety and lockdowns made it worse and I was in a bad place and he helped me so much and I have become too reliant on him. The paranoia seems to have become more intense and the accusations, from me being ""paid by someone"" to have targeted him or he has ranted about a jewel and people I have never heard of. I get verbal abuse and told I am useless and worthless. The end of the road has come. He is never going to get help and he hates doctors. He had his eye test months ago and was told he has cataracts and needs an operation. His parents had them, but he has refused to get it done and says his eyes are getting worse. He thinks he can fix them and ordered stuff, but the only cure is an operation. I can't be with him as his paranoia colours everything in his life and his health is going downhill. His parents are gone and he had a tough upbringing, his dad was cold and distant, his mother was loving to him, but he isn't close to his siblings. All he sees is bad in almost everyone and everything and most is aimed at me and I am made out to be the most devious, horrible, sneaky person ever. I am not and you can't reason with him. Paranoia has now coloured every aspect of this life together and I don't want to be part of it. My anxiety is going up being with him and he mocks it and calls me mental. He has severe mental health issues, his physical health is getting worse and he once was actually talking to his doctor, but now he mistrusts them more. I have to end this relationship for my own sanity too. I love him, he has been kind and supportive, but getting through to him is almost impossible now and false accusations are thrown back in my face.",5,paranoia
"I know this is common with paranoia, but I always have a feeling someone is watching me. It triggers mostly at home, but definitely interferes with my social life. I run up the stairs thinking something or someone is chasing me,  it's very tiring. When at home, I just feel like something is out to get me, some creature that lurks in the dark. They only strike when I'm alone, but I can feel it's eyes on me when with others. In public, it's more of the people around me. I convince myself they're staring, somehow interested in me in some way or picking away every flaw I have in their head. It makes me feel uneasy, sweaty palms and everything.

I see posts on TikTok about these and  usually they’re pretty funny and relatable but at the same time, i feel like it tends to put a pretty bow on something not pretty in the slightest. This shit is destroying me every second of my life. It’s so isolating, i feel like an alien disguised as a human trying to play a role i know nothing about. 
Everything is difficult all the time, does not matter how hard i try. Im so tired constantly, everything leads me to burn out. I don’t know how to properly communicate with others, nothing i say ever seems to make sense to others. Everyone always thinks im lazy, insensitive and overall don’t care. I seem like such an obnoxious shit person, im so goddamn annoying. I have no idea what actual true success feels like, just “thats good enough i guess”.

"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2,depression
"Has anyone ever heard of or experienced this? About 8 months ago (while I was 3 month pregnant) I got a flu like virus and the “congestion” never went away. It was severe congestion couldn’t breathe through my nose at all! My OB finally sent me to the ENT in January after months of complaining. He scoped my nose and saw very large adenoids. Gave me predisone and said he thought they would go down within a few weeks of delivery. Well 4 weeks after delivery there was no improvement so we decided on adenoidectomy. My surgery was 5/12/23 and he also did an endoscopy to check for other issues. After surgery he stated that everything went great and he was sending tissue for pathology even though he was concerned. Well to everyone’s surprise path came back HPV positive (p16) squamous cell carcinoma. ENT has referred me to the oncologist, my first appt is next Thursday but I am the type of person who has to have as much info as possible so I’ve been googling like crazy and cannot find anything about this type of cancer in the adenoids.

"21M I am in college but I’ve been staying at my parents house (which is in the same place as my college). I usually am living at an apartment but my roommates have been really awful so I moved back home.

I’ve been home for about a month and I’ll admit that I’ve regressed while at home. I’ve stopped working out, I barely get homework done, and I sleep too much.

Today I slept until 10:00 AM and my mom burst into my room screaming at me and called me a “suck” which is what she says in place of “waste”.  She said that she can’t have me sleep in and that I need to work out and all I care about is sleep and food.

She works out daily and has completely turned me away from wanting to work out when I was younger. I don’t mind cardio and when I was running briefly a month ago, I was really excited. I even lost some weight.

She however said that I have to do weights and that running isn’t enough. I gave up on running because I have chronic headaches and neck pain. The only escape I get from the world is sleep.

I went to bed at 10:30 last night and got up at 10:00 today. I know it’s a long time but it was good. I had a dream that I got back together with my ex who broke up with me because she lost interest.

I really cared for her and she made me feel at home. I miss her so much and my mom woke me from the dream and immediately began to call me a waste.

I can’t move back to the apartment because two of my three other roommates are super toxic and stay up until 3AM every night. They hate me.

Home is the best choice for me but my mom who honestly is toxic on her own (I love her but she constantly criticizes me for anything I do) is making home also miserable for me.

I’m stuck in between a rock and a hard place",2,depression

"I had an anxiety attack about whether I have derealization or not a few weeks ago maybe 5 weeks ago. And it was basically me over thinking and worrying that i can’t tell the difference and I have psychosis/Schrizophenia. After that I was anxious for a couple of days/on fight or flight. After that I frequently started having intrusive thoughts about stupid things like forgetting my memory or existential thoughts. Also fears on having mental illnesses this went on 24/7. Sometimes I could eat sometimes I can’t. But the negative thoughts replayed in my head all day. But life felt weird after the anxiety attack like I was in a different dimension and the vibes of the days changed. I’m also getting random memory pop-ups, and random vibes or sensations. (I have a post about the sensations) like my environment feels weird or has an unfamiliar sensation. And it feels like it isn’t my life. I don’t know if it’s depersonalization or derealization because sometimes I get it and it feels worst. I feel like something bad is going to happen or  I’m going to die. And sometimes I can’t remember things or write things well or write sentences well. The worry and weird feeling has been going on for 5 weeks. Honestly sometimes it goes away or gets better but comes back worst. I’ve already talked to a therapist and she says it’s just anxiety, but it hasn’t gotten better. I honestly feel like giving up at this point because life feels so weird like I’m floating or stuck in a box. It doesn’t even feel like life.

"I decided to take a chance and go to a small local convention in my area today with a friend and some of her friends that I hadn't met today.

It was really crowded and hot. I was following my group around for the most part so I didn't have much time to stop and process everything around me.

I still made one purchase today and that was buying a poster. The person who helped me was really nice and asked me about my outfit. I wasn't really dressed up as anyone, but I was wearing a cloak and they told me that it was their favorite outfit they'd seen all day and that they hoped to see me again on the other days of the convention. It was so nice.

I don't think I'll be going back any of the other days, but I really wonder if they meant what they said or if they were just saying that to be customer service-y.

I wish I knew because what they said really meant a lot to me and I wasn't able to express that in the moment on account of how overwhelmed I was and I didn't feel that it was appropriate to ask for a way to reach out to them after the convention given the circumstances (me being a customer and them working at the convention). The last think I'd want to do is make them uncomfortable.

I want to believe that they would've wanted to see me again, but there's this part of me that's telling me I should know better. There's so many reasons as to why they could've said those things.

They were just so nice. I wish I wouldn't get so attached to people who offer me even the smallest slither of genuine warmth and kindness, but it's such a rare occurrence that I can't help but be drawn to the people that do and that makes me vulnerable.

I hope that they really did mean all that and that if they did that I'll get to meet them again someday under better circumstances.",1,autism

When I was young, I’ve always felt the need to be kind. Be polite to others and they’ll treat you the same. So I thought. People judge you, treat you harshly, do what they can to push you down. Over the years, I thought that I’d grown a thick skin. But it all cracks. I feel beat down. People who don’t even know me will think I’m disgusting or sick in the head. I never asked to be this way. It’s just the way I am. I struggle and fight and work on myself the best I can. And for what? To still feel like shit at the end of the day? I’m tired. I’m so so tired. My heart aches every night. It hurts so much that I wish I never existed. I feel like all the times that I was happy were all drowned out by all the shit in the world. It’s so crap to say but even those who gave me love and support don’t feel enough for me. I won’t kill myself because I’m a coward. I know that. But I’ll always feel like this in the back of my head.",2,depression
"a little TMI but my doctor had no answers and i can't get the right combination of terminology to get any info on if this kind of thing existed in clinical trials 

does anyone else find that about an hour or two after using nifedipine ointment, you pass little bits of yellow ""gunk""? no stool. i originally thought this was mucus but after logging symptoms for a few weeks consistently i have realized this only happens after using the ointment.

edit to clarify: i imagine this is just what of the ointment i haven't absorbed, i don't believe this is any new ""symptom"" of anything! i just don't know if this is normal, or if it's a sign i am using too much, or if it means looking to a different compounding pharmacy!",0,negative_samples
"People always say to work on your own skills and improve. But it seems that something is wrong with my brain, because I can't do it.

I wanted to learn to play the piano. I played when I was a child and I wanted to learn again, I even took a class. But I hardly continued to practice, and now I've forgotten everything again.

I wanted to write a novel. I've started several, but never finished a single one. I only made it halfway through Nanowrimo. I have an ongoing webnovel that I haven't updated in three months.

I wanted to learn to draw. I said I would draw one page a day in my sketchbook. Now I can't even draw one line a day, and my drawings look just as bad as when I started out. I only made it to Lesson 2 of DrawABox.

I wanted to learn a new language. I can't keep up with my daily reviews, and I've just been doing them off and on. It's been over five years since I started, but I can't even form simple sentences in my target language. Like, first-grader level.

It seems that I don't have the resolve to learn anything new, and giving up seems like the only reasonable option. It's not just that I don't have the motivation or energy, it's the fact that I literally don't improve when doing it that sends me into a cycle of giving up on my dreams, only to try again later before giving up once again.

"... And before I eat everything up or have no idea how to describe it to my boyfriend when he comes home in an hour or two I'd decided to write it down here. 

I'm 21 F, had to stop going to the therapist because they're just for kids and teenager and that ends with 21, at least here.

I've been on sick leave since October last year (because of my depression worsening) and left my apprenticeship in March, hoping that I'd do alot better with A) not being bound to a place anymore that hurts me mentally (software developing in an office with a huge lack of support from the trainer due to there being 5 for 80 apprentices) B) I don't have the stress from being on sick leave and C) I could make a change in my path and go for a more creative job with physical work like woodworking. 

I am not doing better, I'm not sure what I just had, but I was just crying, at least close to hyperventilating, stressed and throwing up. I feel like I'm getting suicidal again, but at the same time don't as I don't want to die, just need a break maybe... I feel trapped... Every day it feels like it's getting worse. 

My health insurance is forcing me to go to rehab(which I now see more as a chance to get better that I'm grateful for), the paperwork is quite alot and annoying but I got people that can help me. I just somehow need to get there. I'll probably try to find a new therapist, but I have problems with phone calls (one of the reasons I didn't call an emergency Hotline), but the social workers at the place I have to go to due to me not working currently offered to help with that aswell. 

I just stepped into a way too cold shower to distract myself enough so I can start to make myself busy, collected my favorite plushies and blanket, made myself comfortable with chocolate a tea and something normal to drink as I realized that I didn't drink for the last 5 hours and put on one of those dancing vegetables sensory videos to try and calm myself a little before playing a cozy game until my boyfriend comes home... Hopefully with food... I don't have the strength to make anything to eat right now... 

There's many more things going on, stuff I can't do that also just stress me even more.

"Some background: from about 10-13, my night would go like this. I'd fall asleep at 10pmish and wake up at about 2-3am. Things that wanted to hurt me, I thought, would come through my window and door, so I'd spend whole nights feeling watched by them, checking the window and then the door, before breaking eventually, dashing across the hallway to my parents and saying I had a bad dream (usually had).

Now for the current issue:

- Last night I had an episode like this for the first time in ages - something was watching me wherever I turned, plotting to harm me. My suicide note, from an abandoned one earlier that day, turned up next to me but I'm certain I didn't put in my bed! I only felt safe under the covers.

- On zoom calls, I never believe the camera is off, even when everything indicates it is and will often turn the device away from me. 

- I get the feeling my phone is listening to me - that I'm either still on the phone and people didn't hang up to listen to me or somehow I've been connected without knowing, and have to check the call history all the time. I talk to myself to work through things but don't want people to hear them. I get this feeling only alone.

Does anyone have tips or things they do to help with this? It’s been so bad lately to the point where I am just completely exhausted and have lost interest in doing anything.

"Sorry in advance this is a little long. 

A little background information, my ex boyfriend has what i'd say are paranoid visual/auditory hallucinations and I don't know if it's possible that it stems from his trust issues or his previous drug usage (acid/shrooms/weed) He would usually project onto me and accuse me of cheating, which I never did. I tried my hardest to reassure him.

There have been prior instances where he's accused me of cheating, however this is the first time he's gotten 'proof'. I had been living in a new apartment with my mom for just about a month. We were sleeping on skype as we did every night, but this one night he recorded the call. 

The video is dark, there are no lights in my room, the only light is what's coming from my laptop screen. In the video you can hear me exhale and groan/moan 'mm-mmm' (the closed mouth version of no, if that makes sense) and that's when you can hear me and clearly see me turn over in my sleep as my arm is now visible. I make the same 'mm-mmm' noise and then there's what sounds like someone else's voice whispering ""come on"" and in response to it, I give out a short groan/moan, 'mmmgh' ( I don't really know how else to describe the sound, but it's like a response someone would give if someone was bothering you in your sleep). Shortly after he wakes up and shines his phone flashlight into the screen, lighting up my room and making both, my face and body visible. My eyes are closed and my arm is in the position it was when I turned around. (he unmuted himself afterwards which made the audio quieter, getting rid of the loud waterfall noise that was happening throughout the video) 

When he shared the video with me, his first and only belief is I cheated, which is frustrating considering he believes in more spiritual/paranormal things, whereas I don't, but I heard the 'voice' as well. I tried to reassure him the best I could considering I was asleep. I started thinking a bit irrationally, like maybe someone was speaking through the vent above me, or because it is a new apartment maybe maintenance or someone is coming in everynight to talk to me? maybe it's my own voice, but it doesn't sound like me. I even started thinking maybe I have DID   
maybe I just heard this noise too many times that it's just ingrained into my mind forever as ""come on"" 

 I really have no idea and its truly always bothered me that he never believed me. I'm genuinely just left wondering what it was or if anything at all.",5,paranoia

I 15(M) won't succeed in life. You probably when you read this think, ""how can this guy be so sure about that he won't succeed in anything?""

I'm so sure in that, because I don't do anything all day have to repeat a year in school. I don't have any good friends and just am suffering.

I don't do anything which helps me. My mother tells me, how much I ruined her life. I can't even shower consistently so, how should I manage to have a successful life? I just simply can't.

My stepdad pushed once pushed me down ths stairs because I didn't shower, which is understandable. Also I told psychologist and staff in my mental hospital, which i'm in that my stepdad did that and they said it wasn't severe enough for an intervention.

"My mum is really struggling with pain and only getting pain relief for 1.5-2 hours before it flares up again. If she takes paracetamol on its own, it will work for that period of time. If she takes it with codeine or morphine, the outcome is the same. If she takes codeine or morphine on its own, she is still in pain. Those two hard-hitter pain meds have no effect on her pain. She is often crying or making noises due to pain. No position is comfortable enough. It's devastating.

She has advanced, incurable liver and bone cancer and her pain is in her upper thighs (with stiffness, heaviness as well), lower back and upper arms and shoulders. We have been to A&E twice because of her pain but nothing is helping in the long term.

Have any of you been in the same situation with codeine & morphine? What ended up working for you?

She has only recently been diagnosed, had her biopsy 2 weeks ago to find the primary and had her MRI this week but she has been in agony since March. We're waiting for results but both of us are completely in the dark about what is going to happen next - there is no communication - so all I can do is help take care of her (luckily I work part time).

She often needs paracetamol an hour before the 4 hours she is meant to wait or she cannot cope.

"Long story short, she never had fleas or worms until now (I know where she got it from too, it was not at home or from outdoors). I noticed she was acting slightly off last night, so I took her to the vet and I didn’t even suspect worms. I was suspecting a UTI or severe constipation, but then the vet found that rice looking thing that is from worms. So she gave me both amoxicillin and dewormer in case it was either suspected thing. 

I get home and I gave both the dewormer and amoxicillin. Immediately she goes to poop, I check, 

And I see a worm shirking and stretching in her poop. 

I have a strong phobia of worms. I am so incredibly serious when I say that if I ever get worms, I will commit self die. So I freaked out and ran out my apartment, went to my sister’s place because it was extremely overwhelming to see it alive. Later she came to help me clean my sheets, vacuum, and disinfect her litterbox (and throw out the poop with the worms that died at that point, I didn’t even scoop the poop I just dumped all the litter). I even bought the petamour flea household spray in hopes to kill anything there. 

I gave her food for the night and her second dose of amoxicillin, and now I’m staying the night at my sister’s place. I feel guilty for leaving her alone for the night, but the thought of being in the same area as worms (and my cat jumping onto my bed immediately after using the bathroom) is too much for me. This is the first time she’s going to bed alone and I feel so so bad but the worms are too much for me at the moment. 

I’m going back in the morning to feed her again and the second dose of dewormer, but the thought of the sight of poop with worms with it is too much. But I definitely must have to scoop out that poo, if any, in the morning. 

EDIT: Now I’m scared I have worms. I don’t even want to poop. It’s been a full day already about about to be 2. I’ve washed my hands 7 times just to put my contacts in.

"I only really became aware of my ADHD as an adult and really only as a byproduct of dealing with the onset of my bipolar disorder, which comes on in your mid 20s generally, and considering it seriously. In the intervening years as I have become more aware and paying attention for it there are a lot of things that make a lot of sense in this new context. This used to happen pretty frequently but on top of having the experience I had got to a decent level of Adderall prescription. But I haven't been able to get my regular Adderall prescription because of the shortage. So I have been bouncing around trying other drugs and they aren't working great. Or at all.

  
So today I was talking with my wife and while she always had thought this and thought I knew. But one of my weird habits is that I'll hear a song I like, then listen to it repeatedly a bunch of times not necessarily all in a row but an extended period of high in rotation. Then out of nowhere it just falls out. I don't dislike it, but something else will cycle in. Repeat.

  
I knew that this was uncommon, it drives the people who I have had to share an office and home with bonkers. Even with headphones the muffled beat repeated 300 times a week will make anyone tear their hair out. I just figured it was just a weird difference of taste and didn't put any thought into it. Some people don't like strawberry ice cream, it is what it is. She pointed out that was textbook ADHD hyper fixation. I had dealt with that before but typically it was me focusing on some new hobby or interest. Getting super engaged and then dropping the interest nearly as quickly as I started it. It is very infuriating and frustrating. But I had never really put the two together.

  
It seems like this new awareness should maybe be a good thing but it isn't like it would change my behavior knowing that one way or the other. But it is in yet another way my growing awareness of just how different I really am and how much it affects my life. With my bipolar it is a mood disorder so it has a larger scale effect and when I watch out for the signs I can usually deal with it, somewhat. Or at least I can understand it. It is like wearing a pair of tinted glasses. Everything is shifted, but shifted in a similar and somewhat familiar, usually unpleasant, way. But my ADHD is a moment to moment problem and sometimes is effectively going mind blind. Not even tinted glasses, just black. And it is constant. Bipolar is spectral and once properly medicated, somewhat intermittent. Not so with even treated ADHD, much less untreated.

  
Multiple times a day I will be speaking and completely forget what the hell I was trying to say because mid sentence I go think about some other random bullshit like what the oldest food in the fridge is. Despite the fact that the conversation had nothing to do with anything even remotely related to that. And it isn't like this is just casual conversations. This happens during meetings at work and it is super embarrassing and makes me feel like an idiot.  Since I have hadn't had my Adderall it has been so bad and now that I am aware of the difference in symptoms I wonder how it is possible I didn't think I had this problem before. Was this what it was like before I was at all medicated? Because if so holy shit, it makes me really scared if I ever loose access to my bipolar meds. That, fortunately, I have got a good prescription for.

  
When I do some dumb shit when I am manic or am unable to enjoy anything in a depressive phase at the very least that has a clear and pervasive cause. The ADHD stuff, while pervasive, is executive function and task oriented. So when you experience a negative consequence it is intermittent and often unclear because the thing that you are needing to be being aware of, your attention, is the thing you lose when you most need it.

  
For a long time and even now I would hesitate to self describe as in any way disabled. Despite the fact that I very clearly and significantly am. Almost like it's a combination of slur and mental excuse hall pass rather than just a functional descriptor. I'm even in a good place right now. Things are really going my way lately and while the Adderall problem is extremely infuriating and inconvenient, it isn't like it's heart pills to keep me alive. But I don't want to self describe as such because it feels like it's a crutch. An excuse for me to explain away my shortcomings. Because at least that way it is me being a fuck up and can maybe do better if I just don't suck so bad. Rather than me being... disabled.

  
It isn't always an issue. Sometimes the symptoms are well treated or the mood swing is mild. Other days I can't get out of bed, or can't get into bed, or can't finish a god damn sentence not in text where I can go back and reread what the hell I was saying before. Everyone loses their train of thought from time to time, but my train doesn't even have tracks some days. Despite all available evidence I want to convince myself that it is absurd you would even consider putting me in the same category as someone paralyzed, or blind, or had an amputation like you would have with more visible handicapped accommodations. Not even in the same category as someone suffering from autism, or Parkinson's disease, or even PTSD.

  
Most of the time it's fine. I am abled bodied, I can take the stairs and walk the whole length of a parking lot no problem. So where the hell do I get off making excuses for myself like I'm Tiny Tim. You've got legs, USE THEM. But in a thousand different ways on a thousand different days I am reminded just how much different I am. And I always will be. It will be treated, it gets better and it gets worse. But there is no cure for this, I will never get to be the person I know that I could be if it were not for this. So no matter how much I may try and convince myself that I can run, some days I can't even walk. And that really fucking sucks.",3,adhd

"I grew up in the hood, I grew up being taught about death, gangs, loveless marriage. I never knew what happiness was. I spent everyday of my life wishing death on myself barricaded in my room because I was hated. I kept myself alive with daydreams believing I could have something more one day I fought hard I clawed my way up I put myself through hell held my head up high through discrimination, sexual abuse, let boss’s believe they had a chance just so I could have a possible future; I did this until it stopped working. My high end life came with a cost which was my soul. I was living in San Francisco being verbally abused by a meth addict, I was abducted and raped by a Lyft driver that got covered up by the company, I was used by socialites for image appearances until there was nothing left inside me. I slept in bed everyday barricading myself once again then I got fired while I was trying to work through it. My mental health issues ruined the job I had to let a boss touch my thigh for. I went back to the valley with family and it’s great I remembered I had a soul but I can see the damage in my sisters life how her upbringing affected her. We were ruined. Our father a liar and a cheater. Our mother who stayed for a better lifestyle. They abused us and now we are all the same. Disasters. I keep thinking what’s the point I went from working in high end positions that I literally bled and sweat for to working in a Taco Bell on the verge of being sued by my landlord because I owe money, about to lose my car; I have nothing. I’m beautiful enough but not enough to fix my issues. As a kid I felt like I was the monster my mother said I looked like wishing I was beautiful thinking if I had it then all my problems would go away but it didn’t it just gave me another set of issues. This world is corrupt our souls darkened. I sometimes wish I was a sociopath so I wouldn’t care. I worked hard to have emotions again I was willing to lose it all but was it worth it? Is living worth it? My life is a curse. I’ve read the alchemist so many times and I keep trying to hold onto the hope my life could be like his or at least similar so that instead of actual treasure I’d fee content or any sort of happiness. I’ve been craving happiness my entire life but I can’t find it the only thing I see is shadows of demons walking the streets of earth. We eat meat of those with emotions and call it survival. We let those less fortunate stay in the streets and call it life. We let the corrupt control us and we call it politics. I can’t take it anymore there’s so much pain everywhere I look and I’m so desperately trying to find the light. I tried going to church and they kicked me out before I got to the door because the conservatives didn’t approve. I’m lost please save me. I’m 23 and I feel like I’ve lived several lifetimes I don’t want to lose the small amounts of humanity I worked hard to find again. Nobody on here will know what to say other than it gets better or a sense of obligation to prevent me from offing myself but truth is you don’t care not really and that’s normal I’m a stranger. Just needed to write this down.",2,depression
"So I am not the one suffering from schizophrenia, but I am thinking my husband may.  My husband has been having paranoid delusions that have just gotten a lot worse this past year. Years back when we first got together there would be things he would say that would make me think something was going on with him mentally, some examples were that my mom was putting cameras or listening devices in our room, that she put a mic in our air purifier, that my mom was poisoning his food, he is severely disabled and so he had to use a commode in our room and he was adamant that when he would use it that my mom would be against the wall listening to him. Fast forward to the present, we have moved out of state and I thought that it was just because of my mom because she was the only thing that triggered it. Well now it’s the upstairs neighbors. About 8 months ago he started believing that they were drilling into the ceiling to put cameras in the ceiling, made me check the vents because he wanted to make sure no one put cameras in it, he wants to get rid of the microwave because he’s thinking there’s a bug in it. So those neighbors moved out and now a new neighbor moved in and now it’s this guy who’s “harassing” us. He says that the upstairs neighbor was following him because he could hear the footsteps wherever he walked. We were praying together the other night and he was sure that he heard the upstairs neighbor laughing at us while we were praying and that he was laughing like his mom. His mom died like 4 years ago or so. So I asked him how would that be possible because she died years back and he just said that they could have seen a video that his ex took of him from like 20 years ago. He’s also feeling these vibrations that I do not feel at all. He claims that someone is doing it on purpose. 

So I get home from work today and right next to the bed was our 9mm. He has never been violent or anything, but to see it out makes me nervous. I’m in a tough spot because he says I don’t fight for him or do more but I’m not going to call the cops on a neighbor who’s walking hard. I have no idea what to do. He tells me I’m not compassionate and all that. I get it because he really believes that this is going on but it’s not. There a lot more instances but it’s just too much to write.   I tried in the past the best I could to tell him that I’m not experiencing what he is and he got upset with me. I feel so lost and I feel bad that I cannot help him. Any advice would be wonderful!

"So I'll start by saying that I don't really have anyone I'd consider my friends, until I started working a new job and I become friends with some people and then we all became one group of friends.

They are only in my city for university and then are heading back home over summer, but will come back once university starts again. As it is their last week here, we all planned TOGETHER to go out and get drinks and have fun.

Which was supposed to be today, yet none of them are answering me back but I can see on snapchat maps that they are all together and active.

So basically my only ""real"" friends have just left me out and now I feel alone again. Actually more alone than before because I convinced myself these people actually liked me, but now I'm thinking they only pretended to like me.

I don't know what advice I want, maybe should I confront them about how much it hurt me that they just left me? Should I keep being friends with them and just ""move on"" from this? 

Thanks for any help.",2,depression
"This is driving me nuts. When I wash my pillowcases, the first few nights sleeping on them I can smell a chemical smell, even when using the various free and gentle detergents, hand rinsing them for more rinses and on and on.... It seems to even make me have worse acid reflux. So ten I go way too long not washing them again, since it stops after a few nights. So then I am sleeping on pillowcases needing to be washed, which couldn't be good for allergies either. lol.

I wonder if my washing machine is just not rinsing well enough or if I need to try to find yet another detergent...

"I’ve been watching my aunts dog for the past week. Every time I walk him around 8pm I’m constantly looking over my shoulder to see if someone’s following me. When we head to bed I triple check I lock the doors & windows. When I try to doze off all the worst case scenarios I end up thinking of. Even yesterday, I showered at her house and my mind just wonders to “what if someone broke into this house while I’m at my weakest point rightnow” lol this might sound stupid.. but sometimes I feel like people have cameras in their home as if I’m being watched. I should feel safe at my aunts though as ironic as this sounds my aunt is a police officer (who also lives with her police officer boyfriend). But they’re away. Overall I just feel like I’m always being watched by something or someone. Does anyone have any answers to why I feel this way?",5,paranoia
"For the past month or so I have been hyperfocusing on a certain musician. Usually the topics of my hyperfocus have been shows or series and/or anything fictional, or my hobbies, so this is not usual for me. I really do not know how to handle the situation and I feel like I am getting lost in my hyperfocus, the delusions and the need to have the artist's entire discography playing on a loop all the time. I can feel people getting bored of me and myself getting bored of other people because I feel like nobody else but the target of my fixation matters.

I keep having these scenarios pop up to my mind about possibly meeting him and getting to know him. In a way, it is possible, as we both live in the same, relatively small country. I feel like the lack of geographical distance makes my fixation worse - because theoretically it is possible to meet him in person one day, these delusions stay alive and well. 

I also keep thinking that I understand him better than most of his fans. I feel like we have similar personalities and that I can see his real emotions, unlike the other fans that are fixed on his outer shell. However, I acknowledge that I am definitely projecting my own feelings and imagonation on him. He does feel really athentic, but it just isn't possible that I could understand him so well without ever meeting him or knowing him personally.

I also keep having romantic scenarios about him, which makes me feel stupid, as he is 1) someone I do not know 2) assumedly into women, and I am 1) a gay(?) man 2) usually very aromantic. I feel like I have to meet him and to get to know him, and once we become friends, I would have the chance of him falling in love with me. This makes me feel like a freak. I know it is not possible or realistic, but I desperately hold on to the scenario. It feels wrong, but for now I haven't found a way to let go. I also feel very possessive about him: seeing others enjoy his music and content makes me incredibly jealous and I even feel RSD. 

I usually don't feel attracted to anyone, which makes my attraction towards him even weirder. I crave attention and validation - at the moment I would like nothing more but to have his undivited attention. The feeling is so strong that I desperately feel like I have to get to meet him ASAP (however, I know meeting him in person isn't very likely). I have tried to figure out whether this sudden attraction is telling me to go out and try dating people, but I feel repulsed by anyone else (romantically). I feel like onlythe target of my fixation is 'good enough' or 'worthy'. I don't necessarily put him on a pedestal or anything - I just think he seems like a good, funny and caring guy. 

As a cherry on top, I am insanely jealous at the artist for his charisma, skills, looks, confidence and what not. I want to be like him. I can feel my personality being affected, or even merging, as I subconsciously study and pick up his habits and mannerisms. I feel embarrassed about it because I keep thinking that to other people it probably seems like I am trying to imitate him. 

In the end, I live in the constant crossfire of wanting to be like him and wanting to be with him. As I said, it is possible that we end up meeting some day (small country, small circles etc.). However, I wish to get rid of the delusional scenarios that I have about him or about undertanding him on a deeper level. There are lots of similarities between the two of us and I feel he has also insired me to find out my true motivation in life and chase after it. I know based on my past experiences that the hyperfixation shall pass. Still, all the emotion feels crushing at this very moment. My hyperfixation brings me happiness and inspiration, but it also affects my performance at work and school and makes less interested in social interactions. Basically, I just want to be alone with my hyperfixation and it is the only topic I would like to discuss with anyone at all.

I would like to be able to enjoy his music without getting carried away with all of these feelings, of which some definitely sound delusional (lol). At the moment, all of the conflicting thought make me exhausted and depressed. I feel like I will never be good enough - I will never be able to meet or get to know him and I will never be able to achieve anything like he has. If I think about the situation somewhat realistically, it would be cool to become his friend or work with him at some point. I also wish to use all these feelings as a fuel to find my true passion in life and to work towards reaching my goals. Through these feelings, I've come to realise I have lots of repressed creative energy and that I wish to be seen and heard more. 

How do I overcome the delusional scenarios I have regarding him? Overall, the fixation affects my quality of life a lot, but I trust that the phase will pass. Right now all the feeling are crushing me and I am neglecting my responsibilities. How do I cope - any tips???",3,adhd
"Rather than blaming other people, accusing them of things and trying to prove my case, why not do some self-reflection and see where one is going wrong?

Perhaps one is intentionally making themselves an easy target to attract these things.

"A bit of an odd one, and I've not been able to address it sooner because 1. I'm terrified of my oncologist, and 2. I've been to ill during chemo to have the energy to manage it.

I had and continue to have pre-existing conditions before cancer, specifically mental health problems in terms of this concern. Before my cancer diagnosis, I was due to receive treatment within a month to help me manage this. My oncologist decided (and ultimately, was expected to know best) that this should be delayed so that I could start chemotherapy. I was scared and my parents also pushed me to start treatment (I had recently turned 18). I didn't want to, but again, I thought I wasn't the one expected to know best.

Turns out, my oncologist had pretty much tricked me into delaying the treatment I was expected to receive for the entirety of my cancer care. This has been nine months, and even still, she is trying to push it even later. This has left me actively suicidal the entire time and at very high risk. My mental health has significantly deteriorated, and I've been in severu danger for a prolonged time, all at the hands of my oncologist.

I tried on multiple occasions to express my concerns, resulting in breakdowns every time I have been in her office, involving a lot of tears (considering I don't cry, is pretty shocking), and self-harming in her presence (scratching my skin open, hitting myself, banging against surfaces)—all uncontrollable and against my will, I need to add. I was in that much of a state I fully lost control of my function.

I don't intend to take action against her, but if others agree her actions have been as seriously negligent as I do, I do think I should be reporting it to the hospital at the very least. I mean, she has fully dismissed me, my concerns, and my actions every time I've talked to her. That's worrying enough. Surely me, as the patient, should have the ultimate say, and she has definitely prevented me from having this at times where it's evidenced there was very little risk to my health (and much less than my suicidal behaviours)? I don't doubt mental health training should be provided to her at the very least to try and prevent this risk in the future. I cannot express how primarily reliable she'd have been for my suicide if I were to have attempted, and how preventable it would have been had she tried to listen and made alternate decisions.

Finally, I believe she is expected to be my follow-up consultant over the next ten years whilst I'm in remission. I'm not sure if I have alternate options for care providers in my hospital but, if I do, does anyone know the best option to go about changing oncologists? Would it be worth going through this process? Should I put up with her for check-ups, and seek a change if the worse is to happen and I need to return to care?

I'm lost and quite frankly have been traumatised with my experience with her, and it's so frustrating. She's not a bad person, either, she's just completely incompetent in managing patients with complex mental health needs, or medical needs extending typical conditions or cancers.

I don't know where else to turn, what else to do, and most importantly I don't know how I can be a support to my sister. 
She (35F) was recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, but she previously had a schizophrenia and BPD diagnosis. She's back on her medications (with an 8 year hiatus...my family and I hadn't seen or heard from her for nearly 5 years) but her medications don't seem to be helping. 
She believes people are playing mind games with her. 
She believes people are sending her messages through her Pinterest news feed.
She believes the people she was in partial hospitalization with are really her highschool friends in disguise.

I want to be here for her. I want to support her. I'm at a loss of what to say or how to comfort her. 
I guess my question is... What can I say? How might she feel comforted? Is there anything I can be doing other than being a shoulder, an ear, a compassionate heart?

"Hi, I am a 18 year old male, and I need some advice and help, so I would appreciate any words of wisdom; btw my first language is not English, so please pardon me if the grammar looks a bit odd..

To start off, I think it would be better for me to provide my background information to understand my situation better, since I believe that significant chunks of my problems come from the trauma during my teenage years.

Every time I try to control myself from the emotional damage of the trauma, I feel like I am constantly damaging myself even though I try not to admit it. 

To elaborate, it started when my parents divorced and I moved to a different country for my school, and lived there with my father for a few years. Even though I could stay with my mother, whom I had a really close relationship with, my mother still sent me to my father, for the sake of the 'better future' in the new country. I was 13 back then. I had conflicts with him and was emotionally destroyed from his constant verbal/psychological/emotional abuse and neglect, and whenever he left home to meet his girl friend, it was the shittiest feeling ever that I experienced, and I think it is since then when my attachment issues started to worsen. I spent most of the time alone, and it was really hard for me to be alone even on my birthdays(I don't really care about birthday celebration stuff, but still..it was pretty depressing), and what was worse was when he cursed my mother's family..and every time he did that, would get mentally scared. 

And it was really painful to be aware of the the fact that I worked as a link that tied my mother and father still together, since they still talked to each other to discuss my academic and other stuff, and I knew tht my mother got agonized every time she had to talk with him, since I remember from my childhood her crying when she talked on the phone with him(they lived separately ever since I was born), and because I love her of course, I didn't want her to get hurt not even a bit because of him.

I thought I could handle all these things, but I got hit hard by depression, DPDR, PTSD, bipolar disorder, etc. I gave up on my school work and all other stuff, even my relationships with friends, since I was running out of energy to even barely breathe. 

And recently, I have been taking medication(Xanax and Prozac) to fix this mental trauma, and also having therapy sessions every month, but honestly, even though this did help me a lot, I feel like this hasn't resolved the fundamental cause of the problem. The PTSD shit hits me bad whenever I have a phone call with my father.(He pays my private high school tuition and other stuff for my family, so I can't just cut loose with him).  

Even nowadays, when I talk with people, even my closest friends, I never show my true emotions or thoughts, because it is much safer for me to just fake and protect myself from any potential offense or attack towards my authentic self.

And I hate to admit the fact that I still have hatred towards both of my parents. My father, of course, I think he deserves that, but I shouldn't hate my mother. In fact, it's just not that I hate her, I do love her so much, but whenever the issue is brought up, I feel so overwhelmed and depressed, and these emotions turn into my resentment and blame towards her. And I ask her 'why did you have to do that?' And this just turns into toxic arguments between me and her. I feel like a total piece of shit whenever I go through this, and have been thinking of suicidal thoughts from time to time. I feel like I have been losing so much of me, and I am losing control, sense of myself.

Sorry if this was a bit hard to read and understand, and I really appreciate you for reading this. And again, I would appreciate any advices. Thank you.",2,depression

"Hi i am a 25 year old male and ive never been a good writer or been very good at describing how but here is me giving it a try .
i feel or maybe it feels that way now because to be honest i feel like i dont even know who i am anymore.
I feel like i have been depressed for most of my life and i feel like i am living through a third person view i can hear see and feel what is around me but it is like i have no emotional repsonse to anything almost as if i was blank. I do not want to live like this anymore sometimes i even ask myself if i even want to live because i dont see the point in anything, everything just seems like a struggle. The hardest part about all of this is, I basically have no social life.

When i look back i never had many friends but i was always outgoing as a young kid   I had a lot of people who wanted to be my friend  thought i was cool but i never knew how to maintain a relationship
Today when i am around people i feel as if i am a ghost and have nothing to bring and give to a conversation i feel empty and hollow, it is almost as if i was a zombie i hear people talk but nothing comes to mind to add it is almost as if i am frozen watching people in my own body not being able to react.
this for me is the hardest part to live with because i just want to be able to have friends and make connections with people more than anything but i just cant seem to do it anymore, it used to be natural when i was younger but it seems to slowly have started to fade away piece by piece.

I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder at around the age of 13 but it has been slowly getting worse as to now feeling like i have severe social anxiety and bordeline agoraphobia.
This is my first time even trying to describe my emotions which is really hard but it feels nice putting them down almost giving me a sense of existence.

I was always passionate about things i would read and learn new topics, i had a deep desire to be alive to feel and be someone i had things to talk about but now i feel as if this is all gone and i really just dont feel anything anymore.
Almost as if my brain does not fucntion everything is hard to do and even feels like i have an attention dissorder at this point where even if i was interested in something i wouldnt have enough mental
Strength to focus on the topic which leaves me wandering through life not knowing what to do or who to be.
I feel like i just getting worse as time goes on and i almost feel like soon i wont even care anymore, i guess since i am writing this i do care and i do want to be here,
But if things keep going this way i just do not see a point anymore, i will probably just isolate myself even more and become suicidal but somwhere deep inside myself i do feel like there is hope, i wish i had a answer to these issues but i dont, i just wish i had someone who could help me figure this out everything just feels so lonely and i do not want to live like this anymore",2,depression

"so I’m 17f and I’ve been masking since I was a kid. My parents even admitted I showed a lot of signs of autism as a kid but they didn’t wanna test me, so I was left to learn how to mask. I mask so much that I feel guilty about self diagnosing and I hate the idea that I could be faking for attention. But the only reason why I think this is because I know the people I’m close wouldn’t believe me. Why? Because I mask so much. They’ve never seen me have a meltdown and throw things across my room, they’ve never experienced my inability to show emotion because I always fake it for them, they don’t know about any of my special interests like my dolls because I know they’d make fun of me for it, they’ve never seen one of my apathetic reactions to something most people would be obviously upset about, and they’ve never experienced me not responding to any form of conversation because I simply don’t feel like talking.

"I don't know if I really feel hope anymore or if I keep going on just so I don't burden anyone with absolutely giving up. Some days I really try to find something that means a lot to me and something I can look forward to in my life. I try to do things that I know I enjoy and I even have a girlfriend who means the world to me. But, none of it makes it feel like it is worth going through the river of shit (as the poker players would call it).

I am constantly confused what it means to be happy. Sometimes I think I found it, only for it to just turn around and lead to more disappointment. I feel like the ultimate disappointment. I know there is a lot of trauma that makes me feel that way and my mind has been permanently altered to think as such from years of BS manipulation I have dealt with. I know that it is the result of a decay in my ability to process things in anything other than pain, a deconstruction of my ability to communicate in any fashion that is clear or unformed by the Bell Jar Sylvia Plath wrote about. Trauma physically changes our brain chemistry. It is not just the gross overstimulating anxiety we feel when we flash back to an old horrible event. It is also the fundamental way our mind perceives the physical world. The simple functions that are no more complicated than 2 + 2 are basically fed bad data over and over again until 2+2=5. Then it builds on that until we reach such a level of obfuscation that a million little pieces doing something wrong, makes a very ugly whole shape. That is what trauma does.

I know this. I have looked at it and observed it over and over again. I have looked at the things I do and I know what part of my past it comes from. But, sometimes it doesn't matter because even if I managed to conquer those aspects of my trauma, I feel like there is just more trauma waiting for me. More fights and struggles. More death and mourning. More systems that actively feed off my energy just to commodify my labor into such low worth. More decay of my body and mind.

It comes to the point where I don't even know what I want to do anymore. What do I even hope to get out of life? Love? Sometimes it really feels like I can't truly feel it. I care for people and my girlfriend, but it is so obscured by a fawning trauma response that I just can't feel beyond that need to be nice and supportive out of the need to not feel like absolute dog shit. I literally can't trust myself to know what love is. Success? I would love the security of success but I feel like most of the time success is sacrificing you self-worth and principles to gain that security. It is an insecurity at the heart of it. Fun? Maybe. Maybe I just want memories worth having. Maybe I would like times where I can truly put myself together long enough to really internalize what a great time is instead of pushing myself through activities just so I don't ruin other people's time.

What I really want? I just want to write a novel; I want to create a youtube channel where I can go over art history and over analyze everything and create parallels between a Russian writer like Fyodor Dostoyevsky and an anime like Gintama and have it work. I would like the security to celebrate what is beautiful and ugly in this life for the pure joy of it. I want to be good enough for someone without the crushing fear that I am constantly on the verge of fucking it up. I want to be able to trust how I feel and be able to put it into words without the basically half an hour pause it takes me to get even a slightly viable explanation together. But, even then I will never be sure that something horrible isn't just around the corner and it makes it so much more difficult to keep walking on. I know I can't live my life worrying about the future, but I can't stop it. I can't stop living in the past either. I don't know what it means to live in the present because it just feels like an endurance to get to a new moment.

Even now I hate this post because it feels like a pity party for myself. That I am just wanting to feel sorry for myself and have people feel sorry for me. Honestly, I just want it out of my head for a bit. I just want to be able to put into words other people can understand and maybe that will make it more manageable. Maybe that will put it into such a way that I can start taking it to pieces. But every time I try to put it into words, I keep thinking ""no, that's not it."", ""no, that is not how it feels"", ""no, they will misunderstand what I mean""...I just don't have any internal confidence. It feels like all that is left if pushing on just so it doesn't feel like a burden or it is just numb. Idk. I'm going to post this anyways, despite my mind telling me not to.

"I've been spending more time thinking about how I'm autistic and didn't know most of my life, and doing more research to better understand my autism. 

I really miss how things were during the height of the pandemic. I live in a major city and I enjoyed working from home more often, less people outside and on public transit, etc... Everything felt less overwhelming for me, and now that things are pretty much back to normal, I feel overstimulated in public places more often. I am trying to learn ways to better manage this. I already wear noise canceling headphones pretty much everywhere, I wear loose fitting clothes to feel less fabric against my skin (and I'm picky about what I wear), and I recently bought a pair of sunglasses and a sun hat because sometimes the sun and other lights are too bright for me. I was on the verge of tears wearing the sunglasses yesterday because I felt immediately more calm, and I had no idea the bright lights made me so stressed out and I've been living like that for 27 years. My baseline stress level is likely much higher than NT people and I had no idea because this is all I've ever known. I'm trying to figure out other ways to feel less overwhelmed outside of the house now. 

As I've been thinking about this more though, I've talked to people in my life about me being autistic, and even people who know me and really care about me, they're supportive of me, but they don't understand. They are willing to do things to help me, like being okay with me turning off the lights because they're too bright, or fidgeting to calm myself down. But for everyone else, I explain it to them, and it's like in one ear and out the other. They say they're supportive, but when I ask for what I need to feel okay, I'm told that I need to, ""be flexible,"" and that, ""we all have to deal with things we don't like,"" without acknowledging that I already have to be very flexible to exist in a world where I feel like an alien. 

I want to do more to educate myself so I can better support myself and advocate for the autistic community more. I'm trying my best to be optimistic and focus on solutions, and I've been relying on God to help me through this emotionally difficult time (I'm a Christian). It's just difficult to accept that most people don't understand autism and don't want to learn anything beyond their limited understanding of it. And that it will be a battle to fight for more awareness and better accommodations for autistic people in the community. I already did a lot of education and advocacy work for the trans community because I'm a trans man and I know a lot of folks who are trans who I care about. I'm tired and I'm sick of life being an uphill battle just to have the same rights as everyone else, and to have an even laying field. I feel like I'm mourning the fact that being autistic had affected my whole life and I didn't know until like 3 years ago, and that if I want more awareness and better treatment I have to basically go into battle again. It feels so unfair. 

I'm not really asking for anything, I just wanted to get my feelings out here because I feel like this is the only community I know that will understand. I don't have any autistic friends irl and I don't know where I could meet some.",1,autism

"Hi all, I have a colonoscopy scheduled for tomorrow, probably my fifth or so. However, it's the first time I'm using Picoprep. Before, I had to drink two pitchers of a disgusting liquid.

It took longer for me to show an effect than I'm used to. What freaks me out a little is that I drank the first glass four hours ago and I've only really felt it in the last 1-2 hours.

When I drink the second glass tomorrow, will it take hours again to show its full effect? Cause I've got to take public transport to my colonoscopy, and (due to construction) it takes me one hour to get to my doctor.

Any advice for me? Could I just get up super early and get it over with? I also suspect I didn't drink enough after the first glass because I felt so full. Could that be why it took so long to take effect?

"Has anyone else experienced serious whiplash when moving from one author to another?

Earlier this week I finished Blood Meridian by McCarthy and as much as I enjoyed the book I felt I needed something lighter afterwards. Going through my to-read collection, I chose Oathbringer by Brandon Sanderson knowing it'd be lighter in tone and an easier read.

What I didn't expect was the shift between authors to be so impactful. It's almost unpleasant.

Prose between authors is an obvious difference. I struggled getting into Blood Meridian because of McCarthy's writing style. A lot of information is conveyed in very few words while artful descriptions paint the journey of the kid. Returning to Sanderson has been easy because his style is so direct and conventional. Sanderson takes his time to explore character feelings and remind readers of previous moments. What Sanderson spends three pages holding our hand through, McCarthy throws down with a single paragraph and expects us to clean it up.

I'm not saying either author has a better style of story telling. But jumping from one to the other makes apparent the different writing styles. I'm almost bored reading Oathbringer because it takes Sanderson so long to reach the point.

However, it's the approach to violence from both authors that's really affected me. 

McCarthy's depiction of violence is sickening. It's vivid, horrible, upsetting, unrelenting, and overwhelming at times. When the kid witnesses someone being clubbed in the head, the reader is going to experience what it's like to see someone being brained. Meanwhile Sanderson depicts violence as a morally bad, but an ultimately dismissible aspect of life for his characters. Early in Oathbringer one of Dalinar's chapters features him cutting his way through an army. Dalinar just slices and dices the enemy without a care. Soldiers are dying left and right but that's the extent of all we hear. He then wipes his sword of blood and quips to himself before carrying onto the next plot point.

Going from a brutal description of someone being maimed to a handwavey ""and he defeated the whole  army not wearing armour because he's so cool, you guys"" has really caught me off guard. It's almost like violence is trivialised now, whereas before it was reveled.

These novels are completely different. They have different levels of engagement aimed at vastly different audiences. But jumping from one to the other has really caused me to think about different writing approaches. We're not comparing apples and oranges; we're comparing apples and chicken nuggets.

Has anyone else experienced this? What authors gave you whiplash when jumping between the two?",0,negative_samples

"Hi. I was diagnosed with chronic migraine when I was 28. I woke up with a migraine one morning that never went away. I went to the hospital over 40 times the first year. I was pumped full of fluids, IV opioids, Reglan, Magnesium, D.H.E. 45, triptans, Zofran, and Fioricet. I tried Depakote, amitriptyline, Topamax, birth control pills, propranolol, and many more “preventatives.” I developed a severe dependence on the IV opioids and had to be hospitalized for detox. I never had a single day without a migraine for 5 years, with only about 2-3 hours of relief at any point in time when they would administer Dilaudid. I went to sign up for a study for CGRP medications that had not hit the market yet at the time. So there were no CGRP meds at the time available at all. I was not approved for the study but was told the medication would hit the market “in a couple years.” So I waited and then one day I went into my neurologist’s office and was ready to give up when he handed me a sample of Aimovig. I immediately administered it in his office and was desperate for it to work. I started to feel better the next day it seemed. With each day, I started to feel like a normal person again. I got off opioids, off disability, got a job, started a small business… and then about a year ago I started to have more than 5 breakthrough migraines per month again. We went up on the Aimovig, and it calmed down a bit. Now the Aimovig seems to not be working as well once again as I am having pretty frequent migraines again and they are intense. I started to use some Fioricet again but my doctor is very weary of prescribing it. I also have a hard time remembering things and work is difficult from the side effects but I can’t work at all with the migraines. I’ve tried Nurtec and it did not work for me at all.

"Hello fellow bookworms! 📚  
  
I've recently found myself standing (or rather scrolling) in the proverbial library of literature, wondering how we, as readers, navigate our path to the next great story. When faced with an ocean of options, how do we decide which book to dive into?  
  
Is it a recommendation from a trusted friend, whose taste in books mirrors our own? Or perhaps it's the seductive pull of a familiar author, their name acting as a beacon of quality amidst a sea of uncertainty. Could it be the lure of a captivating cover that calls out to us, or a beguiling blurb that teases just enough of the tale to make it irresistible?  
  
On the other hand, there are those of us who rely on the curated guidance of specialized websites and book clubs. With their tailored lists, they serve as our literary lighthouse, guiding us to our next reading adventure.  
  
And let's not forget the compelling power of awards and bestseller lists. The promise of a critically acclaimed page-turner can often be too enticing to ignore.  
  
With the diversity of reading preferences within this community, I'm eager to hear your personal process. How do you choose your next book? What compels you to pick up one title over another? Are there particular recommendations or sources you swear by?

For example, if I booked two seperate ticket budget airline flights transiting through Frankfurt or a similar international hub airport, would she still be able to transit airside or would she be required to leave airside to check into her next low budget flight (which obviously she can't do). 

Obviously, I know she also wouldn't be able to check in luggage if we did it this and there's also the issue that the airline might not even let her board if she doesn't have a valid visa for the end destination flight from their own specific flight booking.",0,negative_samples
I really don't understand what's wrong with me. I work hard. I love the best that I can. I try to be as kind as I can but people still want nothing to do with me. I never get any sort of breaks. I am immensely proud of the progress I've made in my personal life but it never seems to be enough. I apply to jobs and don't get it. I try love but never win. Do you think there's such a thing as a negative conduit? Like maybe the reason why some people have such good luck is because there's someone else who absorbs the bad? Idk. Maybe I just wax philosophy too much.,2,depression

"A few years ago I started feeling like people hate me, I even heard people in the supermarket saying things like “why do you shop here? Go someplace else” or I would park somewhere and the whole parking lot would be empty when I went out, just my car, and there was people inside and it was full when I arrived. Strange things like that kept happening, in the end I went back to my hometown.
But eventually, things started to happen here too. 
People would purposely put me in situations that make me look bad with no way out. 
People would randomly ask me really specific things and kept provoking me to say the wrong things. 
People would know things about me that I wouldn’t share with anyone.
Friends would invite me to places and then no one in the group would talk to me. 
Class mates would give me all the wrong informations about class and homework. 
Random people in the street, that I’ve never seen before, would say mean things to me. 
The list goes on.
When it all started I was consuming, but I’ve been clean for a few years now and it keeps happening. 
Every time my life is going good and I’m comfortable, they would turn my life into hell. 
I don’t trust anyone. I don’t talk to anyone about this. I’m just alone, doing what I have to do. 
My psychologist just says it’s all in my mind and to forget about it.

I can’t have a conversation with someone without chewing gum or having some kind of distraction to help me focus. If not I sweat so heavy its embarrassing and stutter all my words.

"I know, I'm like super late to it. I always meant to read it but my tbr list has been incredibly long for multiple years now.

Anyways, about the actual book. I am INCREDIBLY unwell. Like, I've been processing it for about 12 hours now and the sad feeling in my chest keeps getting worse as more time passes. I knew Greek mythology so I knew how it would end, but oh my god it hurt so much more than I thought it would. Seeing the relationship between Patroclus and Achilles evolve over however many years they knew each other was absolutely incredible and the ending successfully ripped my heart right out of my chest. The worst part for me was how Patroclus was kept from the underworld and separated from Achilles for so long. I can't even begin to imagine how painful that situation could be. As gut wrenching as it was, though, it's seriously one of my favorite books that I've ever read. Their entire story was perfect imo. All the tender, passionate moments as well as the few times they fought or disagreed over an issue. I don't normally cry because of books or movies, but I was basically sobbing while reading the last couple chapters. I honestly think this book has completely changed my brain chemistry and I am in love with it. I probably won't ever fully emotionally recover, but honestly I don't think I want to. 

Overall I think Madeline Miller did an amazing job at telling the beautiful story of Achilles and Patroclus. I would love to share these thoughts with someone I know in real life but sadly my one friend who's actually read it does not like Miller's writing style so she didn't really the book.",0,negative_samples
"I'm going to start with the fact that I am honestly not sure if I have depression or BPD or not, but I think so. It would me a high functioning form. Anyways...

Whenever I am doing good, whenever I finally change myself a little, it always fucking gets me in the end. People, places, whatever else.

I can't keep doing this. My entire world comes crashing down in the end. How the hell is that even possible?

I hate that my life seems cursed. *Like, truly cursed.* People get driven away even though I'm kind, listening, asking questions, and try to laugh a lot. Even those who even try to be available a little bit seem to change over the course of 5-7 months. They act like we're fine, but I can tell they're disinterested. They weren't always.

I don't know what I'm doing with myself, I cant live with myself while everyone seem so fake. So very sarcastic. Micro-bullying, I call it.

I don't know how to deal with anything anymore. Usually only older people are nice to me. Hell, even people only a couple years older.

But I can't help being who I am, and in a school with people the same age as (or mainly younger than) myself, it's quite difficult.

I don't feel emotions less and less, or wanted, or needed. I don't feel anything but this massive uphill journey with no one but myself to look to when I need help. Imaging what it would be like to be your only support - I feel this way. Alone in a cold, unforgiving, stale world.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm not ugly, I don't think. I'm not smelly, I haven't even gone through puberty. I'm not rude, ever. I have a lot of cool talents and interests and widely accepted values, I think.

I've been here before. I thought I could get out of it. The very few people left in this school who are older than me are going away next year.

I am not at the end yet not at all. I still feel some emotions. Some happiness. I can still kind of block all of the pain, I've gotten good at that. But I'm quite close, and I don't know what it will be that pushes me off.

Why am I this way?

"hello! i’m not even sure if this is the right subreddit, but i just need anyone’s opinion or advice. 

i’ve just wanted to know if anyone else has this sorta paranoia, but lately i feel like i’m being stalked in my own house.

i already know what i feel is irrational, but it doesn’t freak me out any less. i have visual and auditory hallucinations daily, but this deep-rooted paranoia is something i haven’t experienced in years.

when i walk in my house, i feel this overwhelming sense of dread. you know that feeling when someone is behind you? i feel that. it’s called FoP (feelings of presence) but mine seem to be a bit more intense.

i get this gut feeling that if i turn around when i have the FoP, that i’ll die. it’s a deeply unsettling feeling, like how one clenches their jaw before being punched, knowing that the hit will connect. it feels like that— my body tenses up and i get this feeling that the “hit” will be inevitable as soon as i turn around.

my stomach drops, i don’t feel alone, and i get this instinctive fear of turning around. it’s hard to navigate my house without turning 180. putting my back against the wall doesn’t help either because i imagine hands sprouting out of the wall and killing me.

someone please let me know what i can do to make this feeling stop. i’m so scared in my own house now and i’m so tired. i’m so so tired.

i can’t trust my brain, how my body feels, what i perceive…….

i know some things aren’t rational but every single cell in my body screams “DANGER!” when i experience FoP.

"Overwhelm is a mean ol’ bastard. 

I left a super toxic job to start my home-based business and I’ve been swimming upstream since. Problem is: No insurance and no money = No meds. No meds = no executive functioning. 

I have excellent ideas and all the resources to pull it off. My partner is supporting me so I can achieve this, but I just CAN’T and I don’t know why. Every time I start to work I get so mentally drained and anxious that I feel like my heart is going to explode and I become so damn tired that my muscles ache. So I do something else to soothe myself until I feel ok again. It’s a vicious, never ending cycle. 

So I gave up on my business dreams and decided just to work as a freelancer. I created my website, got the training certificates I needed, and when it came time to follow through… I’m frozen. Complete. Overwhelm. Shutdown.

The drive I had to pursue a future that I can at least support myself feels like it’s gone, and I can’t even get through my remaining classes without dragging it through the mud. I’m so close to graduating, yet everything in me just wants to give up now. At this point, I’m convinced stubbornness to not tap out in my last year is the only thing keeping me in. 

To make matters worse, living with my parents was no longer an option as of this year. I’m supposed to take care and provide for myself entirely, yet I’m bound to be homeless and financially ruined if I don’t get out of this rut. I can’t keep going through school and life with my brain off, trying to protect it anymore.

"Okay, this post may be controversial, i will try to explain myself the best i can.

There's a youtube channel called ""brew"", each video have Millions of views. Most of the videos consist of something like ""How one small cut can break your spine"", "" The Juice Mix That’s Killing People"" etc.

You can think of these videos as informative, but they are not IMO. They create a true paranoia in people that watch the channel regularly. It's kinda ironic because I think the channel 'Brew', brews paranoia and probably schizophrenia.

Now, I don't suffer from paranoia or any other mental illness but I have enough knowledge in this business to know these videos heavily affects people with a predisposition for them. Also, these people are the ones following and watching the channel, because i tell you, no completely sane, mentally stable person, watches more than 3/4 videos without removing the channel from the watch list.

"I just wanted to share my thoughts about a mater.

So I have for some time suspected that my brother might be autistic but I have never said anything untill recently when I told my mom. 

She later brought it up whit one of his teachers but she said that he didn't have autism and just imitaded me because he sees how our parents treat me. (Probably refering to my meltdowns)

The thing is, most of the reasons I suspected he was autistic is other things, for exampel 

• He has special intrests that he always talk about and he plans his free time around it and gets uppset when he can't prusue it.

• He always want to know exact times when stuff is happening.

• He also is wery precise with how mutch money he has left of his weekly allowance he has left after buying candy. (We get our allowance on saturday and tend to buy our candy before we get the monetära so we only get what is left after we have bought it.)

The point is I see where his teacher is coming from but there are somethings that I don't see how he would imitate from me. (For example his special intrests is formula one while mine is books and cultures.)

"I've been getting migraines since I was a kid and I honestly feel like I've never encountered anyone who actually understood how bad they get for me. So hopefully some of you do.   
They started for me around age 12. Always light sensitivity/pain in my left eye and pain in left temple/brow. Usually subsides after vomiting. Usually lasting 3-6 hours sometimes all night until I sleep and wake up the next day. 

They got worse in my 20s. basically the all nighters. but they would become so painful that I scream and pull out my hair until I passed out.   
Nothing a doctor has prescribed has ever had a noticeable effect. The only thing that does help are the painkillers that contain, Tylenol, Aspirin, and Caffeine. But sometimes they wont work. 

The only other thing that soothes the pain is if I feel sad. For example one of the things I would do to try to soothe the pain is watch(or listen to rather) the saddest episodes of shows I like. That episode of Futurama where the Frys dog sits and waits for him after he got frozen until it dies of old age is a good one. Somehow being on the verge of tears would help.   


Now in my mid 30s they seemed to have eased. Less frequent, less painful, less debilitating. But still more frequent than I would like, more painful than I would like and more debilitating than I would like.

I'm not someone who is suffering a lot. I know people who have had a really bad time, people who keep fighting, people who have already left... I feel that their fights are superior to mine.

I've come to my own conclusion, I don't want to say that it works for everyone, but it has helped me. Not only war, death and any danger capable of taking your life hurt and make you feel bad. No... In fact, I think life is more like an hourglass.

What do I mean? For every second that passes, a grain of sand falls, bringing you closer to death. But you can always fill the hourglass with more sand. But for that you need fucking motivation and you've to be careful, because every grain of sand weighs.

If you're fed up with feeling how the grains of sand are falling, causing you to submerge yourself in the quicksand that you're creating, you'll be unable to fill the hourglass. If your grains of sand drown you, you won't be able to fill that sandglass, and when there are no grains of sand left, you'll die.

I'm tired, I've been in quicksand for a long time. If I'm still filling my hourglass, it's because if I find little meaning in life, I find even less meaning in death. I try to keep going, I've everything I ever wanted. I've enough reasons to be happy. But I'm not. Why?

Why don't I want to refill my hourglass anymore? I've been working for so long to make it the most beautiful hourglass there is. I've people who love me, I do well in my studies, I do what I want to do... But it seems that I love to hate myself, and I hate to love to hate myself.

I realize I'm a happiness junkie. I need the fucking soma. But I know that even if I could find happiness in a drug, I'd still feel sad, because I see so many people who have plenty of happiness, and I've to beg for it. I think what makes me sicker is not feeling sick, but believing that I've no valid reason to feel sick. 

Well... I'm sure there are also people who feel like me... For those people, I want you to know that hope isn't something you find, it's something you have to create. I feel bad, but I'm not hopeless, and I want you all to keep going :).",2,depression

Maybe it would have spared the time I spent on trying to understand something, the pain of knowing that I'm always behind and the bullying.

"I (24f) have struggled with my mental health for as long as i could remember.  Depression, generalized and social anxiety, panic disorder then later finally diagnosed with Adhd and autism. Every day I’m learning how Adhd and autism has been the root to a majority of the shit i go through….
I see posts on TikTok about these and  usually they’re pretty funny and relatable but at the same time, i feel like it tends to put a pretty bow on something not pretty in the slightest. This shit is destroying me every second of my life. It’s so isolating, i feel like an alien disguised as a human trying to play a role i know nothing about. 
Everything is difficult all the time, does not matter how hard i try. Im so tired constantly, everything leads me to burn out. I don’t know how to properly communicate with others, nothing i say ever seems to make sense to others. Everyone always thinks im lazy, insensitive and overall don’t care. I seem like such an obnoxious shit person, im so goddamn annoying. I have no idea what actual true success feels like, just “thats good enough i guess”. Im never good at anything, only terrible or alright but nothing worth raving about. 
I cant hold a job long enough before being fired or quitting for being miserable. I barely graduated high school then ghosted community college because i cant even handle a cheap liberal arts degree. 
I don’t ever feel like i belong anywhere, i hate myself and this all feels like a pimento or something. My brain is broken, i hate being here and living like this but theres not much i can do about it. Im stuck with a piece of shit brain forever",1,autism
"So, I've had a pretty big paranoid episode in my life. Involved me thinking the Devil was trying to kill me and the government was tracking me down and stuff like that. I call it an episode because I'm able to define it within a certain part of my life, and since then haven't had those thoughts. 

But, ever since, I feel like I'm paranoid about the prospect of ever being that paranoid again. Basically it'll manifest in certain ways--there's this one person I keep seeing pass me on the sidewalk every time, and rather than think ""this person is following me"" I think to myself instinctively, ""well if I was paranoid I would think this person is following me, but I'm not."" It's like my paranoid habits are the same of being so watchful and attentive but now my brain frames it as ""well that would be concerning to a paranoid person, but obviously you aren't paranoid. Right?""

Does anyone relate to this or at least have some advice? Is this a sign that paranoia is just gonna be my thing forever? Because it's very tiring.",5,paranoia
"My mental health has gotten severe enough that my psych referred me to an intensive outpatient program, which will require me to put in for FMLA at work. I may also need a short inpatient stay.

I am also terrified of getting fired.

And just the fact there are people out there that are so rich like celebrities that don’t need to be doing these things and live these seemingly great lifestyles where every day is some sort of adventure whereas I’m just walking around shopping with a bunch of people doing the same thing.

"Hi, so for a little context, my bf is suffering from TB (not the contagious kind) and is on bed rest from the past 1.5 months. In the beginning he thought it was just a normal back pain but later, he found out it's TB. So, yes, because of this we haven't met since March end. A week or two ago, he even asked me ""Since we haven't been meeting and idk when we will, have you ever thought during this time that you should move on"" I was like ""no, this thought never even crossed my mind and it never will"" then he said ""okay, this made me happy"".So, at that time it actually wasn't bothering me as much because we were talking a good amount of time over the phone but now from the past week, he has stopped talking also, we talk for like 20-30 minutes max. throughout the day and this is really making me overthink a lot. I asked him last night why has he been so distant lately (He has been throwing up a lot because of his medications, which is making his body feel weak and he does not feel good because of this) So, he said that he hasn't been distant, he's just not in a great place because of his health, and he doesn't feel like doing anything. Then he said bye, I was like why are you saying bye, he said he doesn't feel like talking (he meant, in general).So, him not talking to me is really bothering me because we have only been together for 4 months now, and in my last relationship, my ex stopped talking to me in bits, like my current bf is doing but the difference is my current bf is sick that is why he is doing it, but the trauma i have because of my ex is making me overthink and question my bf. I am sorry for this long story but I am really in a fucked up place right now and idk what to do. Also, i am scared that he will forget me if he don't talk to me as much as we were before, and then he will breakup. And i honestly don't have it in me to go through another heartbreak.TL;DR - Boyfriend of 4 months isn't talking to me due to his ongoing illness which is making me Anxious and overthink a lot.

"-Heads up this is probably going to be long-

I've been paranoid for around 1.5 years I think, not constantly but there are spikes to it and I had previously had a what felt like severe episode of paranoia maybe last year where I was sure everyone was out to get me and kill me and poison my food ect I found it hard to meet up with friends and go to work without feeling like everyone was plotting against me to harm me or to get me fired, that my l my girlfriend was cheating on me and my family was deeply disappointed with me ect, I knew this wasn't the reality and felt like I was going mad. It soon died down after I quit my job which was causing a huge amount of stress so I think stress is an attribute to getting  paranoia panic attacks and having breakdowns.

Now I am experiencing the breakdowns again. I don't dislike my job and it isn't too stressful at all, but I think it could be my living situation. I live in a shared house with my mates and I've been having panic attacks/ breakdowns for the last three days now every day because I feel like my friends don't want me there because they just want to smoke green without me in the way and that my girlfriend doesn't love me anymore and wants to be with other men that aren't as fucked up as me and can smoke with her. Usually I wouldn't mind people smoking, I have other friends who use it daily and I've never had a problem with it before but I think because I didn't see it constantly it didn't affect me like this but it is affecting me and I don't know what to do.


My housemates and sometimes my girlfriend smoke together which I cannot partake in because obviously I experience paranoia and the substance isn't exactly helpful to me in that sense, but it has left me feeling like they want to cut me out and so I've been trying to let them get on with it which at the same time is making me feel like I'm losing my friends/ the connection isn't the same. when I spoke about it yesterday with one of them it was confirmed that that wasn't the case but I can't help feeling like it is and that they're doing it on purpose to get away from my negativity or to talk about me behind my back. 

I feel horrible for thinking these things but it's eating me from the inside. I don't feel cared about I'm scared my girlfriend won't love me anymore and wants to leave me because she won't talk to me about her problems and it's always me talking about mine or that I'm stopping her from having fun or doing the things she needs to do all the time and that I'm the problem, to confirm these feelings she doesn't want to have sex with me either which is making me anxious that she's fucking other men because I can't satisfy her or something, I know she wouldn't do that and it's in my head but I can't help thinking things like this.

All this paranoia and anxiety I then took to work with me on Friday where I misinterpret normal conversation and think that the actual conversation I'm having means something entirely different and it really ends up hurting my feelings or making me angry/anxious, which I have experienced before last year also, this would be and is with basically every single conversation I have or overhear where I think it is about me in a negative way or people hiding information about me in their conversations and I have to depict the meaning.


I've had to stay at my mum's house because I am scared to go home in fear of having these breakdowns from seeing my mates smoking weed and thinking all these things that aren't real or are I don't know. It's nice to get these things off my chest but I really just want them out of my head as well.",5,paranoia

"So I’ve been on geodon for over a year now and when I first started taking it I didn’t sleep for two days. Eventually I got more used to it and had a sleep schedule going but as of late every night is a struggle to fall asleep. What’s your best advice to get to bed at a reasonable time every night and actually sleep properly?

Before I was on medication I would be asleep by 10 and then I was in latuda and it would knock me out quick. But now no matter what I try I just don’t get tired. 

I’m on cyprohedtadine for sleep but it’s not making me tired it’s only helping with my nightmares. I’ve tried melatonin and that only works sometimes. I tried not getting on my phone or watching tv last a certain time. I’ve tried reading before bed. It just seems to be random when I get tired no matter what I try. The only thing I haven’t tried is getting out of bed at the same time everyday no matter what. I guess I will try that out tomorrow as I have somewhere to be in the morning but I’m running out of ideas. 

After school gets out my doctor said I soils take my pm meds at an earlier time so hoping that works. But when I was trying to figure out a time that worked for taking my meds it took forever and I felt awful and life sucked back then. Maybe now that I’m more used to it it will affect me less.

i know people would care for a bit, but their pain would subside after a while. it wouldn't last long. it'd be ending all my pain that appears to me in the most inconvenient times, and only causing a small inconvenience to others.

thats not true though and i know it. that'd be selfish of me also. i could never bring that kind of pain onto my friends and family. 

i just want attention. honestly. maybe if someone gave me the love and care i want, i wouldnt feel this way. maybe if someone noticed how shitty i feel, they'd all start to care. 

maybe i'll hurt myself so that they know the pain is real and have a visual.

i'll chicken out. but if it gets to bad, i'm certain that i will eventually resort to a shitty coping mechanism.

"  
Crippling indecision. Depressed people can be consumed by an overwhelming inability to make decisions. Everything is questioned right down to the granular level. This constant self-questioning and evaluating leaves the person paralysed and unable to function. For instance the depressed person might make a decision to take a shower. What follows next is a tsunami of questions “should I wait to later” “what if I don’t have the energy” “why do I need a shower anyhow I am not going anywhere?” This can literally play out for hours and hours until the sufferer finally says something along the lines of “what’s the point?” Needless to say this self-doubting will be followed by recrimination and more than likely self-hatred for being so weak, which in turn feeds the depression, an almost perfect vicious circle.  
Critical self-judgment. Depressed people don’t really see themselves as ill. They rarely give themselves that good a break. Instead they can very easily view their depression as a personal weakness they could overcome if they just tried hard enough. This train of thought is perpetuated by other people telling them to just snap out of it, or a thousand other platitudes they have heard a million times before. Instead of seeing this nonsense for what it really is they turn it internally and berate themselves for having a character flaw that doesn’t allow them to function like normal people. They don’t need other people to be judgmental as they are expert at doing it to themselves a thousand times worse.  
Interaction is painful. It’s something most people take for granted. Interaction, conversing and relating are things we mostly don’t have to think about. For someone suffering depression this natural ability can become excruciatingly difficult. In most instances we pull on a socially acceptable mask and pretend everything is fine. We are present but not really there if you know what I mean? We can be surrounded by people and feel painfully alone lost in the quicksand of depression. We are experts at hearing but not really listening. We are ninja warriors at the art of avoiding talking about how we are feeling. Everything is great and fine when in reality we are dying inside. While you are talking about how your day went we can be reliving the worst moments of ours and at the same time making sure you don’t see our pain.  
Fear of the future. Ask a depressed person what they think their future looks like and they will more than likely tell you “more of the same or worse” Depending on the severity of the depression a sufferer doesn’t see a future. A future is something other people have not them. Their future is the struggle they are going to have tomorrow morning when they wake up and think to themselves “please, not this again, I don’t think I can go on like this” We think about the future by comparing it to our past. It’s very difficult to imagine a nice future when all the evidence from the past is telling you it isn’t going to happen. For the vast majority of people a future is something they can feel optimistic about. For a depressed person it can feel like something to dread. Something filled with hopelessness and helplessness. Not living in the present is extremely common; it can feel like we are adrift in an ocean of misery and torment stuck in a no man’s land of despair and apathy. Once hope is lost, everything is lost.  
Even the good times can be bad. Imagine not even being happy at the birth of your child or in fact any landmark occasion that marks a supposedly joyous event in our lives. A chronically depressed person doesn’t have to imagine it. For millions of people this is a reality and is something that is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. Guilt and shame which feed the depression are experienced in equal measure. They know on a rational logical level they should be happy, unfortunately they have lost the ability. Their happiness has been replaced by numbness and indifference which they have seemingly no control over. I well remember when I was going through my own depression someone asking me what I would do if I won a million pounds. Without even having to think I said I would probably give it away as no amount of money could ever make me happy again. These are the depths a depressed mind can sink to.  
Observing not participating. There is a song from the movie midnight cowboy sung by Harry Nilsson that I think sums up depression beautifully. Here it is. “Everybody’s talking at me, I don’t hear a word they’re saying only the echoes of my mind”. Severe depression is probably like having an out of body experience. You can see and hear everything happening around you but you are not part of it. It can feel very lonely and isolating to realise that you are a spectator to your own life. Your heart aches to be part of something that will make you feel like a human being again but your depressed mind is constantly telling you that this is for other people to experience, not you. Just like the song you literally do hear what everybody is saying but you are lost in mire of the echoes of your own mind. It can feel like you are living a life where the pause button is permanently pressed. A state of non-existing if you like.  
Dysfunctional relating and relationships. It’s no coincidence that the rate of breakups and divorces amongst people suffering depression is quite high. Relating to another human being requires motivation that is sadly lacking as they struggle with their illness. Maintaining relationships requires effort and energy both of which have been sucked out of them. It’s not that they don’t care it’s because they have lost the ability to care and they feel powerless to do anything about it. When you don’t care if you live or die yourself it can be very difficult to care for someone else. They are trapped inside the prison of their own mind desperately hoping for someone or something to set them free. For a depressed person isolating themselves can be preferable to relating even though they absolutely know this is doing them real harm. A depressed mind doesn’t think rationally it will push away the very thing that could help them. It can see relationships as having very little consequence, even though the opposite is true, such is the contradictory nature of depression.  
Lack of autonomy. The most important thing to every human being on the planet is having a sense of autonomy or control over their lives. When depression comes into a person’s life that sense of control is taken away. Choices start to become very limited and the person’s world can become microscopic. In an effort to fill that emotional void many people turn to food, alcohol, drugs, shopping anything in fact that alleviates, however temporarily, the crushing feeling of being out of control of their own destiny. These strategies can of course bring about bigger problems to add to the depression. A sense of meaning or purpose to their lives is missing and in its place is a gaping hole. This can set some people off on a journey to find that missing piece in the vain hope that it will complete them. They never find that thing that will make them whole again because it doesn’t exist. It is a depression generated wild goose chase that can easily turn into an obsession. Depression holds out the promise that if you could just find that thing outside yourself everything would return to normal and the depression would vanish. Unfortunately as many people have found to their cost, including myself, it’s simply not true. The answer lies internally not externally.  
There are a countless different ways that people can experience depression. There are however quite a few commonalities between the different types. If any of the above resonated with you it’s time to seek professional help. These types of symptoms won’t be exercised away, prayed away, snapped out of or ignored. If left unaddressed they have the ability to devastate your life for a very long period of time.

"Sorry, I just need to rant. 

I'm autistic and just had a really long, overwhelming day. I already had one meltdown which I held in until I got home, but I decided to go back out for the night as I knew I could handle going somewhere routine. 

I kept my headphones in and went to take the train to go grab a beer at my favorite spot. They even have a seat set aside for me so I can always be in the same place! Enter overreacting security guards here to crush my good vibes. 

I was fidgeting with my legal nicotine vape at the outdoor train station as there was literally a man leaning over the train tracks, which makes me incredibly nervous. But having such a long day, verbalization is hard. I make eye contact with the security guard in hopes they do something. 

The guard comes up and starts telling me that I can't smoke on the platform, I just said ""okay"" and put my vape back into my pocket. They then got obviously frustrated that I didn't take off my headphones, even though they never asked me to. (They kept miming things without saying anything???) 

Well, the security guard leaves and goes to get their supervisor, who decides the best course of action is to stand very close to me and stare at me. He then follows me onto the train and stares at me. He then follows me off of the train and gets into the elevator with me and stares at me the entire time. 

The more he stares, the more I start to fidget with everything. My backpack, my phone, whatever. I just can't deal with this feeling of being observed without any attempt to even communicate. Meanwhile, I am trying my best to look everywhere that's not at the guard. I begin pointing at a man literally urinating onto the train station as I couldn't verbalize in the moment, and the guard continued to stare at me. 

He followed me out of the elevator and out of the train station. I just... I feel so overwhelmed. Like my autism behaviors were being observed and judged by this wannabe cop. I keep going through the series of events and I cannot think of one thing that is in my power that could have prevented this scenario.

>With story beats and character turns that strain well beyond familiarity, Elemental matches formal adventure with storytelling timidity.

"A movie about a rich capitalist going undercover as an employee of his own firm to root the perpetrators of who is leading the employees to protest, what follows is a look into the life of a working class, which has aged surprisingly well. Its themes of unionization and how capitalists try their best to thwart the efforts of their employees to band together is an eye opener.

The movie gives us a harsh look into the life of employees who are trying their best to go through their everyday life, it is scary how little has changed over the course of eighty years.

I found this film to be quiet ahead of its time. It was even feministic for its time period, showing women take agency in relationships and all. 

I believe that this movie should be essential viewing as it showcases the plight of the marginalized like a few other. I really loved the performance of Robert Cummings as Joe O'Brien.",0,negative_samples
"We broke up weeks ago for various reasons, and everyone keeps telling my that things will get better, get easier with time, but it isn't it's only getting worse. I can't go 1 hour without thinking about her, or worrying if she's safe and alright. Other times I wonder what's going to happen to us when she feels ready to talk to me again.

Will she still love me, will she even want me in her life? Is it even possible for a LDR to work out after 2 past breakups, or am I just telling myself that it is so I don't hurt myself again. I'm so tired of waking up every day with a weight on my chest and heart. I'm so tired of not having someone to love and take care of. Someone I can give hugs and cuddles to everyday, and who will give them to me when I need them.

Honey if you somehow find this, I still love you with all my heart. I hope your safe and your life has been kinder to you since we cut contact, and I hope everyone at your house is doing okay. Say hi to Izzy and Bently for me and keep her safe.

"Not only that, but I especially hate how hard it is to try and explain yourself to people. Being overly sensitive on certain topics, OCD, exhaustion, anger, bitterness and jealousy and everything else I can think of. I start forming Word salads, and I get stupid responses, disrespect and hate thrown at me. THE ISSUE IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU SEEING IN ME TO SAY “alright” “I understood” “I got it” “it’s because of ____” then again, I don’t know what I actually want. I don’t want to be helped, I don’t want to be met with logical answers. I think sitting down with the person I love on my lap, and just talking would be it. I don’t know. I know nothing yet, about this or myself. I truly wish I thought about my future twice or even thrice before making stupid decisions. Drinking, smoking. It might not seem like much, but it made me miserable. THIS Life…full of shit. I don’t want to kill myself, I want to have a proper life just like everybody else, not this misery. FUCK. My life is in slow motion.",2,depression
"I don’t know if this fits the sub and I’ll take it down if it doesn’t but I’m looking for some clarity and relief with this. So I just ate a Peeps frosted cookie, the ones from Lofthouse, and this one had a very strange texture in the middle of it. It had a sharp taste, like physically sharp, and it stuck to the side of my tongue, I still feel it even after multiple sips of water and even milk to try and get it off my tongue. I’m paranoid it was spiked with something, especially after hearing about fungus traveling in flour. Am I overreacting? Could it just be an overload of flour sticking to my tongue? Or should I do something about it?",5,paranoia
"Had to share this. Went through rejection.
As it is, have been a reserved, introverted socially awkard chap my whole life. I used to be in a military school for 6 years. Now I am 23.
Getting out of the military school and adapting to outside world was a tough thing but somehow got connected with some old friends from elementary school. Pretty nice people. These people pushed me to do a bit of socializing. I always stayed away from girls on my own. But during one of these sudden hangouts, I met this girl who is a jolly and friendly person, quite gregarious as well. Slowly fell for her though I got to meet her only twice. Let me call her 'P' for now. Then on, I texted her once in a while but nothing other than some casual conversations. I realized that I do have something for her but never knew how to go ahead or approach her. 'P' used to have a boyfriend who cheated on her and messed things up for her. 
Someday, I was asked by one of my friends to approach her but I didn't pay any heed to his words. Later on, I realized that I should give it a try by asking her out though I accepeted that most likely I will get rejected.
I decided to do this by writing a note and send it to her through a mutual friend of 'P'. I talked to this mutual friend (another girl) of her and explained this to her. She said it was quite a nice idea and be hopeful that it will be a 'yes' though I told her that I am not expecting such for reasons.
Then the note was handed over to 'P' and she said no. I was okay with it. But she added that she felt very uncomfortable because of this which basically makes me look like a creep.
Just these facts of unwillingly bothering someone I do like and getting passed on as a creep have messed me up from all possible ways. I feel like throwing up. Moreover, I don't know anyone to share this with. This happened two days ago. My exams are going on. Today while I went to attend my exams, a few minutes into it I realized I don't have any drive to finish the exam, all these intrusive thoughts engulfed my mind. I submitted the script with nothing on it. I am just horrified with the fact that this whole thing has started to affect other spheres of my life. Some friends have told me apologize to her (though I don't know how did I bother her), but the idea of reaching out to her again freaks me out. I don't know what's ahead. Some support and advice will be appreciated.
I pray and hope this happens to no one else again.",2,depression

"My 89 (almost 90) year old father recently got a biopsy done of a 5/6 mm nodule . It turned out to be adenocarcinoma in early stages (there's no sign of spread to other organs or lymph nodes). My parents went to the thoracic surgeon and he said that my father was a good candidate for surgery because he's in ""good"" condition for an elderly person. He said it could be a ""cure"" for the lung cancer. My father wants radiation and his PCP and oncologist recommended radiation. The surgeon very bluntly said that he would have five years of life if he had surgery and only 2 years of life if he gets the radiation therapy. He said if my dad is okay with 2 years of life than he should get the radiation.

:/

Has anyone gone through this with their elderly parent or other relatives? What were their experiences like? I just want my dad to be comfortable no matter what choice he makes. I don't know what else to feel. This is going to be a horrible experience not only on him but on my mom since she's already an anxious person.",0,negative_samples

I grew up with almost no love around me. That's why I don't know how to love someone or even myself. I can't give something to myself that no one has given to me. It hurts. Until now, I don't get that treatment (except from my bf sometimes). This is probably the reason why I always find a reason to hate myself because I have no one who reminds me that I deserve to be loved. I almost broke up with my bf again. But I feel like if I do that, I'll lose everything. He's the only person in the world who has been affectionate to me. I don't know anywhere else to find love. I long for human connection but because I've been alone for so long, sometimes, I just want to forget everyone I know and disappear in the forest.",2,depression

"I posted recently about my symptoms and positive ASCA. Since then, I had my MRE and it showed very focal thickening in my terminal ileum. My GI told me he wasn’t confident he could get to the spot with the traditional scope, so he sent me to a specialist who performs small bowel enteroscopy. I had that done yesterday. The doctor who performed the procedure said everything looked pretty normal. I got my pathology back today and everything was normal except my terminal ileum showed “prominent lymphoid aggregates”. Not too sure what that means (I mean I know what it is, but I’m not sure if there is any clinical significance) or if anyone else has experienced this. I will call my GI doc on Monday. I’m just so frustrated. I’m losing weight, having HORRIBLE pain, urgently using the restroom multiple times every other day (it’s mostly mucus and bright red blood), and my energy level is dwindling. I’m actually getting to the point of depression. Of course I don’t want it to be anything serious, but I’m sick of being told it’s IBS and nothing works. Sorry for the rant!",0,negative_samples

"I am desperately looking for help and advice. I am the caregiver for my mother living with schizoaffective disorder. My mom is young at 46 years old, was very active, and very stable on her medications prior to these additional medical issues. 

Winter of 2022, Mom sustained a back injury resulting in 4 rib fractures. These fractures are where the rib meets her spinal cord. She was bending over to tie her ice skates when she felt pops and pain. X-rays confirmed the breaks and the doctors assumed this was a one-off occurrence and told her to take it easy so she could heal. She ended up healing very slowly but the pain remained and increased.

She has been sent to an Endocrinologist, has multiple tests done for bone density/degeneration. Countless X-ray/MRIs. Pain clinics. Nothing came back conclusive and the doctor cannot provide an explanation.

Not getting an answer as to why the ribs broke has caused a spiral.

The past 15 ish months have been horrific. Words cannot express the absolute derailment that has happened. Everything from medical delusions, fears that her medical team is trying to kill her,  psychosis episodes, etc. I have not seen my mom this way since right before her diagnosis. I have been advocating for her, booking appointments, speaking with her doctors, etc.

In April, she broke 3 MORE ribs after bending over to tie her shoe. 1 was a re-break, the others were new fractures. Again, doctor has no answers. She has been checked for signs of self-harm and abuse. There are no bruising or anything indicating that is was self inflicted. SHE IS 46 YEARS OLD! Why is this happening? Her medical care has been severely lacking and I wont get into it on this post but IMHO I believe it is because of her disorder that her concerns have not been taken seriously. I know they have performed tests but that took a year for them to be ordered and over 30+ ER visits and many hours of advocacy. 

I have been doing research this whole time and after speaking with a schizophrenia advocacy group, they told me about a linkage between anti-psychotic medications and breaking bones.

**My main question is - Do any of you know about or have experience with anti-psychotic medications leading to unexplainable bone breaks?**

I am desperate to find answers for my mom and am open to any questions or advice. If you need some extra details please ask and I will provide what I can. I didn't want to make this post too long. Thank you in advance.",6,schizophrenia

"watched it for the first time recently. I know it has a decent cult following but was worried it would be one of those movies you have to be a kid to really like. Luckily, this wasn't the case at all and I really enjoyed the hell out of this early 90s superhero film. Love how it is basically a superhero film but with a dash of Indiana Jones. Bill Campbell is perfect in the lead. Honestly this guy I think could have made a great Clark Kent/Superman if there had been a Superman film in the 90s. Timothy Dalton is just awesome as the villain playing both the charming actor part and evil Nazi part great and Jennifer Connelly, Damn! What more can be said about her. Loved the late great Paul Sorvino as the supporting bad guy. The moment where he turns against Sinclair is a great moment. Also this might be one of James Horner's best score. What happened to majestic scores like this? Movies will never be the same after Horner died. 

If I do have an issue, I just wish the movie was a bit longer and we saw a little more of Cliff using the rocket a bit more before the climax. Maybe a scene of him stopping some robbers or something

It's a shame that this movie didn't do very well at the box office when it came out. It would have been great if this had been a franchise. Guess it was doomed being sandwiched between Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Terminator 2 and not having any real box office draw.",0,negative_samples

well im not officially ready. I need to write my goodbyes to everyone. maybe writing them down will help me back out of it, but a sad part of me hopes that I don’t. 

also another part of me hopes that if I were to commit, that I would fail. but then again, I would hate myself more than I already do if I do fail at another thing. I fail at everything.

New boy loved me but fake me but learned truth and devastated. He learned all of this. He started smoking again because of me. All this time he cared for me like i am his child. I didnt even see this kind of caring and loving non of my parents nor relationships. And i hate being myself and not treating him as he deserves. After he found out i lied again about the number of people but he found out again. I also said i did check stds and i have nothing but i didnt said that after this check i slept with 2 people. How stupid i was i couldnt think i would spread something to him. (we checked i had hpv not cancerogen thank god) I promised not to lie again and comitted him. I was using paxil and he was so good to me i could quit in 7 months after using 7 years. He is always so good to me he helps me so much he always cares about my health, spends money for me.

I cant work because i am always sad, i cant even brush my teeth sometime. I cant stand the reality of my past. I dont have anyone in my life who cares except him.

"When I am at my worst, I withdraw completely. I cancel plans (although I hardly ever make any for this reason), I stay in my room, and I am by myself. My anxiety prior to leaving the house or before a planned event/meeting can be so debilitating that I lose sleep thinking about it and I just go into a downward spiral.

My mom, who has suffered with depression and suicide ideation since I was 13, is just not like this. She goes through it differently and copes differently. She's always been able to carrying on with basic hygiene and cleaning around her house, cooking etc. Lately, it takes everything I've got to have a shower or cook for myself, so making plans is not something I do because it just isn't feasible most of the time. 

Lately I've been feeling a bit better, so I said I'd go to her house for mothers day - she was having a bbq with my brother and his family, too. 

The night before I started with the worrying and didn't end up in a good place mentally. I cancelled on her the next day. I've cancelled on her before, but this time she was mad. She ignored my call and didn't return it - just replied to my Facebook message to her saying I tried to call and happy mothers day etc. 

I know cancelling on her was a shitty thing to do, but I just couldn't bring myself to do all of it, and I thought if anyone could understand it would be her. She knows I'm struggling right now. I just don't know how to keep realistic expectations for myself without losing everyone along the way. I know I've disappointed a lot of people when I cancel plans but it just gets so overwhelming I can't do anything.

"A very good movie, one that holds up well after repeated viewings. Even if you're familiar with the story, DeVito's methodical and precise direction makes it thoroughly absorbing all over again. This movie has the directorial perfection of a good Alfred Hitchcock thriller, but it's not either a thriller or a comedy; it's a unique mix of elements from several genres, that does contain some laughs and sardonic humor, but also has serious undertones, mostly thanks to Michael Douglas' three-dimensional character and surprisingly sensitive performance.

"I keep getting the advice of ""oh, if you just practiced, your social anxiety would go away.""  No, no it won't. I feel like people either don't know what social anxiety actually is or they're using the term in a very mild way. When I tell people I HAVE practiced and it's done nothing, I feel like they think I'm not applying myself hard enough.

I took a public speaking class where I had to present regularly. I got better at acting like I had it together, I suppose. I got feedback that I was improving, but I never *felt* any better. I was always anxious and always relieved when it was over. And our presentations always had a time limit because it was large class. When I've had to give presentations or talks at work that last longer than 10 mins, my hands start shaking and my voice starts shaking, and if I keep pushing it, I'll lose my voice altogether and not be able to speak. Even when I tell myself ""you've got this"" and ""it's not a big deal"" and even if I feel calm, the physical stuff starts happening, and I can't control it. The only way I've found to sort of manage it is take a few seconds to grab water and breathe, but I'm always worried that tactic will give out eventually.

I can practice in front of a mirror, but all I'm doing is staring at myself. Where's the fear in that? I can practice the *words* but that doesn't prepare me for the *environment*. I can practice in front of family and friends, but they aren't people from work who will be judging my performance on a different level.

I fidget and get very uncomfortable during job interviews (I'm back on the job hunt), and it's the same problem. I can practice interview *questions*. But I can't practice sitting at a table surrounded by people I don't know who are judging my physical appearance and job history in a very de-humanizing way.

I was encouraged to sign up for a leadership course (""to build confidence"") where they're supposed to teach you all those great leadership skills. And I suppose they did, but I can't say I got anything out of it. It was absolute torture. I was highly anxious the entire time, and I hated every second. Threw all my learning materials in the trash when it was over and ran as fast as I could from there.

I've spoken to a therapist who suggested MORE public speaking, and I stopped seeing him (he also tried to suggest certain traumas happening in my past that didn't, so he had other issues). I feel like people aren't getting it. Repeatedly putting me in stressful situations again and again doesn't relieve the stress. I can develop skills to *mask* it, I guess. But it doesn't make me hate the situation any less. It still feel constant anxiety, and eventually, I will do whatever I can to not be in the situation anymore because no one likes being that stressed out all the time.

I have several years of customer service on my resume. *Can* I work with clients? Sure. Can I do it *confidently*? You're going to have to tell me because inside I am screaming the entire time about how much I just want the situation to end. I've also worked as a receptionist, and I left that job fast. I got a lot of good feedback from my supervisor about it, but I could *not* handle the stress of picking up the phone and not knowing what I would encounter for 8 hours straight. 

I just started with a new therapist, and I'm *hoping* she's going to have something useful for me other than what I've been told my entire life because it doesn't work. And I am so tired.",4,anxiety
"Symptoms: very mild cramp-like pains (24/7) in my abdomen for past 7 days and my stool consistency has changed to a sludge / porridge like consistency - but I am still only having one BM per day, which is normal for me. This was triggered by an episode of really bad cramping after eating dinner one night, since then the pain has become a 2/10 and is really very mild but it does seem to be with me all the time. 

Tests: negative celiac test. I had a positive home FOB test but I do have a fissure and haemorrhoids so I guess it could have been due to that.  The attached photo shows my home calprotectin and lactoferrin test - according to the instructions, any line in the T area, no matter how faint, is positive. Looks to me like there is a faint line for both? 😔

"26M: I think I'm pretty high functioning - I have a well-paying, stable job, good habits (sleep well and work out daily), eat healthy, etc. Yet despite these I feel like I'm never happy. I think one of my biggest problems right now is just a lack of feeling any sort of emotion at all. As an example, before when I would go on vacation to new places, or see family/friends after not seeing them for a long time, I used to get an excited feeling. I used to be genuinely happy/joyous doing these things. But now everything is just so whatever - its like I know how I *should* feel in these situations, but I just *don't*. I don't know if my emotions are suppressed, or just gone, or what. A lot of times after work I come home and lie in bed watching Youtube for hours together until its time to go to sleep. I don't think I have any serious thoughts about suicide, but I can't say it hasn't crossed my mind once or twice (although I don't think I could ever act on it). Additionally when I'm talking with anyone (friends, families, coworkers), I struggle to empathize with them. I remember when I was younger when someone told me something sad, I would feel sad with them. Now I don't feel that anymore. Again, I know how I *should* feel, so I can fake it, but I get the feeling it comes off as inauthentic and fake. And then I get mad at myself for that, which in turn makes me feel upset. I also have bad anxiety and often find myself obsessing over and thinking about inconsequential things, especially in social situations. But contrary to most other people, I don't feel any physical symptoms? (maybe my muscles tightening?), but I don't feel my heart racing or out of breath or any of that. Idk what's going on, but the whole thing has just had me really down for the past couple of years. It's like a switch flipped in my brain and I've just lost all emotion, energy, and enjoyment in life. Can anyone relate?",2,depression

"Hi there,

So lately I've been in not a super great place, but it's been coming in waves. I'm currently in a rigorous grad program, so I've been trying to chalk it up to just being stressed and doubting my abilities, etc etc. But I was wondering if I'm the only one that gets this particular feeling (I've experienced it my whole life and only in the past few years have I been realizing the pattern between dark thoughts and then immediately feeling this sensation)--I can really only describe it as a kind of deep discomfort, /almost/ pain but not quite, that starts in my stomach and radiates to the palms of my hands. It aches there for a second and then goes away until the next bout of bad feelings, which could be as soon as seconds later.

"Almost two years later and I still can't make sense of it. I don't see how it's me.

For 29 years, I had no mental health issues. Then, in September 2021, I had a vision of a man sitting behind a desk giving me an evil grin. I told him to go away and a voice told me that I shouldn't have done that. He went away.

I received a notification on my phone of a friend request for Snapchat. It didn't look right. It was malicious and installed some type of program on my phone to mirror my phone. I have pictures if you're interested. The viewers had Instant Apps downloaded on their phones where they could watch me. Note: the program author is Google Play Store. Real Google Apps are signed by Google, LLC.

After verifying that people were watching me, I deleted Snapchat and reported it. A day later, I started getting these weird energy attacks in the left side of my head that was inducting intrusive thoughts. It went on for a month before I went to the Emergency Room.

My parents were in the room. I told the doctor what was going on, but he was visibly angry. It seems possessed. I said whoever did this I forgive him. He got really angry at that and asked my mom to come with him. The doctor instructed my mom to call crisis to initiate an involuntary hold. The crisis team said there were no grounds. **That's when the doctor took the phone from my mom and said I was homicidal. It even says in the notes, Mom failed to mention homicidal ideations. I never said anything homicidal.**  So I was involuntarily admitted. The energy attacks and intrusive thoughts stopped immediately.

After 9 days, I got out and took the medicine for two months and then decided to quit cold turkey. Things were fine for two months after I quit and then the weirdness started. One honorable mention was a false call to the police that I was saying disturbing things to a bus driver. **Not true.** Some time after that I had a weird shock to the heart and I called home to let them know I felt like I was having a heart attack. When I got home, I was involuntarily admitted again because my mom heard me say on the phone I wanted to drive off a bridge. **She might of heard it, but I know I didn't say it.**

It’s a poison that’s killing me every day. The fact that I will never be as good at anything as my peers. The fact that I won’t ever achieve anything great.

"I've been diagnosed with schizo affective disorder back in 2019, ended up going on Abilify depo shots for a bit but after some time began to think maybe I was just going through psychosis and had finally managed to climb outta that pit and start my life fresh and with better understanding. Unfortunately I moved with a trusted ""friend"" out of the city I grew up from and to an isolated area with some other people that gave me solid actual reasons to be scared.(we'd have a ""friend"" of a roommate come by often and was going to prison for drug dealing) but had been telling myself whatever I'm hearing was probably just in my head. After a few months things weren't working out which led me to be more  mentally drained and delusional so I moved back to the city I grew up hoping to restart again and moved into a co-op where another friend has been living and have had a few mental breakdowns while.living with him.

"Sorry for the long story!

I broke up with my long-term girlfriend around a year ago. Tried to split amicably; we lived together so I had to stay there for almost a month before I could move to a new place (it took a while because I had moved halfway across the country to be with her, and was now moving back of course). She got a bit mean that month at times, but otherwise we were both coping well with the split and managed to live next to each other until I moved out (at least, that's what I thought).

Her parents, however, are a totally different story. Ironically, the had always supported my side in the argument that led to our breakup, but strongly freaked out at me when I decided it was finally too much and broke up with their daughter. Unlike her daughter, they coped very badly and were seemingly much more depressed and angry than either me or my ex.

Then weird things happened in the month I was there. First they suddenly were seemingly friendly to me again (maybe they hoped for reconciliation?) and even invited me for dinner at their house for one last time. After said (unremarkable) dinner they turned semi-hostile again. I later found out that when I was out the whole day to sign the contract for my new apartment (as I said, quite far away), they tried to break in (they had a spare key because they owned the apartment and we were renting it) knowing I was not there. When I later confronted them, they said they only wanted to do so to make a video recording of the whole place and avoid discussions about possible damage due to me moving out later on. They didn't actually manage to do it because I was coming home earlier than expected, and instead had their daughter film everything and send it to them. I actually would have agreed to them just coming over to do so (I understand that they want to protect their property and would take accountability if necessary), but doing all of this behind my back left me feeling deceited. I kept my calm to avoid further conflict, but started growing suspicious obviously.

I should add that these are extremely over-protective people. They’d literally make the university homework of their daughter while she was out having fun. They'd write mails for her in her name. They’d text her all the time and would panic if she didn’t reply within an hour (she’s almost 30 btw). Stuff like that (I know, should have run away immediately at those red flags).

Then, I got mislead again. In that month we still did grocery shopping together, and my ex told me she wanted to go to the shop close to where her parents live to buy some fish (because it's cheaper there). Said shop was closed when we arrived (no way her parents didn’t know). But since we were there, she briefly wanted to go to her parents for some other reason I don’t even remember. When we got there, her parents handed me a contract that they asked me to sign. It stated arrangements for me leaving the apartment (ok, I get that), but also stipulated that it was my decision to break up, that I should be responsible for cancelling mutual accounts, that I’ll be accountable for any damage bla bla. Anyway, I adjusted/scratched some of those ridiculous agreements in there and signed to avoid apartment-related disagreements later on. I mean, I get that something had to be put on paper about the apartment, but her parents making this “breakup form” for her and all of the other stuff in there was just ridiculous. Oh, I later also found that even after me signing that contract (and leaving a pretty obvious agreement about cancelling/dividing all mutual possessions in there), they called the bank where my ex and I had a mutual account to make sure I wasn't hiding (stealing?) anything...

At that point, my suspicion turned into fear, and I did something I should normally not do to avoid any further surprises being plotted behind my back. My ex has an Apple Watch, we she often leaves at home when she is out working. Knowing that she frequently texts her mother, I started reading those texts on her watch when she was out (only those, didn't want to know what else she was writing to friends etc.). In those texts I learned how they had indeed been scheming together to sneak in when we would both be out and so on. I also learned that despite them acting friendly / concerned about me again, they were secretly cheering in those texts whenever I had some bad fortune coming my way (e.g., when I was having trouble getting the utility companies registered at my new address, when my 76-year old grandmother caught COVID, ...). They'd literally put a heart emoji on those messages, but then the next day her mother would call me to offer her help packing my boxes because ""it's not good for my back"" (I do indeed have back issues from time to time); felt super creepy because I obviously knew by then that all of that expressed concern and friendliness was fake. Of course I had to pretend everything was fine (couldn't let her know I was reading those texts with her mother), but inside I felt sick; especially considering that just a few months ago I went to her mother's place every day for an entire month and worked from there  (I was working from home during COVID) to take care of her because she had broken her shoulder and needed assistance. There are a few other things they lied about (and did) that month, mostly minor/childish things that I just tried to ignore.

Anyway, her mother being a total snake, and my ex at the very least playing along with it, did make it much easier for me to realise breaking up was absolutely the right decision. I was so looking forward to the day I was moving out to finally have these kind of people out of my life for good. Her father, however, is a different story. He got very angry and shouted at me the day we broke up, then pretty much remained completely quiet throughout the entire month. To be honest, I was so focused on the scheming mother that I didn't pay much attention to him. To sketch a picture of the man: he's a rich and highly intelligent doctor, but at the same time also a very isolated, introvert (and honestly, frustrated) person. He has no friends that I know of (as in, during the 4 year relationship with my ex he never met with any friends that I know of) and is very unhappy in his marriage (without going into further detail, there is at the very least frequent verbal abuse between him and his wife; they never divorced ""because of the kids"", my ex even told me herself). His wife also blurted out one time that he was dealing with some sexual frustrations (really didn't need to know that). He suffers from intense paranoia too; he would for instance sometimes leave his cellphone at home when going for a walk (especially during COVID restrictions), because otherwise government authorities could triangulate his cellphone signal and track his position. Perhaps this paranoia was also the reason for the contract, recording my apartment, calling my bank, changing the locks of the apartment the same day I moved out (yes, they did that, despite them being the ones previously plotting to abuse their key to my apartment...). I don't know. I know that, a few months before our breakup, he for instance got a pretty serious letter from the police following a complaint from one of his patients. Really don't know what to think of that now. Other than that, I actually liked him because he was always nice to me (before the breakup), had many interests (art/travelling/cooking/...) and could have a deep conversation with you instead of just chit-chat (once you did get him talking). Again, a very smart person I actually looked up to in some ways. On the other hand, I found it hard to gauge his character for all of the above reasons.

Getting to the point: a few weeks after I had moved out, I started having some weird medical issues. It started with some mild aching pain around my testicles, and without going into too much detail (sorry if TMI already), I suddenly also developed sexual dysfunctions I didn't have before. Now, there is also pain in my foot, making even simple walks uncomfortable. Doctors have no clue what's going on (after multiple MRI/CT screenings of my back and pelvis, blood work and so on). Seems to be some weird inexplicable nerve issues, despite me testing negative for all common causes (diabetes etc.) for such issues. Things are also gradually getting worse, and over the last few months the fact that it's not going away is starting to affect me mentally as well (which of course makes doctors think now that ""it's all in my head""). I started panicking, and researching myself what could be wrong. Similar to the doctors I had consulted with, I couldn't find an answer.

Then, an idea started bothering me: I had just gotten out of the strangest, most suspicious month of my life (with people scheming behind my back, and me probably knowing only half of it through the texts I had read), followed just a few weeks later by the most suspicious medical issues I've ever encountered. What if that's not a coincidence? These people clearly had bad intentions set out for me; what if they went as far as to poison me? They have the means to do so (him being a doctor and having full access to any prescription medication/chemical), the motivation (knowing what they had already done ...), potentially the history (the suspicious police letter a few months earlier), their totally weird/suspicious behaviour, and honestly they also have the social isolation and mental instability necessary to be capable of doing such things. Continuing my research, there are indeed drugs/chemicals causing symptoms such as mine that are extremely long acting (sometimes persistent for years) and can be administered both orally (and I had dinner there after our breakup) or topically (they had access to my apartment, and could have put it into any of my bathroom products). I have since thrown out everything (shampoos, douche gels, toothpaste, hair products, perfumes, olive oil, ...) I had taken with me when I moved out there.

Initially. this idea seemed way too unlikely to me; but honestly, as months have gone by without any other explanation, and as I really can't judge these people properly (and I can't just ask them; I know they are excellent liars and I have been fooled by them before!), I am starting to consider it more and more as a possibility, and lately even reality. It's making me so scared that I even contacted a toxicologist for an extensive blood screening (which costed me quite a bit), but they couldn't really help me out (as it may no longer be detectable in my blood). For the last two months I have been having constant nightmares about these people (not my ex even, just her parents!) and what they might have done to me. I wake up in panic, sweating, heart racing and not knowing what to do. It seems impossible to ever know what really happened, and I just fail to rationalise that this could not have happened.  I'm started to have panic attacks throughout the day. I'm truly \*constantly\* thinking about this, making me basically unable to enjoy anything anymore. I fear that I'll never get a full answer, while at the same time living like this in a constant state of anxiety is unbearable and driving me to some dark thoughts ... and it's not getting any better as time goes by, that's clear. Never had any mental issues before. I'm hesitant to seek psychological help, because that would only help calm me down about my fears, until they get me to believe this didn't happen, hence fooling me twice in the case it really did happen (a possibility that can't be excluded)!

Again, sorry for the long wall of text. Even if nobody reads this, I hope writing all of it down for once will help me cope a bit better.",5,paranoia
"I’ve been on a reading mission for several years to read every Pulitzer (US), Booker (UK) and Miles Franklin (AU) award winning novels. 200+ books.

"Something broke inside of me on Monday. A dam I've kept up for years and suddenly I have to come to terms with how much of a loser I am at 35. No job. No feasible education. Fat. And a decade old romantic relationship gone. 

Oh also in debt. It's not huge debt, but It's there and affecting my credit score. And I can't change it until I get a job. Which I've applied for but no calls so far. My resume probably sucked. 

But it's hard to be this functional. Or dysfunctional. Saying jokes. Laughing at things. But inside I can't breathe. All I think is death. I can't go to the gym. I don't deserve to do things I enjoy. Because I'm a filthy loser. An important loser to some people so I can't die. I can't do the undoable but i wish I could. 

I can't eat either. I have the opposite of a binge eating disorder. Food feels wrong. It feels undeserved. Every time I eat something I want to vomit it back up because I don't want nourishment. I want to die. I'm getting physical pains throughout now because I'm so tense. How I wish I was somehow somebody else. Is this the dark side of the soul? 

Feeling the shame I have inside me feels like cutting my insides with a razor. I haven't bitten off all my nails so I can't be that bad. I smile and I act empathetic to distract me from the tearing sting of existing in a body that I have failed repeatedly. People that I've failed repeatedly. Someone I never became. Someone who hyperventilates at will. Quietly. And wonders if it will show up on my fitness watch. Some proof of the darkness filled with scathing flames of pain.

"I hope I'm not alone here but it's been a struggle getting an ADHD re-diagnosis with a psychiatrist (I'm a travel nurse and the new legislation that doesn't allow the telehealth apps to prescribe stimulants and requires telehealth providers to be in the same state has hindered me, esp because I was about to try Vyvanse or Adderall that I think would have helped bc Strattera and Ritalin weren't cutting it).  
So it has led to more mental health services burnout because of additional feelings of invalidation.
But most recently I had a psychiatrist tell me that ""it doesn't sound like ADHD"" because I told her that recently because of my burnout of frustration in not being able to find treatment my brain has realized it can forcibly quiet my inner dialogue, so I don't hear like...10 mental radio station at once, but in exchange my body is moving on impulse and autopilot. And as soon as I try to more actively live in the moment, it means I'm turning my inner dialogue back on, and it's like all of the mental noise picks up again.  
So I call it disassociation because I had problems with focus before but now it even especially feels like my brain and body are disconnected, and I'm even more distanced from emotions.
Am I just calling it the wrong thing?
I tried to explain to her that the disassociation isn't from a traumatic event, it's from having to deal with my constantly running ADHD brain for years, but nope, she decided that couldn't be what's happening.

"Hi everyone. I would like some support and advice as I feel like my life is at its end right now. I've been put into a very bad financial spot recently and it's put me at my wit's end. I've been unemployed to study and now all of the sudden, all of the financial burden has been put on my shoulders.

I've been applying to every job listing that I see have been relevant to my previous line of work, but the response time from companies is so agonizing. I don't know if they'll contact me back, let alone give me a chance at an interview. I can manage to get by for another 2 months from savings and I honestly don't know if I'll get anywhere before my savings run dry.

My biggest issue with anxiety at this moment is my inability to sleep and wake up peacefully. For these past two weeks, I've been heading to bed with a giant pit in my stomach and it haunts me to the point where I can't sleep. When I do sleep, it'd be from pure exhaustion of trying to fight the sense of doom. Even still, I would only sleep for 1 to 3 hours at a time. I'd wake up with the pit in my stomach feeling like it became a giant crater. I'd wake up sweating and frantically trying to seek the presence of others because I feel so alone. Often times no one else is home and my friends are still asleep, there's no one for me to cry to. I'm fairly new to feeling like this, is this what it's like to have a panic attack? It feels so terrible and it puts me on edge every morning.

This is certainly putting a strain on my friends and relationships. I've cried to them so many times already and I feel like at some point, everyone will understandably become tired of me and I'll lose my line of support. I don't know what to do. If anyone out there can share a piece of their story on how they overcame this terrible time, or how they're coping, please talk to me. I don't know what to do about this pit in my stomach and I just want to be able to sleep again.

"Growing up in an immigrant family, mental health was never a reality. Depression and anxiety were just excuses. A few years ago I was diagnosed with high-functioning anxiety, which I successfully addressed with therapy and self-help books (moving out of the dysfunctional family home helped tremendously too). Since I moved in with my partner recently (after living alone for a year), those self-help books are biting me back. As I understand, moving in is a big deal - it takes time to acclimate and work out a healthy dynamic since you now spend so much time together. We disagreed a lot about small things that ultimately don’t matter. My self-help knowledge made me aware of a new (impossible and often conflicting) standard I can keep myself to, but it also taught me that humans are imperfect so any mistake can be written off. Now, I don’t feel grounded. I feel complacent and apathetic. I can’t seem to enjoy just existing. My favorite activity is sleep.

"Let me cover the basics first. I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow afternoon. I do *not* have a neurologist as mine passed away, and the three I have been referred to are not taking on any more patients at this time. 

I would like to suggest a couple of medications to my GP that I could go on for prevention. I’m really, really suffering daily. I am in Canada, and I do not have health coverage/insurance. Things like the CGRP meds are out of the question due to the cost. The other complicated aspect is that I only want to try meds that I can take safely while pregnant, as we are hoping to start trying soon and there’s no point in me finding a medication that works if I’ll have to stop it when I conceive. I refuse to start trying before we get the migraines under control. 

Medications I have tried with no results: 
- Magnesium/coenzymeQ10/riboflavin combo 
- Amitriptyline (still on it for other reasons but has not helped the migraines, even at an increased dose) 
- Toradol 
- a few others when I was younger but I forget their names and would be willing to try them again anyways

He is a very sweet guy, never cheated, very honest, always reassures me when I need it, and above all he's never harsh or rough to me during a disagreement. All in all, a good guy. He's not perfect, obviously, but who is?

However, my anxiety gets to me fairly often, which causes me to overthink. I do my best to push it aside or distract myself, but of course, it gets to me.

Even more elaboration on this because I was not clear enough: they were spamming me to talk to that person in their group chat. They were forcing me to talk to that person. They were threatening to stop talking to me, begging, etc. to keep me in that chat. I stayed because I did not want to lose them, but while I was talking to this very aggressive person, they kept spamming memes and joking about me and making fun of me. I'm not some tyrant forcing them to not talk anywhere.

"I'm planning to travel through some countries in Central and South America (Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala) for 6 months, starting October.

I can spend around 11000€ ($11800) on this without blowing through emergency savings for my (then likely jobless...) return. I know that Chile will burn the budget more than the other countries, but I do plan to see all of the country, particularly because it looks so gorgeous and is one of the ""safer"" ones in the region for female solo travellers.

I usually stay in hostels, but also cheap hotel rooms once a week to get some decent sleep in because I can't really sleep in hostels. I eat as cheaply as possible. I take public transport wherever it's reasonably safe. The one thing I don't save on are tours into nature / organized treks (vs. not doing them), because I love nature and don't drive.

In your opinion or experience, is this a realistic budget in 2023?

This leads to a lot of confusion on social media considering how prevalent figurative language is.

Whenever anyone asks if something is sarcastic or not the response is usually ""obviously"".

"I did it. I told him everything about what's been going on. I told him about the feelings of strongly believing that something evil has entered inside me and that it's been controlling my thoughts and emotions.

"About two months ago I finally sought out professional help to alleviate my anxiety. I went on ZocDoc and after some time, narrowed my choices down and picked at what I thought at the time was a good psychiatrist.

My first visit was very brief and she put me on medication which I thought was odd at the time. That visit was over the phone but she told me to physically go to her office for the next visit. Our second visit started out a little shaky. I went to the office as she told me to, but she wasn't there so I had to do the visit over the phone again while I was in her office. Aside from that it was great!  I felt like I got a lot off my chest and I felt like I finally had someone looking out for me. Our third visit was brief again and she didn't seem to remember or bring up most of what was discussed in our last meeting. I began to realize that she was very forgetful. Our fourth and probably last visit was awful. She couldn't remember basic details about me, couldn't remember what meds she prescribed me and sounded generally uninterested the entire time. At the end she told me they were having ""technical difficulties"" with scheduling appointments and would call me later to book an appointment.

That was over a two weeks ago and they still haven't called me back. I don't even want to waste my time calling them to see what the deal is. It all felt so directionless. She'd prescribe me medications then tell me essentially to figure it out and I've been trying to figure it out by myself my entire life. No guidance, insight, or any form of advice to help me improve my life as if the medications would suddenly fix all my issues. I'll take my losses and find a new psych.

I know this journey won't be perfect, but it was very disheartening to finally tell someone all the struggles I have dealt with my entire life only for them to give me subpar care and treat me as if I'm some annoyance. I did net some good from the visits. I was finally put on some medications that have greatly helped in reducing my anxiety.

"I stumbled across it by accident, by studying chemistry and maths. Studying chemistry and maths forced me to implement an evidence based belief system in my everyday life. Implementing an evidence based system (and consistent 7-8 hours of sleep per night) is the key. Now when I get a delusional thought, I ask “is there any evidence to support this thought?” If there is no evidence for the delusional thought, I say it does not qualify to become a belief. This sounds simple, because it is, but it is a full time job, asking every delusional thought if there is evidence for the delusional thought’s claim. It requires effort everyday, it requires an adequate amount of sleep, it requires a solid daily routine. Consistent sleep, consistent routine and an evidence based belief system is not an easy thing to implement if you don’t currently have it implemented, it was a 3 year process for me. I’ve been a diagnosed schizophrenic for 10 years, many psychiatric unit admissions. Also, if you are still taking drugs (weed, alcohol, mdma etc), forget about it. Curing schizophrenia requires you to order your life, order your sleep, no drugs, practice an evidence based belief system until it is engrained in you (took over a year of daily chemistry study for this to happen for me). It’s not an easy life change, but nothing worth having is easy. I’m now 2 years antipsychotic medication free, my own flat, loving life. I offer you this simple to follow but hard solution as an offering as I know it works through experimentation. Psychosis free for the last 2 years, while the prior 8 years were full of psychosis. Getting your life in order is the key, it takes a lot of work and effort. If you can’t muster the work and effort, this is not a solution for you, and that is the harsh reality. But you can muster the effort out of will, so it’s a matter of how badly you want a schizophrenic free life. Again, a tried and tested method, so if you want to whine, save it, I know it works and this is for people looking for a solution, not for people who sulk, whine and pity themselves. So to any hard workers out there, here you go, a tried and tested method of curing your schizophrenia. To reiterate, if you still take recreational drugs, don’t waste your time with this method",6,schizophrenia

Shakespeare was correct about this statement. Our world revolves on chaos, relies on it even to function. I know everyone reading this and on this sub has experienced chaotic times in their lives as we all have. Our experiences may not be equal but we all understand the pain of this world. Some of us better than others but regardless we understand it. Once you understand the world everything becomes meaningless. Sure you could give meaning to things but for what? Eventually everything will perish and that is the single truth of this universe. The reason everyone clings to life is because of desire. Without desire you’re a walking shell and at that point what do you do? Do you find something or someone to desire? Do you continue on realising this truth? Only you can answer these questions for yourself.

Started my new job 2 weeks ago and my sister and mother are upset that I don't ""talk to them"" despite me feeling mentally exhausted and physically exhausted. I constantly work my schedule around my sister and my mother. I'm always on edge when my mother is with me around others as I dont know if she'll embarrass me blowing up, like she does on me and my sister. I get that I'm the oldest.

She's irresponsible, clumsy, forgetful. I never had that privilege growing up. I find myself at times that I feel envious of her being the youngest. Whenever I try to do stuff on my own to just to catch a break, it is always a problem. I guess I'm not entitled to a break.

I hate that my role in the family is skewd due to family boundaries being blurred.

It sucks having to work my finances around my mother being financially irresponsible and needing to borrow hundreds of dollars that ""she'll pay back"" but never does.

"Hi, I hope this is ok to ask, I would love any thoughts. 

**Background**: My dad (I’m an adult) has schizophrenia. He is currently unmedicated and in a (so far) 2-month long psychotic episode, suffering from delusions. He is seeing a psychiatrist. His anosognosia is very strong. 

**The issue**: My dad’s delusions are persecutory, with my mom, my brothers, and me being the main people who have treated him poorly. His psychosis is progressing. He will often accuse us of things we have not done or ask why we said something we never said. We try to follow the LEAP method but are stumped when asked aggressively, for example “Why did you manipulate me for entertainment on a reality show?” It’s hard to not immediately just say “I don’t know what you’re talking about” or “I didn’t do that.” 

**The question**: How can we respond to being questioned about or accused of things that never happened? We want to minimize agitating him or making him feel gaslit or condescended to.

" Hey, I hope this is fine here, because I am concerned, confused and worried about a friend. About three years ago, she suffered a psychotic episode because she stayed up for way too long one time - as far as I knew, she had a sleep disorder she had to take meds for, and her family had a history of schizophrenia, so I suppose that's all that was needed.

However, after this, I feel her entire personality has shifted. Her episode warranted her having to seek treatment, which she has gotten a lot better from, but I almost feel like this psychosis never quite ""went away"" so to speak.

Comparatively, she's doing wonders since then - she's taken up learning another language and doing work related to that! She does have an amazing sense of determination when she intends on something.

However, she does have various delusions from time to time, and this is where I lose her. Thankfully they haven't been at the severity or intensity since that episode, but every now and then it seems her mind will focus on a very specific thought and she becomes very agitated with others.

As an example, I stream games as a hobby on the side. She wanted to join in but mentioned to NOT stream one game in particular. Streaming this game, according to her, will lead to me being swatted on stream.

At first I tried to ask questions taking the delusion legitimately - the internet can be really terrible so I thought it was some internet trolls but there isn't some wide mass swatting going on for this game: in fact, it really isn't played that much and if it was, it's getting 5 viewers max based on twitch.

The one thing I've learned is that trying to ration or logic through a delusion can actually be more harmful, so I try to not do that. I don't attempt to dismiss her thoughts but any time I ask, ""What do you mean?"" or ask her to explain it further she gets mad at me, tutting, sighing, and telling me vague things like ""The walls have eyes"" and ""You have much to learn"" She gets mad that I don't simply ""get it"" and that I can't read her mind. When I ask her to tell me what she's thinking (not even trying to judge her thoughts, just trying to know what they even are), she will give a vague statement like above and so I'm more confused, and then my confusion pisses her off.

While this example isn't really hindering me, I'm worried what might happen if she develops specific thoughts that would be damaging to herself or others. Our friendship has deteriorated because it's become impossible to have a discussion; a lot of it is now lecturing me to do certain things based on her paranoia. Any resistance to following along leads to condescension and her yelling, which is probably where my biggest problems lie - after the episode, her aggression has ramped up - while I don't feel like I'm in physical danger, her patience for people ""not getting it"" is non-existent and her response is to yell at them and treat them like they're idiots for it. This is the most frustrating bit for me, because I do have a sensitivity to any yelling coming from an environment like that, so my response due to my own personal shit is to back off. But in backing off, it's literally causing me to keep my distance, because I don't want to get yelled at again.

I suppose what should I do, if I should do anything? Is there something wrong with how I'm approaching her, leading to this? It's hard to begin to understand what she's feeling but I want to try in a way that isn't going to make things worse, which I'm worried I might be doing here. Any insights or thoughts would be much appreciated",5,paranoia

Also do you have any advice on helping me manage my anxiety around this issue?  It’s been so hard seeing what my girl is going to have to deal with for the rest of her life and the thought that all of my children will have to is overwhelming right now. 😭",0,negative_samples

"In my opinion, most coming-of-age movies have a pretty depressing atmosphere. What do you think?

I can give a few examples (in no particular order):

The Spectacular Now

My Girl

The Perks of Being a Wallflower

Ghost World

Ashby

Stand by Me

Boyhood

The Ice Storm

Mud

All the Bright Places

etc.

There are of course many more, but the listed ones are some examples.

"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my experience with COVID-19 and allergies. I am someone who suffers from severe allergies, particularly to dust-related substances like dust mites, pollen, sawdust, floor dust, and anything else that's dusty. I have a runny nose 24/7, and I always need to have tissue paper with me. Additionally, if I come into contact with dust, my skin becomes incredibly itchy.

Last year, I contracted COVID-19, and surprisingly, I remained asymptomatic except for a one-day headache. However, during this time, something remarkable happened—my allergies vanished completely. I could finally breathe easily, my nose was clear, and my skin was no longer itchy. Even my scalp psoriasis disappeared.

Unfortunately, this period of relief didn't last long. Around two months later, all my allergies came back slowly. I often find myself thinking about that time when I had COVID-19, to the point that I've even wanted to intentionally infecting myself again just to relive that symptom-free period.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? I'm curious to know if anyone can explain why this phenomenon occurs.

I appreciate any insights or shared experiences you can provide. Thank you!

Ps.No medication was given at that time.",0,negative_samples

"I started ADHD meds just a couple months ago, after taking wellbutrin for a few months. My doctor immediately went straight to adderall, and it worked great for me- after I finally found it that is, after calling almost a dozen different places for it. I decided I didn't want to fight that battle again and wasn't confident the pharmacy that I got my first prescription from would be able to fill it again, so I asked my doctor to switch. Well, he put me on ritalin, but the dosage was wearing off halfway through the day, so he switched it to a low dose of concerta. Well, shocker, the pharmacies do not have that either. I am almost out of the ritalin and doctor is out until Wednesday, plus I don't even know if he will write me a new prescription to go back to ritalin before my next appointment. I have some wellbutrin left over but it doesn't work the same obviously, so I'm back to being spacey, brain fogged, and forgetful with no motivation.

"So talk about being paranoid and super distrustful. 
When my sons mother and I first got together (2011 She was 18 and I was 19.)  I was a HUGE pothead and she wasn't so much. She would partake once in awhile but that's about it. 

Then one day out of the blue she asked me to stop smoking and I said I would, and did for the most part. Until one point I had went to pick up some of my stuff outta storage with her brother, and on the way he asked if I wanted to smoke and  said sure. Tried to hide the fact I was high and not doing it so well.

 Well we had a huge blowout and she told me to leave so I left. I didn't have a car so I started walking home. Well she picked me up about 15 min later and told me it was her or pot and I chose her.

 Jump forward 5 years later we broke up 2 years prior and I just started smoking again. Jumping forward to present day, her attitude about it has completely changed and we smoke together and I even pick her up carts.

"Hi everyone --

I'm wondering if anyone else here suffers from Hyperstimulation Anxiety?

I've always been a somewhat anxious individual since I was a teenager (due to pretty low self esteem/social awkwardness).

When I turned 21 (I'm 40 now!!) after several stressful days and poor sleep my nervous system became hypersensitive to everything and has never calmed down.

It basically boils down to symptoms of nervous system and sensory hypersensitivity. It's just perpetual discomfort on a daily basis. I already exercise, eat as healthy as I can, do regular deep breathing, etc. 

I try my best to avoid any excess stress but because of how overreactive my nervous system is, any miniscule stress ( like temp changes for instance ) acts like a major stressor.

I've been started on Zoloft 50mg (I've tried Paxil, Effexor, and Celexa in the past) so I'm hoping maybe it will help.

To those that have experienced this, was there any ways to finally calm and insanely sensitive nervous system?

"Tw: Self harm, Bad language, Bad Therapists, Schizophrenia stuff

I got a new therapist/counselor recently. The main take away from my first session was ""Look at the positive."" What positive? I'm here trying to figure out why I'm seeing, hearing, and even tasting shit that isn't real, why I can't bring myself to do anything, and why I isolated myself for 2 months in college for no reason. I spend my days going to work and doing self harm because I'm bored and too terrified to sleep because there is something in the dark sent after me that might kill me.

The last one I had was one of the school ones. I wrote Help Me on my arms. I say wrote, but I think cut is a better word considering how I wrote it. I put clothes in my backpack so that they could just send me to a mental hospital and I would get help. She didn't seem to care about the harm, although I never showed her the cuts. She then made me fixate on the hallucinations that occur when you are falling asleep or waking up which is a normal thing to happen. When I realized that, I stopped seeing her. After a while, the real hallucinations started happening. 

I hate this. I hate searching for hours trying to find someone to help only to get the inexperienced ""positive thinkers"" who don't seem to grasp the severity of the shit I'm going through despite the fact that I tell them.",6,schizophrenia

"So I am not the one suffering from schizophrenia, but I am thinking my husband may.  My husband has been having paranoid delusions that have just gotten a lot worse this past year. Years back when we first got together there would be things he would say that would make me think something was going on with him mentally, some examples were that my mom was putting cameras or listening devices in our room, that she put a mic in our air purifier, that my mom was poisoning his food, he is severely disabled and so he had to use a commode in our room and he was adamant that when he would use it that my mom would be against the wall listening to him. Fast forward to the present, we have moved out of state and I thought that it was just because of my mom because she was the only thing that triggered it. Well now it’s the upstairs neighbors. About 8 months ago he started believing that they were drilling into the ceiling to put cameras in the ceiling, made me check the vents because he wanted to make sure no one put cameras in it, he wants to get rid of the microwave because he’s thinking there’s a bug in it. So those neighbors moved out and now a new neighbor moved in and now it’s this guy who’s “harassing” us. He says that the upstairs neighbor was following him because he could hear the footsteps wherever he walked. We were praying together the other night and he was sure that he heard the upstairs neighbor laughing at us while we were praying and that he was laughing like his mom. His mom died like 4 years ago or so. So I asked him how would that be possible because she died years back and he just said that they could have seen a video that his ex took of him from like 20 years ago. He’s also feeling these vibrations that I do not feel at all. He claims that someone is doing it on purpose. 

So I get home from work today and right next to the bed was our 9mm. He has never been violent or anything, but to see it out makes me nervous. I’m in a tough spot because he says I don’t fight for him or do more but I’m not going to call the cops on a neighbor who’s walking hard. I have no idea what to do. He tells me I’m not compassionate and all that. I get it because he really believes that this is going on but it’s not. There a lot more instances but it’s just too much to write.   I tried in the past the best I could to tell him that I’m not experiencing what he is and he got upset with me. I feel so lost and I feel bad that I cannot help him. Any advice would be wonderful!

"Hello,

I (30M) am finally making the move towards serious ADHD treatment after enduring a horrifically severe bout of depression, anxiety and insomnia over the past winter.  Thanks to Paxil, Mirtazapine, and therapy, I am in a MUCH better place than I was, but still suspect that the bulk of those issues may have been rooted in my ADHD brain's inability to slow down and get itself together.

I was diagnosed with ADHD/executive dysfunction when I was 13, as I really struggled to concentrate in class, get assignments done, etc.  This never went away in my adulthood, affecting my work and innumerable other factors in my life.  

**The biggest symptom I'm trying to address is the constant racing thoughts and inner chatter**, which although I've learned to somewhat manage it on its own, can quickly become a nightmare spiral when combined with anxiety.  Thus leading to the unspeakably horrible insomnia I faced over the winter.

A few weeks ago my psychiatrist assessed and re-diagnosed me with ADHD, and prescribed 15mg Focalin XR.  The first day I took it, it only felt like a slight energy boost, like I'd drank a lot of coffee, but not much else.  The second day was similar, except this time I drank caffeine a little later in the day (one cup of matcha tea, but still a stupid choice probably) and was still wide awake by bedtime, which triggered an ugly anxiety spiral in me, but I ultimately was able to fall asleep fine later in the night.

This experience scared me off from taking it again, so my psych then prescribed me Vyvanse 30mg to try instead.  I'm currently on day 7 of that but unfortunately it's the same general feeling of drinking a lot of coffee, feeling energized and slightly jittery, but very little improvement to my ability to focus and quiet my mind.

I guess the ultimate question I have is: **if I'm feeling these physical effects, but no real effect on my actual inattentive ADHD symptoms, am I on too high a dose, too low a dose, or the wrong type of meds for me?**  

I've searched reddit far and wide but can't seem to find anyone with a similar situation as mine.  It's honestly making me doubt myself and whether or not I even have ADHD, despite checking all the boxes for inattentive type, and being diagnosed in both childhood and adulthood.  Any advice, anecdotes, whatever would be hugely appreciated!",3,adhd

I have been seeing the same number constantly for a long stretch of months. I try to calm myself down by telling myself it's just a coincidence but I know its not a coincidence anymore. I believe in angel numbers. im too scared to type out the number because I feel like I might manifest it or someone I know will realize its me, but basically its two digits and I see it-- EVERYWHERE. it is not a coincidence, I understand I should rationalize it but I know that what I am experiencing is not a coincidence, it is real. I'll use XX to represent the number. I check my phone at the same increments of time-- 10:XX, 8:XX, 3:XX, a lot of times in order too, 5:XX, 6:XX, 7:XX, 8:XX, EVERY HOUR IN A ROW like that, and im not on my phone checking the time either, ill go downstairs, come back up and bam, 8:XX. my mom will say ""hey can u tell me what time it is,"" I check, its 4:XX. this is just the tip of the ice berg. ive recently started to get a sixth sense like sensation when im around the number. ill get a hunch, a feeling or sensation like ""If I look behind this paper theres going to be XX on it"" and there it will be, I get a feeling ""somethings telling me XX is to the left of my screen, I look and the video im watching was uploading jan XX or whatever, this is not a ""once a day"" type thing either mind you, this is constantly. CONSTANTLY. as in this number thing has taken over my life, essentially. im afraid that the XX is warning me of an approaching death, because I try to keep track of what I am thinking of or what the XX is next to when I see it and the signs are pointing to either me or my family member/members dying. I went on a YouTube live stream of my favorite tarot reader and asked her to clarify what XX meant. she said its going to be a massive change, ""like a door slamming."" this sounds very frightening, not the change part, but the door slamming part. that can't. be good. I pause a video. its landed on XX. I randomly get a feeling to search a celebs birthday, because somethings telling me they were born on XX, I search and they're born on that day. all of these little details are happening to me day in and day out. im aware it sounds crazy and I hate it because its literally driving me crazy. trust me, I literally try to rationalize with myself ""just ignore it, you're probably looking for it now and now you're gonna notice it more."" I search my problem on google--- ""paranoia about a number that I keep seeing"" the post I click on, the person lists their age and its XX and then... to my ABSOLUTE dismay and horror... I go to the comments and there are XX COMMENTS....... I wish I was making this up, but im not, and because of things like this, no one can convince me this is all just one big coincidence. what's worse is I tell myself ""if I see XX within the next minute, it means \*insert bad thing, like someone I know or me Is going to die\*"" and then within the minute ill see XX, or like today I was interacting with a loved one and they go ""look, its XX!"" and point to a box that MYSTERIOUSLY has the number XX printed GIGANTICALLY on its label, instead of literally any other number??? so then im like shit, if they're pointing it out, it must pertain to them... and my astrology chart said this next year there might be a car accident and that loved one has to go somewhere they've never been before tomorrow and im so scared im just so scared. I feel like something really bad is gonna happen. and I know the way ive typed this out all ramble-y makes me sound neurotic, I just hope y'all believe im self aware of that LMFAO... please, theres no WAY this can be a coincidence, I didn't even reach the tip of the iceberg of all the times I see XX and sense its presence, Is this is a spiritual thing or am I paranoid, please help and thank you SO, so much

My mom and brother are both schizophrenic. They are not willing to get any help nor take any medicine, they have been prescribed but refused. They don’t think anything is wrong with them. I live in a small city and none of the facilities will keep them longer than 72 hours. 

I recently got my own apartment. My mom stays with her boyfriend, It’s hell over there because my brother is extremely destructive and constantly tries to fight her boyfriend, he has put them out many times. So her last resort is obviously me, I stay in a small 1bedroom which means they’ll have to sleep in my living room, which also means, I can’t have company over nor enjoy my own privacy. My brother also leaves in & out, they argue all day, nosey, can be loud, etc. I’m a CNA who works 12hr shifts sometimes 16, and when I get off I just wanna rest in my..not deal with extra bullshit. I wanna invite whoever over , walk around naked, stay up as late as I want, etc ..

On top of that, my sister has 2 kids that my mother watches which means If they move in with me, that’ll be 4 people I have to watch after because my big sister can not get her own place ..her credit is messed up and no apartments will approve her.

I’m the youngest with no kids and I feel like I’m a parent . What should I do? I don’t wanna give up on them but I’m tired of tryninh to help people

"I'm a third year, computer science student. Last summer (2022), all I ever wanted was to get an internship this summer(2023). I felt like a failure and the weight of not getting an internship loomed over me, as my brother had gotten an internship when he was in my year. It also didn't help, that I was checking linkedin and feeling sad as my other classmates had internships that summer. Everytime I thought about the fact of not getting am internship my heart would start beating so fast, I had to calm myself many times doing breathing exercises.

Fast forward to now. I got an internship as a software developer, if I were to tell myself this last summer I would be ecstatic, thinking, god has finally heard me. Now, don't get me wrong I am grateful for being able to get an internship, I know the feeling of thinking it's not possible. But, as I've gotten it, I thought my life would be complete in terms of the summer but clearly I feel the opposite. It's funny because as of right now in terms of work - it's pretty light. The guidance/mentorship in the internship lacks but that's pretty much it. What's getting to me is, the future. Even after my work is done I think of what might come tomorrow - What if they give me something big to do? What if I don't know how to do it at all? What if I won't get the help I want? What if it's really hard? All these questions + probably million more follow me like a cloud as soon as I close my laptop and until I open it the next day.

"So my sisters used to spend their money on expensive alcoholic drinks during parties every weekend. My dad was like that too as a teen.

And I? I don’t drink alcohol, don’t go to parties, I almost never wear makeup (and the makeup I have is multiple years old lol), I can’t handle most skin products because my skin irritates very easily so I just gave up trying (I only clean my face with cold water now) and I don’t like spending a lot of money on food. But I buy one figurine of $600 and I get lectured? My dad got really mad at me. Like seriously?

"I swear.... Most people seem to think autism is only the caricature that you see on TV. This is harmful because it prevents people from being diagnosed and understanding their needs and limits. Even with diagnosis, people and workplaces do not understand how to truly accommodate for you because they dont know what they are accomodating for.

Personal anecdote relating to the situation: last night, I was approached by an old neighbor of mine. She told me a story about one time when I was a small kid, I was repeating one ""inappropriate"" (but harmless) word over and over. People said it wasn't appropriate, and I wasn't phased. I kept repeating it. I want to stress that I didn't get in trouble for this as I was just having a potty mouth, not harming anyone. (There were COUNTLESS incidents of me saying things that shocked adults or were ""too honest"" as a kid... looking back I now clearly see this was my autism.)  I explained this revelation to her and she said, ""OH, the fact that you can even SAY that you have autism means you aren't autistic.""
LIKE, WHAT????? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?????!?! And her POV seems to represent the public. Even therapists aren't really educated on autism. Even I wasn't until a few years back, because the information wasn't presented to me until I found resources online that made everything make sense.

It would've made my life so much more liveable if the information had been presented to me sooner. It would make my life so much more liveable if I weren't discriminated against in the workplace, advocating for my needs during the interview process. It would save my life to make a liveable wage on hours that don't cause burnout. But society isn't ready for that conversation. :/

"17M - i know most of whoever sees this will feel the same or at least understand when i say that i'm gonna sound silly. at this point i don't know if it's a delusion or fact because it damn well could be fact, but there's still the paranoia of detectives/private investigators/police after me. i will admit i'm not the most golden law-abiding citizen out there. so far:

i'm suspicious of cars, people in shopping centres, any persons in vehicles, and i don't leave my room unless i'm about to piss myself and/or everyone else is asleep. the paranoia is concerning me.

12/13th April ~6pm. two cars (isuzu and... toyota, maybe) with tinted windows were parked along the road when i was walking on the side of a bushland surrounded road headed to my estate (suburbs). from both cars i got the vibe of being watched/taken photos of. one of them on my side of the road and parked close enough to the sidewalk that i could read the licence plate. as soon as i was perpendicular to the car it drove off. then when i got into my estate a police car was driving by the school near my house. that's what the last straw was for me.

and just tonight there was a police helicopter (VH-WAH POL61 western australian police force) that came all the way from the city just to circle twice around near where i live. like they traced a nutsack and went back to the city. when i looked up to it, it's flashing light held still as if to signify they knew i was watching them from the crack in my bedroom blinds. i swear, that's proof enough.

i feel this may be the start of a decline and i have absolutely nobody. 0 (zero) friends, mother is a bad person to me, can't talk to my sisters, father will think i'm crazy. i'm fucking lost.

"I'd like to apologize in advance if my post title was bad. I am not good at titles and I noticed some of my posts in other communities get downvoted so much all because the title isn't up to standards of really picky people.


I made a simple post on my local subreddit today with the title that our local movie theater fucked up big time. I wanted to treat myself and just watch a movie solo (which I'm usually to afraid to do) so I bought my ticket a week in advance and got all mentally prepared and went there only to find out it was closed. I saw a couple families with kids also looking really sad or angry because come on, some families don't get many opportunities to get together and do leisure activities like this. Everyone clearly had already purchased tickets beforehand and we weren't given any specifics on how we'd be refunded. This, of course made me a bit emotional, not because my plans were botched, but because I witnessed others looking pretty upset.


I also made that post as a way to inform other locals not to go to that theater in case they also bought tickets prior.


Post got downvoted and comments were basically telling me to stop whining or making it such a big deal just because I couldn't watch a movie (because my title said the theater fucked up big time). In hindsight yes, I should have titled it ""FYI So and so theater is closed today. You will be refunded if you bought tickets in advance"" but I am naturally an emotional person and seeing those families walk away sadly like that made me upset for them too.


The whole point of my post HERE is because this is the only safe space I feel like I can vent about this to. I know it's trivial, but there are just so many redditors in other communities who have huge sticks up their asses and feel the need to put others down when no one has outright attacked or harmed anyone in the first place. I'm so sick of it and probably will quit reddit altogether for a bit. Of course I also immediately deleted my post in that other subreddit and unsubbed too. Fed up with the locals here being such assholes to others over nothing.


Edit: Please replace ""RSD"" from my title to just ""Rejection sensitivity"" or ""Emotional dysregulation"". I am really fighting to not delete my post in fear of downvotes again. I had no idea RSD was something that was overused or that there was so much miscommunication with it until now.


Edit 2: Thank you all for your support, validation, and sharing your own personal experiences here. I've been reading every comment and it helped me not feel so alone. I hope that those of you who struggle with rejection sensitivity find healthy ways to cope and get the help they need.

"Hi from Germany! 
I have negative thoughts all day long. 
When I have a very (paranoid) episode, I am completely convinced that someone has all information about me and is spreading it. In 2014 I lost my smartphone and when I got it back all the pictures were gone. At that time I was already struggling with negative thoughts about other things and was very suspicious of my surroundings.
Strangely enough, in 2014 I didn't have any obsessive thoughts after my smartphone disappeared. In the meantime, however, I think about it all day long. I think in all situations that people have private information about me. When people around me laugh, I think that they are talking about me.
But not only that, I also have other (paranoid) thoughts that keep coming from time to time. In the meantime I also suspect that former friends want to harm me.
When I am in a bad phase, I also look for evidence and spend a lot of time with it. So for all my negative thoughts I find evidence if I search.
At the beginning I thought that only my pictures were stolen. Meanwhile I think that they have synchronized my Google account or installed a spy app. 

Finally, I can say that since 2014 it has never happened that a picture or something similar was ""published"" about me.
The only thing I feel is that since 2016, I have been treated extremely unfairly in my work. For this I also have concrete facts. I do not have a plausible reason for this. Therefore, I can only speculate.
Physically, the compulsive brooding costs me a lot of strength.
Especially when I have an (paranoid) episode, then I can not sleep, have to throw up and feel extreme restlessness. I have realized that I have to change something.

My glucose was trending high while swimming and after multiple doses, I noticed the adhesive part was lifting off on one side so I decided to stop swimming and dry off and find some tape.

Id had fries with lunch so I assumed it was just a stubborn high. In the next two hours I dosed repeatedly trying to bring down my blood sugar from its high reading. Eventually it was too weird that it wouldn’t budge at all and I checked against the finger stick which read 100+ points lower than the sensor reading. 

With my sensor only three days old, I kept trying to calibrate it lower for over an hour and testing against the meter. It kept popping back up as 100+ over the meter. I’m lucky I caught it before I dosed myself way too dangerously. I suspended basal for two hours to let the existing doses finish their work.
