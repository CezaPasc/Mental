Started antipsychotics again and need some positive stories,"I just started taking antipsychotics (Haldol) after a lot of serious psychotic breaks I’ve had the last couple months. 

Two years ago I had my first psychotic break which scared me so much I started antipsychotics (Olanzapine) almost immediately. The symptoms went away mostly but the side effects were a bitch. I gained 15 kilo’s, slept all day and I couldn’t even feel close to the people I love most. I took them for one year and started slowly getting off of them under supervision.

So the past few months I tried to tell myself that I could handle all the psychotic breaks I’ve had and I’ll be okay. Starting antipsychotics would be the last thing I wanted to do.

I just started taking Haldol. In only two days I started to see benefits already. My memory started to get a bit better and self care started to get effortless almost. 

But I’m still very scared of the side effects that could occur. I’m terrified of gaining weight (I most likely would also have an eating disorder) and loosing interest in everything and everyone. 

All the experiences I read here about antipsychotics are negative (which I get) but I also want to get better and try to stay on my medication. I’ve tried these meds before and convinced myself and my psychiatrist I didn’t need them.

So long story short I came here to ask for advice and for some personal positive stories on antipsychotics and/or haldol.",1
i lost my ego because the voices are constantly being too critical towards me,"i have always had voices mocking, insulting, & being harsh towards me. i can't go on for an hour without getting criticized to hell. 2 seconds after i wake up, & as im transitioning into the awakened state, im greeted with these voices reminding me of how much of a \[xxxxx\] & \[xxxxx\] & \[xxxxx\] i am. don't wanna write any examples since i'll break reddit tos. 

i feel like i have lost my ego entirely due to what i hear. 2018 was even worse, my psychosis during that period was very strong. not sure if i became too numb to this. i feel like i really deserve nothing physical/materialistic or emotional. i feel like i don't deserve my organs, two lungs? two kidneys? two eyes? that's too much for me. Sometimes i look at my legs or arms and have a hard time at accepting that these belong to 'me'??? they're too big. i wonder how much they weigh. 

i feel like an object, or rarely if im feel like im worth little more than that, i'm a primate/monkey, i often refer to people as humans because they're just one step above me.",1
Helplessness in life,"First of all I want to excuse for my english, I am not native nor do i have much practice in speaking english, but I will to be my beste with the help of some translator.

I have been diagnosed with paranoid and hebephren Schizophrenia when I was 14 years old. Got treatment when I was 17. During these 3 years I was most of the time alone in my parents house - dont ask, I dont know why I didnt get any treatment... Anyway, as you can imagine these years were not pleasant.

I feel like that I am basically helpless and I wonder what to do. I am around 30  years old and currently studying Computer Science, not very succesfull. I dont have a single friend, nor did I have friends in the past 15 years, maybe more... My living situation is secured, yet I have this deep feeling of hopelessness and that nothing makes any sense. I dont feel joy or have anything to do besides my studys. 

In total I dont have much courage to change anything, mainly because the ""ghosts of my past"" still haunt me to some degree. I have these memories from the paranoid years... they are like dialogs with people from my past, I argue with them in my mind. They question me and I oppose it. Which is really exhausting and it angers me. Every day feels like fighting.

I just dont know how I could change anything about my situation. around 15 years of CBT, many selfhelp books and medication didnt change much. I don't get the feeling that these therapists were listening nor that anything will ever change.

Maybe someone wants to share thoughts on this. I am quite sure that it isnt only me and would love to hear something on how to go on from this point in life.",1
10 historical figures who are known to have experienced auditory hallucinations or claimed to have heard voices. Easily diagnosed with schozophrenia by most standards. NEVER doubt your true potential.,"Here are 10 historical figures who are known to have experienced auditory hallucinations or claimed to have heard voices:

2. Socrates: The ancient Greek philosopher spoke of a divine inner voice, which he referred to as his ""daimonion"" or ""daemon,"" guiding him and warning him against certain actions.
3. Vincent van Gogh: The renowned Dutch painter experienced mental health issues and is said to have heard voices during periods of emotional turmoil.
4. Sigmund Freud: The founder of psychoanalysis wrote about his experiences of hearing inner voices, which he attributed to his own thoughts and subconscious processes.

Should I tell this girl I've been talking to about my dianosis?,"I'm afraid I'll lose her. I told her about my sleeping problems  and about my anxiety and depression but not schizophrenia. She thinks my sleeping problems are from using too many electronics. I told her it was from my mental illnesses. Should I wait until it gets more serious cause right now we have only been talking for about 3 weeks. If I tell her, how should I do it.",1
Found a cure for my schizophrenia,"I stumbled across it by accident, by studying chemistry and maths. Studying chemistry and maths forced me to implement an evidence based belief system in my everyday life. Implementing an evidence based system (and consistent 7-8 hours of sleep per night) is the key. Now when I get a delusional thought, I ask “is there any evidence to support this thought?” If there is no evidence for the delusional thought, I say it does not qualify to become a belief. This sounds simple, because it is, but it is a full time job, asking every delusional thought if there is evidence for the delusional thought’s claim. It requires effort everyday, it requires an adequate amount of sleep, it requires a solid daily routine. Consistent sleep, consistent routine and an evidence based belief system is not an easy thing to implement if you don’t currently have it implemented, it was a 3 year process for me. I’ve been a diagnosed schizophrenic for 10 years, many psychiatric unit admissions. Also, if you are still taking drugs (weed, alcohol, mdma etc), forget about it. Curing schizophrenia requires you to order your life, order your sleep, no drugs, practice an evidence based belief system until it is engrained in you (took over a year of daily chemistry study for this to happen for me). It’s not an easy life change, but nothing worth having is easy. I’m now 2 years antipsychotic medication free, my own flat, loving life. I offer you this simple to follow but hard solution as an offering as I know it works through experimentation. Psychosis free for the last 2 years, while the prior 8 years were full of psychosis. Getting your life in order is the key, it takes a lot of work and effort. If you can’t muster the work and effort, this is not a solution for you, and that is the harsh reality. But you can muster the effort out of will, so it’s a matter of how badly you want a schizophrenic free life. Again, a tried and tested method, so if you want to whine, save it, I know it works and this is for people looking for a solution, not for people who sulk, whine and pity themselves. So to any hard workers out there, here you go, a tried and tested method of curing your schizophrenia. To reiterate, if you still take recreational drugs, don’t waste your time with this method",1

Has anyone else heard voices in public?,"For instance while walking by a girl while shopping the other day I heard “where are your earbuds” and then she and her friends laughed.

Is there anything at all I can do to prevent myself from developing this disorder? I have early symptoms and my dad was schizophrenic. I have risk factors too.,"Hi, so, Im not going to go into detail, and I am going to talk to my doctor like, ASAP. But sometimes they dismiss these things so I want to know what you think. 

Again if I go into it it'll become a whole vent, I already wrote one out and deleted it. But I seem to have a lot of risk factors for schizophrenia. I already experience psychosis, paranoia and negative symptoms. But I don't think it's fully developed. 

But I show so many early signs of schizophrenia, I have extreme fear about unlikely things, I have a lot of the risk factors for it including high stress, and my dad had schizophrenia, and died from it. Unfortunately we are very similar. Since he died I've been going in the same direction he did, it's quite scary. 

I'm terrified of developing this, because I'm extremely scared, of fear. And I feel a lot of it. I wouldn't be able to handle it. I already have no grip on reality. I already can't tell between reality and imagination. 

I just want to know what I can do now to prevent this from developing. I'm already on antipsychotic medication and it keeps me alive but it doesn't stop all of it. I'm on a low dose but any higher and the side effects just about kill me. 

What can I do? I know I may need to make medication changes but please, other than that? I'm going to ask my doctor but do you know how I can prevent this?",1

What happens if your misdiagnosed with schizophrenia,"I think I was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. I have a history of amphetamine abuse (soft versions of it like adderall) and I think that the doctor did not take this into consideration when he prescribed me paliperidone. I went into hospital after a drug induced bout of psychosis that involved delusions that I could not get rid of and was given paliperidone and about 3 weeks after the psychosis ended. I have stopped using all substances but am still on paliperidone and everyone in my life wants me to continue… The thing is I have only ever had psychosis as a result of drug use and sleep deprivation from drug use. I don’t know what to do. They really will not accept this, nor will the doctor.",1

PTSD from becoming homeless and losing everything during psychosis,"I have PTSD from my psychosis experience. I stopped leaving my house and working until I was evicted and 3 weeks up until I was evicted I had no money to pay my electricity so I was without power and in the dark for 3 weeks leading up to the eviction and ran out of money for food 6 weeks up until the eviction, I don't even know how I survived. I was eventually hospitalized and diagnosed with schizophrenia and finally out of psychosis now living with family but I can't stop thinking about what happened to me and how fast I declined. I feel so bad for my poor dog and cat who always had food but it was traumatic especially finally getting evicted with cops literally kicking my ass out. For 2 days I slept in a bathroom and then went home to family. I haven't told anyone in my family just how bad it was with the no power etc but I can't stop thinking about it. The whole time I thought I was on a special mission from God / discovered aliens and this was just a part of it, now I'm out of it and literally scarred for life. I look back and don't even know how I am alive. I was normal and doing so well, just bought a new car etc (of course got reposseed 6 weeks prior to eviction). What's really scary too is that I thought this was all normal and part of it, thank God I went to family because I was this close to being on the streets. I'm haunted by these memories",1

Please help me get through this,"My sister is 30 and was just diagnosed with schizophrenia. My family and I always thought she suffered from depression and anxiety but she never sought help and when we tried to intervene she refused and would always do something that showed she was getting help on her own such as going to a therapist whenever we begged her. Other than that she functioned normally (or pretended to at least).

She went through a psychotic break two weeks ago and had to go to the hospital in which she finally went to psychiatric care. When we found out her diagnosis it was a shock and now none of us really know how to help her. Schizophrenia doesn’t run in our family so this is really new to us and we are trying to do our best to help her with the voices in her head she talks about.

She was recently discharged with medicine for her thyroid problems, zoloft, and risperidone. It’s only been three days but every night she still starts to hear voices around 5pm and at 8pm is when she begins to lash out and believes people are talking bad about her or lying to her. These voices are always negative. 

Please give me some advice I can give to my family. I live three thousand miles away so it’s hard knowing that I have no answers for them. I am trying to see if I can contact the doctor personally about her medicine. 

In your experiences how long before your medicine started to work? With medicine do you still hear voices in your head? Do they stay negative or do they ever become positive? What is the best approach to someone who believes everyone around them is lying? 

Any and all advice or even personal stories can help and will be appreciated. I am just trying to make sense of all this so I can better help my sister.",1
Mean Neigbours," I've suffered most of my life with low self-esteem and issues with my voice and how I sound (I perceive myself to have an annoying-sounding voice)  
I share a wall with my neighbour and sometimes we hear each other. However, I hear my neighbour complaining about me.   
Unfortunately, I suffer from depression and low mood - I sometimes can get somewhat anxious and scared even at home, and I react by trying to be quiet and speaking as quietly as possible. But this doesn't work!! My neighbours then, in turn, think that because im timid/quiet I Im acting like that because they think that, I, think like they (neighbours) are spying on me.    
For the record, I dont think that my neighbours are spying or listening to my conversations but I do suffer from low self-esteem and depression so when I do talk I get nervous about receiving criticism about my annoying sounding voice.   
Its energy-sapping, having to tiptoe around my house just because Im living next door to neighbours who dont like me. I'm already depressed but it feels like being kicked when im down.  Im too poor to move but wish I could.  


TLDR  
Its like im stuck in a catch-22 situation. If I talk in my normal voice because of my thin walls my neighbours hear me and always make mocking comments or angry comments about how they hate living near me regardless of whether loud or quiet, confident or shy, happy or sad.",1

Those with partners I have a question?,"Hey,

For those of you with significant others how do you manage?

My SO seems minimally interested in my mental health as long as outwardly I can keep things together and keep working etc. Ive brought up a few times recently that Im not feeling the best and the conversation just kind of gets changed. This is pretty hard as Im scared of opening up to her to begin with for fear of how she will respond.

So I have some coworkers I can talk to about some of my mental health without judgement - and I do talk to them about it. But it makes me feel incredibly guilty because I feel like Im not being open with my wife.

And then it becomes problematic because I worry that my wife is spying on my conversations and knows that Im talking about my mental health with others.. and Im just waiting for the other shoe to drop essentially. I worry a fair amount she has hacked my phone and that there is going to be some repercussion when she reveals that she knows. 

In some regards this is okay because she then knows what Im talking about and hasnt gotten scared or worried.. but on the other hand I wonder if this is why she seems more irritable? Or am I just perceiving irritability and shes just actually her normal self?

Like has she actually hacked me and knows everything- rationally not.. but its hard to slow down that spiral of thoughts that she has. I guess I worry that she would be hurt if she knew that I talked with others about some of my symptoms - and not her.. even though she really seems to avoid those conversations. Makes me feel like a shitty partner, but I know bottling all of my weird thoughts up inside is not good for me either.",1
journaling for psych appointment,"does anybody keep a journal/diary to track their symptoms? if so, how do you go about it and would you say that it’s beneficial?

I have an appointment with a psychotherapist at the end of june and am writing notes so I don’t forget to mention anything important. my doctor has advised I also put together a timeline of any hallucinations/delusions I’ve experienced in the past until now, which sounded like a good idea until I actually sat down to do it. I didn’t realise how upsetting it’d be to write it all out. 

I feel dishonest and guilty – I don’t fully believe my ‘delusions’ are that at all, I’m just using the term because it’s the same medical jargon the doctors use. but it’s confusing because some of the earlier ‘delusions’ I *can* recognise as being ridiculous, even though I was fully convinced they were true at the time. same goes for the hallucinations.

How to understand schizophrenia and people with it as a nonschizophrenic?,"As a nonschizophrenic, I don't know much about schizophrenia except the stereotypes, therefore I would like to ask a few questions.

Now for the questions themselves:

Is it constant or does it happen in, (for lack of better words) episodes?

What is it like and how does it feel to have one of these ""episodes""?

Is the whole thing about hearing voices real or just an over-exaggeration and if it is are the voices your own or are they different?

How hard is it to live with schizophrenia? 

What's the worst or best part of it(if there even are positives)?

Is there anything I shouldn't do/say around someone with schizophrenia that could trigger some kind of episode (if that's even how it works) or would be offensive?

How can I best support someone with schizophrenia? (I never met anyone that had it so I don't know)

Bruh why does god hate me," Im gonna have to wait six months for a consultation with a pscyhiatrist. Why the fuck was i born both a schizo and in a third world country? Six months for sommething that is absolutely necessary and urgent, and its six months with private health insurance, if i didnt have it i wouldnt even get to see a psychiatrist. I hate it here.",1
"I have no clue how to even title this. I ""lost"" a lot of important stuff","I see a therapist frequently. recently, trying to make sense of my condition after a diagnosis, my therapist asked for full disclosure. Issue is, i have a bad memory and a lot of the things I imagine are important leave me by the time i speak to her or by the time I feel more normal. 

I'm not a great writer but I am good at following instructions and strict formats. This makes essays and essay planning a really nice way for me to organize, visualize, and remember my thoughts. I took to my notebook to write down things I thought, saw, heard, felt, or theorized about. I remember writing pages and pages of either semi-fleshed out thoughts and bullet points. its been about two weeks since i last opened that book because last time i saw it i felt incredible dread that my own blood would be inside that book and i didn't want it to trigger anything. I decided to look at what I had written today since I felt i was at the point of forgetting. 

Reading what I wrote was honestly more cathartic and stressful than entertaining my fears of whatever could have been in the notebook. Where I had expected ramblings and point form notes of my emotions and day-to-day, I found a lot of writing that was either irrelevant or half done (without even mentioning syntax and grammar). I can't even tell what i remember. There were ramblings for sure but they read more like short stories from a middle schooler with too much time to think. There were point form notes but of memories such as a man speaking to me and his stern eyes. Even the notebook I held as i was reading this was not the one I remember holding while writing; I have no other notebooks i would have used.

I cant help but feel helpless and somewhat afraid. even ashamed of being irresponsible. I cant even tell what's going on. ive been told one thing by a doctor but even here i struggle to identify what i can relate to and cant. I cant even tell if ive had an episode or if this is a rumbling before something much worse or if there is any value to this because I dont even know if this is a thing that happens or something else im gonna have to improvise on.",1
Tired and afraid,"I've been diagnosed with schizo affective disorder back in 2019, ended up going on Abilify depo shots for a bit but after some time began to think maybe I was just going through psychosis and had finally managed to climb outta that pit and start my life fresh and with better understanding. Unfortunately I moved with a trusted ""friend"" out of the city I grew up from and to an isolated area with some other people that gave me solid actual reasons to be scared.(we'd have a ""friend"" of a roommate come by often and was going to prison for drug dealing) but had been telling myself whatever I'm hearing was probably just in my head. After a few months things weren't working out which led me to be more  mentally drained and delusional so I moved back to the city I grew up hoping to restart again and moved into a co-op where another friend has been living and have had a few mental breakdowns while.living with him. Over time I've isolated myself, and cut ties with a lot of friend groups. I've lost a fair grip on reality sometimes when I try to figure out if it's my next door neighbors or if it's in my head, more often than not I'll respond verbally which don't know if that helps anymore. It's getting harder for me to figure out if it's my head or just the neighbors but I feel like the community is scared of me which doesn't really help either. Paranoia has increased as well with a legitimate fear with my past working in the grey market but I know that, that sometimes just has me spiralling. Ive gotten myself stuck in a cycle of be stubborn and scared. Scared that I'm really losing it but stubborn with telling myself I can push through this but going back to being scared thinking that I'm just making things worse for not just myself but everyone around me.",1
Con't abuse I posted about ppl breaking into our house,"I'm not f*cking s*upid and gaslighting me and psychologically abusing me and emotionally abusing me won't work.

"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.","Almost two years later and I still can't make sense of it. I don't see how it's me.

For 29 years, I had no mental health issues. Then, in September 2021, I had a vision of a man sitting behind a desk giving me an evil grin. I told him to go away and a voice told me that I shouldn't have done that. He went away.

I received a notification on my phone of a friend request for Snapchat. It didn't look right. It was malicious and installed some type of program on my phone to mirror my phone. I have pictures if you're interested. The viewers had Instant Apps downloaded on their phones where they could watch me. Note: the program author is Google Play Store. Real Google Apps are signed by Google, LLC.

After verifying that people were watching me, I deleted Snapchat and reported it. A day later, I started getting these weird energy attacks in the left side of my head that was inducting intrusive thoughts. It went on for a month before I went to the Emergency Room.

My parents were in the room. I told the doctor what was going on, but he was visibly angry. It seems possessed. I said whoever did this I forgive him. He got really angry at that and asked my mom to come with him. The doctor instructed my mom to call crisis to initiate an involuntary hold. The crisis team said there were no grounds. **That's when the doctor took the phone from my mom and said I was homicidal. It even says in the notes, Mom failed to mention homicidal ideations. I never said anything homicidal.**  So I was involuntarily admitted. The energy attacks and intrusive thoughts stopped immediately.

After 9 days, I got out and took the medicine for two months and then decided to quit cold turkey. Things were fine for two months after I quit and then the weirdness started. One honorable mention was a false call to the police that I was saying disturbing things to a bus driver. **Not true.** Some time after that I had a weird shock to the heart and I called home to let them know I felt like I was having a heart attack. When I got home, I was involuntarily admitted again because my mom heard me say on the phone I wanted to drive off a bridge. **She might of heard it, but I know I didn't say it.**

I've been on medicine for over a year and cars aren't tailing me, false reports aren't being made about me, no one hearing things I didn't say. It's more than brain chemicals.",1

Its the best thing, but i have been taking care of her since i was eight, i spent half of my life hanging out with that dog, so it really fucking sucks that i have to do this, but its in her best interest.

Two Schizos dating each other?," Hey everyone. I have been active on the psychosis sub Reddit, but never posted on here before, because I was only recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Then they changed it to bipolar with schizoaffective features. I have been in the hospital three times because of psychosis. But this last time, I met someone. He is amazing And my best friend. We fell in love really quickly in the hospital, and it is only escalated now that we are out in the real world. However, his psychosis doesn’t seem to have gone away yet. And his parents are saying that he isn’t on the right medication. He is out of work right now, and I understand that. The first time I had psychosis, I had to stop working for over a year. So there’s no judgment here. If he decided to go on disability, and not work, that’s ok with me too. But the issue is that I’m very high functioning, and I have a really good job. He also drinks and smokes a lot of weed. So his delusions become really bad when he is drunk. I love him so much, but the drinking is only making his schizoaffective disorder worse. I get a lot of mixed reviews of my relationship with him. Some people say that it’s really romantic that we met in the hospital and fell in love in a hopeless place. Others say that our relationship is doomed to fail. A lot of people say that I deserve to be with someone who is Nuro typical because I am so high functioning. But I have never felt so excepted and loved in my entire life. It’s just really difficult for me to see how sick my boyfriend is. Has anyone else dated someone who also has schizophrenia?",1

I think since i have been in psychosis and schizophrenia symptoms what not, it opened a gate from hell or a spirit dimension and the spirits and demons have connected to my mind. My whole room turned into hell and a cage and ive been trapped. But it opens and closes. But now its staying and leaving faster and fasetrr. Any advice on how to fix it or close?

"Considering ""ultimatum"" to help my fiance'","Short background:

We have been together 15 years.
We have 3 kids.
She is undiagnosed. 
She has been petitioned in for help 3 times in the last 6 months.

If people trying to help ask for more details about previous delusions or family history I'll provide it.

On to her current delusion...

Beginning roughly a month ago, she started becoming very concerned about things like 5g, wifi, power, being ""hacked"" (this started as her phone being hacked, but it's now her mind).

Fast forward to yesterday. 

She demanded that I get the kids in the car and drive the entire family to the nearest FBI office so she can report to them the imminent threat to our family. She got very angry with me when I refused, so much so that she walked to her mom's (it's right up the road).

This is the threat, as she explained it to me and as she described it on her tip submission form to the fbi.

Some group of people, unknown who, have been secretly ""ungrounding"" the electrical to our house. This is part a setup on our home so they have the ability to electrocute anyone in the house to death. The setup doesn't require anyone be using or even near electric devices, as they can pinpoint the electrical attacks through the air. At least one member of the attackers works for DTE (our power provider). 

I removed her from the situation last weekend by taking the family up north to our cottage. This didn't help, as they followed us there (per her).

She is aware of their plan because they have hacked her brain and have been telling her the details of it. Her staying at her moms for the night was out of self preservation, because they told her they were going to kill her that night. Since the electrical kill setup is only at our house, she's safe from that as long as she is not on our property. Lastly, in her words, she has been ""acting like she's crazy"" for last few months at their direction. If she didn't do this, they were going to kidnap our children. 

Sorry that got long, but it's still only a fraction of what's going on right now.

Here is my issue...

We are not married and I don't have power of attorney over her. I can only petition her in if she is a danger to herself or others. If anything, she is hyper protective of herself and others right now. I called our local mental health rep that I normally deal with and was told that there is nothing they can do.

All I want to do is help.

The only people left in her life she can go to for help is her parents and one of her brothers. I'm considering telling her that she has to make a choice.

1. Make an appointment with CMH (community mental health), attend all appointments and take all prescriptions or she is no longer able to live in our home.

Or..

2. Check herself in to the local facility and remain there until her medications are helping, or she is no longer able to live here.

I don't know which of these 2 is best and I can't put into words how terrible I feel just thinking about telling her she has to leave if she doesn't seek help.

Since I'm sure someone will ask, she is on medication right now (seroquel)  and I ensure she takes it.

Any suggestions?",1
My partner has schizophrenia and I am at a crossroads,"My partner (20m) and I (19f) have been together for about 8 months, but have known eachother for over a year. He told me he has schizophrenia before we started dating, and I accepted it and him right away. He has the priveledge of being on medications for it, along with access to therapy and a psychiatrist at the drop of a hat, but he still does not speak about it. I am the only person outside of his family who knows about his condition, and I sometimes wish he would open up about it more. I have never pushed him on it as I know these things take alot of time, but the last few months have put me in a bit of a crossroads. Because of his medication, he only has ""episodes"" once or twice a month, and he is the sweetest, most loving partner and person I have ever met. I love him more than I can possibly say, but there are some things I wish we could talk about. He is starting to venture out into being/living on his own, and I have been on my own since september. For a bit more context, we both go to the same college, but it is 3,000 miles away from me and only 25 miles away from him. As our relationship has progressed and gotten more serious, the concept of living together, committing to one another, ect has come up in my head but I am apprehensive. Am I an asshole for feeling like if any of those things were to progress, I would be unhappy? I love him, but I am afraid I would end up becoming more of a crutch/ emotional caretaker than a girlfriend. Also, if I am overthinking this or jumping the gun, let me know. I don't have anyone to talk to about this and would love to hear any opinions from someone like him. Thanks",1

Underneath the sea.

Why would you afflict me?

I beg you to teach me,
Why this came to be,
Please show me the purpose,
The purpose in all this,

It always feels like im being forced to not say some things, or sometimes its feels like something is stealing my thoughts because I will forget the trail of conversation quickly. What i hate the most is shortly after someone tells me something, there have been times i forget it almost instantly, like it was taken from my mind. 

I am in a daze a lot of the time. I always think im aware but is it even awareness? It doesnt feel like me at all. I dont know a lot of things anymore. If I remember eventually, I forget again.

Why would someone drug a mentally Ill individual?,"Are we really living in a time where people are so bitter and upset with life that they would drug a mentally ill person who is trying to move forward in life.They didn’t want to rape me just wanted to destroy me.I am asking due to the fact that I have encountered total demons. I annoy others and they count me out because I don’t fit the script of a decent person by looks. 
I lost my parents and was raised by a grandmother who wanted the worst for me. So life has been hard battling mental illness with no support. Now I am dealing with a stalker and  life is so difficult. I am punished for wanting a job, when I have almost always became the best employee. 
People are so jealous because I have a different God that doesn’t help me out with everything.they think that if I get a job I will have money in my pocket and become happy. Like let me enter in to my delusion. Life is hard for everyone, who likes going to work. But I can’t believe I have a decade dedicated stalker and he wants me so destroyed because I didn’t sleep with him or get in a relationship with him. But if had he would just want me on drugs and hurt. What type of monsters are being bred.  I just learned that men like to conquer women, even the ones who are a mess with confidence. If I walked around sad I need to get help.if I just do me, I overly confident and it strikes their nerves to the point they want sex and a relationship to have me hurt in the end. Sounds crazy but this is how crazy they think. What TF is wrong with folks. Why waste your time. Devils in the details",1
Mothers - someone else spoke for me to her,"My mum really did her best I know she did but I’m going to make the hardest decision of my life to never speak with her again. 

I’ve had the worst year of my life I was in a very bad situation and now I’m mentally injured. 

During this time I haven’t gotten out of bed in months I’m suicidal and I cannot handle the world. During this time my mum has doubled down on her remarks towards me and I just realised no wonder I screamed and kicked throughout my childhood I had to deal with her mental gymnastics.

I’m cutting her off fully after hearing a voice that spoke out of my mouth saying “protect her” obviously it broke my brain so so much. When she heard that voice she said “Your never going to get better” and earlier in the night I told her I’m not coping and thinking of ending my life and she told me “fuck off”. 

I’ve just needed love during this time that’s all I’ve needed and she couldn’t just be nice to me for a year. My cat got sick and she said to me “don’t go broke fixing your cat” but she’s called me requesting money because she’s gambled it away. So she should get money to waste but I shouldn’t protect my best friend.

When I achieved something she said “Don’t act like it’s actually yours”. 

She has spent months and months trying to make snide remarks and I thought we got somewhere and she said oh no you’re just sensitive. She told me I’m probably better off without her she also sticks up so much for my dad and the men who assaulted her vs being nice to me.

I feel like such a bad person cutting her out but when that other voice spoke through me I was so scared. Im so traumatised my brain is trying to protect me. It’s time for me to realise that. 

My therapist said it’s okay and it probably won’t happen again I have Valium and have been sleeping a lot this past couple of days my mother is still blocked I cannot bring myself to unblock her.",1

Stuck,"I'm not sure how to start this, but I'll just give a grand overview of everything:

In 2020, I (now, 21F) was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, and recently had a rediagnosis of Schizoaffective disorder (depressive). I feel so stuck. I don't and cannot, drive. I also find myself unable to work stressful and fast-paced jobs. I feel like I can barely talk or even move sometimes. I hallucinate frequently and have vivid delusions but I'm moreso aware of my behaviors and thoughts, now that I'm medicated (Abilify 10mg).

Although my father supports me and I live with him, he's very emotionally and mentally mean and borderline abusive to me. He basically told me how much of a burden and useless I am. We also argued as to how I'm going to survive if he's gone (he's of older age).

I realize no one can really know exactly what's best for me from a mere reddit post, but any insight or helpful advice would be amazing. I've come to the conclusion to either discuss my feelings with my psychiatrist, or seek a possible outpatient program to attend. 

But I still don't know how to go about being more independent, driving or job-wise. I just really need some support right now. Thank you to all who respond <3",1

Best Videogames for Schizophrenic People,"Hi Everyone,

I’m schizophrenic and have struggled with positive and negative symptoms for about ten years.

I play a lot of video games, and two stuck out to me, for different reasons, as really indicative of my experiences.

Yakuza: Like A Dragon is a videogame that is very goofy, but with a serious plot. For example, your boss at work is a chicken that just clucks all the time. It’s good, in my opinion, for making fun of positive symptoms in a relatable way.

Death Stranding by Hideo Kojima, and his Metal Gear series of games, are really beautiful portrayals of the negative, paranoid symptoms, which helped me process my negative trauma. 

The trailers for these games are on youtube.

I hope they can release some stress!

Little Message For You Guys<3,"Hey everybody that reads this post!

For starters I myself am not schizophrenic, however I have been dealing with an awful amount of health anxiety and OCD issues relating to developing schizophrenia. I currently am in therapy and have been prescribed diazepam to help me through the panic attacks as they can become really bad for me. 

But having said that, I know it’s nothing compared to the amount of torment you guys go through everyday, and I just want to say how proud I am of each and every one of you for pushing through and fighting such a debilitating illness. Honestly I firmly believe you all are some of the strongest people out there, I can only imagine how hard it gets and I really sympathise with you all. 

When I’ve dealt with my anxieties my plan is to volunteer in helping and supporting people with schizophrenia/schizoaffective related disorders where I can. 

I wish you all the very best and hope you can all find inner peace someday, you all are doing so amazing, never EVER underestimate yourselves. stay strong!❤️

I am on 75mg risperdal depot injection. From your experience, does one need to be hospitalised to reduce medication? 

I am so exhausted these days that I'm like a husk of a person. 

Any input on reducing medication would be great.",1
Should I…ask for outpatient?,"Right so I have a doctors consult about a new psychologist and it can go one of two ways, I could mention the walls, the things in my previous posts, the episodes, hallucinations, trouble understanding stuff, incoherent mumbling, etc. And ask for outpatient 


Or I can just shut the fuck up and go with the flow, which should I do cause I got no clue which one I wanna do.

Ideas of reference,"21M diagnosed with schizophrenia for a few years now. Apart from auditory hallucinations, the main struggle for me is hearing noises and thinking they are actually messages targeted for me. For example my mom could be chopping peppers in the kitchen, and each chop will trigger a word in my mind. The messages are very hurtful and anxiety provoking, so I wondered if anyone else deals with this and what the proper terminology is for this?",1
I think my antipsychotic is stalling my weight loss and want to take myself off of it.,"I follow a ketogenic diet, do 16:8 intermittent fasting, AND eat under 1400 calls a day. All while attending spin, yoga, and HIIT classes 3x-5x per week.

I’m sick of the scale not moving or often going *up*. 

Why do I think it’s the antipsychotic? Because in 2018 I did the same routine and lost a lot of weight on no AP meds. 🥺",1
Things are getting bad again,"I don't know what to do. The voices and delusions are getting even worse, and I feel so helpless because they're starting to take control. I'm currently doing rTMS for my depression, and I see my psych in 2 weeks. At our last meeting, I told him everything that's been going on, including the self harm down there. But now it's getting bad, I'm doing it every single day and it hurts so much. The obsessive and repeating thoughts are literally getting to be too much, and the only way to stop the intrusive thoughts is to hurt myself there. My psych told me that if I need a hospital stay then we can certainly talk about it, because on top of the intrusive thoughts the voices are so overwhelming and keep telling me to cut. I want to finish my rTMS and hold off until I see him in two weeks to talk about a hospital stay, but I honestly dont know how much longer I can keep going on with hurting myself multiple times a day in an area that is so sensitive. I cant tell my mom because she will flip and hates when I have to be inpatient. But I need the help so bad. I dont feel safe in my head and I dont know what I should do. I just want to give up and end it but I know that's not the answer. Two weeks is a long time to be in so much pain. Idk what I should do  :/",1
Paranoia,"I’m sorry I keep on posting about this, but I keep hoping to hear other people’s perspectives and see if any more people can relate. 


I’m terrified of being watched and judged even in the privacy of my own home. I thought I did something really bad (which I didn’t, it was part of the delusion) and since then I’ve been worried that people are all in on some sort of conspiracy against me. Has anyone else experienced something similar, with the paranoia and persecutory delusions?

Executive Dysfunction,"I had a rough week.

I been experiencing ADHD-like symptoms. On top of that  anhedonia symptoms.

Since my last depressive episode, which was two years ago, I been having trouble reading novels or writing fiction.

I find it hard to enjoy watching TV or movies. I get so restless and bored. I dropped so many shows because of it.

This week, I really noticed I lost interest in my hobbies. They aren't fun or as enjoyable as they used too. I can only do them for a few minutes before giving up.

I really been dealing with extreme boredom too. I feel understimulated. My mind isn't as active now I'm on my semester break. 

I will finally tell my therapist tomorrow. I spoke with my psychiatrist earlier this week and they feel like they missing something when it comes to my diagnosis. They want me to me a neuropsychiatric assessment done. (Who knows when there be an opening for that?)

Has anyone gone through something similar? I hope to hear some success stories.",1
Fear of being diagnosed. I need input besides just my doctors.,"TL:DR at bottom!

So long story short, I’ve been treated for anxiety, depression & ADHD w/ trauma from age 13 to 22. Then there was a gap in my treatment due to constraints in my life at the time & I was only on medication. Then by the age 23-24 I started seeing therapists along with meds & finally found a therapist who I can say has helped me over all of these years.

So the past Few year I’ve been treated for PTSD primarily by therapist and anxiety, depression, ADHD by psyche/providers with meds. 

Over the past months of my treatment, I’ve gotten a recommendation to have neuropsychological testing & there’s suspicions to rule out schizophrenia.

My therapist has had an opinion of seeing I should do the testing because there may be other factor beside psychological that’s causing me difficulty in my life.

I’ve gathered they suspect I may have either Bipolar or Schizoaffective, or Schizophrenia. 

I’ve been on multiple medications over the years (10 - 20+ meds), and I’ve remained on: Adderall & Valium for several years. Rx’d Ketamine 6 months ago also which has been helpful. 

I’ve also dealt with Rx opioid/benzo addiction in my teen years, used weed & triggered severe paranoia for months and fear of drugs before I started taking meds & those Rx’a from off the street basically.

I’ve dealt with substance abuse for the past year after taking meds prescribed for about 2-3 years straight a year ago. So started up again with other substance/manners starting one year ago. 

I’ve added Kratom into my regimen for one year now. Around that time I also started taking extra Valium at times but not how I did years ago (80mg - 120mg years ago versus 5mg to 30mg some days now.)
Adderall which I don’t find very recreational, but still have taken an extra pill sometimes (years ago I did not abuse this med at all). Phenibut added in about 1 week ago.

I’ve gotten prescribed clonidine & trazodone a week ago to work towards stopping Kratom, stabilizing my Valium dose and eventually tapering/using as needed. But my life has genuinely been so controlled & move to another state in about 2 months. It’s been difficulty tapering with the treatment I get in work & the dynamics I’m working on in my marriage that are hurting me psychologically (no physical abuse thankfully). 

I’ve been able to maintain my career for these past 4 years, but struggling mentally versus my teen years in addiction –I could not find a way to function without opioids & benzos during that time compared to now.

So I am scared because I envision myself being on different meds like antipsychotics, mood stabilizers; the idea of being misdiagnosed and becoming worse. Being treated in a different manner by everyone. But I am open to being tested for these conditions to be logical & reasonable because I know becoming mentally stable is a good thing and working through the fear of getting better treatment could help change my life for the better. I do not feel comfortable with changing my regimen to new meds and completely stopping certain substances I’ve mentioned, but I’ll work on reducing my frequency of abusing meds. I am completely open to stopping substance abuse when I move & balancing my current meds, but I am still afraid of making changes to my meds and being on mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, etc.

TL;DR:

I am afraid of being diagnosed with bipolar, schizoaffective or schizophrenia with further neuropsyche testing because of antipsychotic, mood stabilizers, and med changes + potential misdiagnosis.

Therapists Issues,"Tw: Self harm, Bad language, Bad Therapists, Schizophrenia stuff

I got a new therapist/counselor recently. The main take away from my first session was ""Look at the positive."" What positive? I'm here trying to figure out why I'm seeing, hearing, and even tasting shit that isn't real, why I can't bring myself to do anything, and why I isolated myself for 2 months in college for no reason. I spend my days going to work and doing self harm because I'm bored and too terrified to sleep because there is something in the dark sent after me that might kill me.

The last one I had was one of the school ones. I wrote Help Me on my arms. I say wrote, but I think cut is a better word considering how I wrote it. I put clothes in my backpack so that they could just send me to a mental hospital and I would get help. She didn't seem to care about the harm, although I never showed her the cuts. She then made me fixate on the hallucinations that occur when you are falling asleep or waking up which is a normal thing to happen. When I realized that, I stopped seeing her. After a while, the real hallucinations started happening. 

I hate this. I hate searching for hours trying to find someone to help only to get the inexperienced ""positive thinkers"" who don't seem to grasp the severity of the shit I'm going through despite the fact that I tell them.",1

I dont know what to do I NEED to change my antipsychotic but I have no idea what to change it to!,"Hi redditors, 

I have been on Zyprexa for almost 7 months now and I have no voices or horrible tactile hallucinations but i also have no life.. I dont know what to do. I want to switch antipsychotics so bad but at the same time I am terrified that I will get psychosis while I will be switching, besides my only options left for switching are kind of activating mild antipsychotics like vraylar or rexulti or caplyta, I am afraid they will not be enough to keep my psychosis at bay but at the same time i am on a very small dose of Zyprexa, what if I will be able to successfully switch. I cant even walk on Zyprexa I cant do anything on this drug, it's not a life, i dont even care if i die with this life of mine. I have to try to switch no matter how scarry it is.. 

Another hurdle for switching is that my doctor would not let me do it, my psychosis was so bad and torturous (I had auditory and painful molesting tactile hallucinations as well as visual ones) and it lasted for so long (almost a year) that my doctor refuses to risk destabilizing me BUT i cant live like this anymore. The only reason I havent killed myself yet is because i am a coward and because of my family. 

Thank you for reading everyone. Sorry for such gloomy tone of this post, I hope it wont trigger anyone. I just dont know how to shake off this depression.

Because of this I'm changing meds. There starting me on a low dose which means I'm going to start hallucinating again well more then I am now. The worst part is I'm starting a new job soon. The couple times I've missed a day of my meds I've had episode. They weren't bad episodes but still I'm afraid that might happen at my new job with the low dose. I've had hallucinations my whole life but I've never really had episodes until I got on meds. I'm just quite unsure what I should prepare for an episode at my new job. Should I prepare anything at all? I'm going to be in a receptionist position. Any advice will help.,1
is trauma a part of a reason for schizophrenia?,My therapist believes that schizophrenia is caused by a piece of the psyche splitting off from the self due most likely to childhood trauma and forming separately and then being tapped into as you age. I'm not sure if this is true. Mostly he just offers empathy not advice. I've had some rough time as a kid but nothing too abnormal. My mom heard this theory and got really mad. She insists that trauma has nothing to do with it. She read about that awhile back and has held onto it very hard as she was somewhat abusive verbally and a little physically and I think she feels bad or regrets it and can't face that but I'm not sure what to think. Her anger seems out of place and she doesn't want me listening to my therapist. What do you think?,1

"My journey with schizophrenia, drug-induced psychosis, and addiction.","I am a diagnosed schizophrenic, particularly of the undifferentiated type. My episodes range from delusions, catatonic hallucination, paranoia, etc. I believe I experienced an onset of schizophrenia earlier on because I had this voice in my head in middle school that was a jester who judged everything I did but acted like a friend. Then highschool hit and suddenly I went into severe isolation, dropped out, stopped showering and brushing my teeth, stayed up until 10 am everyday playing videogames or on my phone. 

This was a very dark time of my life it was like total mental anguish and loneliness and I just felt.. off. I got kicked out of my mom's place because I was so depressed that I didnt do anything and we fought regularly. So I moved in with my dad and he introduced me to weed. The first time I got really high I had a psychotic episode where I thought I was going to kill my family with a knife I had just bought. From this point on I never truly felt ""normal"" again. I went back into highschool and spent my last year thinking I was in touch with entities from different dimensions and ancient, forbidden knowledge. I would move in with many family members and go through a lot of trauma and violence in these years that will forever affect my mental health. I also started using harder drugs like amphetamines and cocaine. I was addicted to amphetamines for a year and then crack cocaine for almost 2 years. My parents are the ones that introduced me to hard drugs and were both addicted to crack when I was born.

I would try many meds and go on and off of them but I could never find one that truly helped. The last time I was medicated I fell into the deepest depression of my life. I had a catatonic weed-induced episode where I couldnt move or speak and I thought I was being attacked by demons. I saw hallucinations of hell and viscious flames. I was hospitalized for this and this was when I was officially diagnosed with schizophrenia and they put me on a new medication. This medication (invega sustenna) was not only ripping away my will to live but I would still get episodes and I couldn't hold down a job. So i quit this medication and about a month or two ago I did psychedelics combined with methamphetamine and had the scariest episode of my entire life. 

The delusions were no longer just in my head they manifested themselves in the real world and I spent nearly 40 hours full on hallucinating. There was like hundreds of phones buzzing all around me and it felt like the friends I were talking to on my phone wanted to kill me. I also thought that there was people outside my house that wanted to kill me and I boarded my windows with cardboard. I thought that there was a plot against me and that my precious friends and family Ive known for years were actors or had been trying to mind control me with drugs. Which honestly I dont even think was a lie because I was hanging around a lot of addicts (including my own mother but I dont want to get into that) who just kept getting me more and more fucked up and they knew I was a diagnosed schizophrenic. 

This ordeal helped me realize that it was the drugs that were not only fucking my brain up and essentially driving me insane but were putting me in bad situations and leading me down a dark path. I was born into really unfortunate circumstances with two addicts for parents and predisposed psychotic symptoms. I am determined to stay sober so I can better manage my symptoms. I have also cut off those toxic addicts in my life and I am in a (relatively) safe environment. I dont think I need meds, except for maybe seroquel which has so far been the only medication to help me without having horrible side effects. Its so sad how there is so many people like me who fell into addiction and started experiencing psychotic symptoms. This shit isnt any joke its like hell on earth you are never truly comfortable or feel safe. I just wanted to share my story and see if maybe any of you could relate or sympathize with me.

2. My life is not rich with activity. These people both had full time jobs and found the time for hobbies and other things such as reading the news and listening to new music.

Brain dumping..,"Hey all - sorry wall of text here

I have a bit of a varied past. Essentially started out as potential ocd, then an adjustment disorder and was followed by a psychiatrist for 8ish years. When he retired we had a discussion and he was going to put on my discharge file ‘anxiety induced psychosis’ because he thought the diagnosis of schizophrenia would be too much stress. Last summer I saw a consultation psychiatrist who suggested schizoaffective - or that I am having periods of dissociation???. I doubt the dissociation piece. Anyways I had been fairly well managed on risperidone and carbamazepine for a number of years (until I got unwell again last summer in relation to a significant amount of workplace stress). Risperidone was increased and fluoxetine was added at that point. 


Anyhow - this last year has been pretty off and on with a variety of symptoms (mostly in the weird thoughts department) and its sucked. Ive basically separated myself from my brain at this point - I’m me and my ‘brain’ is the one causing all the shit. I view us as two separate entities. My psychologist suggested that externalizing my symptoms to my ‘brain’ is a good way to view things.

1. But besides spending time worrying about stuff that likely isn’t normal - I spend alot of time thinking about the fact that my ‘brain’ is causing symptoms because it wants me to be unwell because it is seeking attention. I personally don’t want attention and am revolted at that idea. I really dont like to talk about any symptoms at all and do my best to hide things other than with a select couple people that i share the tip of the iceberg, but I worry that my ‘brain’ is just making symptoms up to get attention. Can anyone relate? Or is this just me.. 

2. I know my brain is off and Ill even give in and say I have had psychotic symptoms, but I have a hard time believing in a diagnosis for myself - how do people come to terms with this? My psychologist suggested getting a copy of my latest psychiatric report - but i really dont know if I want to read that. I mean I dont really know what to tell people (like healthcare providers) based on the variety of diagnoses anyways. I normally just revert to the anxiety induced psychosis - but thats not really a thing. A large part of me doesn’t want to accept the possibility of schizophrenia or schizoaffective because I have never fully lost it.. I get unwell - but not that unwell.
And part 2 of this one is - I know medications work for me at settling things down- but i also spend alot of time thinking that maybe I dont need the medications and in the long term they are doing harm.. what if I have been misdiagnosed/over medicated - how do people deal with these thoughts? Im consistent at taking them as I worry about the potential repercussions of not taking them… but I dont know, maybe I dont really need them.. 

3. How do you get things off your mind? My mind is going down alot of rabbit holes lately and I worry that if I talk about this at all Ill end up at hospital against my will. I feel somewhat ok talking to the psychologist about some of it - not my doctor. I wish I had people to explore some of these ideas with as a sounding board - but talking to friends about it likely isnt a good idea. Is the anonymity of the internet where people turn? I do have some worksheets that help me challenge some of these thoughts that my psychologist gave me - but they dont stop the wheels from turning on some of the bigger rabbit holes. Overall Im doing fine - but if I dont have a distraction going on my brain is going 5 million ways and its causing me anxiety. A - because the thoughts are distressing. B - Im worried that I am potentially starting to get unwell again.

Any insights would be appreciated. Sorry if this seems disorganized, but besides the likely weird rabbit holes these thoughts are all circulating like a whirlpool in my head. I miss the days of my quiet brain that just focused on normal everyday life. :/",1

I lost my job, wrecked a vehicle, busted my teeth, was hospitalized multiple times, and was isolated from friends and family. The phenomena almost killed me so many times. I preformed a personalized summoning ritual for a spirit guide, this was a big up for me in my mortal and spiritual bout.

Taking that stuff is the equivalent of burning your house down so no one can break in. The only substance that ever helped me with this phenomena were the plants Chamomile and Kratom. I found the Hearing Voices Network, I began sharing my story and hearing others. It was staggering to see how much of my story was in everyone else's, how the spirits are dim witted and do the same thing to every human they harass. Lastly the three books from Jordan Peterson were of tremendous help to me. No only do they describe an ideal perspective to take in just about any trying situation, they describe his recommendations to people in this very situation. More so he talks about himself having heard voices and overcoming the harassment of spirits. Look into music, the story of the tortured medium is the story of countless artists in contemporary music. The spirits tell stories and send messages to each other and the rest of the world through these artists, who know themselves to be channeling spirits. The world is coo coo for crazy nuts, screw the APA. If you are interested in this please look through my profile, it tells my story. Lastly I have a google doc up that I am adding to that distills the key takeaways on how to understand and act around this phenomena. See below: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTozHsHnN\_8k85-ubAFxc0R2UiWoPr8tRKvlGOUjSW40jyzCWq0p6jEbKx8LrJT9BUfI\_36kjQe9l6y/pub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTozHsHnN_8k85-ubAFxc0R2UiWoPr8tRKvlGOUjSW40jyzCWq0p6jEbKx8LrJT9BUfI_36kjQe9l6y/pub)

Can someone tell me if it’s anxiety or the beggining of my schizophrenia symptoms?,"All right, I apologize for my English, it is not my native language. I’m 19(M) and always frequent reddit threads and first of all, I must make it clear that I am diagnosed with OCD and generalized anxiety. Recently, I started to be very afraid of having schizophrenia. Once, when I was almost asleep, I heard people I knew calling me and talking to each other. Okay, I know this was possibly a benign event called hypnagonic hallucinations. However, everything got worse to the extreme when last night, something happened that left me with a lot of doubt, and caused me a very bad anxiety attack. I'll try to tell in details: I was lying on my bed and I had my AirPods in my ears, however they were turned off, that is, without sound. My fan was on, but its noise is low. Suddenly, I hear from my LEFT ear (I emphasize this because from my right ear I can hear my street, and from my left ear, there is only my door that leads to a corridor of my house) a voice saying something completely muffled, as if my headphones had drowned her out. From what I heard, she said one sentence, but I couldn't make it out and it was quite low. Then, I opened my door and no one was there. Since then, I'm having a panic attack because I know that if I have this disease, I'll isolate myself from everyone and break up with my girlfriend, because I'm too afraid of hurting the ones I love in an outbreak episode. I just wanted a certain diagnosis telling me if I HAVE IT or I DON'T HAVE IT. I don't have delusions or believe in unreal things, I know how to separate things very well. If someone who knows about the disease can go into detail and calm me down, or tell me the truth... on friday my girlfriend will come here and I won't be able to enjoy anything... I'm so scared.

What makes me think the most about not being schizophrenia, was the fact that I heard only one sentence and nothing more. I have a friend who has the disease and he said it wouldn't be possible, because when he hears voices, they last for a few minutes, he never heard just one sentence, but idk.",1
how to help my cousin,"my 30M cousin is schizophrenic (paranoid schizophrenia) - he was recently diagnosed, having struggled with psychotic episodes all his twenties that were blamed on his cannabis and hallucogenic drug abuse.

he scares the whole family and we all have taken a distance from him as a result- he has given us death threats, stolen money for drugs and many other things that are too long to list.

that being said… the diagnosis shows these episodes are out of his control and of course that the hardest is really for him.

how can i help him without putting myself at risk? we grew up together so we were always more like brothers and i don’t think his family plans to help him or be in his life",1
is this catatonia ?,"sometimes when i’m overwhelmed or if a topic along the lines of my mental illness comes up, i freeze. it’s like the voices get so loud, i can’t hear anything else. they don’t let me talk or move. this can last minutes to hours. my partner says sometimes i’m in the freeze while doing art or midway through conversation.",1

How do you manage the side effects?,"Hi! I'm new here. Last year I had a psychotic episode that never went away (awaiting diagnosis).

Will it get better? Do I have to try other meds?

I was on invega 9mg last year and quit my meds precisely because the side effects were making me want to kill myself so I'm not very hopeful.",1
Can people talk of their successes on here?,"

Has a psychotic episode ever made you attracted to people you normally aren't attracted to? Or obsessed over someone you normally wouldn't.,"This may because I have the bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder, but I remember being so obsessive over one person and I kept stopping myself from bothering them because I knew something was off. I have 3 books I filled writing about them. 
It didn't stop me from making an ass of myself. I couldn't stand to see them again. They probably knew I was sick because everyone around that time were trying to help me. 
I fought for control because something felt wrong. I kept thinking they were communicating to me, but I logically understood that this didn't match their behavior in person. 
I started looking for answers and remembered my disgnosis again. When I finally got back on medication. My interest in them dissolved completely. I'm thankful that I didn't harass them. I was like that for over almost two years. I'm sure they're great, but I may have been attracted to the narrative I created around them. I should also mention that I'm a lesbian and I'm not even attracted to men. I've never even had a boyfriend. I think my heavily religious homophobic background had a part to play in that. 
Have you be obsessive over people before?",1
Do I tell my therapist?,I can’t decide if i should tell my therapist about the bugs in the walls and the time travelers. I know its good to be open but i’m scared she’ll call the cops and force me into a hospital (again) or not understand and think that i’m making things up. I don’t want her to look at me like i’m crazy. And i don’t want to be locked up. But the things happening are so so scary and I am very distressed.,1
I feel like “people” are starting to notice what is going on with me.,"They are just treating me a little different, looking at me with different eyes. It is probably so that they can use it to get me to be ashamed. I think it’s still a part of their plan I guess. Will not kill myself though.",1
Got out of the Hospital yesterday!,"Rant / Vent because I can't really be that happy about it. My Uncle died, who I loved very much, causing me psychosis. Schizophrenia doesn't run in my family but my brother, so the genetics were there, I guess. Symptoms pretty similar to negative symptoms of schizophrenia were there for years, I think (Which I've told my doctors. It's probably depression, though) So yeah. I've talked with my brother a lot, asking for advice and such, which I got plenty of, so I think I'm good. I'm on 2mg risperidone. I was on 4mg, but that tired me out hellishly, but 2mg's still taking it's toll on me. In 3 weeks, I'll be on abilify instead.

Seroquel,,1
I told my psychiatrist everything,"I did it. I told him everything about what's been going on. I told him about the feelings of strongly believing that something evil has entered inside me and that it's been controlling my thoughts and emotions. I told him about the self harming triggered by these horrible intrusive thoughts, and how I have no control over these urges. And I told him how these voices in my head are completely destroying me. He was soooo understanding and listened so well. I feel so relieved! I feel like finally I'm being heard and that I'm going to get the help I need and deserve. Right now I'm on haldol orally but he wants to switch me to the injection so it stays in my body longer to try and control symptoms. He said that this belief of feeling this darkness inside is definitely a delusion and that I'm not crazy, but that it is the illness and it's going to be okay. I'm also taking abilify again which I hope will also help me because these symptoms are really kicking my ass right now. I'm hoping the haloperidol injection wont make me too tired? And that there aren't alot of other side effects. He also said if I need a hospital stay to sort all this out that he will bring me in and see what he can do. Honestly I feel so much better after today's appointment. Does anyone have any advice about how they manage they're delusions and hallucinations? I completely broke down when I was talking to him because I've been feeling so hopeless. I just want to feel like me again. Any suggestions would be great",1
Lack of insight to illness,"Hey everyone, I’m new here. I have a sibling (adult) that was diagnosed within the last year and has been to the hospital a couple of times while in psychosis. I believe she probably was also hospitalized while she lived further away from home.

She destroys hospital documents, won’t share details with anyone when she returns, and doesn’t believe she has a mental illness. Has anyone else on this sub also gone through a long period of not having insight to their illness? How did you come out on the other side? As a family we haven’t been pushing it, but it’s hard watching a loved one clearly suffering by not getting medication or treatment. I’m feeling really stuck",1

My dad tries to get me to do things with him but being the horrible daughter I am I completely freak out at the thought. I don't want to push him away and I tell him this in text messages all the time but it's like I lose myself when it actually comes to it. Please how do I push myself to not be like this.

I need some advice from you,"I have a hard time with all of my symptoms. And this will sound crazy, but I don't take medicine anymore.

When I was on meds, my abilities vanished until I had been off everything for some time.


I can, for the most part, handle the hallucinations. But the paranoid delusions are ruining my life.

I feel like everyone has ulterior motives. Everyone is out to get me. And that no one truly is acting in good faith or my best interests.

It doesn't help that I was actually hacked and had to get help from someone to secure my devices. Now I'm not sure who to trust, if I can and ever will trust anyone ever again.

Recalling a time when I was in a psych ward,I remember one time I was in a psych ward really far from home. The staff did vending machine runs for the patients once a day and I had a 20 so I asked for something. They said they didn’t/ couldn’t change it for me so I couldn’t buy something. I was bummed when a lady I talked to a bit gave me a dollar. I remember telling her “I can’t pay you back.” And she said “Nothing in this life is promised.” I thought it was a beautifully profound thing and I think about that and her quite frequently. Does anyone else have experiences like this?,1

He really freaks me the fuck out, when I was looking for him last night I was by the coat rack having a mini panic attack and went to my room where I placed salt at the door to establish a safe space so he can’t strangle me telepathically.

Additionally everyone says I should tell my therapist about this since it’s been about 4 weeks of hallucinations, this, a kid I can’t trust because I KNOW he’s gonna hurt me, outside of my mania.

Mother's schizophrenia destroyed my family,"My mother developed schizphrenia several years ago but me and my family struggled to recognise it and even treat it.

I don’t know where to place myself. I’m constantly uncomfortable, dissociating. It feels like being sick but you never heal. Sometimes the only thing that makes sense to do, is to end it all (if you know what I mean). I was admitted to the psych ward for two months and here I got some meds that work for some things but not all. And I get help and support everyday with my everyday struggles but it’s like it’s just not enough. I’m so lonely as well…",1

experiencing first episode psychosis and I want to be alone,"(CW: ED, overbearing parents, undiagnosed)

Hi!! This is my second post here. This is also kind of a rant. I am doing not super okay since then but I need advice because I don’t think anyone has made a post like this yet. 

TLDR: my mom is feeding me too much, not leaving me alone, making me go from my house to her house and being waaayyy to overbearing  because of my mental health and hallucinations and I just want to be alone. Is it okay to be alone during this? Am I mad for no reason?

My mom is very overbearing and has been ever since I was small. I (20) live alone and she lives on in the middle of nowhere (farm) where there is nothing to do in a small house. I like my home and feel good living alone with my cats. but since two months ago, she doesn’t leave me alone. A doctor told her it’s best to not let me be alone.

Because of her work, she needs to be home.  She makes me go with her. I am very unhappy at her house and 60% of the week and time I am stuck in her house and the other 40% I’m allowed to be back home.

I have gained weight. have struggled with eating my entire life because of my parents eating patterns. Upset? Eat. Happy? Eat. I learnt to live a healthy lifestyle after living alone. I love working out and going for long walks but now, I am unable to do so because I can’t be alone. She doesn’t get how bad it makes me feel. 

I told my mom that I am upset the way she is making me eat and not allowing me to workout or go for walks. I told her it’s unhealthy how much weight I’ve gained in a short time and now I am very upset because I have absolutely no control over my life and it’s constant bad though and the voices are so awful I can’t stop them when I am like this. My mom said I’m not eating too much but I am. 

I just want to be alone again not because I want to do something unhinged but I am just too overwhelmed. I got taken off all my meds (adhd and birth control for hormones) and I just hate this I can’t take this experience anymore. 

The clinic that will help me will call me next week after a month of waiting to get in and two hospital visits later. 

Can someone just tell me I’m okay to be alone? She talks to me like a child now and I feel so useless here with her. I have no control over my life and don’t want to go from house to house anymore. I just want to be with my cats in my own home.",1
Why do people hate me so much?,"Genuine question. I am at my wits end because I very honestly do not know why people dislike me so much, and I genuinely want to know what the problem is.

Every time I see my therapist I ask him this same exact question and he tells me nothing is wrong with me and I just need to meet new people. I have met plenty of people in my 26 years of life and I am still mostly alone, apart from the LOML, but even he left me for a year during my psychotic episode.

Why were the nurses in the psych hospital so vicious to me? Why do my cousins that I grew up with never text me back but hold it against me if I don’t reach out to them? Why do my boyfriend’s friends treat me like I’m invisible? Why did my only friends during my psychotic episode make fun of me behind my back and right in front of me? Why did my former therapist and my psychiatrist both abandon me in the middle of my psychotic depressive episode when I said I was going to kms? Why did exactly 0 of the 6 mental health professionals I saw over a year suggest treatment for psychosis? What did I do???

As far as I know I am friendly and polite. I do my best every day. 

Any insight is appreciated.",1

I can see ghosts now,"I found out I had undiagnosed schizophrenia when i felt people staring at me all the time, and then I started hearing music and giggling that wasn't there, then I started hearing people say/whisper my name.

I haven’t found a way to be able to help that yet does anyone have any suggestions? I am meeting him soon and we are doing so in public so I really wouldn’t want it to ruin our first time meeting.

Getting worse (again!),"Sometimes my symptoms are manageable. Sometimes they’re not. I’ve been doing good lately, I caught up in all my classes and I’ve been able to hangout with friends.
Then, I started thinking those friends are spying on me, I started thinking my skin was poisoned, etc. my negative symptoms got worse. No hallucinations yet, but I can tell things are gonna start getting bad again. Sigh. Here we go. I’ll be here a lot soon I assume :)

and for a bonus cherry on top, my girlfriend (who does not know of my illness) keeps making sz jokes. I think I hear something, I get “lol maybe you’re schizo”. She was having sensory issues and said “it feels like there’s bugs in my skin. Does that mean I’m going crazy?” (No.) why is this the second romantic partner in a row that tries to glamorize psychosis?? (my last one was obsessed with the idea of voices “I’m gonna listen to the voices in my head and go crazy”) 

It’s just so sucky to know that not only am I about to go back to struggling to make it through every hour of the day but I’m going to start getting more and more invalidated because everyone thinks it’s cool to have this disorder. 
Ugh.",1
Born to fail,"Life is 90% of the time a haze of confusion, fear, and paranoia. Then when my mind is somewhat clear I look back at life and feel nothing but existential dread knowing this is just how things are and I can't really do anything about it. I can see myself getting worse, but what am I supposed to do? 

They say ""get help"", I have tried this. I did exactly what I was told, and I can say beyond any reasonable doubt that ""help"" made everything worse. 

Go to the doctors, get locked up and dehumanized and abused for a week or two, beg the doctor every time you seem him to let you out of there as this is a horrible place to be, eventually get let out and despite the meds they put you on be notably more depressed, reclusive, and psychotic to the point that you try to game end yourself and end right back up in there bc you can't do a single thing right. 5 times. 

When I think about it, I'd rather do anything than go back into those hospitals. I used to sit down and pet my dog and that would always calm me down alot, but he's gone now and everything feels hopeless but I think it was always hopeless. I wish I would wake up and this was all a very long and awful dream",1
My dad was just diagnosed with schizophrenia,"Hi❤️ I’m a F23 with two troubled parents, I have BPD, my mom has ADHD and my dad was just diagnosed w schizophrenia today, he is 42 years old and has always been depressed and dissociative ever since I can remember. He begun having manic / psychotic behaviour beginning 2018. 

He is highly intelligent and sensitive, loves movies, music, video games and the cosmos. 

I want to be there for my dad. I want to know how it has been for those of u who are diagnosed to have ur condition and what to be mindful of. I also do have a few friends who are sc and I want to be as mindful as possible of what I can do to help when they are very triggered. I always make sure to ask them myself what they need too ofc in a soft manner.

I just got the «news» of his final diagnosis today, though he started experiencing drug induced (Ritalin / Amfethamine / Weed ) psychosis in 2018 and ever since then was he ever the same.

Up until now I thought he might be autistic with isolated incidents of drug induced psychosis’ that turned to the psychosis lingering for years after.

In his very intense episodes he mostly sees demons and wants to fulfill some sort of prophecy, and / or he thinks he’s being followed and is suspicious of everyone but me and my grandma.

I remember him as being calm, witty, sensitive and smart my whole childhood / young adulthood leading to 2018. Though, apparantly whenever he was ill I would stay at my grandma’s house and she would tell me he had a fever or stomach bug instead.. 

Since 2018 he has been aggressive, accusive, he breaks things (electronics, his windows and walls). He was recently forced to sell his apartment because he’s been screaming a lot, and broke things constantly and I guess my worry now is will he with his diagnosis and finally getting the right medication be able to lead a good life again?

I don’t want to be insensitive to my dad but I really miss the way he used to be so much, we were best friends and talked every day pre 2018, and I guess I thought there was a possibility that he would go back to his «normal» self again but I now understand that he has actually always been like this and I actually just never knew. He has been in a good psychiatric hospital for half a year now and after careful observation they finally diagnosed him 

I am curious to hear from those of you who have been diagnosed with sc yourselves in your later years and how it affected you. Also those who have sc parents and how it has been for u.❤️",1
I keep making mistakes,It seems like everything I do is wrong. My brain just malfunctions and gets so loud that I can’t do anything right. I move too fast but I can’t slow down no matter what I do. I feel like I’m getting into an episode and I’m so worried I’ll end up back at a hospital. I don’t even know what to do or what advice I’m asking for.

Looking for advice for my friend.,"He's my oldest friend (from elementary school, now we're in our 30s) showed schizophrenic & bipolar symptoms late in HS.  He's been forced into hospitals multiple times since HS when he's become too unstable. He was on abilify for awhile, but stopped because of gambling issues. I'm not sure what it is but he has a daily med but doesn't take it as far as I know. We're brutally honest with each other, no judgements.  He often turns to drugs like weed, alcohol, coke, x, acid and meth. His reasoning for doing crystal meth is it ""gives him clairvoyance"" I hang out with him almost every Saturday. We bowl, Frisbee golf and just chill. He was doing well working for a few years but he has a DUI case that has been hanging over his head for 5 years that has finally gone to sentencing but it has stressed him out and caused him to have manic episodes so he hasn't worked in months. And they can't sentence him because he's mentally unfit when he shows up. There are good facilities in the area, and therapy but he won't go because he doesn't want someone to change how he thinks. He's non violent but his mind races to the point he is no longer in control or his paranoia makes him lock up his computer or not trust anyone. This means he can't work and is fighting so hard just be in a limbo of surviving but not being able to make any progress towards his goals.. I don't know what to do to help him. If you have any advice or any other resources I can look into, I'm all ears.",1

Im sick of schizophrenia forums being filled with “self diagnosed people” and liars,I got banned from a schizophrenia forum for calling out someone with borderline personality disorder for lying (and i wasnt rude) because they keep saying they have schizophrenia when they aren’t diagnosed with schizophrenia.

How effective are meds supposed to be?,"I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia last year but have been suffering with symptoms since 2013. 

I haven't been able to hold down a job for very long on average. However I took up a nightshift job at a supermarket in 2020 and been able to hold that done for 1 and half years before having a major psychosis period that lasted most of 2022. I have since moved on to day shift but have had to take 3 periods off sick because of my symptoms. 

My question is, is how effective are meds supposed to be?

I have daily paranoid and delusional thoughts at work and hear hallucinations regularly...

what happens if/when i get diagnosed?,"i’ve been seeing my therapist for a few months and he believes i have schizophrenia, i remember i started to hallucinate a year or two ago (im 19 almost 20) and they’ve been getting extraordinarily worse in the past 8-9 months, they’re more vivid and i can’t tell if what i’m seeing is real or not. along with this, other symptoms have started to show up/worsen as well. 

i hear whispers mostly, i can’t really make it out, lately the “heys” started being more regular. i haven’t had any command hallucinations which is one reason why my therapist wants to wait to send me to a psych. my personal hygiene has declined, i never go out anymore, i HATE mirrors and windows, i always see something watching me, i feel so disconnected from myself and everything else, i used to be super outgoing and now i can’t even go to the grocery store alone. my managers are starting to get upset with me because i’m never “present” anymore, telling me if i need time away from work to figure out my stuff until i’m “back to normal.” 

it sucks that i have to wait until my next visit in a month to start to get this figured out. i don’t like half knowing what’s wrong with me. essentially, i just want to know if i will feel better and feel like i’m not insane, i can’t even talk to my boyfriend without seeing or hearing something. i always feel like im being watched at all times and im so tired. 
does anyone relate? what will happen after a diagnosis? and how do you feel since being diagnosed and/or treated?

ps. i don’t typically write stuff for the internet bc i am super anxious, i just need support
from people who understand what i’m talking about, most everyone else treats me like i’m insane :((",1
Flat/hollow earth stupidity…,"Dear schizophrenics, 

I want to warn you about flat earth. I didn’t really study this stuff much when I was young, and got stuck in it for a year or 2, and had to study my way out of it… I was a slow/lazy researcher, and kept letting it get hold of me, and it would make me delusional.

Please don’t get caught in flat or hollow earth.

Do your best to study.

This stuff can really mess with your mind until you grow enough to understand it. Don’t become delusional with it.

Eratosthenes experiment isn’t the same on a flat earth… don’t let people confuse you about it. Think about what a shadow would look like on a stick at the North Pole, with the sun hitting it from the side, with parallel rays (not mentioning tilt). Hollow earth would have inward pointing shadows due to an opposite curve. Sticks in the ground with shadows really can prove a lot.

South celestial pole is not possible on flat earth.

Moon and sun somehow magically float on flat earth and hollow earth.

The North Star disappears once you go south far enough.

Clocks speed up, and gravity is less at higher altitudes.

Meteors somehow make it through the flat earth dome.

The flat earth excuse for seasons is the sun moving further out on the flat earth map, but that would technically mean a longer day due to the sun doing a bigger circle. And doesn’t explain the analemma properly, and in Australia in summer, the sun actually appears to curve south during sunset, due to the angle and tilt…  

Personally, I still think the moon and mars stuff is dodgy looking… but they aren’t 100% messing with us about the shape of earth… their camera angles do suck tho…

Don’t let yourself start thinking science is stupid, like I basically was… keep trying!",1
Tired of being treated like an addict because I want stimulants to treat the negative symptoms.,"Antipsychotic medications only seems to address the positive symptoms and I'm just anhedonic and bored all day I feel like a husk my life is so fucking boring.

Like even if I were to do meth it wouldn't be because I'm an addict. It'd be because I need a stimulant to counteract negative symptoms that my psychiatrist simply won't prescribe. I'd essentially microdose it and just take the equivalent to a therapeutic dosage of Desoxyn.

I'd rather just have my Dexedrine prescription back. I know it'd obliterate the anhedonia.

Wellbutrin worked for like a month or two then it just made me irritable and clench my jaw a lot. Dexedrine actually remained effective and made everything exciting. This was before I even developed symptoms.

I did eventually abuse it but that's because I was dumb and immature as I was still in highschool and just entering my drug experimentation phase at the time. I'm 19 now and I probably wouldn't abuse stimulants if I got put on them. Fuck I want them back life just isn't worth living with anhedonia.

Whenever I say I want stims for a legitimate and valid reason (reducing negative symptoms) people just say I'm an addict/recovering addict.",1

I don’t control my emotions well nor do I understand any of this. I sometimes feel like ripping my hair out or cause myself to be unable to hear. I apparently mumble about random things all the time. I do not notice these things. I can’t stand people touching my stuff for the fear of what they will do. I feel like the people around are just trying to hurt me.

How can I make a work safety plan?,"Hello, last week I (f20) experienced a bought of psychosis. I was afraid of mirrors, rain, my voice, and other peoples beings. I am on anti-psycotic medication so I am okay now. I wasn't diagnosed with anything. I've been telling people I'm on the schizophrenia spectrum? But Idk, it's kinda a self diagnosis. But my Counciler said it's a good possibility.

I'm a tattoo apprentice. My station has a giant mirror on the main wall where my chair lays vertical too from the other wall. When tattooing last week I just put up a dental sheet and I was fine. Heads a little loose but for the most part I'm screwed on, especially with medication. I told my mentor about my experiences with psychosis in the past and I had to let him know I was dealing with it again. I need to make a safety plan incase, for whatever reason, I go into an attack while I'm tattooing a client. I'm terrified of that happening. It'd be super embarrassing and low-key truamatic for everyone involved.

I used to keep a daily log of my activities and I've stopped. I'm going to a movie club recommended by my psychiatrist and I have nothing to say anymore while I used to be quite talkative.

Medication somehow works, even if I don't feel anything special while on it. Lack of medication is a killer. At least I'm convinced that I can get my life back on track if I secure a steady supply of medicine.

In need of advice,"So I am not the one suffering from schizophrenia, but I am thinking my husband may.  My husband has been having paranoid delusions that have just gotten a lot worse this past year. Years back when we first got together there would be things he would say that would make me think something was going on with him mentally, some examples were that my mom was putting cameras or listening devices in our room, that she put a mic in our air purifier, that my mom was poisoning his food, he is severely disabled and so he had to use a commode in our room and he was adamant that when he would use it that my mom would be against the wall listening to him. Fast forward to the present, we have moved out of state and I thought that it was just because of my mom because she was the only thing that triggered it. Well now it’s the upstairs neighbors. About 8 months ago he started believing that they were drilling into the ceiling to put cameras in the ceiling, made me check the vents because he wanted to make sure no one put cameras in it, he wants to get rid of the microwave because he’s thinking there’s a bug in it. So those neighbors moved out and now a new neighbor moved in and now it’s this guy who’s “harassing” us. He says that the upstairs neighbor was following him because he could hear the footsteps wherever he walked. We were praying together the other night and he was sure that he heard the upstairs neighbor laughing at us while we were praying and that he was laughing like his mom. His mom died like 4 years ago or so. So I asked him how would that be possible because she died years back and he just said that they could have seen a video that his ex took of him from like 20 years ago. He’s also feeling these vibrations that I do not feel at all. He claims that someone is doing it on purpose. 

So I get home from work today and right next to the bed was our 9mm. He has never been violent or anything, but to see it out makes me nervous. I’m in a tough spot because he says I don’t fight for him or do more but I’m not going to call the cops on a neighbor who’s walking hard. I have no idea what to do. He tells me I’m not compassionate and all that. I get it because he really believes that this is going on but it’s not. There a lot more instances but it’s just too much to write.   I tried in the past the best I could to tell him that I’m not experiencing what he is and he got upset with me. I feel so lost and I feel bad that I cannot help him. Any advice would be wonderful!

Does anyone else have similar experiences or any guesses to why? There are other changes but I take them up as normal drunkenness, but I noticeably hallucinate less and I don’t wake up delusional a night after drinking. Any thoughts or knowledge would help I’m just curious as to the reason.",1
Bad case of the “why me”’s,I’m a spiritual person and I am 1000% convinced that I was put on this earth to teach kids. I love my job. It’s my purpose. It’s in my birth chart and i’m good at it. My principal used to want me to be department head of elementary at our school I was that good. But I’m on mental health leave until next year not by my choice. Why would somebody who’s meant to have a purpose like this be made to have schizoaffective disorder. It doesn’t make sense. How can I be a positive influence when I can’t even be there. Towards the end of my time there this year I was consumed by anxiety and paranoia and I was suicidal. How is that good for kids to be around.,1

Should I ask this girl out?,"I’m still on meds (the lowest dose possible), I am unemployed (I sometimes help a bit in my parents supermarket and am pursuing a career in writing, i have written 4 books), and it’s been 3 years since ive been on a date. Theres this girl that works at a grocery store and she is very pretty. I feel like im missing out by not dating, so should I do it? I have no symptoms atm but sometimes I do have the blues.",1
Can anyone relate ?,"So I’ll try to keep it simple in this convoluted long story short as of currently :: so I’m I guess u could say a pseudo caregiver son to my mom , which is paradoxical and etc bc she always wants to help me and not herself . Recently the past 3 years or so she started talking to me as if I was someone else come to find out one of her delusions is that I have a implant in my head and “they” control what I say and do.” Well that’s one thing but not exactly the strangest part is that if she gets on the phone to her mom. She suddenly seems to almost change into the behavior of a child crying etc ? And being she’s suspicious paranoid etc of doctors it’s like I uno I need some kind of advice or something? And mind u this is only a piece of 30 years of this stuff as of late so … opinions experience advice? O and she is super obsessed with control and like keeping me with her or being with me all the time or she’ll freak out",1
Mushroom trip psychosis,"Hey guys, I’m writing this as best as I can because I still feel fragmented- like right and left are not connected- in my body or in the world. I don’t use drugs a lot. I guess you could say all the “weed and mushrooms are the new frontier and they will cure everything” talk got to me. A yer ago I tried a very small dose of weed edibles. I had a full on psychedelic experience where I was stuck in a time loop, nothing was real and time stopped making sense. I had what i now realize is a psychotic break. A year later I still wasn’t recovered. 
This weekend, stupidly, I did mushrooms. I believed all that talk about expanding drugs, how they can only help you, etc. it was even worse. I felt full on fragmentation, I could only talk in the third person referring to myself. I can’t even say it was myself talking, I truly was other people. Even now I feel my left and right brain as separate entities. I experiences the worst and deports terror I could possibly imagine, with no way out. No solution. 
It also confused me even more about time. I’m screaming still whenever I have to think of any temporal concept, time is sideways now. It makes no sense. I can’t function. I feel like I’m not here, time isn’t here, it doesn’t go forward. It’s all jumbled. 
I regret doing this. My brain is broken now forever. Do you feel this time perception with schizophrenia? I don’t have schizophrenia but when I was in college even smoking a little bit made me entirely paranoid, which is why I lost interest in drugs for my adult life. Fuck, even typing this the timeline doesn’t make sense of being in college then later then now.",1
My mothers bones are breaking and the doctor can't figure out why,"I am desperately looking for help and advice. I am the caregiver for my mother living with schizoaffective disorder. My mom is young at 46 years old, was very active, and very stable on her medications prior to these additional medical issues. 

Winter of 2022, Mom sustained a back injury resulting in 4 rib fractures. These fractures are where the rib meets her spinal cord. She was bending over to tie her ice skates when she felt pops and pain. X-rays confirmed the breaks and the doctors assumed this was a one-off occurrence and told her to take it easy so she could heal. She ended up healing very slowly but the pain remained and increased.

She has been sent to an Endocrinologist, has multiple tests done for bone density/degeneration. Countless X-ray/MRIs. Pain clinics. Nothing came back conclusive and the doctor cannot provide an explanation.

Not getting an answer as to why the ribs broke has caused a spiral.

The past 15 ish months have been horrific. Words cannot express the absolute derailment that has happened. Everything from medical delusions, fears that her medical team is trying to kill her,  psychosis episodes, etc. I have not seen my mom this way since right before her diagnosis. I have been advocating for her, booking appointments, speaking with her doctors, etc.

In April, she broke 3 MORE ribs after bending over to tie her shoe. 1 was a re-break, the others were new fractures. Again, doctor has no answers. She has been checked for signs of self-harm and abuse. There are no bruising or anything indicating that is was self inflicted. SHE IS 46 YEARS OLD! Why is this happening? Her medical care has been severely lacking and I wont get into it on this post but IMHO I believe it is because of her disorder that her concerns have not been taken seriously. I know they have performed tests but that took a year for them to be ordered and over 30+ ER visits and many hours of advocacy. 

I have been doing research this whole time and after speaking with a schizophrenia advocacy group, they told me about a linkage between anti-psychotic medications and breaking bones.

**My main question is - Do any of you know about or have experience with anti-psychotic medications leading to unexplainable bone breaks?**

I am desperate to find answers for my mom and am open to any questions or advice. If you need some extra details please ask and I will provide what I can. I didn't want to make this post too long. Thank you in advance.",1
