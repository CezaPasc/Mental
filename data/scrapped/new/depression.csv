"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",1
"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",1
"I'm sick and tired of ""faking it till I make it""","My life is so just slightly not great. I have a job, I live with my mother and my free time is spent however I please. But with the lack of apparent friends and incredibly ill brain I have, I get depressed super easily. Whether it be dwelling in the shame of not going to college or wallowing in self pity and lack of a social circle, I always turn around after a lil bit. I usually end up in trains of thought similar to:

""Nope, I'm fine, might as well be happy, cause lingering in any other feeling does me no good.""

And then I just act completely fine and inevitably feel fine. I'm always cracking up my co workers, making them smile and laugh. But I get so sick of it sometimes. I'm the only damn person who's positive. Despite how depressed I feel when I'm not working. It feels like a role that I've adapted to. And I just keep going with it. 

You can only fake it so much before you get exhausted and give up trying. Trying to act like I'm fine, and/or that things will get better. Cause at this pace, it's not. I barely have anyone in my life that I'm real with. The extent of my social circle is really just friends online, which are great dont get me wrong I love each and every one of them. But being able to see and touch an actual human being is very different. 

Anyways yippee, I'll feel better in the morning after a bit of work. I'm typing this at just before midnight when I have work at 6am",1
I hate how life just doesn’t have a feeling of fun anymore. I can enjoy myself when I’m with friends but once I’m alone again I just feel depressed .,Depression taints everything makes boredom and a feelings of hopelessness cloud everything.,1
i think ab my future and cry,"i’ve never really seen a future for myself. i would always try my hardest to. i never saw myself after high school. it was hard to even believe i would exist past that point. now it’s been 5 years since i graduated. i’ve been playing pretend, not only with myself, but everyone around me. it was convincing enough for a while, but the facade is slipping. that all-consuming emptiness, that void, is growing and when nighttime comes and i’m alone with my thoughts, there’s no escape from it. and i’ve been lying for too long. i’ve dug myself in such a deep hole idk what to do. i need to disappear. i’m failing school STILL. somehow have everyone convinced i’m doing “okay” tho. had hopes of maybe pursuing a career but my brain feels so diseased i don’t know if i can do anything consistently for the rest of my life. it’s sad that the only probable future i see for myself is me rotting somewhere, alone and empty. atleast that way, i wouldn’t be a disappointment anymore. i cant do this.",1
"for fucks sake, a hug could save my life at this point. im pathetic.","i had a good day, or at least i think i did. i cant remember what happened because i've suddenly just been sprung into a depressive state for no reason. im wondering what would happen if i died. if i just ceased to exist. 

i know people would care for a bit, but their pain would subside after a while. it wouldn't last long. it'd be ending all my pain that appears to me in the most inconvenient times, and only causing a small inconvenience to others.

thats not true though and i know it. that'd be selfish of me also. i could never bring that kind of pain onto my friends and family. 

i just want attention. honestly. maybe if someone gave me the love and care i want, i wouldnt feel this way. maybe if someone noticed how shitty i feel, they'd all start to care. 

maybe i'll hurt myself so that they know the pain is real and have a visual.

i'll chicken out. but if it gets to bad, i'm certain that i will eventually resort to a shitty coping mechanism.

i just. want a fucking hug. no one will know that i want a hug though. because i wont ask and no one will notice that i need one.",1
"If I had even just one real friend, I would be happier.","I just want one real, loyal, genuine friend.

I just want somebody that talks to me.

I just want somebody that won't ghost me.

I just want somebody who won't slowly distance themselves away from me for no reason.

I just want somebody who isn't a backstabbing asshole.

I just want somebody who doesn't make excuses.

I just want somebody who cares about me like I would about them.

I just want somebody who is consistent.

I just want one close friend that I can talk to. Just one.

I want to feel loved. My mental health would be better. I hate this so much. I'm tired of being disappointed. I'm tired of crying all day.",1
Gender dysphoria kills,"

My gender dysphoria is the worst, it’s almost killed me before. I’ve told my mom if I have to have my AGAB genitals in high school I will simply die. I cry every day in the shower, I breakdown just by looking at myself.  My family is by no means wealthy. But I read Croatia has great and relatively cheap bottom surgery for anyone above 13 with parental consent. It would be 30k budgeting in plane tickets. Question A: is it a good idea to get bottom surgery this young? (I’ve read about growth and how much skin they need for it) and question B: how the hell does one talk their mother into a 30k loan for this?",1
If I'm not perfect then I don't want to live,"If I'm not where I want to be in life in the next 5 to 6 years or so, have the job I want make my parents proud and be financially stable and be able to be proud of what I have accomplished. I don't see the point in living. Right now the way things are going I don't think that I will ever accomplish something like that, I have terrible grades and don't even know if ill make it to the university that I want to get into. I have always had this urge to be perfect ever since I got into hs and its been killing me mentally and physically, I don't know why I'm not getting good grades I have tried everything but nothing works and ever since this school year started I have completely given up because I don't know what to do and it seems whatever I do is useless or not good enough.",1
Apathy is the true killer.,"It's the strangest feeling. You know your life is turning to shit but you just don't care enough. I am very conscious of the fact that I should feel sad but instead there is just a big hole. disconcerting to say the least. Is this what is feels like to be a psychopath?

This is very debilitating.  I don't get or care to get certain social queues.  My wife cries sometimes about me being this stone-cold asshole but I can't seem to find the right emotion to help her. I just tell her we all have our own problems.  I am a scumbag this I know.  She would be better off with another person.",1
Bpd and suicide.,"I feel the title is self explanatory, a lot of issues being in an Asian household who don’t believe in mental health or my bpd diagnoses, them telling me it’s in my head and that education is the most important thing. Rushing me to finish school. 

“Education first, mental stability later.” 

Boyfriend doesn’t understand and he has a temperament. My mom and his mom have NPD. Mom says it’s all my fault for how I am and which is why people don’t end up liking me, and my boyfriend agrees. Yelled at me in the car today while he explained it. Even though I only recently blew up in front of everyone for the first time. Guess I’m not allowed to crack. 

Taking dbt with an individual therapist. Not working anymore. Sometimes I feel like I need to be emotionless in order to get by but it’s not possible. Everyone is never satisfied, especially with me. 


I think I’m nearing my end and I’m gaining the confidence to do so, just needed to vent because idk what’s the point in seeking advice anymore. 22 years old and I’m ready to go. I’m going to miss my cat when I do go though.",1
If there was a god he would have killed me by now,"Just want to rant because everyone talks about this magical sky daddy that will help you and guide you, but I’ll call crap on it all. I’ve begged whatever is out there to just let me die for years and nothing. It’s all crap and I’m too pussy to do it myself",1
I wanna fucking die already. I know I'm gonna do it someday. Just a matter of when and how.,"Fucking hate my life. No purpose. I can't enjoy things anymore. Can't find any meanings. Can't find ANY reason to get out of bed. I just wanna die and end it all it all feels so worthless. There's no point, I don't think heaven or hell exist and I don't think God exist. I'm just such a worthless human being. No one will ever love me. Nothing will ever give me joy. I tried so fucking hard to enjoy things again and to forget every dumb decision I've ever made. I just.. I hate myself so fucking much I can't stand it. It hurts it hurts so much everything hurts. Living hurts. Breathing hurts. Sleeping is the only thing that I enjoy and I for real just want to sleep forever. It's all too much. I just can't do it. And I try so hard to find purpose, to find an inkling of meaning but I can't. I just can't feel happiness anymore and it hurts so much. I wanna end it all so badly. I can't see myself living past 25. I can't see myself finding love. I can't see myself being happy anymore. I don't see a future of myself. And the saddest thing is I can't just let things be because it hurts so much I can't stand it. I'm not human I'm just a shell. I hope I get into an accident or drink myself to death. I don't wanna feel this way i mean who would but I can't help myself thinking that this is the only way out. This is the worst feeling ever and honestly I can't wish this to anyone even on my worst enemy. I'm not a good person I'm worthless fucking piece of shit coward. I'm such a coward I wish I could just end it all already and just sleep for eternity or whatever the fuck I'm going. Seriously,  I can't take it anymore.",1
i wanna be saved,"i just want someone to save me, i just want a single person to care or love me. i dont want anything else, i dont need any money or shit, i would be fine with being literally homeless if i just had someone else that cared. that is legit the only purpose i see in life, being cared and loved for and loving and caring for someone else. because everything else is just miserable and depressing. but everyone just says you gotta love yourself and you can only save yourself its always the same fucking answer man",1
a note to others,"I hate myself so much, you know that? I hate everything about myself right now. And I don't think it'll change anytime soon to be honest. I've done a lot of bad things. Made a lot of people worry about me. Made people genuinely scared about my safety, made them think that I wouldn't make it. I traumatized my parents so much. They already had to go through so much, and I just added more on top of that. They didn't want to lose their first child, the one they had to work so hard on. I'm a bad person, don't try to tell me otherwise. And it's not like I'm going to kill myself or cut myself or anything of that sort right now. That would mean that I've wasted everyone's time. No, I don't want to kill myself. But I wouldn't mind if I died right now. If life were to take back my soul. I wouldn't beg for a second chance. I'd just say goodbye. I know that's a horrible thing to say, but it's the honest truth for me. There are other things I hate too. The fact that my mental health has gotten so bad that I cannot comprehend anything I read anymore. I can't even comprehend shows or movies. I can't play the games I love. I can't do all of the projects I wanted. I'm basically flunking my classes. My friends probably hate how I'm always joking about wanting to die. Heck, I think even my teachers must be annoyed with me. It's annoying. I'm annoying. I don't like how annoying I am. But I guess I can't help it anymore. It's just how I am now. Useless, annoying, childish, immature, hopeless, burden, dead-weight. I'm so sorry for this. I hate myself. I hate all of this. The person who I used to be is dead, their rotting corpse in this shell of their body.  I hate it. I hate myself. I hate how I treat others. I hate how I affect others. I hate how there's nothing I can do to change it. No matter how many books I read, shows I watch, people I meet, things I play, events I go to - everything stays the same. Nothing changes. I'm still a worthless good for nothing person. I can't do anything. I can't be happy, genuinely happy. I can't make others happy or proud. All I know is how to lie, be needy, and disappoint. I hate myself. And I'm sorry.",1
"Life is precious, but goddamn","It’s important to always know that life is invaluable. Maybe it’s the only thing that really matters. I’ve never been suicidal, I don’t think I ever will be.
But holy hell, man…

It’s hard to stay positive. It’s hard to stay awake.
I manage to lose touch with every good friend I make: maybe I was too much of a downer and got clingy. Or, life just gets in the way, idk.
The people who do stay in my life are narcissistic or apathetic. They keep me around because I’m easy to be around.. that’s as deep as it gets.

My first relationship ended in me being cheated on. My second relationship was with a slob who tried to get pregnant by me without my consent.

I fell hard for a girl 10 months ago, and she fell for me. She was like a princess, I’d never been so smitten. But she lived too far away and we didn’t want to put each other through long-distance. So we cut all contact.

Society is cold and hostile. Nobody trusts each other. For good reason: so many people do everything they can to exploit the crap out of everything they can. So, when a trustworthy person comes along, they get treated like shit all the same. The chance to prove yourself rarely comes along.. and a lot of people just don’t care if you’re trustworthy, they’re too busy trying to exploit you.

Now I’m here, ranting on reddit, because deep down I crave social interaction, despite being introverted af.
But all my social circles have died off, all my friends don’t respond to my messages anymore, not because they hate me, they just forgot.

It’s really just not easy to enjoy life sometimes, it just isn’t. But life is precious all the same. I just wish I didn’t have to tell myself that so frequently :/",1

Lost in life,"It’s 2am and I am very upset right now just pondering like usual and thinking about how lost I am in life. I don’t know what to do with my life, I’m in college right now in a program but my heart doesn’t feel in it I don’t have the desire to want to do it. I came so far with it too I am close to the degree but I have zero motivation to continue it. I dont want to continue and force myself to study for hard courses when I have no desire to. I don’t know what I want to do. I feel stuck. My parents are annoying too and say I need to think realistically and I’m gonna have to do something but I just DONT KNOW. Sometimes I just wish I could disappear and not have to worry about these stupid things. What should I do because I don’t have a clue. I feel like I have no one to talk to that would understand, so here I am.",1
I fall in “love” at the slightest sign of attention and feel like I will never be enough.,The slightest drop of attention is enough to make me attached. When I was younger I had success with girls but as I got older I found that something as simple as a conversation is enough to make me feel emotionally connected to somebody. When I do actually have a connection with somebody I always feel I will never be enough. I decide that I am not what the other person wants before they do. This hurts as there’s been times recently where I knew the other person was interested but I didn’t try to take it further as I’m scared that I am not enough. And now I’m venting on Reddit.,1

I wish I could pull down a big wall around me and erase myself out of everyone’s thoughts or memories. All I do is keep disappointing and flaking on people who love me. I can’t say anything to explain what’s going on in my life or how I feel, and everyone keeps asking for and expecting things. Every time I try to say no, or let people know things are bad, or ask to stop; I’m ignored. So I try to be selfish when I just ignore those things but you really can’t, and then things are even worse.

I’ve been so busy keeping other people afloat, everyone expects me to just keep on trucking because I always do. I don’t have mental breakdowns or public fallout, so my problems don’t appear that bad to people. my whole family has mental conditions & trauma; but we’re all so great at acting like a social class above ourselves and masking that stuff. the outer world has all these expectations because of the roles we’ve played so long, and it’s like I can’t step off the stage.

I hate myself and doubt myself,"I need to vent. 

I don’t like the person I am. 
I hate how quiet and socially awkward I am. I hate how it’s hard for me to express myself. I hate how much anxiety I have. I get anxiety about every little thing ranging from working and talking, to whether another media induced dystopia will overtake every public building I walk into. I’m afraid to die and I’m afraid to live simultaneously. I’m afraid of everything.
I am flawed and defective and unlikable. I don’t feel like people would like me if they really knew me. I feel like I’m defective for being how I am and struggling to express myself. I’m defective for having the mind, ideas, hobbies, thoughts, and feelings that I have. 
I’m stupid and probably the dumbest person on the planet. I make too many mistakes. 
Everyone else is better than me.
I’m lazy. I don’t work hard enough. 
Im a lucky bastard in some ways but I feel so unworthy of everything good sometimes. 
I feel worthless to the world sometimes and like I am an alien trying to blend in to a world that I negatively stand out in. 
I feel like all I do is make mistakes and I do nothing right. Every decision I make seems to be the wrong one. 
I’m defective. 
I’m unlikable due to my personality and the words that come out of my mouth and the way I present myself.

I sometimes get so fed up towards the people around me for never asking if i’m ok.,"I’ve been depressed for the past 11 years, and I’ve had many people (mostly schoolmates) point out that I looked angry/miserable. Yet, no one in my family has ever asked if I’m ok. If I attached a quick selfie of myself to this post to show my general facial expression, all of you would agree that it’s obvious. In fact, it’s so obvious that I’m actually incredibly self conscious about it. I cannot leave the house or be around other people without worrying incessantly about how I’m coming across to people. 

I suppose it’s maybe my fault for not bringing up my issues often, but then again it isn’t because I’ve talked about it a few times in the past without success. Most of what I say gets undermined. I already have a very difficult time asking for help (regardless for what), it takes A LOT of courage for me to make myself vulnerable to people in person. It’s part of the reason why I ventilate on Reddit so often. If the only place I feel comfortable doing so. 

I’m going through one of the most stressful moments in my entire 11 year history with depression right now. No one seems to give a damn. I’m literally on my own here. I get that people are busy with their own problems, so not many people would want to hear me ventilate. But the fact that everyone around me refuses to address the elephant in the room and pretend that everything is fine annoys me. I look miserable, but that’s fine I guess because “that’s just the way that I am”. I don’t ever even hear a “you good bro?” A lot of my depression comes from having a low self esteem. I already feel like I don’t mean shit to anyone. Not being asked if I’m ok, when I’m clearly not only validates that feeling. Why ask for help, when people clearly don’t care to make themselves available. Maybe I’m just overreacting or asking for too much. Idk.",1

I can't even think much on events after they happen, it's just like ""This thing is done now, time to forget the emotions that should be attached to that moment.""

Thus my title, I want to sleep forever. Sleeping is a void where I simply am not conscious. It is concerning that I want this so bad, some of my best moments are when I'm under the influence of something that lessens my consciousness and thus I feel better but sleeping is the ultimate way to get there because well I'm not conscious then. That peaceful moment of nothingness is something I deeply crave and that is concerning, death scares because eternity of nothingness is terrifying if that's what it'll be but the brief moments in sleep are just comforting. I both want that forever but I also feel what makes it special is the fact I wake up and have to suffer being awake and then be rewarded with sleep.

It's sad I know but sure I guess that's why I'm writing this here. Just yeah would be a hell of a lot easier if I didn't chicken out on the suicide attempts I made in the past that's for sure anyway haha.",1

It has been one year since I almost gave up completely and took my life.,"This time last year I was having a particularly bad time. It got to a point that one day, I left work early to get medicines in order to end my life that day. This was right before Mother’s Day and I had also gotten my mom a card so she would have something from me. But as I was preparing to overdose, something in me told me not to.

In the year that has gone by, I have moved countries this January back to where I grew up.I have seen family that I haven’t seen in years, reconnected with old friends, and explored places that I haven’t been to since I was a child. All things that I would have missed if I had gone through with my plans that day.

The first couple of months that I have been back, I reached a new low. I felt overwhelmed with the move I had just made, the rental crisis here in Australia and  trying to sort out transferring universities. I started to have suicidal ideations again but this time I reached out for help. I got the help that I have needed and I am so happy that I have made it to where I am now. I had to put my own personal shame aside so that I could help myself.

To anyone in a similar situation as I was, just wait. I know you probably roll your eyes when people tell you “it gets better”, because I used to be skeptical too, but it does eventually get better. Although I still have hard days and I am not happy all of the time, I have found hope and a purpose. I am glad to still be here today.",1

The Vail Of Death Getting Thinner...,"Please excuse the formatting, I'm using the app. 

When is enough, enough? 

Suicide seems so easy in theory but when it comes down to it, it's a lot harder than it seems. 

The thought of ending it is all consuming. The more I try to not think about it, the more I think about it. 
Every second of every minute, every minute of every hour, every hour of every day. 

I've sat many a day, hopeless, against the wall with the tool of choice in my hand with the resounding voice screaming ""JUST DO IT! IT SO EASY! IT WILL END YOUR PAIN! IT WILL STOP! REST! YOU NEES TO REST. JUST... REST. THIS IS WHERE YOU WILL FIND PEACE! 

Then my emotional support dog will stop me, after which I feel even worse because it's just another thing I cannot achieve. Just another defeat.

I feel so empty, 
I feel so worthless, 
I feel so defeated, 

My thoughts are racing again, 
I can't focus! 
I have no motivation, 
I have no will to live! 

The help available is unaffordable, my meds are unaffordable. 

I'm being crushed under the weight of worthlessness, emptiness and hopelessness.

Worried Mom - How to help my son?,"I have a great, musically talented, smart, funny kiddo. He will be 17 soon. His dad and I aren’t together anymore (about 5 yrs now) but we coparent well. We both have safe loving homes where he is 50/50. We tell him we love him all the time. I’d hug him if he’s let me but at his age he would prefer not. Oh well, fist bumps it is. 

I’ve noticed he’s been really angry/mopey for the last year and it’s gotten worse lately. And when he’s angry/annoyed everyone around him feels it. A short fuse with the dogs that he adores stomping around and short one word answers to questions…or no answer at all like he didn’t hear. The air is toxic. It worries me, and makes me feel like shit at the same time. But this isn’t about me…

His primary Dr recommended antidepressant a year ago which both he and his father were adamantly against. I was over ruled.  

He doesn’t like many kids at school. Says they’re assholes. I thought maybe he was getting bullied? We talked to his teachers and they said he could come to the office anytime he felt frustrated or bad in any way. He will never name names. 

I know he was getting teased about his weight. And for a few weeks I couldn’t get him to eat. That was scary. 

He’s decided he would like to change high schools for his final year. This may help? Or it may be the same ol same old. but I’m willing to try anything!  

He has no interest in doing anything fun with us. Laser Tag, a Summer Vacation of his choice, going to see a movie. He just says “Nah” and goes back to his room. 

He will not talk to his father or me about what SPECIFICALLY is going on. He said,  “Everything sucks and is annoying. Home, work, school I hate it all.” I asked him what I could do to make his home life better as I can control that. He had no specific requests. And I mean I’M WILLING to change anything I’m doing wrong. 

I would like him to go to therapy. And am open to getting him on antidepressants but, again, he has been very against it. It seems like he feels like he would be less of a “man”. Like it’s a sign of weakness to get help. This sucks! I didn’t raise him to shove down his feelings. It also doesn’t help, as I said previously, that his Dad, is against the therapy or meds too. 

Last night everything came to a head and we all talked. His dad said he should take two days to think about what he would like to do. And how we can help. If he doesn’t know what to do, that’s okay too. AND dad said that something needed to happen, like therapy, so he could be happy again. (So glad he said that!) I asked if he’s ever had thoughts of hurting himself and he said no. But is that the truth? 

Today my son said he would like to try medication. He will talk with his dad tomorrow about it. I wish he would do both talk therapy and meds (even for a short time) so he can feel happy again.

I can’t tell my boyfriend,"My parents have told me I play the victim. That I have a victim mentality. That’s why I never tell them anything. I don’t want anyone to think I’m just playing the victim or doing it for attention. I mean at what point does it become true? How many people have to start saying it for you to start believing it? 

I don’t tell them anything. That’s how they always react. My mom says to grow up, my dad says to get off my meds. But nothing ever changes. Not for the best anyway. 

And that’s why I don’t tell my boyfriend. I had an episode. I called him a few times and he didn’t pick up and during that time I decided if I were to tell him I’d be making myself a victim again. I don’t want to burden anyone. Everyone would be better off if I just stayed happy. No one wants me to trauma dump. I’m sure you’re reading this and think I’m playing the victim. I’m typing this and thinking I’m plaything the victim. Maybe I’m over dramatic and doing everything for attention. Maybe. There are a lot of holes in that logic but there’s so many people telling me it that it has to be true right? 

I don’t want to burden anyone anymore. But if I don’t write how I feel I feel like my head will explode. I’m not going to make anyone uncomfortable or hate me. I’m just going to be happy happy happy until I break again. Then we’ll play the game again. Over and over. Until I become happy or permanently break.",1

I feel fundamentally broken to the point where I can't ever be ""normal"". I don't even have a bad life really. I don't have friends, but I have a girlfriend, and a job I don't hate that pays okay. 

I just don't feel *anything*. I don't know what I'm thinking most of the time. Nothing makes me happy, or sad, or even really mad, and I'm constantly in a fog. I don't feel alive, just that I exist.

I don't feel like my experiences are the same as everyone else's experiences, and I can't relate to people. It feels like whatever part of the brain that makes everyone else normal, functioning, feeling humans, I just don't have.

I've felt this way my entire life, and so far no amount of ""getting help"" has changed anything one bit. I'm 24 now and I feel like I've wasted so much time doing and being *nothing*.

“Hell is empty and all the devils are here.”,"Don’t mind me just have some thoughts I can’t quiet down. You don’t have to read this at all. 


Shakespeare was correct about this statement. Our world revolves on chaos, relies on it even to function. I know everyone reading this and on this sub has experienced chaotic times in their lives as we all have. Our experiences may not be equal but we all understand the pain of this world. Some of us better than others but regardless we understand it. Once you understand the world everything becomes meaningless. Sure you could give meaning to things but for what? Eventually everything will perish and that is the single truth of this universe. The reason everyone clings to life is because of desire. Without desire you’re a walking shell and at that point what do you do? Do you find something or someone to desire? Do you continue on realising this truth? Only you can answer these questions for yourself.

I fail at learning every new skill that I try to learn.,"People always say to work on your own skills and improve. But it seems that something is wrong with my brain, because I can't do it.

I wanted to learn to play the piano. I played when I was a child and I wanted to learn again, I even took a class. But I hardly continued to practice, and now I've forgotten everything again.

I wanted to write a novel. I've started several, but never finished a single one. I only made it halfway through Nanowrimo. I have an ongoing webnovel that I haven't updated in three months.

I wanted to learn to draw. I said I would draw one page a day in my sketchbook. Now I can't even draw one line a day, and my drawings look just as bad as when I started out. I only made it to Lesson 2 of DrawABox.

I wanted to learn a new language. I can't keep up with my daily reviews, and I've just been doing them off and on. It's been over five years since I started, but I can't even form simple sentences in my target language. Like, first-grader level.

It seems that I don't have the resolve to learn anything new, and giving up seems like the only reasonable option. It's not just that I don't have the motivation or energy, it's the fact that I literally don't improve when doing it that sends me into a cycle of giving up on my dreams, only to try again later before giving up once again. Has anyone else had this issue?",1
Struggling to fight back,"I'm spending my whole life fighting an invisible illness that will never leave. Every day i struggle and suffer , giving my all just to be barely able to work. Then i go to bed, and repeat. No energy left to be with friends, family or even myself. 
It's been 2 years of hardcore fighting, but i feel like an eternity passed. I see no future or or present.
Sometimes i reach my limit and lose the will to fight, just to go back struggling after a few days. No one cares about me anymore, i'm completely alone and i don't even remember what does it feel being happy.... I can't fight anymore... I don't want to... I'm losing my mind.",1
I think I am having psychotic depression and I am too paranoid for help. What can I do?,"I will try and keep this short. I have been fighting depression for my life and seeing psychiatrists and doctors for around 12 years. I am 35. With my current therapist, over the last 9 months or so he has basically stopped trying to help and simply listens and says he will help me look for a better resource. But every resource referred to me just doesn't take new patients, doesn't take my insurance, doesn't provide the care requested, etc. So I left a voicemail on a potential new therapist machine where I expressed that I was struggling and I was crying quite a bit. Instead of helping, they called a neighboring parish Sherriff dept. who called me and tried to figure out my location so they could pick me up. I made it home and was able to convince her that I am under the care of a psychiatrist and therapist and was simply upset, and never expressed I wanted to harm myself or others. She agreed, finally, that I was safe and we ended the call, and told me that she would not send anyone. But, the cops showed up anyway.

Since then I just haven't been able to trust anyone at all. My therapist has been saying for months I need to do some kind of inpatient program but I cannot defeat the paranoia that I will be drugged into submission and have something horrible happen to me. I am terrified I will lose my job and I have no savings or family or friends as a safety net. I would be homeless. Louisiana, where I live, is very poor and our healthcare is from another era.

I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I can trust any advice or help from the medical field and the more I express this, the worse they treat me, and it keeps becoming a self fulfilling prophecy. I can't call and ask for another therapist. My current therapist does not help. I am terrified that if I ever voluntarily went to inpatient I would never be released or I would be tortured into submission. There's nothing anyone can say to me that will change my mind, and I know that is wrong, but I also know it is true.

How do you ask for help when you don't trust the help? What can I do to convince myself that inpatient facilities are not simply mental jails to ease state suicide statistics? I read so many horror stories online, and I hear so few good ones. And the good ones don't seem to explain very much about what happened there, it's the bad ones that go into detail. I would rather die than go on antipsychotic medication again, because to me the feeling they bring is the worst thing I've ever experienced. It's like truly being undead. I know that isn't the case for everyone, but for me, I just feel like a small eye in my skull peeping into the world, but the rest of my body is something else, controlled by something else, I'm just watching, I no longer exist. And if that's the case, I might as well be dead. Here are all the diagnoses I have been given, but I am not really sure which ones are real:

Major depressive disorder

Double depression

General anxiety disorder

Adjustment disorder

Borderline personality disorder

Avoidant personality disorder

ADHD

ASD

To be clear I am not hallucinating, but I feel that my thoughts are delusional and I have feelings inside me I don't understand and haven't had before, and cannot explain. And of course the paranoia does not stop ever.",1

I’m so god damn jealous that people like him, that there are people that want to be around him. I listen to him talk about the people he met that day and the people he befriended and I think to myself… why can’t that be me? Him and I are both introverts, we’re both autistic and mentally ill, what makes him so much more special than me? I feel so unapproachable but all I want is to make friends with people. Nobody ever comes to me, and I’m too anxious to come to people first. Coming into new places for the first time is a nightmare because I’m either ostracized for being the weird quiet guy in the corner or I’m instantly disliked - only god knows why. I feel like my boyfriend is secretly so embarrassed to be dating me, that he’s embarrassed whenever people see me with him, and it’s an awful horrid feeling.

They want robots. She had the perfect qualifications. Everything. Im just so done with it all. Whats the fucking point. We apply to literally every single relevant position that opens up everywhere on the internet. Im not joking. Yet nothing.

In comparison to me she is actually amazing and impressive as an Industrial Designer/Toy Designer. I am trash. I graduated from college with a polisci degree and wanted to help people in government. I've literally done nothing with my life. Ive taken odd jobs that I could get just to support us through both her bachelor's and masters. Nothing Ive done has offered me any achievements or progress toward anything. What's the fucking point of trying. If she cant get anything I have literally no chance of getting anything. Ive been jobless for years now trying but even volunteering gets me nothing. Life is just a huge punch of disappointment every single day. Why have hope, Why when you know you have no future. There's no point thats why. And no one is coming to help. Thats the ultimate lesson of life. You are a failure and since your poor and never got a chance you will never get that chance.",1

They tell me to just “have faith in God” or “just pray it out” and I think that’s a load of bs. On my bad days they threaten to take me to the ward or emotionally manipulate me into getting better “for them,” but it’s just a mask. If I wasn’t in this timeline, nothing would change.

"Ive been feeling at rock bottom for a while now, and just want to end things","It all started a year ago with my health. My eczema was the most extreme that it had been and it started spilling into other parts of my health. I ended up getting a lot of eye infections, allergies, immune system related infections. I went to a million doctors but to no avail. 

In december / january, i physically couldnt bring myself to go to work. I basically took 2 months off without telling my family or boyfriend. I was so unmotivated because you need a job to sustain yourself in the future, and i no longer saw a future i needed to sustain. 

Ive slowly noticed the joy disappear from my life and ability to enjoy things diminish. I used to be able to pretend like everything was fine and put on the cheerful front like nothing was wrong. Now when im out and around people, i feel hollow, speaking hollow words. 

I accidentally got pregnant earlier this year, and had the abortion several weeks ago. My boyfriend had been supportive throughout, but recently we got into a huge fight, because he thinks the relationship is extremely one sided. I dont blame him, i know it has been. I realise finally that it is due to my depression that i havent had the capacity to give what he needs, but i dont want to lose him. He told me he needs space and time, but i want him to understand where all of this is coming from from my point of view. 

Ive thought about ending things more times than i can count. Ive even looked up how many sleeping pills it takes. Ive thought about the letters i would write, what my funeral would look like. I cant see a world in which i live past 30 anymore. Everything feels so black.

How to Understand Depression?,"I currently have depression, yet I can’t seem to figure out how it’s been affecting me. The only things I know is what people tell me is off about myself, including when I’ve given up on simple things or stopped trying in uni and just allowed myself to do the bare minimum. The drive I had to pursue a future that I can at least support myself feels like it’s gone, and I can’t even get through my remaining classes without dragging it through the mud. I’m so close to graduating, yet everything in me just wants to give up now. At this point, I’m convinced stubbornness to not tap out in my last year is the only thing keeping me in. 

To make matters worse, living with my parents was no longer an option as of this year. I’m supposed to take care and provide for myself entirely, yet I’m bound to be homeless and financially ruined if I don’t get out of this rut. I can’t keep going through school and life with my brain off, trying to protect it anymore. I swear I can’t even fucking think properly, to the point that all my decisions are impaired and I’ve already fucked up my current classes that I did to at least not be idle while unemployed during the summer (which for some reason, I cannot figure out myself since it seems like nobody I apply to will hire me, and I don’t have the energy to apply to everywhere and anywhere). Everything I do feels dysfunctional, even if it’s productive like studying.

Borderline Zombie,"I was dumped by my high school sweetheart (both 23 at the time of the breakup) in February, just a few days after Valentine's Day. I don't fully understand the reason why, but I know it's my fault. I've been trying to move on, but at the same time I don't wanna just.. not talk to her. She and I were originally best friends, and I don't ever want to lose that. I took the breakup really hard and said some things I deeply regret. I haven't heard from her since March and I'm afraid she'll be mad if I try to talk to her again.

As hard as I try to move on, something always comes up to smack me like a ton of bricks and send me spiraling into a depression so suffocating I can barely function. I force myself to keep moving because I'm also in debt and I have to deal with that. I doubt I'll actually off myself, but I wouldn't mind dying. I don't feel alive at this point. Physically I'm moving and I'm all there, but I feel like I'm drowning inside",1
Garbage,"I don't deserve happiness. When I get happy, I feel like I just hurt those around me. I don't deserve anything. I'm such a piece of garbage of a human being. It's fine if I am alone. It's fine if no one is ever going to love me. I wish I can just disappear. I fucking hate myself.",1

My memory loss caused by depression drives me crazy,"Before I suffered depression, I had so good memory abilities and I could remember one page of my academic notes within three minutes (not bragging) and got A grades in every exams.

But now, with my worsening depression symptoms, my brain’s functions are so bad, especially when it comes to remembering things, which makes me feel that the young and clever me was just a dream. 
I have to switch back and forth many times between different phone apps just to fill in a 6-digit verification number. I could recall nothing from what I did one hour ago. I read one sentence, but they turned into endless grey void after I read the next one. Not to mention remembering and understanding those difficult academic terminologies and solving exam questions. 

I feel overwhelmingly lost. It has taken such a long time of medical treatment to push me back to school, but now I failed at the first step.",1

I haven't been able to cry for a very long time...,Its been what 4 years since I last cried. Even when I need to cry or try to cry I cant cry and I'm not sure if its due to past trauma or if its just a thing that naturally happens to most people.,1
I (33F) just lost the relationship to the love of my life (34M) bc of his depression,"It's been 3 days and I am still in so much pain I can hardly stand it. I met my now ex almost a year ago. We have overall had a great relationship. We were so much alike and so good to each other. I've never met anyone like him and genuinely saw myself being with him for the longterm. The only issue we really had is that he would get very, very low because of depression. He had no energy, sometimes for weeks on end, had consistent feelings of emptiness and numbness, and overall would be very hopeless about life in general. He has said a few times that though he isn't necessarily suicidal, that he wishes he had never been born. He will sometimes withdraw from reality and just lay around. I would sometimes get mildly upset about this, especially in the beginning, bc I thought it was bc of me. But then he explained he has dealt with this his whole life and if anything our relationship is actually helping him feel better. I overall have been very supportive and understanding since he explained things to me. 

Some back story that I think is important: he was married before. He was with his ex wife for nearly a decade all together, 3 of those years married. He packed up his life and moved a few states away to support her career and paid all the bills while she was going to school. He said after the marriage, she completely flipped on him. She became very insecure, controlling, always accusing him of cheating (I can tell you now he is the type that would never cheat) and even tried to cut him off from his family. She was always telling him his teaching job wasn't good enough and he needed to make more money. He wasn't allowed to have friends or do anything without her present. Well one day he flew back home to visit family while they were going through a rough patch. She called him and over the phone told him she was divorcing him, not to come back to the house other than to gather his things, and then cut off all contact. He is such a sensitive person and i cant even imagine how painful this was for him. He is pretty certain she was cheating with a wealthy guy she married about a year after they split. Bc his teaching contract wasnt completed, he still had to go back, get a crappy apartment, and wait out the school year in a state where he knew noone and had no support.

I am the first relationship he has had since this. We started dating about 2 years after they split. He said he's dated a couple other people since, but I'm the first person that made him want to try a relationship again. Over time, he's made comments like ""I feel like you're going to meet someone else with more money and realize you don't want me"" and ""you're going to realize one day I'm not as great as you think and leave"" and ""I am going to disappoint you like I do everyone else."" I always assured him that those are intrusive thoughts and totally untrue. I adore him and want to work on any obstacles we encounter in life as a team.

Well Saturday evening, I was pms'ing and got emotional asking why he doesn't talk about the future much with me and was worried he wouldn't be able to emotionally move on with me. While I know he loves me, he does sometimes have issues being vulnerable and letting himself be emotionally deep bc of what happened to him and bc of his depression. I told him I wanted to go home for a little bit for some space and about and hour later I called him. His voice sounded different than I've ever heard. He went from sounding like my sweet boyfriend to this cold, stern person I've never heard before. Its like he snapped. He said he could not be in a relationship anymore bc he is bringing me down and he is so empty and numb that he can't even take care of himself, much less me. He said he can tell I'm down bc of him and he loves me too much to keep disappointing me. I told him to come over and he did. I thought once we talked face to face that everything would be ok. It wasn't. He was firm in his decision and left me there crying after an hour of talking. He kept saying he isn't right for me and that I am amazing and will find someone not screwed up that can give me everything I deserve. When I asked why he sounded so different, he stated he had ""shut down"" as a defense mechanism and that it was the same thing he did in his marriage when things got bad and that his ex couldn't take it.

The only contact we have had since was me calling him the next day asking about things. He still sounded so cold and said it was for the best that we breakup. I am devastated. I never thought in a million years this would happen. We never even fight. No relationship is perfect and when you love someone you help them through things, and that is what I want to do for him but he won't let me. 

He is an amazing, selfless human and I would never leave him like she did. I love and appreciate everything about him. 

Have any of you ever been through this?
Does anyone have advice on how I can navigate this? I am really struggling right now. And comments or perspective would be appreciated. I am trying so hard to make sense of it all. 

TLDR: My amazing relationship with my boyfriend ended bc of his depression and past relationship trauma. I am devastated and don't know if he will come back.",1
Medication change?,I have been on citalopram for my anxiety and depression for years. Recently it changed to celepram which is meant to be the same. But ever since the change I have just felt so depressed and all I can do is cry.I know correlation isn't causation but i can't think what else. I had started being a bit anxious and stressed about work but thus feels different and unrelated. Anyone had the same? Any ideas?,1
What medication stops emotions,"I don’t wanna feel anything anymore I feel like it would be better to just be a husk and not feel sad or happy or mad or anything I tried to see what I could get easily but it’s very hard to find out what stops emotions.

Throughout my life I’ve been various shapes and sizes yet no one has shown interest in me,"I used to be obese . Guys were disgusted when they’d have to sit next to me, even the fat ones. I felt sorry for them because they had to see me .

Then, I developed an eating disorder and became underweight ( can we even call it an ED tho ? I was obese, some of it was needed) . I felt a bit more confident at first , bit eventually it wore out, I was just as depressed as before . Still, no one was interested in me. The ones who congratulated my weight loss were all girls . I tried making the first step, all of my 3 attempts were rejected . I felt ashamed: how could I even think of going out with someone, didn’t I look in the mirror to see how ugly I am ? Those guys were probably looking for someone better, why would they settle for me ?

Now, I developed binge eating disorder. I already gained half of my weight back. I am more depressed than ever. I keep fighting and fighting but I just want to give up . Call me selfish , but I just want someone to like me, romantically, and not in a friend way . But the sad truth is that will probably never happen. My chances of finding someone keep getting slimmer as binge eating takes over my life . 

And I know, I know, love has many forms , not just romantic blah blah . Obviously, I love my parents and my sister, I could sacrifice everything for them and I am SO thankful to have them, because not everyone is blessed with a family . 

But I don’t know, I just want to experience being in a relationship. Don’t ask my why. I have no idea either .

I just want a normal life, but at this point, I’d be better off dead . All I do is waste resources. Sucks that I’m way too chicken to actually kill myself. 

This rant is getting nowhere but I have to get these things off my chest",1

I might be going to a partial hospital program and I’m very anxious about what will happen after I go.,"I (20F) have been struggling with major mental health problems ever since I was a young child. My mom (50F) had a conversation with my psychiatrist and told me I have to go to a in person partial hospital for several weeks because of my declining mentality. 



I don’t want to take my own life because I want to be there for my loved ones. I just feel like I’m going to lose my mind one day due to my tension and my undiagnosed mild anger issues. I swear to god if I don’t do well at the partial, I will bottle up everything and never talk to my parents about my feelings anymore.",1
Is this sa (dad),"Okay so this has messed with me for a while and I'm still really confused and feel sick writing this. Idk what to think or what to call this. 

From the ages of around 14-18 my dad used to do this weird creepy thing around once a week.

I would be laying on the couch and he would walk up to me very slowly, slowly look at me head to toe, head to toe, head to toe, and his arms would slowly come up, and then when he finally got to me he would quickly grab either my upper inner thigh, or the place where the top of my upper thigh meets my hip. 

It always seemed sexual to me, and he would never grab me anywhere else when he did this thing. When I saw him coming up to me to do this I'd call my two little dogs up and put them on top of me. There was a couple times where he asked, ""what did you think I was gonna do?"" (Making me think he knew what he was doing?) But I can't know his intention, so I don't know what to think about it. But when I moved out I stopped talking to him for the most part because it seemed sexual to me and it weirded me out and changed how I think about him. 

He also asked me multiple times as a teenager if I masturbate, to which id pretend like I didn't know what it was or  I thought only guys did that just to brush the question off. 

He'd smack my ass a lot, and one time I said please don't do that and he did it several times as I tried to walk away from him. 

It's so confusing to me because this isn't molestation, I don't even know if I should call this sexual assault. All I know is that it's had a major affect on me.

 I wasn't going to tell anybody, but then in 2019 I had a phycological break where I heard a demonic voice tell me I was going to hell (never had anything like that happen before) and I was convinced I was going to die so I just opened up about everything I was hiding. It told my mom dad did something weird, she asked what is was, i didn't know how to tell her. Then she told my grandma (her mom) and they both came up to me and asked what he did, I freaked out and told them he took me in the garage one day and cut both of our hands and smashed them together (which did happen) but I told them that so I didn't have to say the other stuff. My grandma rolled her eyes and seemed mad like I made a big deal out of nothing. 

I eventually told my mom what happened and she pretty muched brushed it off and now I feel like shit because to them it seems like I just wanted attention.

Anyway, my dad died last year unexpectedly from multi-organ failure. When he was unconscious I told him I forgive him, even though I never talked to him about any of this. but I'm still left with these weird feeings. I still want my dad and the relationship we had, minus the stuff that made me feel weird. He was the most similar to me out of my whole family and I love him very much. Half of me is angry at him, and the other half of me tells me I was being dramatic and I should have just let it go so I didn't waste the last years I had with him. I just don't know what to call this. I don't know why I even want to label this. I have a hard time letting this go and it's very confusing to me. Thanks for reading if you got this far.",1
Trigger warning - attempt at taking life,"My teenage sibling attempted to take their life last night, we have of course referred them for counselling but I would be really appreciative of any advice on how to go about talking to them about this, is there anything I should/shouldn’t say to them about this?

I’m worried about my little sister,"Hello.. It’s my first time using this app to ask for advice because I seriously do not know what to do. I’m a sister (20) who has a little sister (16). My little sister is diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder and was doing therapy session and taking antidepressants. She was doing so well for 2 months after she decided to stop her medication. She stopped it without consulting her therapist. I didn’t realise this until she started withdrawing heavily from it.
She is currently feeling really sad and having mood swings. The thing that triggers her withdrawal symptoms is her being at school.

These past few weeks, she had a difficulty waking up to go to school and my mother gets mad at this. She wouldn’t wake up when my mom is trying to wake her up. She would groan and doesn’t get up. My mom (58) gets pissed because she cares about my sister’s education and feels like she would fail as a mother if she doesn’t have her daughter continue school.
My mother is also diagnosed with depression but takes her medication
however, I don’t think she understands what my sister is going through and can say things that I’m sure she doesn’t mean to.

I’m honestly really scared on what my sister is going to do.

She used to self-harm too but now she is doing it again..
she is also having suicidal thoughts and I’m worried she might take action.

What can I do to make her feel better but still proceed to going to school 
I know that it’s best for someone who has depression and having withdrawals to stay at home and heal better
but it is also an issue if she falls behind in her classes 
The school doesn’t seem to care either about it. I live in the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and mental health is not cared about in high school.
So I genuinely do not know what to do.

The plan so far is that she is booked again to see her therapist but it is next week and idk what i should at the moment.

I have a not a specific question to provide for you to answer. I just would like to know what someone would do if you are going through the same thing as me.",1

I feel like I’m never gonna be okay,"I’ve been losing so many people in my family in the past few years, and my mom has been suffering with dementia for about 10 years now. I’ve been repressing these feelings and trying to act normal for years. The past 3 years my mom has been in a center, I live alone and spend all my free time in my bed doing absolutely nothing. It’s been hard to clean, take care of myself, go out. It got a lot worse recently because I lost my childhood pet. I’ve been going down a spiral and I think I’m in a major depression. I cant eat, I dont wanna do anything. I’ve lost 13 pounds in 2 weeks. 

i’ve been on medication for over a year now, and my doctor added a second one last week. I’ve been seeing her and a social worker. But nothing is getting better. The way I feel now is unbearable. I’m trying to make efforts, seeing a psychologist, having more regular meetings with my social worker, forcing myself to go out with friends and family on my days off. But even when im with people, I feel like crap. I have this feeling im a bad person and I don’t deserve to have friends I don’t deserve to have fun. I always think they probably hate me and think im horrible. I even tell them why I think im a bad person and they just try to calm me down and say its nothing. 

How much longer do I have to be depressed? It’s been years. And this feeling of worthlessness and guilt and shame, it’s no way to live",1
Any time I don't have a distraction I just cry,"Why is this? I don't want to be at work but the thought of going home is worse. I will just go for a walk so I don't have to go home. What's at home? Eat some food, scroll on my phone, read a book, sleep? Wtf, it feels so empty and boring. I don't enjoy music anymore. I barely enjoy my hobbies anymore. I don't enjoy going to my favourite places anymore. I like being alone so I know it's not about wanting company. If I had an all expense paid luxury vacation I'd feel the same. If I had a mansion with house cleaners and all the groceries I want it would be the same. If I didn't have to work it would be the same. I feel uncomfortable at existing. If I let my distracting thoughts stop for one second I start crying. I don't really want to die and I'm scared to die but it feels like I'm incompatible with life. Like I'm having an allergic reaction to it all the time. I feel less real than everyone else. I want to disappear without it hurting or doing it myself. I want someone to shoot and kill me while I sleep.",1
Am I in denial?,"If people treat me like they think I'm sad/messed up I'll pretty much have negative thinking, sometimes very negative thinking (as far as wanting to off myself). When they treat me normally I don't feel bad. Are they causing me to feel bad or is it me? Am I in denial or is everyone treating me like there is something wrong with me bringing me down?

Edit: I'm sure I wouldn't off myself to be clear it's just suicidal ideation.",1
Struggling with Mental Health and Failing Driving Test Twice: Need Advice and Support,"Today, I failed my driving test for the second time due to ongoing mental health issues. When I turned 16, my mother urged me to start driving to reduce future car insurance costs. However, my anxiety and depression, diagnosed at 16, made me delay obtaining my license until I turned 18. Throughout my life, I have experienced various forms of therapy, seeing nine different therapists since third grade. In one of my therapy sessions, a psychiatrist recommended medication to manage my disorder. Unfortunately, my mother declined. I needed parental consent to take it since I was still a minor. I'm thinking that my struggles with school, road tests, and other necessities stem from a lack of access to medication and strong family support. Now that I'm 18 and can consent, I can't afford mental health help. Despite my fears about driving, my entire family insisted that I learn to drive. Their gossip made me feel like a failure for being afraid of driving. On my first driving test, I failed due to speeding at a dip. The examiner's yelling from the start increased my anxiety. Today, I had a kind examiner. I stopped at a 4-way stop sign. However, someone to my left was speeding. My nerves got the hang of me as I drove, thinking I could pass them, but my examiner had to brake. She informed me that I had only four errors, including one critical error. She realized that I had a severe anxiety disorder based on my reactions and offered some suggestions to pass the test. Her kind words made me feel less hatred for myself. However, I still bawled my eyes out at home because my instructor downplayed my mental health issues, saying I was simply making reckless decisions and that it had nothing to do with anxiety. Next time, I should expect that Californians can't drive properly and cheat at a 4-way stop. I am scared that I will get a stricter examiner the next time and have to apply for my permit again. I hate that my family ridicules me because my younger sisters drive better than me. I also wish that my family would understand that I'd rather take public transportation than put my life at risk by engaging in something I dislike. In the future, I plan to move to a more affordable state or country with better public transportation options even if I attain my license. Once I pass my driving test, I will still use the bus. However, I'm doubting my chances of passing the driving test on my third attempt. It feels ironic that as a Psychology major, I'm seeking advice from others in this situation.",1

Mentally ill are tormented at clinics in Florida.,"I have major depressive disorder for many years. But I am not suicidal and have never attempted suicide. But I was locked in the Citrus Health Network by the Baker Act and kept under stress for 29 hours.  They threatened me, exacerbated all my phobias, brought me to a big panic attack and a heart attack. They forced me to sleep on a very hard bed in a terrible cold, although I warned them about the big problems in my spine. I could hardly move from the pain and could not sleep. After this ""medical care"", my life is broken, but no one answered for these crimes. When I tried to sue them, the state court dismissed my case because Citrus uses the federal budget, after which the federal court dismissed the case again because everything happened because of the Florida state law (Baker Act)! There was a catch 22. The judicial system does not allow to judge the tormentors! Where is the justice? Where is the humanity?

I just don't know what to do,"I dont know what to do

I'm 17 and my life has never really been useful, i spent most my teenage years getting physically and mentally abused by my parents and for the last few months I've been wondering if ive developed depression. I can't remember the last time i genuinely smiled and i dont enjoy the things I used to like. I've been contemplating running away from home and starting off somewhere fresh recently as I still live with my parents and they are no doubt the main cause of my issue

ive been born into a life where my parents are in severe debt because of an accident before i was born and i work 2 jobs per day, just to help them pay off their debt and it'll be fully paid off in about 6 years from now if i keep going, but frankly im not sure if I'll survive for a single more year. it's not nice to work your ass off after a long day of college, work 2 jobs and still not be able to buy the things you want to buy, because all my money goes to my parents debt, and frankly I dont want to throw my life away for this.

I know it's not right to abandon my parents as they aren't able to work anymore and their massive debt, but ive spoken to a few people and the general gist i got was 'you need to think about your own life', so i thought on it and I've done nothing to deserve this life that im living, and I'm genuinely baffled on what i should do in this situation. the family i live with is extremely toxic and i dont like it here but i also feel a strong sense of responsibility as the older sibling, and i know my younger sister wont be able to deal with it if i disappeared one day.",1
acceptance isnt always the direction you want. even if its to kill yourself.,"i had a big episode this weekend. honestly i thought i was doing better. did ketamine therapy. worked out. lost tons of weight. quit alcohol and weed. went to socialize. went to free classes. took my med diligently. up’d my dose. never missed therapy sessions. but i was still feeling the void. i felt pointless. 

i talked to my therapist. i wanted to find a reason to live. but things i did didnt seem to work the way. i thought life was like an algorithm. i felt like i did everything right. she couldnt quiet respond to my pessimism. i asked her “isnt this to stop me from killing myself? to find a reason to live?”

My starts just like a lot of people born to two parents that weren't at all compatible, nore where they ready to have a kid how do I know that you ask? Simple my parents fought a lot when I was a baby and kid right up until I was about 5 at some point my father hit my mother or so she claims I don't know the facts and they divorced soon after which you know fair enough no one should stay together if that's the relationship no I have no problem with that. 
What I have a problem with is that instead of ether of them taking me and raising me they both just dumped me with my grandparents and said have fun. Mind you my mother would go on to steal my childsupport as long as it was coming in I never saw a dime and funny how that's the less fucked up part the real fucked up part is the fact she left me with my grandparents.
Which your probably thinking whats so bad about that? Well what's wrong with that is she knew my grandmother was an abusive fucking monster it's why she got amansipated at 16 at left the house.
Like bitch jumped ship herself but left her 5 year old son to fend for himself. 
So predictably as anyone could guess the abuse started after that. But twist I didn't start in the way you might imagine. At first it just started with trying to make me into the perfect little child oh all the adults would love me 💌 they would all say what a well behaved kid oh he's so smart this that and the other. Little did they know I was so damn perfect because if I wasn't I should get my ass beat screamed at and anything else you could imagine I was just my grandmothers little living trophy.
I was dragged all around to adult party's with nothing to do but sit around and be presentable I could talk with adults because it was an adult conversation I couldn't watch TV because it was rude to do that as someone's place or around guests I couldn't play games because that was disrespectful to others mind you I was a kid not a teen a kid. 
Oh also did I forget to mention she constantly didn'tni allow me to have friends I was totally isolated from  kids my own age so that as I grew older I had no idea how to interact with kids my own age for the longest time until I was in high school in fact and even then I needed her seal of approval. But i am getting ahead of myself here.
So my childhood keeps going on and I get sent to one of the worst school in the whole of the United States its has been in the national news multiple times for gang fights. As you might imagine awkward nerdy kid with no social skills makes for an easy target for kids to try and bully what you might not have expected was that nerdy kid was taught to fight by his grandfather to protect myself and encourged to do so infact. So I ended up getting in a lot of fights and I do mean a lot. Now what you might not have expected even more then that though was that fact that my evil bitch grandmother would in fact not take my side for defending myself and would in fact both blame me and punish me for doing so.
So needless to say I grew to resent and hate her for both the physical abuse when she hit me the verbal abuse when she called me things like demon child and the mental abuse of telling me one thing but when I actully did it getting punished for it. And when she wasn't beating me or yelling at me what she would do was lock me in my room no books no TV no games no cards nothing just empty room. And to be fair when school was in, it was fine but when it was off on break. Man did it fucking suck I would just go days or weeks without human interactions except for them which as you might imagine a kid doesn't want to interact with his abuser very much so I just didn't interact with anyone except sometimes my grandfather when he wasn't to tired from work. 
And that went on for years until I was in highschool and then suddenly my grandmother this evil woman I hated suddenly got and man let me tell you what a complicated set of emotions that was because I might of hated this woman for all the abuse but at least she raised me which was just a tad more then I could say about my own parents. So I ended up taking time off my senor year of highschool taking care of her just barely being in school enough to graduate. Great am I right? Finally out of that hell hole? Nope because now comes the real mental anguish. My grandfather who never asked me for most anything asked me to take care of my grandmother so that we could save money so she could get treatments and he could go to work. 
As you might imagine I wasn't exactly happy about that arrangement but I agreed to it because he's one of the few people who treated me like I mattered in my family. So I waste a few years of my life taking care of her she gets better at time and then suddenly takes a turn for the worse and I experience all the horrors cancer and cancer treatment do to a person from the throwing up, hair loss  agonizing pain, and anything else you can imagine only to have her die anyways. Now me being the stupid stupid bastard I am manged to get ahold of my mother because I thought she deserved to be their before her mother died worst fucking mistake of my life. Now you might be asking how's that the worst mistake that's simple I had compassion for another person who was hurting at lose because even though my mother and my grandmother couldn't be in the same room without fighting I knew they loved each other. So I make the hospital let her in to see her on her death bed my wishes where honored. she used this as an opportunity to manipulate me into feeling pity for me now fast forward a few years into the future and I invite her to live with me in my grandmother and grandfather's house because he was moving out because it was to painful for him to live here but he didn't want to kick me out so he left me to pay for the house instead. So I figure win win I get my mom to live with me and we can try repairing are relationship and all she has to do is pay real cheap rent and her and my brothers all get a nice house to live in. 

SEE THIS THIS RIGHT HERE ⬆️ THIS IS WHERE I FUCKED MYSELF THE HARDEST

So she and my brothers move in the first thing that starts happening is they all start trashing the house they refuse to clean up after themselves they eat my food mind you I have a fridge in my own room so they had to break in and take my stuff knowingly, and she also refuses to correct my younger siblings behavior because she let's them do whatever they want and doesn't want me to do anything about it ether mind you again this is my house. So it gets so bad that I have to kick her out but mind you it's to late they have trashed my house and I now have a roach problem she broke one of the bedroom doors and door handles changed the lock and handle on another one aboned one of my siblings at my house and refuses to come get him and cps won't do shit. But at least she's out mind you while this happens my current gf who was just a friend at the time saw all this happening and felt bad for me and loved me even if I was to stupid to see it at the time. So time goes on with me struggling then I lose my job get super depressed end up in some amount of debt and I want to die. But she doesn't give up on me and she shows me she loves me in a way that even someone as stupid as me can understand. She supports me and gets me back on my feet enough so I can get a job again and all the while I don't notice she's putting herself in debt to help me. So finally realizing she loves me clearly and doesn't just want somthing from me I asked her out we start dating and I ask her to live in my house ya it still has problems but I say we can try to mange it together we can't because she has put herself in debt trying to help me and so we just try working on getting are stuff together but stuff keeps going wrong. For starters as soon as she moves in the well water pump brakes so we have to fix that then after this on my way to work a guy T-bones me totals my car I use a decent portion of the money to try catching back up on some of the house payments I missed and I hold on to the rest to try to get us through stuff because I stupidly think she has a car we can share not realizing what a burden I am putting on her. Because now we have to make are schedules always work for each other. So I have now placed this girl multiple times under distress because she loves me worthless ass. Mind you she is putting up with roaches we can't seem to get rid of no matter how hard I try or how clean we keep the house. And now she's left to her mother's house rightfully so because she can't take living here anymore I was forced to buy a car with no money saved for one with credit that hasn't recovered yet so that I can keep working so I can try to keep my house feed myself and not be homeless all while trying to deal with the houses problems and trying to not lose my gf because I have made her life harder just by loving me. So now I have negative 147$ in my bank 5$ on my credit card left a 600$ payment for my car coming up no money for food no family to turn to crippling anxiety crippling depression and an intense desire to kill myself all while knowing I won't kill myself. I don't have an idea of how to evan start helping myself and if I am honest with myself I know I can do nothing for myself here I just have to be forced to watch as the little bit of life I have tryed to carve out for myself crumbles like ash in my mouth leaving nothing but a bitter taste in my mouth.

This is my life story or at least a large part of it I suppose. I don't know why I wrote this I don't know if anyone will care probably not. Not many have before. Honestly this just might be my last dying gasps for help but I am not even sure I want help as much as I just want all my hurt to go away to be able to be loved and love someone else without so much going wrong. To be able just just live......... but I probably won't get even that wish. Life real is just a sick cruel joke.

I honestly don't want people to be concerned about my state of being, and if I told them I was going to commit suicide they would try to stop me and hinder my plans.

Not feeling a sense of purpose,"In theory, I’m a pretty ambitious person - I’m studying to be a social worker, I volunteer, I care a lot about social issues,  I crochet, blah blah blah - but a lot of the time I kinda feel like it’s not really me doing all this, or at least not doing it for myself. I do care about the world, and other people, and there are things that genuinely make me happy, but when I pull back and think about it, I sort of feel like an automaton. I don’t really feel any driving force to achieve my goals, I just do stuff because I feel like that’s what I should be doing. 

I recently got hired at a job I applied to, and I had to pretend to be excited when I told my parents because they were thrilled and I felt like I should be too. Now I’m going through the motions of onboarding and training, and it just feels like it’s not really me doing it. I don’t dissociate as far as I’m aware, but I’ve been getting this weird detached feeling with pretty much everything I do, and I hate it. Not sure what to do about it except keep trucking along and hope that I just miraculously wake up one day feeling like my heart is finally in it.

I don't compare to my peers at all (Rant),"My Mom even said it. I don't compare to anyone else my age (17) everyone else is driving, going on dates, fucking, and enjoying their lives. While the most eventful thing that has ever happened to me besides going to school and being at home was going to a mental hospital for trying to kill myself. I told my only irl friend (out of the 2 friends I have) that if things continued to not work out I will kill myself by the end of the year. And he told me to go on a drug binge before I go and completely respected my decision. That's when I realized why I told him that. I wanted to know if he'd talk me out of it or give me solutions to my problems or at least showed he cared. I feel so defeated nothing has ever gone my way. I try to dedicate my time to hobbies but I never succeed in acquiring new skills because I'm basically immune to learning or grasping concepts above the 7th-grade level. Why do other people get the things I want without any friction?

It's been three years like this, the idea of keep living this way makes me lose my mind.
I'm soon starting my master degree but I don't even care, I'm sure I'll just have lot of problems and I'm too stupid to continue in my field. I'm mediocre at everything.
I'm struggling to concentrate even just to watch a movie, let alone studying.
Suicidal thoughts are back and stronger than ever and I'm alone, I just have my boyfriend who doesn't care that much about me and I have almost no friends.
Almost nobody would miss me.
A few months ago my boyfriend's friend (he was my friend too even if not super super close) took his own lives leaving all of us so shocked, we all loved him so much, he had a girlfriend who clearly loved him and a wonderful family.
I feel so bad to be still alive while he's not here anymore, he still has so many people that care about him. 
I just keep thinking that maybe if I had offed myself before, maybe just maybe he wouldn't have done the same. I don't know why I keep thinking this. Maybe if I hadn't been invested so much in my own depression I would have noticed his.

I need advice. badly.,"Im going to try to keep this as comprehensive and to the point as possible. I dont feel loved by anyone, and i oftentimes question why i continue to live. It has costed me several jobs and my sanity when i came to realize the most important aspect to life is about love, and even though i had my heart completely broken by someone who i thought loved me but actually betrayed me, i still have the innate desire to find someone who completes me. i know that love must come from within before you can love another, i just feel so distraught because my partner who i was smitten with betrayed me, then spreaded gossip about me to further shame me and my reputation. that alone id think would drive anyone crazy, but on top of that, my own family has been mentally abusing me for years, and im just starting to understand why i am the way i am. they told me I was being abusive, when in reality i was gaslit, and now i feel so depressed and alone. my brother is a piece of shit addict who keeps lying, stealing, and backstabbing me, but i try to continue to help him in spite of that because i love him so much. at this point i realized that if i stayed, it will only drag me down more, but inside, i know that if i left or my family left, hed be dead within a few weeks, which compels me to stay to help at the cost of my mental well-being.  


tl;dr: I grew up in a dysfunctional and hostile household. non-biological grandfather was an abusive alcoholic who manipulated people for a living, and did so to my grandmother, who in my mind, was the most selfless and beautiful person i met, because she made me feel like she actually loved and cared for me(unlike my own mother), but she got cancer, and i watched her die in the worst way possible. after her death, said grandfather basically stole my familys inheritance, and my mom, brother and i were left with very little even though it wasnt his right to take. my house was financed by my actual biological grandfather, who by comparison, was highly intelligent and caring. he died of cancer at age 32, so my grandmother being in a vulnerable state, made the mistake of marrying that piece of shit... he ended up dying not too long ago, a couple years after my grandmothers death. after that background, i was very likely cheated on, and used by the woman i thought loved me. my brother overdosed 2 times, and i saved his life both times while he continues to steal from me and berate me. my family betrayed me by not being there for me to show emotional support or love, and theres a specific incident in mind that id rather not share online, but it did happen, and basically my mother refused to tell people the truth of what happened because she was selfishly afraid, so instead of telling  people the truth, she pretended she didnt know what i was talking about, and i made myself look crazy and stupid. my fathers been dead since i was 11, and i still remember the cryptic and depressing things he said before he died. my uncle is probably the only person who shows love, but even then i feel like he thinks im some kinda joke since im not independent yet, even though im on the cusp of it. theres many other examples of emotional trauma that i went through but it would be pages long. in short, it feels like no one in my life truly loves or cares about me, and it makes me question the point of living in itself. I know that i deserved some of the bad things that happened to me, because i realized how toxic i was BEFORE, but that doesnt mean that i am NOW. i learned. not saying im suicidal, im just saying that the pain my past and current situation has created has been overwhelming, and im just expected to ""man up""... WHATS THE FUCKING POINT IF I HAVE NO ONE TO LOVE OR LOVE ME?! seems like society is mentally abusing the fuck out of men, because apparently women are never wrong in america, and if youre failing at life, then the whole world will ruthlessly scorn, judge and shame you over things that you feel like are outside your realm of control.",1

Bad sleep triggers depression?,"Lately, it seems that the main trigger for my depression is bad sleep, not even sure if it's bad sleep or not. The thing is, it typically happens after I wake up, usually when I wake up and then decide to snooze for some time, then I wake up in a horrible mood and it seems to have all the typical depression symptoms. The bad mood seems to get worse throughout the day time. I usually I'm unable to get any work done and just wait for sleep time to hopefully reset whatever imbalance has happened in this broken brain. Usually after one or two nights things start to align again. I can't think of any triggers for these ""bad sleep"" nights.

All my problems cone from autism. Which means that I can’t solve them.,"I’ve worked so hard on improving myself. I’ve gotten through and over PTSD and borderline personality disorder.

My life improved a lot.

But the one thing I kept going back to therapy for, was my inability to relate and connect with others. I’m extremely extroverted. the only time I’m truly happy is when I’m able to have a lot of people in my life, go to events, and meet new people. 

But I got diagnosed with autism, and suddenly everything made sense. 

No matter how hard I try, I just can’t connect with people. I easily meet new people; and then that’s just sort of it. There’s no click. I don’t really have friends. They don’t last. Ever.

I don’t have family. I’m the black sheep.

And sure, you can improve symptoms if autism, just like how plenty of people in wheelchairs can walk for a short amount of time and plenty can improve their life and work around it. 

But, if the one thing a person in a wheelchair loved to do is running: then what?

If I were introverted then this wouldn’t be a problem. But I can’t solve my problem. And anyone who knows me, knows that I’m always looking towards the future. I always come out fine. I always make it through. I’m extremely determined and optimistic. I’m always uplifting and always willing to work towards what I want.

But the one thing that makes me miserable, that gives me suicidal depression, is the one thing I can’t solve.

There is no working through autism to hopefully no longer be diagnosed with it. There is only so much you can improve with autism before you plateau.

There’s nothing I can do to help myself.",1

I have nothing to Look forward to at home.I wake up and it's the same damn thing all over again.Even if I change my routine like going to the gym or doing events, When I come back home at night, I face This feeling of nothingness in my room as I enter it.My happiness and enthusiasm feel boxed in Living with my parents.I can't really move out because of physical and mental health issues.As well as Financial Burdens, if I do move out.",1
I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up again,"I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore, im trying to get better, but it’s just not working, I wouldn’t wanna kill myself, that would make the people around me super sad, and I don’t want that, but I just can’t stand myself anymore. The best thing that could happen to me is I die in my sleep, that just sounds amazing to me atm, I try to see all my accomplishments, and there is a lot of them, im going to the gym, im working more, im starting college, im dating around, but it all doesn’t mean anything to me, it just doesn’t phase me and I can’t understand why.",1
I don’t know what’s happening to me.,"A few things are screwing with me right now. I’ve always had a feeling that I would fuck up any possibility of a career so bad and it’s gotten so much worse. I feel like I’m going to fail and there’s nothing I can do. I don’t stand a chance to succeed. 

People don’t talk to me anymore. Friends don’t text, call, or talk to me anymore. I’m think nobody cares about me anymore. And no one ever will. I try and make new friends. I try to involve them with me but they return nothing. This happens to often for it to them and not me

More recently the dumbest thing make me irrationally angry. The sound of breathing, eating, laughing, walking etc just make me so upset. I hide it pretty well but I’m really close to never coming out of my room again.

What’s wrong with me",1
How can anyone afford inpatient therapy?,"Congratulations to Fetterman on his great success with inpatient treatment for his mental health. My doctor would like me to do the same, but what would be the point of ""getting better"" if I'd then be bankrupt by medical bills.

Started lithium and my doctor required a pre-screen blood test for various levels, thyroid, etc. I received a $400 bill for that which I cannot afford. 

How in the world could I ever actually get the help I need?!",1
Why can't I be honest?,"Throw away obviously.    


I've been struggling with my mental health since I could ever remember.  I had anger management issues in elementary school leading to me getting special treatment and very frequent meetings with the school councilor who taught me to ""control"" my emotions (repress them.)  This lead into middle school where they deemed that unnecessary, which happened to coincide with me getting frequent suspensions for my behavior.  This lead into high school where I got into frequent fights for the first two years, mostly due to being bullied. This was to the point where I was on a first name basis with the school resource officer and the social worker.    


That is the point where I learned I'm no longer allowed to be honest about my mental health with anyone for fear of repercussions.  I was honest one time and I was immediately threatened with being hospitalized.  This has stuck with me ever since, I've learned to repress my emotions and the only emotion I really feel these days is a deep overwhelming sadness.  I've tried reaching out multiple times to different therapists and councilors, some of them are completely useless while the only one that was any help that I mildly trusted tried to hospitalize me again.    


I don't understand why I'm not allowed to talk about the fact that living is a constant struggle just not to unalive. I don't understand why I can't talk about how much pain I'm in.  I don't understand why the people who's job it is to help, go out of their way to make their patients not trust them.  I want to talk, I want to be better.  My brain won't let me and people just want to put me into a padded room instead of helping me.    


Why can't I just be honest?",1
no point,"if the outcome of ANY amount of work on myself yields the same depressive/anxiety-self, why continue?

I need the long looked-for answer :,"Hi 
I’m 20, went through a lot of fucked up stuff (abuse etc etc), and still live in the same environment of abuse and all the good stuff you know 
My main issue now is my Major Depressive Disorder , I started anti-depressants at 14-15 years old, I would take it , a while will pass like a year and a half , then it stops working , same happens to the others ( molecules) I would take after the previous stops working but the “working period” gets shorter and shorter , so I’ll take this one , would work for a year , then stops, take the next chosen molecule, works for a little less than a year , then stops working , and it goes on to today, where the last one I tried  , nothing, I don’t respond to anti depressants anymore 


Anti depressants not working = depression symptoms ( and ofc they worsened with time progressively all over thoses years as if it wasn’t enough ) 

I’m doing bad , really bad , I have no word to describe what I’m going through , and no will to since i’ve wrote all the long texts expressing it that all I wanna say now is “I’m living in everyday torture”

I’m currently taking “break yearS” ( yes pluriel) because of my depression, I can’t go finish highschool-> because I can’t study -> because of depression ( right at my last year of highschool🤩 , how lovely isn’t it ?)

Let’s say I went to every psychiatrist in my city so far over the years , and like, 5 psychiatrists when it was official that anti depressants aren’t doing anything ( I didn’t stop taking them and prescribed medication ) 

Everyday is hell , I really don’t have the energy to write a lot about details now, specially that I suffer from other things (anxiety disorder , conversion disorder (hysterical attacks) etc etc) , and  , specially that I just came from the ER for a panic/hysterical attack and first time deciding to tell them I’m extremely suicidal and need assistance ( idk why , Idk how I’m still here despite being extremely suicidal/attempted , let alone ask for help to not do it , I don’t get why it is so hard for me to just do it ) and my “mother” made a scene once here home as she religiously do to make it about her , and my father and “brother” are abusive so I have now flashbacks of all the abuse because my “brother” is being loud with slamming the doors to join her to wherever she took the car keys to go 

Well , back to what I was saying, I did rTMS ( for simplifying to the ones that don’t know about it , basically a machine put on your head that send magnetic waves to create changes in your brain to hopefully fix the hormonal mess in it, you are awake (no anesthesia no nothing, you feel it vibrating and irritating your scalp kinda , that’s it) , and well , IT DIDNT WORK 🤩✨ 

Now the “true plan” is ECT ( yeah electro convulsive therapy , where you are under general anesthesia and they shock you with electricity to create a brief convulsion to , again, fix the mess in your brain) 

Knowing that nothing is for sure when it even comes to the ECT even if it’s the most effective treatment out of everything ( and results don’t last “permanently” anyways ), and that I could , just not feel a change or relapse ( I don’t believe something good can happen to me anymore lol ) 

The question: Am I ever gonna come out of this? Do I just got to accept that : “yep, I’ll never be okay enough to function “almost” like a normal human , this is it , you are now part of the unwanted people in this society my friend, doctors for sure can’t tell you that since it will be contradicting to what they are told as a protocol , but we all know that this is it , this is the end , all that striving so you can come back to having a treatment or something that makes you “almost like others” is from the past now, the reality is , you lost everything , this is it, this is all you’re ever gonna be from now on  ” ?",1
Nexplanon implant depression,I’ve had the Nexplanon implant (birth control) in for awhile now (over 2 years) my concern is not the fact that it’s not effective birth control but that it may be effecting my mood and worsening my depression. I am going to call my doctor to set up an appointment to have it taken out but do you think it’s possible that having this implant in has impacted my mood? My depression is the worst it’s ever been,1
I’m trying,"I feel a depressive episode creeping in and I’m going to try to stop it. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up right now. It’s so hard to do anything. I haven’t made it to work in a few days. I’m bursting into tears doing simple things like making my bed.

Today I’m going to try my best. I’m drinking water, I’m going to eat actual nutritious meals instead of the garbage I’ve been eating. I’m going to go outside at some point. I’m trying. It’s just all so painful right now.",1
honestly how i am feeling right now.,Well this is a burner account that prolly wont ever be used again so don't even worry about upvoting this post. Anyways I can't f\*\*\*\*\*\* understand why im feeling this way i just feel this feeling in my heart that hurts it feels weird i cant get someone off my mind im struggling real bad right now I wanna just pause my life. Its so hard to be happy ive been like this for a few months now its just like there's no point in anything anymore im slowly giving up on my life. I will do anything for some advice please somebody tell me what's wrong....,1
I am so unhappy with my life but I don't know what would make it better.,"No friends, no job, no hobbies besides gaming occasionally. Days have just blended together and I only go outside for groceries. Last job I had was last year for 3 months, got fired without an explanation. That was the longest job I had since graduating high school in 2013. Back then I found it hard to get jobs because of my social anxiety, now that I'm older my anxiety has lessened a lot and I've learned ways to manage it, but now my depression just makes me not want to do anything. Even though I was never given a reason why I was fired, I'm pretty sure it was my attendance. I called out a lot and came in late, because I hated that job. I didn't want to be there or do the work, and I actually wanted to quit but I still wanted the money, so I kept working hoping to be fired lol. It's so hard to make myself do stuff. I have to force myself to just go outside to the supermarket for food so I don't die. I have a panic attack every time I have to go for groceries and it's been this way since high school. I have difficulty managing basic things, I can't see how I could ever manage a normal adult life. I still want kids, want to travel, want to have a life outside of my bedroom, but I'm running out of time day after day. I wish I could find a job that an idiot like me could do for 4 hous a day. I wish I could find someone to talk to and hang out with. I wish I had a reason to get up in the morning. I don't ask for a lot but it still feels alot for the universe to give. I don't feel capable or worthy of anything.  All my therapist can say is 'wow that must be really difficult dealing with all that. You are such a strong person, you just need to set some goals and try one day at a time' lol sound familiar? 

I've my lost train of thought.

I just want to be normal.",1
i cannot think anymore,"Stringing a sentence together, learning something new, listening is my biggest challenge. Brain for, and all I can seem to do is accept it, I am powerless, it’s not like I’ve ever had the motivation to climb out of this pothole anyways.",1
Need help or advice,"Hey everyone. I've had depression since around 2010. I feel like I am at the bottom of the ocean drowning. I'm married and have 2 kids, but my wife also has Depression really bad. Every time I try to talk to her about my depression she turns it to how worse she has it. I used to be on meds for it, but the prescription ran out and I can't afford to lose an hour at work to go see the doctor for a refill. We also rent a house we really can't afford because it was the only option in this market. No matter what little steps I can manage to get out of this funk, it seems like life kicks me back down. I'm up to my gills on debt, my vehicle is broke and needs an expensive repair that I can't afford to fix so I've been bumming rides with friends to work. I'm sorry I really don't know where I'm going with this but it feels good to get it out. i have no one to talk to about this type of stuff.  Some times I feel like I'd be doing my wife and everyone a favor by ending it. If anyone has a similar experience and somehow got out of it please enlighten me as to how. Thank you.",1
I'm lucky... am I?,"Do you know what I hate? I know that if I were someone else and met me, I would think that I'm a good guy, but it's actually impossible for me to like myself. I'm not saying this because I'm egocentric and want to protect my feelings, no, damn, I'm not here to say that kind of bullshit, but I'm aware that I'm a charismatic person, many people love me, but I swear I'm incapable of loving myself.

I'm not someone who is suffering a lot. I know people who have had a really bad time, people who keep fighting, people who have already left... I feel that their fights are superior to mine. But at the same time I know that something is wrong with me, because my brain tells me that I'm okay, but it also tells me that I'm not.

I've come to my own conclusion, I don't want to say that it works for everyone, but it has helped me. Not only war, death and any danger capable of taking your life hurt and make you feel bad. No... In fact, I think life is more like an hourglass.

What do I mean? For every second that passes, a grain of sand falls, bringing you closer to death. But you can always fill the hourglass with more sand. But for that you need fucking motivation and you've to be careful, because every grain of sand weighs.

If you're fed up with feeling how the grains of sand are falling, causing you to submerge yourself in the quicksand that you're creating, you'll be unable to fill the hourglass. If your grains of sand drown you, you won't be able to fill that sandglass, and when there are no grains of sand left, you'll die.

I'm tired, I've been in quicksand for a long time. If I'm still filling my hourglass, it's because if I find little meaning in life, I find even less meaning in death. I try to keep going, I've everything I ever wanted. I've enough reasons to be happy. But I'm not. Why?

Why don't I want to refill my hourglass anymore? I've been working for so long to make it the most beautiful hourglass there is. I've people who love me, I do well in my studies, I do what I want to do... But it seems that I love to hate myself, and I hate to love to hate myself.

I realize I'm a happiness junkie. I need the fucking soma. But I know that even if I could find happiness in a drug, I'd still feel sad, because I see so many people who have plenty of happiness, and I've to beg for it. I think what makes me sicker is not feeling sick, but believing that I've no valid reason to feel sick. 

Well... I'm sure there are also people who feel like me... For those people, I want you to know that hope isn't something you find, it's something you have to create. I feel bad, but I'm not hopeless, and I want you all to keep going :).",1
I hate this,Most days I just want to be gone forever. But there are some days where I want to be here. I just don’t feel like I deserve life anymore. I wish there was a way to stop feeling like shit everyday.,1
I am just a shadow of the man I used to be,"Yup. I'm just a shadow of the man I used to be.   
I can't find happiness in my life. I just can't. No matter how much I try, my demons will always get me and drag me down. I have a lovely and supportive wife, a small dude - I love my family, but instead of feeling happy, I'm constantly worried about them. About their health and well-being. This constant health axiety  and ovewhelming  saddnes is affecting my family - I can see that, I see my wife even though she is helping me as much as she can, is alredy tired and fed up with my constant worries. It also affects my little dude - he can see that daddy is not happy, and worried, so he starts to show same behaviour as myself - he is also starting to worry about things he shouldn't.   
I am on anti-depressants (lexapro 10mg) and they were working really good, but since last week or so, I feel they completely stopped doing their job - how is this possible?  
  
I left my home country 20 years ago, and I just missed my home, all the stuff I know, love and understand. I am in an English-speaking country, and I can communicate easily, I can have small chats, and so on; but so what, if I can't have a social life - as I don't understand nuances of the language, phrases and jokes? I don't have a social life at all actually. It's just home, work, home, work.    
  
All I do is just exist, I feel empty, like a husk and I am not the same person I was 20-30 years ago - I was full of life, I had friends, I was chatty and happy. Now, it's just white hair, a tired face and bad emotions. Just overwhelming sadness. I need to change it, I know - but I don't even know where to start, how to start.",1
I want to give up on everything in my life,"I want to keep this short cause everything I want to say is too much. 

I feel like I’m super close to hitting rock bottom and I am ready to let go and give everything up. I want to leave behind my current life and pack up and move to a far away country to start fresh. 

I’m sick of everyone in my life repeating to me the mentally damaging sh!t I hear in my own mind every minute of the day. I’m sick of everyone giving up on me and being annoyed that I’m suffering greatly and I’m sick of people insulting me and making fun of me and yelling at me while I’m having an anxiety or panic attack. I’m sick of nobody listening to me and I’m sick of being blamed for my family’s problems. And I’m sick of so much more. I am so ready to give up but I can’t get away from this toxic environment and I don’t think I can stay tough and get through it much longer.",1
Is this a symptom of depression or am I just not good at social relationships?,"Does anybody else feel tired after spending time with other people?

Please note that after I started taking medicines this situation hasn't changed. I want to spend time with people but I get tired. I don't get tired much when I spend time alone. Should I mention about this to my psychiatrist the next time I visit her?",1
Depression is so unfair," Don't you all find it crazy that we all have been robbed of so much joy, so many friendships, so many experiences just because our brains suck? Like sometimes I imagine myself reliving my life without depression and I know this is unhealthy but it's so crazy how differently things could've gotten.",1
What to do now?,So I have been using many different medicine to help with my anxiety and depression but none worked great and I had terrible anxiety attacks randomly. But now I'm using a new medicine at 300 mg a day and it really does help with my anxiety. I finally feel like a normal person but the thing is idk what to do now. İt's been roughly 2.5 months since I have started to use this medicine and it's effects are getting lower I can kinda feel it. I wanna get rid of my eating disorder and be able to lose weight but it just feels impossible. I also feel my rage level going higher at certain times in the day. I will be talking about these with my doc but idk what to do. I'm also already using smt to stop me from hurting myself but it's not that effective tho my hurting myself is only pulling on my skin in my certain parts of my body (hands etc.). I just wanna be someone who can be a part of this population. I wanna be able to function by myself. I wanna have smt I'm interested in. I enjoy nothing and I have no future plans or dreams. All I want to do is having no responsibility and dying.,1
Severe depression & being a business owner,"Hi guys

Seeking some advice on how to be a good business owner

I own a business but I’ve never been able to grow it, simple because of my depressive episodes

When i get into these I can’t stop crying and I am so lethargic 

There is nothing obviously wrong with my life at all in this moment in time fortunately, so these sadness periods are extremely challenging because I don’t understand why

I take days of rest, I ensure I incorporate balance  

I let them be when they come, but I can feel my brain dying faster and I’m struggling building something work wise to ensure I can look after the people I love

any tips out there about what I could potentially do? I do heaps of self development and try to be better but something you just can’t find info on

"What's the point of continuing to struggle when I have no faith that my life will improve, that I will never find love, and that my existence is meaningless?","I have been severely depressed since I was a child. I have survived several suicide attempts over the course of my life and I honestly don't understand why everyone around me is always surprised when my depression completely takes over.

I suffered at the hands of an alcoholic and abusive father as I grew up. I spent most of my childhood alone and afraid that I would be berated or beaten for the tiniest bit of non-compliance. I didn't even have any real friends until midway through elementary school. I even tried to talk to my parents about how lonely I felt and how I struggled to make friends, but that was met with ""What the fuck is wrong with you? How do you not understand how to make friends? This is normal kid shit. Get the fuck out of my face before I throw something at you.""

Even when I did make friends, my father would go out of his way to embarrass me in front of any friends I had. From forcing my friends to help me perform chores while they came to visit my home, to screaming at me for not doing something as simple as picking up our family dog's poop when my dad wanted to cut the grass, to even saying that my friends are not welcome in the house if they wouldn't help prepare a meal. My friends just stopped coming over and I spent more and more time out of my house. Honestly, my best friend's parents were closer to me throughout childhood and high school than my own family. But it never fixed the gaping hole within my spirit. I always felt so broken and alone.

I was also ruthlessly bullied in elementary and high school. People around me would see me getting punched, kicked, choked, and one time even literally having my bully stomp on my throat in the school cafeteria. No one would ever step up and help, even teachers looked the other way. I'd show up at home with bruises and a couple times with a broken nose, only to have my parents ignore the obvious signs of bullying and abuse. I eventually stopped trying to defend myself. It only made things worse.

My mother was too afraid to challenge my dad as well. They both drank for years until my mother realized how miserable my dad was making her and she decided to stop drinking so much and start exercising.

Things only got worse as I got to post-secondary school. In my first year, my father was so controlling that I got so depressed that I stopped going to my classes altogether. I tried to date to help me find some value in myself, but I began gaining weight so quickly as soon as I stopped playing sports. I gained between 35-50 Lbs in my freshman year and the self-loathing only increased. I was completely unsuccessful in finding a partner, and rejection after rejection only deepened the black hole that is my soul. I tried to off myself again that year for the 5th time in my life, my first time being hospitalized for a suicide attempt.

My father seemed to finally understand how much pressure and damage he had done to me while he saw me lying in a hospital bed, barely clinging to life, but it didn't actually flip a switch in his brain to realize that he needed to change anything. After my required time in a psych ward to ensure that I wouldn't try to kill myself again, I went home, only for my dad to immediately revert to his old, shitty ways.

I continued to try to finish my schooling, switching subjects several times, but I was too depressed to succeed. Any time I started failing tests or assignments, I dropped my class. Three and a half years of this did not result in a degree, infuriating my father to no end. My father refused to hear me when I told him that I was lost and none of my majors interested me. I mentioned that the only solace I had in life was video games, as they were the only things I felt like I excelled in, but that was not a valid option to my father. I tried to take programming courses, but was so depressed that I kept failing out of them, and my father was fed up with paying for my schooling. The only thing left to do was drop out completely, as I did not have the funds to continue going to school.

My parents were also on the brink of divorce at this point. I moved home from school and started to work a minimum wage, dead-end job, which seemed fitting for a pathetic loser like myself.

My father tried with all of his might to pressure me to go back to school, and once he realized that I wouldn't go and I was depressed beyond measure, he tried to force me to go to a psych ward because he was so ashamed of me. I tried to kill myself for the 6th time, and was hospitalized again. That seemned to have put the nail in the coffin for my parents' marriage, as my mother and I completely blamed my father for pushing me straight to the edge of my rope. ""Apologetically"", he offered to take me to a mental health clinic in the city that he worked in, trying to claim that he only wanted the best for me. Sadly, I overheard the truth behind his actions while at his job. He was deeply ashamed of his pathetic excuse of a son. He figured that this was the only way that he would ever be able to get me out of his house and potentially able to work for a living.

I spent multiple more years languishing, literally praying that I would develop cancer and would finally be able to die without any guilt, but I would have no such luck.

I am still alive a decade after my last suicide attempt, and after cutting my father off for a period of time, I was finally able to cobble some form of a life together, going back to school, graduating, and getting a decent job, but the depression has never left and is now back in full force.

The older that I have gotten, the more broken I feel. I've been trapped in a never-ending pit of despair and loneliness, unable to properly connect with all of the wonderful people that have come into my life. I've dated a couple people over the past decade, but never to a point where I could honestly say that I have ever loved my partner, even if they told me that they loved me. If anything, my partners telling me that they loved me immediately scared me and made me push them away. I literally could not understand how they felt or even how they were attracted to me in the first place. Every single one of those relationships ended when my partner eventually got tired of trying to connect with me or they would meet someone better (which to me would be 99.99% of the population). I am now convinced that I am too broken to actually feel love, let alone any form of intimacy, even though it's the thing I want most in the world. I simply don't deserve a partner. I have nothing positive to offer.

I hate myself beyond all measure. I literally feel like I am worth more as an organ donor than a human being. I am tired of existing. I am tired of the constant fucking pain, suffering, loneliness, and the abject nature of my life. I feel like a poison in everyone's lives around me, dragging everyone down, making this world a darker place every day.

I will likely be required to be on medication for the rest of my life in order to be a barely functioning member of society. I am a leech of my region's socialized healthcare system, requiring inordinate amounts of funding to barely hang on. There are so many more worthy people than me. Beyond all of the refugees across the world, there has to be someone who could easily and happily replace me.

All I want is a painless death. My country is contemplating legalizing euthanasia for people whose sole detriment is mental health. If the law is passed, I feel like I will have no other means of escape other than to sign myself up on day one.

My family and the few friends I have are aware of this desire, but the only respond they have had is to tell me some bullshit, placating me, with empty promises of a brighter future. That, or a guilt trip.

So, again, I ask... what's the point of trying to continue when life feels empty and meaningless?",1

My life is slipping away,"So I'm 12 and my life is going horribly.in 2020 I got really sick and had frequent hospital visits (and still do) because I had gastric problems along with family issues and 2020-2021 were when my mental health declined at that time I was like it can't possibly get worse than this but it did now I'm in secondary school/middle school and my attendance is inconsistent, my grades are the lowest of low and I haven't attended school in a month due to my sickness and just a depressive rut that I haven't been able to get out of for 3 years .I'm at my breaking point I'm posting on reddit because I'm giving myself a last chance . I'm not going to kms or anything but if someone came in here to kill me I don't think I would resist. At this point its like I'm waiting for the last straw like  someone close to me dying then I might actually do it.right now I have no motivation to do anything I don't really have a good or decent relationship with anyone but my dad whenever I talked to my mum it most of the time ends up with us arguing. And I spend most of my time watching funny videos to be happy for a short period of time but it feels so temporary. I don't know if I'm a good person I've acted so shitty to my mother and sister and by shitty i mean constantly giving them a hard time with my attitude, my mum has hurt me in the past whether it was physically or mentally but that only changed when I got sick and I get really angry, like concerningly angry that whenever someone passes me off I have violent fantasies about hurting them. I also get paranoid like someone is going to torture me type of paranoid it happens often when I'm in bed I get too scared to turn around because I think somethings gonna rip my intestines out or something I'm in constant pain so my motivation is literally at 0. I noticed in 2021 that I thought I had depression I didn't want to self-diagnose myself but I found myself relating to almost all the symptoms it's like I'm stuck in the past because I find it so difficult to move forward and when I started getting depressed in 2020 I noticed I felt a chronic feeling of emptiness,  it felt different in the sense that nothing could fulfil my need like all my feelings felt so ungenuine and temporary even if I felt happy the feeling never lasted. Even now I've told mum about how I feel but it hasn't changed anything. She had a supportive response but I don't feel any better than before I told her and I've been hiding it from her for years.",1
Want to off myself at the slightest trigger.,"I catch myself wanting to commit suicide whenever anything happens. It's maddening. Misplaced my keys? Suicide. Awkward conversation? Suicide.

I know that it's stupid and dangerous, but it's not something I'm consciously doing. Wtf am i supposed to do?",1
Why does the body desire unhealthy habits?,"While you are depressed? Why does your body desire so many copes just to feel good? Drugs, escorts, drinking, and long hours of gaming. I do it all the time. And, yet I feel empty sometimes. I work out to help my depression and take the necessary supplements to help my depression. So, I'm basically suffering in silence until an angel can save me. ""Fuck off""",1
went to see my doctor and i think she genuinely believe when she asked me how am I and I said “im feeling okay”,I am not feeling okay. kms has crossed my mind multiple times these past months. but i dont want to tell her that. im afraid they’ll suggest me to be locked out again.,1
Apathy is taking over,"I’ve been increasingly struggling with depression lately. Every outlet, every single little thing that once brought an ounce of joy is quickly becoming bland. 

Its like the whole human experience has become mashed potatoes in flavour. 

My few joys i do have i can already feel fading. Writing was one of my biggest outlets but even that is starting to feel like nothing. I just feel like im spiralling into a blackhole and am waiting for nothingness to take over.

Why is my Home so save,What is this Shit to day was the day i pland to end my live i Look around at my Home to do it and i don't have pills to overdose no roap and all knives are to dull and the rest ist to messy to clean up why can't the world Just let me go,1
I cant keep doing this forever...,"I'm going to start with the fact that I am honestly not sure if I have depression or BPD or not, but I think so. It would me a high functioning form. Anyways...

Whenever I am doing good, whenever I finally change myself a little, it always fucking gets me in the end. People, places, whatever else.

I can't keep doing this. My entire world comes crashing down in the end. How the hell is that even possible?

I hate that my life seems cursed. *Like, truly cursed.* People get driven away even though I'm kind, listening, asking questions, and try to laugh a lot. Even those who even try to be available a little bit seem to change over the course of 5-7 months. They act like we're fine, but I can tell they're disinterested. They weren't always.

I don't know what I'm doing with myself, I cant live with myself while everyone seem so fake. So very sarcastic. Micro-bullying, I call it.

I don't know how to deal with anything anymore. Usually only older people are nice to me. Hell, even people only a couple years older.

But I can't help being who I am, and in a school with people the same age as (or mainly younger than) myself, it's quite difficult.

I don't feel emotions less and less, or wanted, or needed. I don't feel anything but this massive uphill journey with no one but myself to look to when I need help. Imaging what it would be like to be your only support - I feel this way. Alone in a cold, unforgiving, stale world.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm not ugly, I don't think. I'm not smelly, I haven't even gone through puberty. I'm not rude, ever. I have a lot of cool talents and interests and widely accepted values, I think.

I've been here before. I thought I could get out of it. The very few people left in this school who are older than me are going away next year.

I am not at the end yet not at all. I still feel some emotions. Some happiness. I can still kind of block all of the pain, I've gotten good at that. But I'm quite close, and I don't know what it will be that pushes me off.

Why am I this way?

Please let me know if I can fix this. If I can stop it.",1
"With the way the future is shaping up, I'm not sure I want to live very much longer","I honestly dread the future. Everything is getting worse, no one seems to want to make it better and if they do, they either don't have enough power or they're too afraid of rocking the boat and ruining a good thing for themselves.

I'm in a very vulnerable position socially and financially and I feel like I'm living on borrowed time as it is. And as bad as the world is now, I figure it'll be 10-15 times worse by the time I'm elderly.

Depressed Vent,"To all readers I understand that I am a shitty person. I am not looking for any sympathy from anyone. I simply need to get some things off of my chest. I apologize for the structure of this post. I am not very good at composing my thoughts into words so this may come across as more of a rambling than anything else.   
  
I’ve been battling with depression all my life. I always thought that once I hit that “big event” my depression would finally go away. Despite hitting several of these “events” during my life my depression has only worsened. A few years ago I finally broke down and reached out to a doctor and was prescribed antidepressants. After a few trial and errors with different drugs I finally found one that worked well for me. They didn’t fix my depression, but they definitely made things more bearable. However, now after a few years they have either stopped working entirely, or are working too well. I’m now completely disassociating with the outside world while facing internal conflict like no other.   
  
My job pays pretty well, but it isn’t exciting work by any means. By nature I am a good worker. I am a bit of a perfectionist whenever it comes to my work, and I will get tasks completed fast and efficiently. I do not however get any sort of fulfillment out of my work. My co-workers act as if they enjoy what they’re doing. Perhaps they are lying to me or themselves about enjoying the work, and they are truly as miserable doing the work as I am. Regardless I am jealous of their fulfillment, or ability to lie to themselves because I simply cannot do this. I know I hate my job, and the thought of doing it for another 30-40 years fills me with a sense of dread. Further, I cannot think of a job on this planet that would give me a sense of fulfillment. I think that no matter what job I have I will eventually come to hate it.   
  
I have always had low self esteem. As a former obese child & teenager I never had anyone show romantic interest in me throughout my teenage years. Because of this I despised the way that I looked and turned to porn for comfort. As I came into adulthood I decided to get a grip on my health and managed to lose a lot of weight, but I still hold onto the body image issues (along with stretchmarks and loose skin) from the weight I once held.   
  
I managed to have two serious relationships in earlier adulthood and then eventually met my now wife. I went into relationships with the intent of marriage from the very start. I was coming from the mindset that if I don’t lock someone down I will never be able to get someone in the future. After the first relationship went south I decided that I would marry my next girlfriend no matter what. That’s when I met my now wife. She was pretty enough and had a good enough personality, but more importantly loved me. While dating I wasn’t convinced that I loved her, but kept forward with my original promise to myself and married her anyway. Fast forward five years and we’re having issues exclusively because of me. Some days I like my wife and her personality. She has a sweet side and knows how to make me smile. Other days a different side of her comes out that I simply cannot stand. On top of this despite an initial attraction, I am no longer physically attracted to her. This has made our sex life basically non-existent and has caused an even greater strain on our relationship all because of me. I know my wife loves me, but I do not think that I love her. I can keep on faking love for a while, but I think it is becoming more and more evident. I do not want to hurt my wife, but I don't know if there is another option besides separation. She deserves to be with someone who loves her.   
  
I have family and a few close friends, but they don’t know this side of me at all. To them I am the guy who always has something funny to say. I am rarely serious around them and try to make sure everyone is laughing and having a good time when I’m around. Despite this the second I am no longer around them I return to my depression, often worse than before.   
  
Sometimes the only thing that gives me comfort during difficult situations is fantasizing about killing myself. I don’t think I will actually ever do the deed, but thinking about it helps me get through whatever shitty situation I am facing in the moment. If I didn’t have anyone in my life that my suicide wouldn’t adversely affect then I would do it, but I cannot bring myself to put someone else through emotional pain no matter how much I hate myself. For the meantime I will continue to numb my pain with weed and alcohol.",1
"I don't know what to do, & it's not getting any better.","What do you do when nothing matters?   
  
I'm 45, Male. Going through what I'm sure countless others are going through. But it sucks more when it's YOU. This ""story"" will probably jump around a bit. Sorry about that, I'll try to keep it short.   
  
Been married 20 years, no kids. I'd say I have a happy life for the most part, great wife, great dogs, a few good friends. Full time job, as well as a small  
DJ/Entertainment business. Sure, things could always be better, but I'm doing ok. The problem? I've never been more miserable. Why? ... I don't know. It's been getting progressively worse for the last 10 years at least, maybe 15? But why? Is this the beginning of a ""mid-life"" crisis? There are plenty of reasons to be happy. But I am not, & honestly can't remember the last time I was.  
  
I had goals. I have achieved some, and still have some more that might never be realized. I've slowly given up on most of them. We won't get into what they actually are, it doesn't matter. It seems the last twenty years or so, have been spent treading water for the most part. Just getting by. BUT, I'm getting by. That's a good thing. I consider myself kinda smart, I've had many ideas for side hustles etc. Nothing ever sticks. It's probably my OWN fault. Could be undiagnosed ADHD? When I was young, that was never a thing. Point is, I want more. Maybe that's part of the problem, I'm never happy enough. People say be grateful for what you have, and believe me, I am. But...  
  
My wife and I have both dealt with pretty severe health issues for years. Me, diabetic for over 20 years, on insulin. This has led to multiple foot problems. But, thankfully, they all seem fixed. I had 2 foot surgeries last year. Everything seems good now. Other than the diabetes, I'm pretty healthy. Chubby, but healthy. She's doing good too, despite her struggles. These are good things. I should be happy.   
  
I SAY I'm healthy, but AM I? The Docs say ""For the most part, your doing pretty good. Ya need to quit smoking though"". My problem is ME. I don't love how my life has gone. I see friends and acquaintances doing (what looks like) so much better. Thriving small businesses, nice houses, shops, etc. I've been working toward the same thing for years,..and nothing. Also, no real vision of how to get it done. (the shop part at least, credit sucks due to medical bills) My Dad passed away when I was a year old, so none of that cool fatherly advice, or help. This is NOT a pitty party for me, I don't want that. Just pointing out facts. I also had big dreams involving music. None of which came anywhere close to true. I'm a drummer, not in a band currently. I've thought seriously about selling everything. The full DJ trailer, the drums, everything. I'm from a small town, so not much out there anymore. I don't know what I'd do without an outlet for music. But I don't know what to do WITH it either.   
  
But it's not ALL doom and gloom. I have a modest house, and small garage that we own. Also, no credit cards. These are good things.   
  
But, I'm still generally miserable.   
  
I used to be over 350 lbs. and my body has taken a hit because of it. My ankles, knees, feet, back etc. always hurt. I drink a little, nothing too bad. Six or so when I mow the yard etc. pretty normal stuff for any guy really. I've tried the jazz lettuce. I like it. May have to get a medical card, since I can do that here in Ohio. I have a somewhat stressful job. So does the wife, we're both in Management. I work all week, then the weekends are either DJ gigs, or doing work around the house/yard. Currently, the wife is off work due to hip surgery (she's almost better), my truck is broken, lawnmower is broken, house needs some small repairs. Not enough money or time to fix everything. I know it sounds like I'm just bitching, and I am. BUT, back to my original question. What do you do? I know I'm not the only one. 

I used to have dreams. Now I just foresee more of the same until I die. I see NO reason to care, try, or plan for the future. I have no one to talk to about this stuff and no way to make sense of anything. It's not like I'm suicidal, but I've seen enough. I don't care what happens. I wouldn't kill myself, it would be terrible for my wife, mother, even dogs. But then that means I'm just living for them, not me. I'm just so over it, and I don't see any way out. So, I'll go to bed & be pissed that I woke up, again.",1

Cant stand my past (23f),"I hate myself for what i did. I slept 11 boys and who knows the number of bjs. Some of them was one night some of them was fuckbudy. I lied to a boy about my past just to make him love me although i had a boyfriend at that time. And after i broke up and started to date with new boy i talked to another boy and sent my photos which new boy took from our date and i said to him i want to go drink. New boy loved me but fake me but learned truth and devastated. He learned all of this. He started smoking again because of me. All this time he cared for me like i am his child. I didnt even see this kind of caring and loving non of my parents nor relationships. And i hate being myself and not treating him as he deserves. After he found out i lied again about the number of people but he found out again. I also said i did check stds and i have nothing but i didnt said that after this check i slept with 2 people. How stupid i was i couldnt think i would spread something to him. (we checked i had hpv not cancerogen thank god) I promised not to lie again and comitted him. I was using paxil and he was so good to me i could quit in 7 months after using 7 years. He is always so good to me he helps me so much he always cares about my health, spends money for me. I cant stop myself from feeling devastated and very sad and crying every day. Every day my past comes to my mind. I know i dont deserve him but its like idont deserve to be happy at all. I cant work because i am always sad, i cant even brush my teeth sometime. I cant stand the reality of my past. I dont have anyone in my life who cares except him.

The Troubled Teen,"I may be out of place here since I am a teen and could just be playing victim of depression however I just want to vent out. A lot of stuff happened in my life, at age 10 my dad left me without saying a word. At Age 11 my family broke off and we all had separated ourselves. It is hard, having the responsibilities that I should not shoulder but who am I to complain? I want to ask my mom to bring me to a psychiatrist for I thought I have depression since I am showing off symptoms but I thought it was just my imaginations and I shrug it off. But as years passed I am lost. ""What am I supposed to do?"", ""How can I do this?"", ""How should I carry out my responsibilities plus the responsibilities I have to shoulder?"" These questions pop in my head. And now here I am, in reddit asking people what should I do, to be honest I'm tired of continuing my journey in life and sleep eternally 6 feet under. When all hell is let loose I am always the one to blame, in every chaos I am the troublemaker, in every bad situation I am always the one to blame. I've had enough already, this journey of mine feels nothing more than a freight train of pain and suffering. It irritates me that I have no power nor the materials to improve myself and rely on what is presented at the table. I feel useless as if I exist as a mere jester to make people laugh at me. I just want someone to value that I exist and that I have feelings but looks like it ain't happening. I guess this might be the fruit of my sinful life, and everything is just the consequences of my actions. Anyways, I hope you guys have your salvations and live a desirable life.

They are only in my city for university and then are heading back home over summer, but will come back once university starts again. As it is their last week here, we all planned TOGETHER to go out and get drinks and have fun.

Which was supposed to be today, yet none of them are answering me back but I can see on snapchat maps that they are all together and active.

So basically my only ""real"" friends have just left me out and now I feel alone again. Actually more alone than before because I convinced myself these people actually liked me, but now I'm thinking they only pretended to like me.

I seem to excel at almost everything I do. I've largely got it all figured out. I am very fortunate. 

Yet, under the surface, I feel nothing. My life is joyless. At least half of the days over the last decade I've thought about how nice it would be to just be dead; to not have to deal with life anymore. I've always thought the saying ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" is stupid. To me suicide is a permanent solution to every problem I'll ever have. I've spent countless hours planning on how I would do it and how I can minimise the pain on others. I am honestly surprised I'm still here.

I'm currently at a crossroads. My depression is getting worse and it's becoming visible. I am already starting to lose people because of it. But, I feel like I can't talk to anyone close to me. I worry as soon as people know just how fucked I am I'll be treated differently and things will never be the same. It's also just not in me to ask. I am not the person who needs help from others. I've made token attempts before, seen doctors and underplayed my symptoms to avoid being sectioned. I've been prescribed antidepressants and seen therapists but all to no avail. What's to say if I ask for help this time will be any different.

As stupid as it feels to write this, knowing the advice I would give to others I feel this is a journey I must continue to take alone. I also wonder if it's even worth being fixed.

As a result, I've been booted from the discord server that has been my home away from home. All my friends who never even heard what I was going through are now out of reach to me. I had a community of like-minded people. A lot of queer folk that I could relate to. And now it's gone. 

I'm too unhappy to be allowed in the place that makes me happy. And I deserve it... They can't deal with the heartache of having a friend who breaks down from time to time. 

I just feel so lost right now.",1
I had a nightmare this morning of a voice telling me a future of happiness will never happen for me," Just as I was having thoughts of a better future, this evil voice just contradicts me suddenly and loudly in a nasty tone. 

Idk what it is or why or where it comes from but this voice has haunted me before. The last time, not all that long ago, it said it was seeking my death. Just what is this super creepy voice thing? Isn’t it enough that I have episodes of overwhelming suicidal feelings? Is there a wicked spirit trying to kill me or steal my happiness? Or is this a part of depression or something else?",1

(F27) I am losing my battle with Depression,"I think one day I will end up taking my own life. It’s not a matter of If, just a matter of when.

I’m currently unemployed, a college dropout, I barely have any friends, no romantic partner. 

I have nothing going for me. The only good thing people can say about me are that I’m “smart” and “pretty”.

Whenever I try to make friends I get ghosted. Whenever I date someone it always ends badly. I’m not good at anything I can make money off of, so I struggle financially. I have extreme trust issues, extreme abandonment issues. Because everyone in my life has ghosted me or stabbed me in the back. Everyone betrays me, so I rarely feel comfortable with other people.

I have panic attacks nearly every single night because when I lay in bed alone in the dark with my thoughts, my mind becomes overwhelmed with intense negative emotions and it’s given me insomnia.

I tried to see a therapist and I saw her for a few weeks but gave up because she didn’t seem empathetic at all nor did I feel like she understand how serious my issues were.

And maybe that’s partially my fault because I am very, very good at making it seem like I have everything together when on the inside I’m falling apart. Even the mask of normalcy I put on is slipping because I cut myself and I don’t even care enough to hide it anymore. I walk around in public with large, gaping, bleeding cuts all over my left arm because I just don’t care to hide it anymore.

 I have gone to therapists for ten years and have tried nearly every anti depression and anti psychotic on the market. All of them do little for me. 

The few moments in my life where I have been happy are so fleeting and few in number. I don’t have a strong will to live. If it wasn’t for my sister and the very small amount of friends I have on the internet, I would have killed myself a long time ago.",1

My self hatred grows everyday no matter how hard I try to fight it...,"I struggle with this problem that absolutely no one around me understands..  
I can't push myself to do things.   
I can't push myself to cook, to sleep early, to take care of myself, to study, to indulge in hobbies, etc.  
It's been ruining my life for years.  
No one understands what I mean. I get the same stuff told and it's been driving me nuts  
""No one likes to do chores""  
""Maybe that hobby isn't for you?""  
""If it's something you truly like you wouldn't stop""  
I want to cry when people tell me this.

I can't remember anything, I can't concentrate on anything, I just can't do it.  
I want to write a book. I want to cook good food. I want to swim, sleep early, make all the doctor appointments I need to do, clean my room, I want to be responsible and healthy and full of energy.  
But I just can't push myself to do anything.  
I tried going to a psychologist but she didn't help and i had problems affording it anyway so I stopped. I hate myself so much.  
I hate my looks, I hate my personality, I hate everything.

Some told me ""it takes time"", but I'm not going to wait fucking *decades,* especially not with this slim of a chance. I'm not doing this. I hate being here, all I want to do is leave everything.

Severely depressed.,"I’ve always suffered from depression for as long as I can remember but in the recent month’s it’s gotten a lot worse, I can feel a certain shift in everything. I feel a lot darker, numb, and overall in absolute despair about my life. I’m seeing no hope for me. I don’t feel like myself anymore and I feel completely lost and incredibly insecure. I’ve cut off nearly all of my friends and don’t have the energy to go out anymore or do anything. All I do is work, come home and repeat everything again. I’m a 22 year old female that also struggles with chronic anxiety but it’s been my depression that’s been scaring me lately. what do all these signs mean? I want to harm myself because I don’t see a way out and seeing someone is very expensive for me so I’m really at a loss. I’ve never felt this depressed in my whole life, I don’t like who I’m becoming. I hate myself. I’m no good in social interactions and I hate myself so much for it. I don’t want to be here anymore. :(",1
Balding in your 20s fucking sucks,"
I know people are gonna say “oh I know guys who are bald and do well with girls” or something like that but those guys are clearly the exception, not the rule. Not everyone looks good bald. Some guys are pale and have weird shaped heads like me and it just sucks. I’ve tried the hair loss meds but they cause a lot of sides. Finasteride is really good at preventing hair loss but it definitely causes major sides, especially sexual sides.

Every day I have to watch more and more hair fall out and feel less and less attractive. And maybe if I was in my 40s or even 30s I wouldn’t care but I’m in my 20s. I know women care. I can’t even use old pictures of myself cause I look so shitty now.

It just sucks, there’s nothing you can do. You know you’re less attractive and everything in life is about to be harder and always will be.

I hate this shit",1
I thought I was doing better,"I have been making strides to try to be more hopeful or looking towards the future. I created goals and dreams to chase. But now I'm spiraling watching my hope collapse on itself. I thought I had changed or improved. But im still that dumb ugly useless kid. And honestly having dreams goals and hope just makes it worse. I'll never have those things I want. I raised my expectations just to have them bashed to pieces. I guess I forgot reality and let myself dream a little too high. I'm the biggest fucking fool of them all.

Everyday little mistakes,"Is it normal to keep making small mistakes in my life?  In the morning, I pour coffee on myself, I have to change clothes or I forget clothes in the washing machine; I spill water on the parquet floors.  Every day I make a some mistake.  My husband says it's my disease because I don't concentrate well.  But I'm trying so hard!  And I keep asking myself why I am so impossible and where is the line, when is it still normal and when is it a prelude to depression.  Does this happen to you too?",1
Dysthymia vs MDD,So I got a second opinion from another psych and they think I have dysthymia with major depressive disorder (been diagnosed with MDD for like 8 years). I get dysthymia has more persistent low moods but I'm a little confused since they are both forms of depression and seem exactly the same at least to me,1
I wish my friends would check on me without prompting,"The past year and change has been hell. I had two mental breaks downs resulting in a total of 10 weeks in a PHP program. I feel like all of my friends don’t really try hard enough to support me. Even while I was in a genuine crisis I don’t think my friends did enough. Enough isn’t even a lot. 

I feel like it is very obvious when I start struggling but nobody ever asks if I want to grab a beer or something. Small things go so far for me. I feel like the worse I get the further they pull away. I’m not in trouble right now but I’m having a rough time but nobody has pulled me aside and asked if I’m okay. My boss/best friend knows the last month has been rough for me. My work is clearly struggling but nothing. Hell, I brought up to her that I had too much on my plate at work and she completely dehumanized the entire conversation and made it all about the company. 

I just want people to check on me. I understand that people get busy and life happens but it takes so little. They know that my mental health is fragile but it feels like they don’t try.",1
I've wasted so much of my wife's time.,"I'm just a terrible husband for her, and I tried her into thinking I wasn't our whole dating life by saying and doing all the right things to put on a facade of someone who was bound for success and being the caring person she needed. But it was all because I was so afraid of being alone again, I was willing to do anything and pretend to be anyone to be loved. 

But I am not that person, I fail at everything I do, and past the facade I am a weak, insecure and self-absorbed person who can barely care for himself, let alone a marriage. She never makes mistakes, and I'm always the reason something is wrong or that she has a problem in life.

Hey only mistake was being tricked into loving me, but I can't undo it now. It's been too long, and I've wasted too much of her time. She wants kids and doesn't want to be too old to avoid issues, so it would betray her greatest goal in life for me to admit that we should separate, because she's already 30, and it might be too late now to start all over with else, someone better for her.

But since I'm so awful, it's such a terrible idea for me to have children. Even if they aren't genetically fucked in the head like I must be, then having me as a father will certainly hurt them for their entire lives. I will fail as a father and I know it, but I can't bring myself to just end this whole thing before it starts because I don't want to hurt her even more.

I've been going over it, and it just feels like the best option would for me to have an accident, something fatal that makes it all end. I have a very large life insurance policy, so while it won't make up for the time I've wasted, maybe it will help her live comfortably, and find someone who will be better for her. Then outside of the initial heartbreak of my death, I won't be able to hurt her anymore, and she'll be happier overall when she finds someone who can be the person she needs them to be, and hopefully forget I was ever in her life.

Edit: I think I should clarify that I've never been abusive to her or cheated on her. Im just an awful husband who can't be who she needs me to be, and tricked her into thinking I could be because I'm entirely selfish. I am so self-focused that I think I'll never do a good thing for another person in my life, so the best thing I can do is be removed from life.",1
It’s so hard.,"So recently i’ve just been really down for some reason i get like this when it’s close to my period it’s just a lot . Yesterday i had to call out of work, and today I have a 10hr shift and could cry. I feel so sad, depressed, I sat in my bed all day yesterday and ended up sleeping most of the day. I wanna call out today because i just don’t thank i’m mentally and physically strong enough to work with special need kids today but I have to because I need the money that bad. It’s just so hard to prioritize my mental health when I have to work 24/7 or I can’t afford to live. I’m only 21 and it’s just getting harder and harder i don’t even care to wake up if life is gonna be like this. I just feel alone. No support. No Family. No friends. No nothing. Just trynna stay strong but idk i get these really bad thoughts when i’m like this. I just want help and time to get help but it seems like that’s a lot to ask for.",1
My 18 year old keeps blaming depression for his impending failure to launch.,"We are there for him. We are willing to do whatever it takes to help him through this. We talk a lot and have a good relationship. Except he has such a massive secret life that he constantly lies to keep us from finding out about the real him. We have had many glimpses though. 

I wish he would just tell us 'fuck you i wanna smoke pot with my friends forever and bang a bunch of skanks' because that's sure what it looks like.

Instead he strings us along with how he wants to get into tradeschool but he's interested in a break after high school. he says he's suicidal or struggling with cutting 'relapses' sometimes, and its always when we are asking him about his plans for the future. 
he mentions these things as if we knew it, but he never told us before.

he is probably not going to live with us, because we would get him into training and make sure he stayed on track.

he wants to go live in his grammas basement and work at dunkin with his stoner friends.

he doesn't have hobbies except gaming. when he's with us, he doesn't have him games, so he just goes to bed *very* early.

he has an online therapist. when he tells us his depression was flaring up and that's why he had to skip school, we ask did you talk about it with your therapist? he says 'no, i'm usually just telling her all the things that happened here' which means complaining about us giving him shit for skipping school.

He smokes weed and clearly has this whole pot head dark guy image that he's rocking right now, but he insists he doesn't use it much and will never use harder drugs, but he also hangs out with drug dealers and his friends have had cocaine parties.
we tried to get him to quit weed when we first found out and it was impossible. he says it helps him. he also takes antidepressants that the doc gave him without our consent.

**He keeps going back to how he wants to choose differently but *unfortunately* he has this curse of depression that won't let him do better.**

He has reasons to be struggling with depression. He's been through 3 divorces. It sucked.

But the rest of his complaints about life are almost headline buzzwords like 'the world is falling apart and i don't wanna just get right into working some 9-5 until i die'

I just wish he would stop leaning on this depression thing. It feels like an utter excuse and an insult to people who have been through really bad stuff.",1
My self loathing and depression is at its worst and I don't know what to do.,"I (18M) has been struggling with my self esteem for years now. It's at an all time worst though. 
I've been taking medication for years. I've tried maybe 2 dozen different meds in the past 7ish years and nothing has really helped. I've tried therapy for years and that hasn't helped. 

I've tried basically everything and I'm not sure what to do. I just want to matter to someone. I just want to be kissed by someone. I want to be someone's cuddle buddy. I've never dated and I'm a fucking loser. 

People say love yourself and I ask how and I never get an answer. How does one even love themselves if nobody loves you back? It's embarrassing. 

My time is running out since I can't talk to people out of school. It's weird to approach them. They didn't go outside to meet some random guy. They went out to do errands or something.

But can someone help me? What should I do about the whole loving yourself situation. If this helps I am autistic and I do have borderline personality disorder. 

Thank you.",1
Bittersweet nostalgia/longing for the innocence of childhood,"For some reason, I have always latched onto nostalgia as a coping mechanism. Occasionally it's for my teenage years, more often than that I get nostalgic for my young child-preteen years. 
It's hard to explain, because even though I still had things to be unhappy about, I was content with how I perceived the world in my little kid brain. I wasn't corrupted by bad actors in my life, or exposed to evil. As an adult, my brain is so noisy and chaotic that I'm more of a homebody than anything. Being an adult with a drug/alcohol/gambling/anger problem is a much different animal and zaps of me any motivation to feel human. It kills the part of me that has imagination and creativity.  I used to be an open minded kid hungry for knowledge about things I didn't yet understand. Sometimes I'll put on an old movie or play a video game I used to like to peer into my little kid brain, but it's usually a very bittersweet feeling.

Sorry for the long rambling, hopefully my post connected with you in some way. Especially those who long to feel the innocence of being a kid again.",1

I want to get out of this prison.,"I don’t understand how you can get better. I mean you just can’t look at things the same like you once did. Everything is boring and colorless. People always told me that it will get better as your getting older. But they left the part where it doesn’t work for everyone, like what the hell man. I can’t build relationships with people, I’ve lost interest in all the things I used to love. Even if I find something new, it’ll eventually get boring to me and right I’ll be right where started. Lost my social skills a long fucking time ago and I can’t look people in the eyes. Listening to the same songs for a year or two cause I’m not putting any effort to listen to anything new. I hate going outside during the day. It’s too painful to see everybody with a love one or a group of friends. Always look happy and having fun. I know that some ppl can fake that shit. But you can tell that is truly happy and that’s something I don’t think I’ll ever get back. And knowing that it feels like a prison. I don’t know how long I’ve been here and everything feels like an eternity of numbness. I don’t know long I have but I’ll try to hang on as long as I can.",1
I think I'm going to do it tonight,"My life is going no where and I hate the position I'm in, it's been years and I feel nothing changes no matter what I do, no-one in my family understands. Everyone thinks I'm dramatic and that it's all because I'm drinking everyday, my dad says if I do it he'll do it too. I can't handle life and the people around me, the only thing I think about is a near painless way to go. I've had terrible things happen to me as a kid and I've also done shitty things to others, I never hurt anyone but I failed so many.

I just don't know anymore,"  For the last 2 years I've been extremely sad at almost all times. About 2 years ago my grandpa died, obviously I'd be sad. I feel like that just opened the door to all my bad thoughts and emotions. I haven't ever had a good outlook on myself, I think I'm a 2/10 at best, I'm not funny, and I absolutely hate myself in every sense of the word. 
  I've never had any luck romantically(I know that's very common) and rejection is never a surprise anymore. As a result of the constant rejection both romantically and socially I never talk to anyone new EVER. I actively avoid all social interaction if possible and I don't feel like I have anything to give anyone. I'm just an annoying burden with absolutely 0 worth. I've tried all the things and they don't work. ""Talking about it"" has gotten me nothing but judgement and some of the very few people I talk to think I'm making an excuse to not do things with them. 
  It's gotten worse recently, for the last few weeks all I've been thinking about is how much better the world would be without me. I've completely stopped drawing/sketching (The only thing I liked to do) I have no inspiration and feel like I'm forcing it too hard whenever I even attempt to draw. So I stopped. I am a shell of my former happy outgoing self because I've got nothing to show for it. All I did was be nice and considerate and do what all good boys and girls are supposed to do and I've got absolutely nothing for it. I'm aware I'm not owed anything but it would be nice once in a while. I've only gotten bullied for existing, which at this point in time I'd love to stop doing.
  I've been in my bathroom for 2 hours crying on and off with a knife in my hand, I'm thinking about the least painful knife related way to die. I can't do it, I don't know what in the universe is making me this much of a coward. I don't think I'm scared, as an atheist I've fully accepted my reality of there being no afterlife or reincarnation. I fully wish to go into the void of nothingness to free the world of the pain that is me. I just don't know anymore. I feel empty and worthless. 🫤",1

Fast forward to present I still can’t feel anything, happiness, sadness are so foreign to me after those years of struggling I really don’t know what to do.

Going Off Meds?,"My wife has been suffering from insomnia/anxiety/depression since about August after a very stressful event in our lives.   She was totally fine before this.   After a couple of months she got the Insomnia cured with trazadone, but still was battling depression and anxiety.   She has tried multiple meds without success and now the insomnia is back, probably as a result of one of the new meds, but those new meds should make her more tired.   It seems like we are back at square one and she is thinking of going off her meds (under doctor supervision), I sort of see her point, but I think these meds must be helping even if it is just a bit.  I am wondering have any of you tried this and what was the outcome?   What did you do in replace of the meds if you were successful in going off them?",1
I'm I just fucked if I have both anxiety and depression?,Sometimes it feels like so,1
I Think I might have depression but I’m not sure,"For some context I was a pretty normal kid growing up until my parents got divorced when I was around 10. I felt like I needed to grow up for my mother who always had a hard time finding good men so I kind of acted like an adult sometimes even when I was young, and I think that cut off some of my childhood. When I was around 9 my dad got remarried to someone who seemed really nice but she is a selfish prick I learned as I continued to grow up in the house. My mom ended up getting into drugs pretty bad and I couldn’t see her for a few years in college. But I managed to graduate Highschool with a degree and almost a valedictorian, but not quite

So here’s where the story is. I just got back from college and suffice it to say that I messed up pretty bad my first year. I failed a bunch of classes because I ended up getting really sick in the second semester and once I got back to being able to go to classes I felt so far behind that I didn’t think I could keep going to classes. When I started to stop going I beat myself up for it because I felt like a disappointment to my parents. I finally got back from college a few days ago and I told my parents that I needed a gap semester for myself to figure out what I really want to do so I’m not just going to college to go to college. When I talked to them I talked about wanting to maybe explore the world a little bit while I’m still young and able to and my dad interjected “that’s not how the world works” and that hit pretty hard because I’ve always just taken everything that they say to me because every time I’ve interjected I’ve been grounded Or berated for expressing myself or an opinion. What my stepmom said to me was far worse in my opinion as she said “you know we co-signed that loan with you so if you don’t pay it we are the ones who get hosed” which really told me where her priorities with me were. My mom has been pretty supportive to me about this and she understands what I’m going through. I recently decided to move in with my mother because I don’t know if I can keep dealing with them. A little of a side note but my dad is basically telling me I have to get some 40 hr a week job by the end of the week, and I think that’s a little bit unfair because I’m still young, I want to hang out with my friends while I’m still young but they insist that I get a job, almost like they think I’m going to be a bum, as they would say

For the depression part is I think I have depression but I don’t want to just say that because I’ve grown up in a household that isn’t really good with emotional sharing and while I was in college I had thoughts of suicide but I didn’t want people to deal with the gruesomeness of my corpse and I didn’t want to upset my mom.

I don’t know what to do anymore I’m so stressed and tired of this",1
i'm so miserable,"I'm so fucking miserable. I am losing my friends, my closest friend who's like a brother to me of 8years I think is becoming more close with our new friend and It's my fault because I cannot muster any sort of activity cause of my depression. They all think I hate that new friend, but I really don't I think. They all thought I was jealous, and I said ''No, why would I be? That's silly, and stupid. I'm really not.'' But they didn't believe me cause I said it in a VERY fake way, and now I think they're starting to be right which I feel awful about. I'm becoming a disgusting version of myself and I feel like I'm falling down a pit and watching myself do so, I can't stand living anymore I hate it. My grades are getting slightly better but, I'm losing all my friends and I feel horrendous. My father doesn't like the idea of me being depressed so he's hooking me up to get hobbies and I have to take this music class which I feel like I'm gonna fuck up horrendously and it's gonna leave me ruined.

I'm never seeking help,"I made a post yesterday asking how to know when you need to seek professional help. Today, I happened to end up in the situation perfect for me to seek the school counselor. Such a coincidence right? And I guess I must've been insane because I decided to. And lol that essentially felt like public humiliation and I'm  never seeking help ever again.

First of all, they informed me that discussing anything related to self-harm or suicide obliged them to inform parents and the relevant authorities. Although, I guess I expected it. But that just means that the only legitimate reason I had for seeking help couldn't be a reason anymore. 

Still, I decided to talk about friendship-related stuff instead. I even teared up a few times (which made it worse because why did I break so easily and why did the person's words even mean anything when I knew they thought I was a joke). They were judging me the entire time I was there, as if I was an immature teenager who was overly concerned with friends and obviously lacking life experience because life isn't all about friends. Fair enough, I am. But I wasn't expecting it. I used the term 'emotionally unavailable' at some point, which may have been slightly off because I just wanted to describe being too emotionally overwhelmed for anything, but then the counsellor basically clowned me for the rest of the session with that term lmao. They kept laughing whenever they said it 'to put it in my words', along with things.

Not that I want to discourage anyone else from seeking help. Please do. This is just my personal experience. Perhaps I expected too much of a school counselor. Perhaps I didn't even need to seek help in the first place. Either way, I'm never doing it again. I tried taking a step towards getting better and now I'm two steps back. Dying does seem like a better alternative doesn't it lol",1
hello,"
Hey guys, I'm not really sure why I'm posting this, but I just wanted to put myself out there for once. I'm a 19-year-old guy, and I'm really struggling with some stuff. I don't even know if anyone will read this, but I figured it couldn't hurt to try.

I've been dealing with some pretty severe depression for a while now. It's hard to describe exactly how I feel, but I just feel really lost and hopeless all the time. I don't really have anyone to talk to about it, and I don't think anyone really notices me or my problems. I actually don't have anyone to talk about anything except my weird confusion and poor self image.

I've been isolated for most of my teenage years and even some of my childhood. I don't really blame anyone for that, it's just the way things worked out. But for the past 5 years, I've been completely alone, and it's really taking a toll on my mental health.

I don't have any goals or anyone to live for, and I just feel like I'm drifting through life with no purpose. I've tried to find things that interest me, but I always seem to lose motivation pretty quickly. I feel like I've failed at just about everything I've tried, and anything good that's happened to me has just been luck.

I know this might sound irrational, but I feel like the only thing that might work for me is finding someone who's going through the same thing. Someone who's just as confused and lost as I am, so we can figure things out together. But I don't want advice or a mentor or anything like that. I just want to connect with someone on an equal level.

Anyway, sorry for rambling on. I don't really expect anything to come of this, but it feels good to at least try to put myself out there. Thanks for reading, whoever you are.",1
Feeling guilty,Would you kill yourself if you contracted herpes.

Relationship advice,"My wife has depression and I'm always trying to learn and support anyway I can. A common issue we run into is that she can let very minor things totally de-rail her day. For example if I was to say ""yeah we can do that"" vs. "" yeah I'd love to do that"" she will overthink the sentence and take it as I'm only doing the activity because she asked and I'm not actually happy to be doing it which could lead to her thoughts and mood to spiral. The only thing I've seen work so far as a solution is to just talk out whatever the situation was about and give her space until she can bounce back and then she'll come to me when she's over it. This solution is ok but depending on the bounce back time can take 20 mins or sometimes up to 24hrs for something bigger. Is there anything I can do that's more preventative instead of reactionary to this situation? Or is this just a normal symptom of depression I need to be patient and sympathetic for? Any advice is appreciated, thank you all.",1
Life is too much work to be enjoyable,"And it just keeps getting worse. I have to put out more for less return.

"Guilty about fatigue, cant help it","hey everyone, so I have been depressed ever since I can remember. I have extreme fatigue. I remember as a teenager I would just feel so tired and I would feel very guilty. recently, I went through a phase in which I was extremely suicidal, and my fatigue was just very bad. I was also working the night shift which made my fatigue even worse. Now I am trying to do more things during my days just so I am not in bed all the time . however, it is extremely rough. For example today, I took a walk with my mom in the morning, I did some laundry, and I went to target & ulta. Right as I was getting home, I couldn't take the exhaustion anymore. I had to lay Down for a little bit. my mom was in the kitchen cooking and I felt bad for her because she's doing all the work by herself. I wish I had the energy to help her around in the kitchen. I asked her if it was OK if I rest a little bit, and she said yes. Regardless, I still feel pretty guilty about not helping her out. later on today I have to go to therapy and a friend is coming over because I need to give her her birthday gift. this is a very busy day and I'm just exhausted. i have to be in bed by 9pm bc I work tomorrow early in the morning. I also wanted to review some work stuff. I mean it's good that im busy because I don't think about negative stuff but I'm just very exhausted. I have come a long way though because two months ago I couldn't even get out of bed and my mom would have to do my laundry. I feel so bad for putting my mom through this, so I helped by buying the detergent & softener for the clothes. I also bought groceries and pay for food. it's just I don't know how to stop feeling guilty when my body starts getting tired. I admired my mom for working so hard & understanding my depression. any tips.",1
I don’t feel like a belong in this world,"I’ve come to realize that I’ve been crying a lot lately when I’m in bed at night. My body, my face. It doesn’t feel beautiful. The world and it’s people don’t feel beautiful. My life overall just doesn’t feel beautiful. It all seems so rotten. 

When I was young, I’ve always felt the need to be kind. Be polite to others and they’ll treat you the same. So I thought. People judge you, treat you harshly, do what they can to push you down. Over the years, I thought that I’d grown a thick skin. But it all cracks. I feel beat down. People who don’t even know me will think I’m disgusting or sick in the head. I never asked to be this way. It’s just the way I am. I struggle and fight and work on myself the best I can. And for what? To still feel like shit at the end of the day? I’m tired. I’m so so tired. My heart aches every night. It hurts so much that I wish I never existed. I feel like all the times that I was happy were all drowned out by all the shit in the world. It’s so crap to say but even those who gave me love and support don’t feel enough for me. I won’t kill myself because I’m a coward. I know that. But I’ll always feel like this in the back of my head.",1
Standing on the outside looking in.,"I'm beginning to come out the other side of a really severe, numbing depressive state. Today was horrible. Horrible in the sense that I'm not shutting down or repressing. 
Instead, I'm actually allowing myself to feel all the negative emotions. Goddamn, feeling really hurts sometimes. I haven't cried this hard in as long as I can remember. Ugly crying is what my sister would call it. 

Anyway, it reminded me of something I wrote last year. Last year when I began this self improvement journey to reconnect with my emotions. I just wanted to share. 


```
Now my emotions are not numb, I cry, I fear, I yearn, I love.
With this clarity, I remember feeling before
This softening is familiar, I've resurfaced before.
I remember how strongly I felt love for someone else, and it wasnt returned.
The most powerful feeling I've ever known.
But I was not worthy.
Following my lead, She concurred
Eventually that love was exhausted. In its place loneliness and longing grew.
The most powerful feeling I've ever known
Eventually I wasn't lonely. Eventually there was no longing.
I was worthless.
And I don't like feeling worthless. So I don't.
Now I don't feel much, everything is gray and flat.
People in arms reach are distant.
The world is foreign only to me. I am a stranger there.
Now I remember how much feeling hurts.
Now I remember how strongly I feel
Now I remember why I am numb.

"What’s the point, really?","hi all. this is just a vent. what’s the point of life? i’m 20 years old, i’ve never been in a relationship, and that’s probably my own fault. i’m fat and i have been for a while now. and even if i did put in the effort to lose weight, what’s the point? all i do now is work. i hardly ever go anywhere in public anymore. my anxiety prohibits it. so even if i did lose enough weight to be attractive, i feel like it won’t even matter because i’m not socializing with anybody. and i don’t think fat people are unattractive, but i know that the vast majority of people do. i don’t want to go my entire life without love. a few of my friends are in great relationships and i am very very happy for them but i wish i had someone to love, like they do. i have one friend i enjoy hanging out with in public, but we hardly ever see each other. what’s the point? honestly.",1
I’m losing my battle with life.,"I’m a Veteran with sever anxiety and depression. I’ve self-sabotaged every relationship and friendship I’ve had out of fear of the unknown. My anxiety has taken over my life and pretty much controls it. My partner is thinking of calling it quits because it’s become too much and it kills me. My friends keep their distance with me because I’m sick. I eat right, I workout, I do Brazilian Jiu jitsu, I go to school, I go to therapy. I really do try and nothing is working. I don’t feel like life is worth living, everyday for the past 7 years I tell myself to keep pushing, that my big break is coming. But I’m met with trouble it seems like. I’m tired of this, I’m tired of being controlled by my bad thoughts. I hate this so much. I can’t even feel joy without the fear of it being taken away. I just want to be happy and feel joy and love without being scared. But I’m so screwed up that I can’t even process it.

Nothing feels right. everything is uncomfortable. something is wrong.,"im wondering if anyone else has this feeling.

where Every moment of my life is spent feeling wrong. like im sick without any symptoms, like im extremely tired but not exhausted, like ive forgotten something extremely important, like theres something i need to be doing but im not, like im trying to avoid something but its also something i really want to do.

i feel wrong and miserable and it makes me uncomfortable to be around people, even the ones i love. it just compounds on other shit and makes shit even harder to do.

everything just feels so wrong and uncomfortable and its fucking stifling. 


its totally unexplainable and im not really doing it justice.
if anyone knows whether this is just some stupid shit caused by being depressed or some other shit lemme know.
im asking cause i need a justification for posting this rather than the sadder fact i just wanna be sad about myself but have noone but reddit.

"I know I'm depressed, but I don't know why, and talking to therapists hasn't helped me","I've tried lots of things. Exercise and journaling and talking to therapists etc. Nothing's helping. 

But now I'm actually scared for my health.

I can't bring myself to shower unless I start to smell myself, and it takes a lot of effort. My hair is so matted and I get so impatient trying to detangle it that I just give up and then slap it in a ponytail under a hat for work. Brushing my teeth seems impossible now. I went from being underweight to being overweight and now pre-diabetic as well as insulin-resistent. I went to the doctor for irregular periods (4 months minimum gap between cycles) and was told I had the lowest vitamin D count they've ever seen in their life (7). I never have energy. My room is disgusting. I do nothing except sleep when I'm at home, and I purposely overwork myself . The only thing I can find myself able to put energy towards is my job and I'm damn good at it. I'm constantly working overtime, I was promoted to the head manager, and I spend as much time as I can there. I don't know why. I can't seem to do anything else but I can't resist coming into work until my boss forces me to go home. And then I blow all my money on food and stupid shit. I know I need help. But I don't know how to ask for it or WHO to ask for it when a therapist hasn't helped me before. I'm seeing one right now but I don't see any progress and I've run out of things to say. I don't want to die young but I can't seem to care if I do anyways. What a joke.",1
I fear this emptiness is never going to leave me,"It's been with me for so many years now. I can't shake it off. Even though I'm with a girl that I love and it can sometimes be difficult to make work because it's a long distance relationship, I feel so alone and that nobody has my back or cares for me. Not that you should expect a relationship to magically cure your depression because believe me, it doesn't. I don't know what the answer is and I wish I did.

The older I get (I'm 31), the worse it becomes. It baffles me that some others make it to such high ages in life. I find so much of existing mentally tiring and a struggle. Trying to find some joy here and there and sometimes I do, but it isn't enough. I just always feel like I'm not good enough for some reason.

I miss being younger before any of this was brought on. I completely changed around my mid twenties. I can't go back to who I was. Feel so hollow and barely have the motivation to do anything.",1
Nota single good thing happened in my life,May it be love or at work or even in school. Every friend I had is gone. Every choice I make is breaking me apart.

"I could never kill myself, I am overwhelmed by fear of physical pain","I'll sometimes tie a noose and put it around my neck, so that it exerts the slightest bit of pressure on my airway & vessels. Or rest the tip of a large knife against my abdomen. Or lean over the railing on the roof of my apartment. Or stand at the edge of a train platform. At that point, a sense of overwhelming dread and fear washes over me, I get chills, and I know I wouldn't be able to go any further. My base self preservation instinct is too strong, as well as my hypochondria and intolerance to any sort of physical discomfort, I guess. I test it out every month or so, just to see if I've gotten more accustomed to it, but the feelings are as strong as ever. I try to rationalise with myself - that even if I didn't kill myself, death will always come with pain (from illness, or an accident, etc) - and so it really shouldn't stop me from just expediting the process. But I just can't do it.

Guns aren't easily accessible where I live - I do wonder if I'd find it easier to overcome that fear if I were holding a gun, since it seems to be a more instantaneous and (semi-)reliable way to go.",1

Roller coaster year,"I've been fighting with myself over the last year about my decisions and life choices...and it feel likes it's a never ending game.

Over the last year, I had an incident that happened with my car. It was towed incorrectly and pulled 75 miles (it's and all wheel drive) and did some major damage. I've had it repairs multiple times but I have anxiety attacks every time my car pops a check engine light. Every time it pops up is due to choices I made trying to fix it/ improper repairs.

While waiting for repairs to be done in November of last year my fiance was hit my a car on his bicycle and could have died. I was also in school at the time so I'm not even sure how I made it through that.

I had to increase my meds which I thought would help, but I don't know who to go to or who to talk to...I can't even find a therapist. I feel like I'm trapped and barely have the courage to post this. 😢

I'm just not sure of what else to do. I've tried everything to bring positive vibes/ thinking, mediation, but I'm just in so much pain mental and physically. 😞",1

I'm always wrong...except about being always wrong and life sucking. I'm 100% right about that.,"Anyone experience this? 

A tenacious self-loathing about how I'm a terrible human being, with awful judgement, that can never be trusted to make sound decisions, with fatalistic, negative beliefs about how myself and life in general sucks and always will.

But, ironically it's this opinion, and (only this opinion) that I'm ever correct on, and have resilient confidence in. So much so, that no amount of therapy, positive thinking, self-help techniques, mental health et al. can argue me out of it. Ever.

I'm always wrong about everything, except about how I'm a piece of shit that is always wrong (in every single viewpoint except this one) who will never amount to anything. Bet your bottom dollar on that one.

Where is that kind of confidence when I actually need to achieve anything in life?",1
I’ve noticed that happier people stay busy.,"Since I was a young girl I noticed this. Happy people move around a lot, they don’t sit on their couch or on their phone for hours at a time. They have hobbies they get into around the house, meet up with friends, and etc.

I don’t have the desire to be busy all the time. Even when I was at my happiest I was not a busy body.

Edit/Update: wow, & Thank you for all the insightful responses. I tried to respond to everyone so if I didn’t yet, I will later. Taking a break from Reddit for now. 

In summary, I think one can conclude: being “busy” appears to be a better alternative for coping with depression than just being sedentary - but does NOT guarantee happiness. Some say it’s just a distraction from thinking, and a few others say it has either helped them get through everyday life while living with depression or know someone else who has expressed and admitted this. Many of you, including myself, say it’s hard to always be busy because the symptoms of depression make it incredibly challenging to do so. However, I’ve also gotten several practical responses to how I can incorporate more quality activities in my life that are realistic for me and even offer a perspective I hadn’t considered before. Maybe the the goal isn’t to spend every waking hour doing something to avoid thinking, but instead, choose a few activities that give you some meaning to your life.",1
can't decide if my life is chill af or horribly lonely,"i'm 36, been disabled with primary progressive MS since 2020, can't walk except very short distances with a walker like to go from my room to the bathroom, need a wheelchair if I leave the house like for a doctor's appointment. On disability, live with my parents for now, and when they get too old have plans to live with my sister.

Every day is the same. Wake up, alternate between listening to music and watching anime for 13 or 14 hours, go to sleep, over and over. Sometimes I'm like ""wow, i'm so lucky, I don't have to work, and I get to just chill in my room doing things I like all the time."" And then sometimes (like now) I feel so depressed and lonely living in this weird sort of purgatory.

I think I'm just venting, but also need some perspective. Like, how would you feel if you were told you didn't have to work anymore, but in exchange you can't walk anymore.",1
"If life is going to be like this, I don't like life","My parents divorced when I was less than a year old because he was a bipolar alcoholic who was very scary when he was in his angry phases, so I was a weekend custody kid. He was actually pretty alright around me, buying me toys, taking me places, but when he moved into his new girlfriend's home, he showed some of those angry phases. I stayed every other weekend and it was very stressful sometimes, but good at least 3/4 of the time. In those stressful situations he would shout and get mad, occasionally I could hear some stuff get knocked around, but sometimes he would end up pushing and grabbing my stepsister, who was a few years younger, and I occasionally had to stop it from escalating. It was overall stressful for me. One night I had to call the cops on him when he was drunk. It was a harsh environment sometimes, but not the worst, no torture, no belts, and frequent legit happiness.

I was always spared

After that I didn't see him for a while. He died 2021, and I never got any resolution to any of it. I learned recently that his family was abusive, even covering up how my uncle raped my dad. Last semester I had to read a book in class that dealt with abuse, and it retriggered all of my post traumatic feelings. 

Now, as I look around the world, it barely feels worth living for. Abuse, torture, rape, it's just fucking everywhere. Even before I became depressed I was hyper sensitive to people suffering, and now it's so bad I don't think I'll ever read a book, or hell, consume any non-musical media again. It's all just so terrible, but if I express this, I'm just a fucking emo teenager whining about shit. I know there is more to life than this, but it doesn't change the fact that it exists. I have no motivation or hope anymore, and I barely feel like I matter. My life isn't bad enough anymore to matter.",1

Depression is fucking me up. (real),"For so long now, I've wanted to die. Whether it be me cutting my wrist or blowing my head off, it was always one way after another. I'm going into ninth grade this year, and I had a relationship with this girl, who said she loved me forever. Now I did know it would end at some point, but the one thing that made this even worse when she broke up with me, is the fact that I had gave her everything. I spent over $3,000 in 6 months, 6 MONTHS MAN?? She was also the first girl to take my virginity, which at the time I thought was special, but then realized it didn't matter so much. She had cheated on me 5 times while I was dating her. When I found out, she explained each way to my face, on how she fucked these guys. At first, I didn't care. I didn't know that holding my feelings balled up inside me, was going to cause me to cut my wrist 2 weeks later. I was sent straight to the hospital and was stuck there for 1 week and a half. Getting home to see my family in tears.. hurt me, soooo fucking much. The one thing I never want to do again is to fall in love. If I do, I'll purposefully put myself in the E-R. Never in my life do I want to hurt this much again. Tbh, this whole vent was to say to everyone that I am unwell. I still wish I died on that kitchen floor that night, and I still cry at home, but I act like I'm fine at school. I'm fat, unattractive, and overall.. I just wish I wasn't alive anymore. Most times, I want to kill myself, but then I realize how many people I would end up hurting more than I hurt myself.",1

But instead I embrace the pain,
Knowing one day I'll find the strength,
To face the world again.

As torturous screams fill the air,

But I find myself bored and generally just unamused with everything. I know one of my issues is my own knowledge of that fact that none of it matters in the slightest, I'm not religious or hold any beliefs in anything whatsoever, I mean shit I don't even believe in luck. I have come to terms with my own mortality through a couple very close calls. Knowing that nothing matters has given me more personal freedom than I ever would've thought myself to have. I feel truly free to enjoy myself as I please and everyone including me knows I'm a kind and gentle human. But here I am, chronically bored.

How do you deal with constantly letting people down?,"When I am at my worst, I withdraw completely. I cancel plans (although I hardly ever make any for this reason), I stay in my room, and I am by myself. My anxiety prior to leaving the house or before a planned event/meeting can be so debilitating that I lose sleep thinking about it and I just go into a downward spiral.

My mom, who has suffered with depression and suicide ideation since I was 13, is just not like this. She goes through it differently and copes differently. She's always been able to carrying on with basic hygiene and cleaning around her house, cooking etc. Lately, it takes everything I've got to have a shower or cook for myself, so making plans is not something I do because it just isn't feasible most of the time. 

Lately I've been feeling a bit better, so I said I'd go to her house for mothers day - she was having a bbq with my brother and his family, too. 

The night before I started with the worrying and didn't end up in a good place mentally. I cancelled on her the next day. I've cancelled on her before, but this time she was mad. She ignored my call and didn't return it - just replied to my Facebook message to her saying I tried to call and happy mothers day etc. 

I know cancelling on her was a shitty thing to do, but I just couldn't bring myself to do all of it, and I thought if anyone could understand it would be her. She knows I'm struggling right now. I just don't know how to keep realistic expectations for myself without losing everyone along the way. I know I've disappointed a lot of people when I cancel plans but it just gets so overwhelming I can't do anything. 

How do you manage expectations while still trying to be a good friend and person along the way?",1

Self-sabotage,"A few months ago I decided I wanted to start working out and found myself a nice few exercises to follow on YouTube. It wasn’t too intense, but I wanted to start off small and practice setting goals and routines, so that I could slowly add on to it and not feel overwhelmed. And honestly? For a while, it was going pretty well. It became a bit of a habit for me. I started to see tiny results. I felt good. 

And then for some reason I decided to just stop. I was like, “eh, it’s fine if I skip today, I’ll just do double the workout tomorrow” or “a few days won’t make a difference in my gains” and now I’m sitting on my ass a few months later with all of my progress reverted. I haven’t worked out in a long time, and I feel worse than ever. Why did I insist on suddenly stopping, just when I was developing a healthy routine and feeling good about myself? Why did I let myself do that? I know I need to push myself to be better or whatever the hell in order to combat my depression but every single time I try I just give up and end up setting myself back. Whenever something starts going well I immediately fuck it up. Why even try anything at this point? I know it’s not going to work anyway. I doubt I’ll be trying to set another workout routine anytime soon, that’s for sure. I’ll just be disappointed. 

Sometimes (all the time) I really really hate myself.",1
I just feel so hopeless...,"I feel so hopeless, I don’t know what to do. I still live with my parents, but my relationship with my family sucks. I have no friends, have never been in a romantic relationship, I’ve never had a job. Even simple things like having a clean pair of socks is too much to ask for apparently. I really don’t see how anything can change, for the better anyways. On top of my own problems my parents marriage is falling apart, which isn’t helping things. I’m just doing really bad.

Summer SAD,"For my fellow peeps that also struggle with summertime sadness, what helps? I find myself more exhausted and overwhelmed the longer and sunnier the days get. 🌞",1
I just wanna end it,"I am 21 years old Italian, nearly 22, and i've got these type of thoughts since I was like 10, but always ignored them, but sometimes they always return. And now, I just can't think of avoiding them. I didn't, and still don't know what to do with my life. I have ADHD and probably developed through depression some personality disorder, but having ADHD and growing tired and bored with things kinda fast, I just can't work, between being in a office, working 6 days out of 7 like my mother does, I prefer die. The only thing that can bring me joy, are gaming, but I guess with the many people doing it, the little pubblic being Italian gives, and being shy/depressed myself, that can't turn in to a job; the other thing is art. I went to an art high-school, and I had a wonderful time, finding friends and teachers that I liked, even if sometimes it was rough, and there was Covid in the middle of everything, I knew it was worth it. Then, nearly a year ago, it ended. I didn't found anything beyond it, I didn't know how to be an artist, all my friends were too far away, not even in the near cities, I didn't know what do to with my life. I thought I could get that figured out in time, while I attended an art university, but has since passed a year, I still don't know what to do, and everything that teached me university is pointless, nothing I can't find on the most basic of the YT channels. 

For all my life, people said I was wrong. My jokes, my look, my face, the round of my face, my beard, my body, ironic that somehow I even got called fat for a bit of time at school, without ever being, I'm now 1.70 tall with 60 kg, at least depression never put me in a condition to always eat. Now, I'm thinking, they were right, not for the reasons they gave me, of course, but I am wrong, I can't find my place in the world. Even if I quit university, what's in then for me? Finding a job that I'm going to hate and quit? Waiting to become a famous artist while playing tons of videogames? Very recently I'm starting to wish that when I go to sleep, I don't want to wake up. Being by IA taking control over night, being by WW3 starting over night, being by a thief, even by some magical portal with monsters, even by a zombie outrage over night. Because, in the end, I'm so wrong I can't even put up with the solution  to my problem I've found. Maybe, not the best of solutions, but a solution nonetheless.",1
i use humor way too much,"i use humor to lighten up my depression. even if im having a bad day or something made me annoyed, i joke about it. but ever since i got hospitalized for my depression because of attempting to kms, i send my family to panic when i joke around. i get it though why they’re like that. idk if that’s healthy cant diagnose myself either. 

My family don’t even want to talk about it. they’re too aloof of what i had gone through. idk what else to do to cope. i just feel like im constantly being constrained of saying things inside my head. this feels bad. i know im gonna lose it sooner or later. sorry if my grammar is not perfect. English is not my first language",1
what do i do,"I'm 19 years old and home for the summer from college. my dad and I never got along that well. we disagree on most things and we get into fights all the time. maybe hate is too strong of a word because we do get along sometimes but I feel like we are always at a constant battle. recently, I have not been doing well mentally and have been really unhappy. spending my hours laying in bed and not having the energy of doing anything. Last night my dad came into my room and started screaming at me for my room being messy, ruining Mother's Day because I did not leave my room, etc., and took my phone. He made me feel so shitty and I truly felt bad. when I get into these arguments I ""shut down"" and don't say anything because I think if I do say what's really on my mind he will contradict it and say that's not a reason. Today, I quit my job and began applying for new ones online on my computer. He again, comes into my room and asks why I'm not at work and I said I quit. before I can even explain myself he starts screaming at me saying I'm lazy that I'm a guest living in his house and that I could be homeless soon and so on. I don't say anything throughout this whole thing which is making him even more mad. I can't remember all the things he said because I think I blocked it out. As he was yelling he puts his hand into a fist calling me a bitch and I yell ""Yeah Hit me"". He laughs and said ""You would like that wouldn't you"" and I ran into my bathroom and locked the door. I start having a panic attack and he says ""Let me see your tears"" like he wanted to see me cry. a few hours later he's talking to me like nothing happened but I'm still pissed. I'm I wrong to be upset? he does not understand what I am going through and called me mentally retarded for thinking I have depression or ADHD. I don't know what to do. I'm tired of all the fighting and kinda scared of him. he has never hit me but threw a cup of water in my face one time when we were arguing. any advice on how to deal with this? living at home is a nightmare because I'm always reminded that my parents favor my sister more and that my mom does absolutely nothing about my dad. i just want to leave but I have no money. any advice is good!",1
I am lonely,"I (33f) haven’t had a boyfriend in 10 years. I struggle maintaining relationships and boundaries. Friendships are few and far between, often not lasting longer than a few months or years. I don’t know what to do. I feel so lonely, used, alone, depressed all the time. I feel worthless and unwanted. I like to have fun, I try to love myself, I take myself out to dinner/dates. Guys that are interested see me as a wet body to use. No one really cares about me. I get lonely and suicidal, but I never burden anyone with those thoughts. It’s hard for me to find anyone to hang out with and trust, and oftentimes I’m left feeling suicidal by myself, which scares me a lot. 

I just don’t know what to do. How do I make friends? I feel like I’m so old now that it’s just becoming more and more difficult to meet people. What do I do?",1
Hey people!,"I just wanted to write a little bit about what's been happening to me lately.

losing my nana.,"my nana has alcohol induced dementia and her progression this year is scary. this is the first year i've really noticed her change in speech, posture and movement. it started as a stutter, and now she forgets her plans, gets her days mixed up, can't remember a word out of almost every sentence. she shuffles her feet instead of taking real steps and she's covered in blood bruises. i'm so so scared to lose her, i feel like she's slipping away really fast. we had mother's day dinner with her tonight, and it broke my heart to see how she can't communicate well anymore. she looks to my grandpa for help too. i cannot imagine losing my nana.  i just lost my uncle this previous week, and trying to deal with everything and the permanence of death. i cant tell if it makes me want to leave on my own terms or if it scares me into wanting to avoid living. id really appreciate some support from you guys, and some similar situations if you can relate.",1
Working while super depressed,Has anyone else had to work while depression is kicking in. My job has a ton of stress but I can't afford to not be there or my situation gets worse. My work suffers. I am sloppy and distracted and  I endanger my job just by working while depressed... What can I do???,1
I don't understand,I really don't understand what's wrong with me. I work hard. I love the best that I can. I try to be as kind as I can but people still want nothing to do with me. I never get any sort of breaks. I am immensely proud of the progress I've made in my personal life but it never seems to be enough. I apply to jobs and don't get it. I try love but never win. Do you think there's such a thing as a negative conduit? Like maybe the reason why some people have such good luck is because there's someone else who absorbs the bad? Idk. Maybe I just wax philosophy too much.,1
I'm not sure if I'm Depressed or just Disappointed with my Life.,"I come on here every day and read a lot of the posts, especially on this sub.  I realize that a lot of people here are in a deeper depression, and I can't really relate to them that well.

So as far as I am concerned, I'm generally in a decent mood most of the time. Im able to get up after sleeping without issue, I function well daily doing the things I need to do. I laugh, have fun, and enjoy my hobbies (which I generally do by myself).

My general problems lie on two things. Not having friends to share things with, and having a general disappointment about the way my life turned out.
I do get unhappy and it throws me into a funk at times but they are few and far between.
I know depression can come in many forms, but there are few times in my life when I wasn't able to pull myself out of being unhappy. 

So what do I call this, just a general dissatisfaction with my life, or would it be categorized as minor depression. 

Just not sure.",1
I have no idea for a title,"I miss the time were i felt alive. I was just a kid living the best of life. Everything looked so colorful and tasted good. I remember feeling the sweetest scent ever, and it made me think of that gorgeous girl, i had a crush so hard for her. I loved to just talk to her again, so i could look deep into those beatiful eyes. I would go to my best friend's house, play dozens of games and joke around like idiots. Or get all my buddies and go watch a movie.
Well... i'm trying to say that life was really nice. I could enjoy every little thing. I didn't have to think about the future, because i was living every moment to the fullest. I was happy.

But my depression screwed it all. Now i'm just a empty shell of the person i used to be. Trapped in my own body, unable to feel something. Life has lost all meaning and joy. Sometimes it feels like food has no taste, there's no scent in the air, i swear even the light of the day feels diferent, more grey. I'm lonely so badly that even in my dreams my friends ask me why i left them. But i can't send a message, because i honestly believe their friend is long dead. They have better friends. Real people to talk to.

I'm tired of pretending i'm fine, while i'm obviously slowly dying. But what's the point of looking for help? People can't possibly understand, they'll laugh and treat me as a weirdo. Or pity me. Or send me to a psych ward and throw me away. And they can pretend i'm important to them as much as they want, but in the end of the day, i'll be alone in my suffering. I may speak about my darkness, but only i can see it. Eveyone get back to their houses and enjoy life, while i pretend to be human.",1

I don't understand my objective in life,"For context ,I'm from Hungary but I love in Italy since I was 6 because my mom found a job here.
I passed trough a lot of shit during my life,my weak ass father killed himself,I changed schools like 6 times,I had to go to live in Germany for 3 years with my grandparents,to then come back to Italy,in a different place.
Fast forward to middle school,never been good at a single thing except English.My votes were always terrible because I didn't see the point in studying stuff I'll never need in life.During those 3 years I got a fell in love with a girl but got rejected, twice.That hurt ,a lot, but I didn't want to talk about It to anyone ,especially my mother cause we already had enough trouble to go trough(she and her bf broke up,they still are In contact and good friends tho,they just didn't understand each other well).
Middle school ends.My mother worked as a barista at the time and she barley could pay rent ,she wasn't sure if she could pay a highschool for me.To my ""luck"" she eventually hooked up with his asshole that's she could use as a credit card to an extent ,on thing pulls the other and we move in with him.That place sucked ass.Small city,nothing really to do,not even a normal park.Whatever,I basically just stayed in my room all day.

Now it takes a bad turn.
Slowly but surely ,he came out to be a narcissist fuck ,he fucking ruined our life's ,but we couldn't escape cause my mother fell pregnant.My sister was born eventually ,and the fuck just became more and more psycho.He hated me,he always game me bad looks,alywas had some shitty comment to say about me because I never go out(don't have friends there and wasn't gonna get any).

Fast forward a little

Things escalated,he wanted my sister and cut us out.My mother managed to find a lawyer that's Hungarian and he was understanding enough to do the job upfront with payment later on the road.


After some more suffering ,we are free.We went to live in a BNB for 3 ish months ,the fuck gives use 400€ monthly child support.Stayimg at the bnb sucked ,we lived all 3 in one room ,no privacy,no silence,and I was working at the time Aswell.

Thank god ,literally.And acquaintance of my mother knew the cities church caretaker who had an apartment for rent.We moved in ,the place was underwhelming honestly,pretty old,the  guy rented it to bypasses occasionally ,people who would spend a week or so here.It tool a lot of cleaning to make it shine.


Fast forward to the present.
Here I am 21 male,working to maintainy family.

Let's talk about me now;
I work a 7 to 5 ,forklift operator and wearhouse worker.I liked it at the start ,but with months passing I hate it more and more.I don't know why ,I just keep committing little stupid mistakes that make me look like a retarded to my superiors.No matter how hard I try ,there is no one day without either me saying something stupid to my coworker that makes me look like a retard or having trouble with something stupid.

This last week has been really ruff for me mentally.The supervisors always pretent too much,there is always good much work and organized the warehouse is a mess cause the stock amounts make no sense.

I stated to feel a pain inside of me,the fact that I have to live trough life,the mere fact that I exists is giving me a pain in my soul.I snapped twice this week.While in bed I just went blank for a minute and realized that I can't get out of this.I just screamed ,screamed untill it hurt ,then cried.



What do I do?How do I make the pain go away?Why di i have to endure this?
To make it clear,I don't want to kill myself,but I would like to not exist anymore so the pain would stop",1

It's settled then,"I'll say it, high and not so proud
I'll die during 2024

Having no feelings for anything and pretending to care for anything is exhausting, and I don't want to keep on pretending that I'm feeling good

All I can do now is wait for 2024, since my life's already crap

I have health insurance that covers some of the cost but I pay most of the bills I should go to work and get over it.He is not talking to me",1

I used to at least look forward to once I graduated and got a job and started my life, but I don’t even see the point in that anymore. Like yea, I’m still gonna do that, but it is pointless. At this point, I’m just sticking around for my family, as far as I’m concerned, my life isn’t worth keeping anymore. Holy shit I wish I could just end it, but I can’t do that to my family, so I just have to wait. I have to wait for the rest of my damn life, which is already turning out to be such a pointless life, not even worth anything.

Physical symptoms of your depression?,"Hi there,

So lately I've been in not a super great place, but it's been coming in waves. I'm currently in a rigorous grad program, so I've been trying to chalk it up to just being stressed and doubting my abilities, etc etc. But I was wondering if I'm the only one that gets this particular feeling (I've experienced it my whole life and only in the past few years have I been realizing the pattern between dark thoughts and then immediately feeling this sensation)--I can really only describe it as a kind of deep discomfort, /almost/ pain but not quite, that starts in my stomach and radiates to the palms of my hands. It aches there for a second and then goes away until the next bout of bad feelings, which could be as soon as seconds later.

&#x200B;

I have absolutely no idea what this is, and I don't know of anyone who struggles with their mental health as I do so I don't really have anyone that I could ask. Does anyone else get this, or any other odd/unconventional physical symptoms of your depression?",1
no hope. it’s all a cycle. (TW: mentions of SH),"god i’m just utterly exhausted. i want to relapse so badly, even though i’ve been clean for months. i keep the rusty razors i use in my room. they are all that’s there for me when no one else is.",1

"I don't want to exist, but I don't want to die","Unlike before, when I didn't have anything to call mine or dreams to follow, now I have some projects that I want to work on. Even currently, I'm making some progress.  But I still feel that I'm not good enough. When I draw, I feel incompetent. I feel so bad at everything, I recognize that I have to keep going. That's what I always tell me. It's just that I'm sabotaging myself in every aspect of my life. In my work, I'm replaceable. In my relationship, I'm so insecure, I feel that my worth is nothing, and he will eventually see that. I'm constantly afraid that I'm going to be abandoned againg. I try to be okay most of the time, but there are days that I can't do it. Two weeks ago, I was looking on websites how can I suicide without any pain and I spent so much time reading and reading. I tried it three years ago without success. I don't want to die yet. I just want to feel at least what does it feels to be alive cause I don't know if I had ever experienced that.

Many depressive periods over 5 years?,"I’ve never been diagnosed with depression but around 6 years ago I developed an eating disorder. Pretty much package deal with feeling crappy all the time.

For no reason at all I feel sad, mad, irritated, hungry, not hungry at all, can’t sleep, sleep all day, hate everything etc. And some periods I feel fine and dandy. 

My coping mechanisms usually were either starving myself or ranting to Internet friends. Now I have neither.

I feel so lost. I’ve never really had any goals or wants from my life. I feel so embarrassed for having a gpa so low that I lost my financial aid and can’t afford school anymore. I don’t know how to talk to my parents. I’m 20 and only just met my father for the first time last Christmas and my mother puts so much pressure on me because we grew up poor.

Who knows, maybe killing myself might actually wake me up in a better version of the universe that I keep seeing in my dreams?

School is making me depressed,"For context I’m 30 and I am trying to go back to school to become a nurse cuz I made a bunch of decisions that didn’t pan out and I’m broke and having a quarter life crisis.

I’m really mentally ill and I just got out of a really abusive relationship so I’m all fucked up inside and out.

I’m old and I just want to enjoy my life but I can’t because 20+ year old me made a bunch of stupid and uninformed decisions and I ruined my entire life and I hate myself for it everyday.

Now I have to study things I don’t care about like Chemistry and Statistics and once I get those done (and if I pass) I’ll have to move to Ohio for 15 months and do even more school which I hate the thought of too in hopes that I can become a nurse and make a living so that I won’t have to rely on my abusive parents for help.

What is the point of it all? I just want to give up. Working is miserable. Life is miserable. Nobody cares. Everything costs too much.

I hate my life right now and it sucks. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I’m always feeling stressed out or bitched at by people.

I don't offer anything to anyone, I have no talents, no skills, no hobbies, no interests or prospects and am super boring to be around. I am the most boring and uninteresting person imaginable.

Nobody knows me. I have only two friends. One thinks I'm Iron Man and that I'm an unstoppable force domineering life. He's never met the raging, on/off drug addict, borderline abusive me. He doesn't know me. My other friend is better than me in every way. He's smarter, stronger, more talented, funnier, more charismatic and more respected than me and never lets me forget it. He treats me like shit. Mocking everything I say and do, never letting me finish a sentence, rubbing in my failures, making sure I know how much better he is than me. I never thought I'd say it about a friend this close but I fucking hate him.

I give and give and get nothing in return from any of my friends I've made over the years. They all just abandon me at their earliest convenience. The friends I actually do like don't like me and the ones I hate stick around forever.

Most of all, I want love. I didn't like the only girlfriend I've had, she was too quiet and even more reserved and awkward than I was. We were very cold and distant from each other. While the girls I did like were indifferent to me and sometimes seemed to hate me. One in particular that I worked with a year ago sticks out to me. She was my idea of perfect, she was so beautiful, sweet (even to me), intelligent and made me happy. I wanted to tell her how I felt, I wanted hold her and love her or at the very least ask her out and get to know her even better. But fear of rejection got the better of me and before I knew it, she moved three states away.

The only pleasure I get now is escaping into fantasy and imagining what life could have been like if I actually gave a shit. I know I'm young (20) but I'm so ill-equipped for this world that it would inevitably chew me up and spit me out. I already flunked out of college and got fired from my last job. Now I have no idea what to do and all I have right now is a longing for love, intimacy and understanding.",1
No insight,"I (22m) was telling my cousins (who are more than 80 years old) about my illness, and they kept giving advice based on how they treat their son when he was younger. He got kicked out of college and couldn't hold a job because he was lazy and just didn't care-not because he has a raging illness that prevents him from being happy all the time. 

I now understand how people can't comprehend this illness. My entire life these people have known me and ever since I became depressed, I always masked my symptoms when in public. So of course they have no idea what it means to be depressed. Everyone who's depressed masks their symptoms.",1
"My pet died,i feel devastated","It's been a few days since my budgie ciel died.The first day felt strange,i don't know how to explain it but it just didn't feel that horrible.The next days became worse,i believe that's when it finally hit me,maybe i was still in denial about the whole thing but i'm not sure,however i know that it was only after i buried him that i was at my worst.

Ciel was given to me as a gift by a relative,i never even thought about getting a pet bird,but when i did i fell in love with him,he was so gentle,cute and very sweet,the most innocent creature in my world and my best friend...Now he's gone.

I feel awful,it was all my fault.I wish he had a different owner ,maybe that way he wouldn't have died so soon.What hurts me the most is that i know i could have done better,for the past two months i wasn't able to spend much time with him because i have an internship,so i'm not at home during the day,and when i'm back i have to go work on my assignments and some college projects.Of course he would be in my room while im doing my work but i was mostly focusing on the tasks i had,it was a really tough time for me because of all the things i had to do,but i hate myself for it,i should have spent more time with him.

I have no idea why he passed away,was he sick?or maybe being alone affected his health?I can't know the reason anymore,but during his last week he slept a lot more than usual,he seemed so weak to me,he wasn't as energetic as he used to be and i was really worried for him,he was probably sick,i wanted to take him to the vet but i could not afford it,seeing him that way broke my heart i even cried that day,i had a feeling that he was dying,i don't know why or how but i just felt it,that he only had so little left to live.I refused to believe it..i told myself that i was just paranoid and that he was going to be better soon,that i was wrong and that there was no way he was dying.I was going to buy him a friend that weekend,i went to the pet store and the guy working there told me there were no budgies left but on sunday he would be bringing them.I was happy ,now he was getting some company!But the next day i woke up a bit late,my sister came into my room and told me the news,all she said was one word: ""Ciel..."", and i understood.

That day i was still composed,now i can barely do anything right,i'm thinking about him 24/7,i have a report ive been writing and sometimes id just burst out in tears,i can't even count how many times i have cried in the last few days,it's the worst thing that has ever happened in my life.I was depressed years ago but nothing comes close to losing someone dear to you,it's too much..it hurts too much,the pain,sadness and regrets...his death absolutely shattered me.I cannot do anything without thinking about him,he's always on my mind.Earlier i was going through my gallery looking for some screenshots and i saw a picture of him i had taken before,i couldn't look at it,i looked away the moment i spotted it and i put my phone away,i don't understand why but i cannot bring myself to look at any of his photos.

Today i woke up and i realized once again that i didn't tell him goodnight the day before,it was something i always did when he was still with me,and now i feel empty.When im in the kitchen i unconsciously think about how its time to give him his food,but the next second im reminded that he's not here anymore.

I miss him a lot,i want to see him and listen to his cute chirps again,i want to see him healthy and happy...I try to tell myself that he is in a better place now,but it doesn't help at all,in fact all it does is hurt and make me cry again.Why did he have to go?Why so soon?I wanted to do so many things for him,i was going to get a job soon,then i'd be able to give him many things, take him to a vet,buy him toys,and just take better care of him..but he left without all of that..before i even had the chance to do anything for him,i hate myself for not being able to provide things for him before he died,i feel so guilty for not being a good owner.It's all my fault..

It's so unfair..I just want him back..",1
"I feel awful because I KNOW I have to kill myself, but I know that would be bad.","I came to the conclusion a few months ago that I have to kill myself. I do not have a future, and nobody wants me to get better. Everyone wants me to get worse. I started taking therapy, and my therapist said I have to increase my medicine dosage. That is just going to make it more difficult to be with my girlfriend physically. And it’s going to just make me worse. 

I **want** to get better but nobody will let me. I don’t know why everyone wants me to just give up and kill myself. I don’t understand.",1
Look man... Why continue?,"It's late stage capitalism. They're pushing us further and further to see how much they can get away with. 

No one is raising the appropriate minimum wage. If it's us ordinary people who have to mobilize and fight back, well, in Canada and USA, both countries are far too large and brainwashed to achieve the things that France has.

Look, why is living so valued anyway? Any good moment you have is going to be followed up by plenty of self doubt, negative events, struggle, and disappointment... It's like 5 to 1 ratio of stupid shit for every good thing that happens.

Don't want kids. Can barely afford my living conditions (credit cards in the red). I don't believe in working a job you hate to afford life... Because that is NOT living.

Plus... Chemical imbalance in the brain. Been fighting it for almost 20 years now. Dad died when I was in grade 9... Mom died in pandemic. Feel lack of connection with aunts and uncles.

So... What's the fucking point?  Plenty, plenty, plenty of unpleasant shit outweighing the good events that happen.",1
I’m done with this,My car payment is due tomorrow and is already a month behind. So it’ll definitely be repossessed by the end of the week cause I have maybe $19 to my name. I’ll barely have money for rent next month. I’m constantly working two full time jobs just to have nothing to show for it. Currently contemplating the best way to kill myself so I no longer have to deal with this shit. Im clearly a burden on society and my family,1

i feel bad,i was really mean to a couple people. i should’ve faced the fact that i was doing bad things. but i tried to ignore it and feed into the negativity. now i just feel like the villain. not in a corny way but it’s really hard knowing i did that shit,1
I can't continue anymore,"I had this thought every other day of the week, but today it's become even more apparent.

Recently I have tried to fight my depressive episodes by creating healthy habits for myself, such as waking up early at 6 ish for sixth form, or thinking positive affirmations and goals I want to achieve each day to get me in the correct mindset e.t.c

However, I can't keep it up anymore. My biggest weakness is that I get very easily demotivated if anyone or thing interferes with something which is within my control. It makes me feel like shite and makes me feel powerless, inferior, weak. And my way of dealing with these emotions is horrendous. I lash out and start destroying my surroundings, harming my body (whether it be punching my self or slamming my head repetitively on nearby surfaces.)In the end it really doesn't solve anything and I realise the only one im hurting is myself, since noone else clearly knows or wants to know how I feel and I therefore drown myself in this continuos loop of self-degradation and dismayal.

I don't want to continue anymore. I want to go to sleep and forget all about when I wake up or just don't wake up at all. I want to be carefree, not caring about any ones emotions and not taking EVERYTHING to heart. I want to be able to reciprocate certain emotions and thoughts in my relationships with people. Most importantly I just want to feel fufilled and actually wanted.",1
1st week side effects on Wellbutrin or medication interaction with phantom booze? Can someone share what they’ve done here?,"My wife has BP and I’m uncertain if she told her new doctor before seeking a medication change. The medication is Wellbutrin in typical dose to start (200mg/day)

Her moods have become very challenging to keep up with. I’m waiting for the Doctor to get back to me, but in the meantime I’m making space for her most severe side effects. It’s becoming more alarming to be, the side effects seem to be really severe and leading to extreme confusion and anxiety which keeps escalating into anger fits. I’ve never seen these symptoms with her BP. I’m worried about the risk of seizure until I do hear back so is there anything I should look for?

Can anyone share their experience or advice on this first week of new meds?",1
Major lack of motivation and drive.,"I have been on a couple of meds for a couple months now but I find the benefits are very hit or miss. My main problem is motivation and drive. I, gratefully, am not a person who stays in bed all day, I was a few months back, but have since improved quite a bit. But, as today for example, I really struggled to start anything and keep myself busy. Have any of you found any strategies that help with motivation when meds dont? Thanks. Peace and Love.",1

Disappear,"Hi
I’m struggling with bpd and depression since many years .
I just feel like i would be better if I just delete all social medias and disappear 
But I feel bad with the idea of letting my friends . I have one friend whom I stayed the weekend with and went to a festival with and I would feel bad if I let him but I just wanna be alone with no one to talk to … I don’t know if it’s a good idea or not ? Will it makes me a bad person ? If I delete everyone of my life ?",1
I feel so dumb and empty,"I’m going to get kicked out of school within a few weeks because of my un motivated attitude and low grades, I know it doesn’t sound that bad but I’m so tired of constantly doing my best yet it doesn’t come across like that with my teachers and they refer to me as “just lazy” and not trying “hard enough”. When I’ve been suffering for poor mental health to the point that waking up is the most difficult thing for me to do. It’s going to be my 3rd time failing my first year of college how can I say this to my family? I feel like I’m a complete idiot and a failure to even exist. My brain is rotting day by day and i don’t know how to stop it. I need a degree to work yet I’m too stupid and too mentally unstable to even finish school. What should I do with my life? 
I’m only venting this because I have none else to talk to and my classmates think this is so funny…",1
Can't get help,"I'm 15 and have been depressed pretty much most of my childhood. I have a hard time recalling good memories from my young childhood; most I remember when I think back is being miserable.

I remember first thinking of suicide vaguely when I was maybe 7; I first heard of that opinion in a religious i.e it's a sin and I remember being really upset about it since I didn't think it was fair.

I have no one to talk to either. I spend most of my day alone. I have no friends in school and don't speak 98% of the week in school.

I can't get any help either whether it be socially, mentally or anything else. My school counselor sucks I can't even get a hold of her when talking about classes let alone any issues I may be having. I tried reaching out to a teacher a bit and she just brushed off what I was saying (wasnt so much talking about my explicit depression just my social issues with largely relate to my depression) 

I just don't know what to do. I can't talk to my parents, teachers don't help, counselor doesn't listen, I have no friends, outside of parents I don't really talk to other relatives either. I'm completely alone everyday. Sometimes it's okay i.e I have motivation for small things like playing games or instruments but, recently I've just wanted to sleep all day.",1
how do y’all feel ab anti depressants,"my therapist says i should get on them but i’m not sure yet, how are they?",1
Low energy,Anyone else experience extremely low levels of energy even after sleeping 8hrs ?,1
"Lost, hopeless, and empty.","(TW: Drug use, mentions of suicide) I used to be so passionate about things I still see and remember how much I used to love them. I'm on the verge of having to do credit recovery for some classes, I'm not paying attention because I'm just so mentally exhausted from fighting my thoughts and pushing them down. I don't talk about it much with anyone even my best friends who I trust the most. I'm trying my best to get out of school early because it's so taxing, but all I get when I talk about that is ""what do you want to do when you're done"" and the truth is I don't know what I want to do for the rest of my life, however long it is I can handle all this. I work a ton to get out of the house and away from a toxic manipulative household and I stay out as much as I can but I'm not to be trusted because of some past drug problems and reckless behavior, mostly as a result of trying to feel something at all. I don't want to talk about it to anybody because I can't handle any more people being disappointed in me and seeing me as a failure. I have no interest in anything anymore except getting out of the house, but when I do that it's made to seem as if I hate my family (I do) and I'm ungrateful. Everything bothers me, even people I used to be close to or still am, i'm just really angry at something and I can't figure out exactly what it is because I think it's multiple things or a whole part of my life. Im constantly thinking of what's next, and people tell me I shouldn't be depressed because I have a ""loving family"" and I'm (relatively) financially stable. I go to therapy but I never talk about how I really feel. I keep telling myself I will next time but I just keep being scared to open up for fear of being sent to the psych ward or having to trust one more person. I broke up with my partner because I didn't want to drag them down with me into the hell that is my life. I don't know who I am, I don't know where I'm going, and I don't even know where to start. I don't know who I'd be if I was happy. It's been like this for so long it's just become part of me and if it were missing I don't know what I would do. I push everything down and it all streams out at once in one breakdown, but I have to control it because I can't show it or I'll just be more of a failure and a disappointment to my family and I cant handle having to repeat a year. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I look at everyone else and they have something going for them, somebody loves them and they have a value but I can't say the same for myself. I would kms but I would hurt too many people and I would just become a statistic. And I can't tell anyone that because I'll be in a psych ward so fast I won't even be able to blink. It's fucked up I can't get help with something like this without filtering so I don't get hospitalized. Some things make me laugh in the moment but then i'm back to it. Nothing actually makes me happy except working because I feel like I'm helping someone out and I'm part of something, but I can't just work a minimum wage (basically) job forever and never move forward. I feel like I'm fake for laughing at things and sometimes I wonder if I even find whatever it is funny because I don't know what happiness is anymore.",1
Overwhelmed,"I (36F) have had depression for 22 years. I've had many ups and downs since my diagnosis at 14, and currently I'm battling postnatal depression. I feel like I'm losing that battle.

I'm currently stuck in a cycle of flip-flopping. 1 minute I tell myself I deserve better, I deserve love and affection in my life, I'm worth something. The next minute I tell myself that's garbage, I deserve nothing, I'm worthless, of course no-one cares about me when I'm so fundamentally unloveable. The latter is a much more convincing argument.

I'm just going back and forth, back and forth. The strength of emotion overwhelms me so much. There's only one thing that makes such overwhelming thoughts go away (SH) and I'm really trying to resist but it's getting harder and harder.

What do you folks do when you are overwhelmed by intense negative emotions, and you feel like you're running out of options, but you can't cope with life much longer? I'm drowning here.",1
today is my last suicide attempt’s anniversary,"I can’t type as much cause I sliced (unintentionally) my thumb this morning. I remember the feeling. I browse through my notes, I saw the letters I composed for everyone in my life that deserved a good bye from me, that in my final hours, I was thinking about them. Next time I’ll create a voice message, I think that’d be better.

Anyway, going back — this time last year, in the same place, was my last suicide attempt. You know it’s bad when you can no longer feel anything. I was numb. I was like a vegetable. I can remember tears falling but I had no idea why. My stomach growled but I couldn’t muster enough energy to move. It’s been a year but everything feels as if it was just yesterday.

These feelings still haunt me to this day. I’ve been on and off meds for a while. My insomnia never left. I’m so exhausted.",1
ssri experience,"my doctor said she would prescribe me an ssri and gave me some options to research because i was a little nervous about starting medication. i’ve had some time to think and i think medication is worth a try and may really benefit me but i have one fear.

a common side affect of taking ssri’s is low libido. i am a virgin who has always been excited to try out that stuff when i get married and i would want an active and regular sex life some day if possible. i’m just afraid that if i take ssri’s my libido may be impacted in the long term. so i guess i’m here to ask about your guys experience in this regard with taking ssri’s. have you noticed any significant differences?",1
Just needed to tell someone (TW: self harm),"I had a completely off the hook trigger today that caught me entirely off guard and had a brief breakdown.  I'm ADHD + Depression and have been having a *very* rough brain day and just kind of struggling through the work morning (from a home office).  I've been self harm free for about 5 years.  I opened a drawer in my desk to get a pen and write something down and for whatever reason it instantly triggered the desire to s/h complete with ideation and flashbacks of various instances and methods.  I was stunned and scared for a moment by the speed/force of it all and then began crying.  Sometimes it feels like no matter how long it's been I will never escape that desire and the baggage that comes with it.  It's very tiring.  I don't want my kids to find me in this state because I don't ever want them to even have to ask why.

I can't talk to my partner about this stuff because they just throw ""go back to therapy"" at me every time and otherwise are unhelpful.  I don't want to worry my mom, >!because my brother recently succumbed to suicide!<.  And I have no friends.  I'm not looking for advice or anything.  I'm not in danger.  I guess I just needed to tell someone that this happened so it doesn't feel like I have to weather it alone all the time.

Overshadowed(kind of),"Me and my cousin are best mates since childhood. We do everything together. We share the same hobbies etc etc. Me and him are only a year apart in age(he is a year older). But from the last 2-3 years i have noticed that people adore him more than me. he gets good grades,is tall, good facial features, nice personality meanwhile im just a short fat dude with no personality and facial features. We still are best friends but people give him more importance than me. I have never been jealous or him nor will but why the discrimination tho? This has caused me to be lonely all the time and no longer to hangout with anyone. Cant sleep. All i think is about this. Don't have the will to live when i know nobody cares for me.

People listen to him, takes his advice into consideration. He gets all the girls. Whereas, people tend to listen and ignore me. Not taking me seriously. Idk i can handle it anymore. This shit always hits me hard and makes me disheartened and hopeless.

depression is back worse,"hey guys, i’m new to posting here but i need some reassurance that i’m not thinking clearly and there really is hope for me still. I was majorly depressed from 14-18, (almost 20 now) then things slowly started getting better, i got into a new amazing relationship with someone i loved with my entire heart and soul and and cherished and i was stable for the most part, probably the most stable i’ve ever been. but due to my codependency and attachment issues i had some insecurities but i genuinely loved him more than myself and put those aside as much i possibly could, BUT we recently broke up and my life has gone absolutely downhill from there. there has been so many stresses, i had an attempted si after that, failed that one unfortunately, mental hospital stay, being treated differently by my family, iop, therapy, so many meds and med changes trying to figure out what works best for me, med withdrawals and just so much more. I’m stressed, and i’m tired. I drink and i try to just relax for a moment but instead all the emotions i hold onto come flooding out 10x more intense and while me and my ex partner were trying to work things out and things were both very difficult he just couldn’t handle it anymore; i know he’s doing what he feels is best for him but i can’t help but feel so abandoned, i feel like all my insecurities and fear of abandonment were just validated and it makes me feel hopeless. if the one person who i felt i could understand and who understood and loved me me the most couldn’t deal with my mental health and breakdowns during a rough time, who can? i have nobody else. No friends, family doesn’t understand, and i’m so close to just giving up. I want my happiness back but everything is piling up and making me feel like maybe i don’t deserve happiness.",1

How do you guys survive with depression and no money,"So I have had severe depression since I was 10. I also suffer from extreme OCD, ADHD and OCPD. It did a number on me as far as self esteem and confidence. Fast forward a few years and I was very lucky to get a get a girl that really supported me through thick and thin. Due to her I became highly functioning but everyday was a misery fest. Of late, last 6 months I have lost my job and am the lowest point of my life. I am 42 so no spring chicken. My wife has grown progressively tired of dealing with my issues for the last 23 years. She seems to be disengaging and charting a way for herself and my son. I can’t get up and pursue anything meaningful to save my life. Always plagued with guilt, regrets, doubts and FEAR. 

While I have savings right now that will last me a bit due to my high functioning years I can’t help but think what happens after that. Do people who can’t earn (like me anymore) and don’t have active family support just end up on the street, homeless and waiting for death. 

My biggest roadblock to any success is my own mental limitations. Am on 22 medication a day and just don’t see myself ever coming out of this black hole. 

Can someone relate? Is there a story of inspiration out there, any helpful advise to a person who has spent a lifetime self sabotaging.

Anxiety and Depression,Not sure what’s going on. I’ve been living in my dream city (LA) for the past year and I’ve loved every second of it. I just started school for my dream career which is filmmaking and idk why but suddenly my anxiety is at an all time high and I’m starting to feel a little depressed also. I feel like it’s worse at night. And nothing really changed in my life except for going to school so idk why I’m feeling like this. Kinda sucks man.,1
Husband and Father - I feel stuck,"Throwaway account first of all. I don't usually make posts. I think I'm just looking for some semblance of connection with someone. I'm a father and husband. My wife and I have been together for over 5 years, got married and had a kid. I have a decent job in my field that I studied for in school. Wife works as well but has no education, so her options are limited. I make more than twice what she does, but even with both incomes, money is tight. I stress a lot, and when I do it also stresses her out and makes her feel like she isn't doing enough. 

In my younger years I was very openly angry, meaning I had a temper and would be rude and nasty. Which is ironic. Because these days, I'm very controlled in how I handle my anger. In fact, I'm so good at controlling them, I've also learned that it's best that I stow most negative emotions deep within so she won't know that I'm stressed, down, and frankly, depressed. She notices at times that there may be something off, but these days I just tell her that I'm okay and we're okay and that everything is good. I keep daily life going and make sure all is taken care of. Our kid, daily duties, etc. 

I think that my negative emotions, even though they're calmly expressed, they tend to end up in an argument. I think I expected my life to be less stressful at this point. I'd have a house, enough money to save, that in the event that I died, my family would be okay. Of course there's so much more to all this, but I'm frankly tired of everything to the point that's it's hard to fully explain. I'm just exhausted. It's tired of pretending. 

Today, I finally took it upon myself to look for a psychologist. I got a call that the one that I had chosen wasn't even accepting patients. So back to the drawing board on that one. I'm finding myself less and less interested in home life. Work feels like the only escape I have, and I get burnt out with that too after a while. Please tell me I'm not alone in this and that you too have felt this way. I have no clue how else to tackle this. I feel like I'm suffocating and no hears me.",1
Mentally Exhausted and Tired of Mistakes,"I (28M) am tired. I have a really incredible job title but I am also under paid. I have very poor money management skills. I was never taught and I tried to learn but everytime I save up some money, I end up spending it again usually on emergencies.

I have lengthy credit card bills, student loans and a car note. I have tried looking for a second job that I can work just to at least pay off all of my credit cards but I have not found any luck. 

I am tired of seeing my bank account lower and not increase. I try to put away 800-1000 a month but it is very hard to maintain. 

I have looked into every avenue and tried to think of every way to bring in some residual income but I haven’t found any luck. If someone could please just show me what I can do, where I can put this extra savings into and where can I make changes in my own lifestyle in order to better myself and live a good life.

I want to get married, be a great father, help take care of my parents who have been through a lot and I just feel restricted and tired….",1
How the fuck do I get over this crushing weight of loneliness? Nothing makes me happy anymore.,"I have no friends, I dedicated my time and energy to my ex and now the were over I’ve got nobody to talk to.

People at work like me, but only cuz I do my job, don’t complain and I’m quiet. The truth of the matter is, I’m socially awkward as fuck and don’t know how to have conversations with people, even trying to talk to people on the internet is a fucking pain.

But I just feel so alone all the time, I sometimes hangout with my older brother and we exercise but even that doesn’t really bring me any joy. 

Really the only thing that makes me slightly happy is taking breaks at work and feeding the Cardinals, Chipmunks and other animals that come around.

I am not suicidal at all, but when things get like this I always wish I could run away or just leave for a while and come back and carry on as if nothing happened. Too many people rely on my to do this.

 I still live with my parents but see my Fiancé regularly,  but I just feel so down and defeated by the fact that it's almost impossible to get on the property ladder and I lack my own personal space. My family are slight hoarders and I just find the mess so overwhelming. I feel jealous of friends who have had significant help from family to get on the property ladder. I just feel in a rut and wondered if anyone has ever felt the same? How would you cope in my situaiton? I guess I just wanted somewhere to vent to people who don't know me and think I have my shit together. I know people have it worse than I do and I'm lucky to have a roof over my head, I just can't help how I feel.

Any advice appreciated. Thanks!",1

I hate everything that comes with depression,"Not only that, but I especially hate how hard it is to try and explain yourself to people. Being overly sensitive on certain topics, OCD, exhaustion, anger, bitterness and jealousy and everything else I can think of. I start forming Word salads, and I get stupid responses, disrespect and hate thrown at me. THE ISSUE IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU SEEING IN ME TO SAY “alright” “I understood” “I got it” “it’s because of ____” then again, I don’t know what I actually want. I don’t want to be helped, I don’t want to be met with logical answers. I think sitting down with the person I love on my lap, and just talking would be it. I don’t know. I know nothing yet, about this or myself. I truly wish I thought about my future twice or even thrice before making stupid decisions. Drinking, smoking. It might not seem like much, but it made me miserable. THIS Life…full of shit. I don’t want to kill myself, I want to have a proper life just like everybody else, not this misery. FUCK. My life is in slow motion.",1
i’ve become bitter,"***trigger warning SA*** 

as a medium put it, i’m stuck in despair. idk if it’s anger or hate for the world or just depression. but i am so angry at the world. 

my grandparents died 4 years ago and so did my only aunt, they raised me, they were my support system. then I found out that i was sexually abused as a kid and confronted my abuser to see if he did it for sure, he did. it was the dumbest thing i did because i suffered from a lot of mental health issues after losing 3 people and seeing the man who did that to me for years as a child. i told my mom but she didn’t believe me. she said “if he did that why isn’t he in jail” she was just in denial. still is. we’re not super close. And my dad… he’s just not there for me and i lost many friends during this time period because they didn’t like dealing with me while experiencing an extreme mental health crisis. 

i felt so alone until i met my bf and he’s great but i’m still so angry at the world. i used to love people, i was a people person. I also was so happy all the time and now i live in despair. I’m angry. At the world. At my family who’s still alive that disowned me after my mental health crisis. i’m angry at no one to protecting me. i’m angry at my friends for also ditching me. i’m mad at doctors. i’m mad at god or the universe for taking my family members who DID love me away from me. 

I’m angry at having this shitty life. And i’m angry about being stuck angry. I don’t want to constantly be angry and feel like the “villian” hating everyone and wishing misery on ppl because i’ve had such a hard life and they would never understand.

But I can’t stop feeling this way.",1

What’s the point anymore?,"Hi, I’m Tuesday, and I want to give up.

I’ve been on antidepressants for the last 10 years, but I don’t think they’ve *ever* worked. To the point that, at the end of 2021, I stopped taking them. In 2022, I nearly punched my ticket, so, oops, Tuesday has to be back on drugs again. I’m physically repulsed by the idea of being on these pills for the rest of my life, so I’ve been trying to be better to get off of them. And I was doing okay…

But then I crashed, a week before my doctor’s appointment. I reiterated to her that I hate the pills, I don’t want to be on them, they don’t work. Her response was to increase the dose and brush my feelings under the rug. When I told her I doubt it would help because I feel I have ADHD, making actually taking medications difficult, she said, “I don’t think it’d be that.”

Since then I’ve been spiraling down. It feels like every direction a new punch comes my way, and I’m just defeated. I’m trying so hard to feel anything other than “I want to die,” but it’s fucking pointless. Why even try to do anything if you end up back at square one to begin with? Fuck this shit.",1

i’m gonna write my suicide letters.,"I had written some a long time ago, but decided that I was ‘strong enough’ & would never need them. 

but right now, I feel like I’m almost at the end of my burning wick. I cant stop thinking about death & hurting myself. the temptations used to be (somewhat, almost) manageable, but my thoughts are officially clouded up. 

I cant focus on my job, school, my relationships, my friends, anything. i’m drowning in my sadness & I think i’m ready to let it take me under.

well im not officially ready. I need to write my goodbyes to everyone. maybe writing them down will help me back out of it, but a sad part of me hopes that I don’t. 

also another part of me hopes that if I were to commit, that I would fail. but then again, I would hate myself more than I already do if I do fail at another thing. I fail at everything. 

I’m failing my parents, my boyfriend, my siblings, who aren’t I disappointing? 

i’m so numb right now, I want to cry & scream, & punch a wall. 

anyways, I’m gonna write them tonight.",1
Breaking point,"I'm so close to just giving up on life no matter what I do things just keep getting worse, I'm trying to stay positive I really am and I'm doing things to help me cope and feel better but nothings working or even when I get to a spot in my life where everything is alright and stuff sucks alot less than usually its like my life doesn't want that for me or maybe it's karma or something..

but it feels like I'm climbing a mountain and when I get to an area where I can take a break life just pushes me down that mountain. People see me at the bottom and say ""keep going its not even that hard"" or will assume I'm not even trying but in reality I've been trying to climb this long everlasting mountain for years and I keep ending up at the starting point... Maybe one could say ""just leave the mountain alone if that keeps on happening"" but I have to climb this mountain if I stop trying I'll die and I want that of course, obviously I want the easy way out but some STUPID part of me says ""we've been doing this for awhile now we have to keep going... we have to..""

Hospital Inpatient Stays?,"Hey, so my girlfriend recently went to a mental health hospital for PTSD. She's been having flashbacks and panic attacks for a couple days related to a trigger - she's sick and I won't get into it but obviously she has trauma related to that sort of thing. I'm just feeling absolutely sick with worry. We're long distance, she's from Michigan USA. She told me she was voluntarily going and they're likely going to take her phone, which they have. She wasn't self harming, suicidal, or a danger to anyone around her either btw..I just have no contact with her or anyone around her.. And so, my question is, how long may they keep her for? I keep seeing stuff about 72 hours. It's been 24 hours since she went. Any constructive information is very much so appreciated. But please, I don't really wanna hear any bad things about this right now. I'm worried enough.. Thanks for reading.

Edit: I have no idea which hospital she could be in.",1
Life…,"I know am depressed. I haven’t been to see anyone because i know there is nothing they can do. 

I broke up my girlfriend a year ago and I can’t get over her. She won’t talk to me. I do not exist. If i texted her she might reply but she’ll never initiate it with me. She knows hoe much i want to be with her but she chooses to leave me alone. 
I used to be happy. I can’t even socialise with people anymore because I’m too depressed. Why would anyone want to spend time with me when I’m miserable. It’s not like its a month or two. It’s a full year. Constant tears & breakdowns. Don’t have the energy for the day. Thank goodness i work from home. I tried dating someone else for a few months but she broke up with citing that I adored my old girlfriend. There is literally nothing I can do. I’m just stuck here alone. 

There is only one person that can help me but she doesn’t want to know me.",1
This is a looong venting post,"Hi

I don't know how to start this properly but I want to talk about me feeling like im nobody.

I am 23 years old and living in a big family of 18, i am number 15 in line. From childhood i got little to no parenting from my parents, not that they weren't amazing parents, they just did not know how to raise a child to have good routines. When i was a child i did not go to kindergarten, we had an aupair while my parents were working at their company. They were never strict on me brushing teeths or showering, they would tell me to do it. But as a child, if you don't want to do something then you don't do it unless you get forced to. 

So as i am in school, i would start to skip days because i felt like it had no consequences. Which then without me knowing made me the weird kid. I had my friends, that are still my friends to this day and are great. Anyways the reason i am bringing this up is because this didn't come to my attention before one of my friends told me that i used to be the weird kid. And then everything clicked, now i understand why no one ever had contact with me outside of school, it's because they wouldn't want to be seen with the weird kid. I never felt bullied, but more unnoticed. And that is how i still feel, because it's kind of true.

2 years ago i went on a work and travel program where you can live for free in another country by working for a company in that country. We were 10 guys and i felt like we had so much fun and i felt like i made so many new friends. After the 1 year of working had past, we had become somewhat close at least that's what i thought. You see, everyone was close except for me but i didn't know this. I found out about this by seing all the Happy Birthdays posts they made for each other on instagram. But no one ever made one for me, and i see that they are still hanging out. While even though i have contacted them, no one has ever reached out to me... Like i don't exist and so that is what started my feeling of being a nobody. 

I feel like no one remembers me after having a deep conversation or shared laughs. 

And i feel like i haven't accomplished anything in my life. And i know im not dumb, i passed with top grades in school and have an iq of 120 according to mensa. It's just the feeling of nobody will ever remember me that weighs me down. 

We have a family chat group and everytime someone has a birthday, everyone congratulates people, and compliments them with 'Thanks for always showing up when we need something'. Meanwhile i haven't got a single meaningful comment like everything i do for my siblings or how much i care about them which i try to show them by coming visiting them. Its like they don't remember.

Right now we are doing carpentry work at the family cabin, and i hear ""Great work sibling!"" And i have a lot of carpentry experience so i was making the kitchen but all i got was complaining (from one of my brothers) all though everything i did was by the book and looks nice. 

And then he said a comment to me that made me absolutley resent him. He said you are just pretending to know how to do carpentry, while i put my heart and soul in to that project. And hadn't boasted anything about stuff i knew. It was so painful to hear that i felt physical discomfort. No one has ever expressed that they appreciate me. And i feel like i can't talk to them about feeling unappreciated.

Feeling like a nobody is draining and very deeply sad. 

I think the reason i feel like i haven't accomplished me is because i have never been recognised. And not being recognised also leads to lack of motivation.

Anyways thanks for reading my messy post, i will gladly take any advice or other thoughts on the subject.",1
Searching for ways loved ones can support from afar,"I feeling very hopeless and have experienced some suicidal ideation the past few weeks. I am planning on reaching out to some loved ones to ask for support, but I am unsure of what might actually help me get through the next few weeks.

I’m going nowhere in life,"I’m 25M I live with my parents. I am 2 years clean off of drugs, but I just lost my shitty restaurant job and my other job at a pet store. I’ve been fired from everywhere I’ve ever worked. I don’t have any friends and I’m not interested in making any around where I live. I want to move away and start over somewhere else where no one knows me, but I have no idea where to start. I have major depression, and have struggled with it since a child. The last couple weeks it’s been bad. I’ve been in bed for days. I have no motivation to get up, find work, get out of the house or anything. I literally just feel sick all the time and don’t want to move. I hate it here and I hate living with my parents. I feel trapped and I feel like I’m suffering through a miserable life of nothingness while I’m helpless to change it.

Life does not stop coming.,"In the past, I felt like I was getting an okay handle on my depression and finding ways to deal with it, but I just don't feel like I can catch a break latetly. I got broken up with by my long term partner that I bought a house with about a year ago. Her life had a lot of issues going on outside of my control and I was not as supportive of a partner as she needed. I have accepted that at this point and am moving on, but a major issue is the house we bought together won't stop having issues and it just so happens to be all at once instead of throughout our close to 1.5 years of ownership. I have handled almost all of it as it comes up, but it seems like as I fix things, something new comes up literally 2-3 days later. On top of that, someone crashed into me a couple months back and just finally claimed the crash on their insurance so I can get my body damage fixed. I was saving and scrounging to cover the crash if it did not work out which is a postive now, but I feel like some of this is just hangs over my head all day as I work my full time job. Outside of all of that, my overall depression and anxiety as well as living with my ex partner has been a lot. It is a very complicated situation so more just airing my grievances and hoping it will all work out, because I just want some room to breathe. It feels like everything closing in on me even if I have so many positives and have the resources to fix the problems. I mean, being a home owner so young is an accomplishment and as far as I know a lot of my house is in excellent quality outside of the one main area we have been having issues. I just never know what my expectations should be anymore.

I used to be on anti depressants. ADHD and anti anxiety meds, but they felt like they ramped me up even more in some of the ways they were supposed to help. (Affected more then average by medicine in general according to my psych) I am open to taking them again, but it is tougj to want to.",1

And it makes me so mad that I can’t just end my suffering because I know how badly that would hurt her and she doesn’t have another parent. I feel so hopeless and I can’t even kill myself. I’ve taken all the steps to try and fix me but nothing is working. I just want to normal, functional. I haven’t always been like this , I had a job for 8 years, my own place, my own childcare, and I either want me back or for this to all end.

Concussion that led to clinical depression,"25 year old male

August 2022:

Finished an intensive masters straight after a 4 year undergrad.

September:

Job offers and interviews
End of relationship

October:

Moved into a 'party' flat and Starting work in the IT department of a Martime management company

November:

Mood decline begins - began to realise I want this job and lifestyle to just be temporary and work towards a better future for myself

December:

Dog passes away over Christmas.
New Years eve party my friend asked if I want to take his place on a new years day surf so he could do MDMA all night instead, I decided to go instead of him (I was drunk and didn't go to sleep until 6am)

January 2023:

Hit on the back of my head by a surf board while in the water.

Attended A&E to close up a bleeding wound on the back of my head, tetanus shot and advise to 'take it easy' before going back to work in 3 days.
I took it easy and tried to get back into a routine before starting back at work.

The day before I started back I vommit (thought it was something I ate - even my flatmate said 'is that the concussion?') - tried to sleep it off.

Worked for 3 extremely stressful days where I got no sleep what so ever and after the third day I just got home from work and went straight to bed extremely exhausted and just couldn't sleep all weekend.

Monday 9th of January:

Requested the day of sick and went to my GP and tried to explain my situation while getting things all muddled up and with slurred speech. The GP wrote me a letter that referred me to go back to A&E.

Arrive at A&E and handed in the letter and had to wait for half an hour to get seen. 

Got into the briefing room and tried to explain my situation to the nurse while again getting things all muddled up and with slurred speech.
The nurse without hesitation leaves the room and comes back in with a doctor.
 
That doctor brings me into the hospital bed area where I had to take off most of my clothes and get a heart pulse scan - all ok.

Then came about 3 nurses who all did the limb tests to see if I had control over them.
Sent for a CT scan of my head.

After the scan I had a chat with the doctor who tended to my wound on new years day who said the head scan was all clear and that I was suffering from the effects of concussion and discharged me on the same day. 

I walk outside the hospital all dazed and confused with a banging headache.

Got an Uber back to my flat and took a week off work went back to my GP the following Monday who was shocked I was back and thought I was drunk the last time he saw me, signs me off work for 4 weeks with a sick note that said 'Head Injury' and advised that I just try to stay in a routine and my symptoms would eventually go away. 

I did just that but for those 4 weeks I could not sleep what so ever and my mental health just got worse and worse and my flatmates just kept on partying and partying while I was getting clinically depressed with extreme anxiety trying to get better from a concussion.

February 2023:

I got so unwell by the 4th week of my sick note I had to get another 4 weeks off and go home to my parents just to get my physical health okay with 7 days worth of sleeping tablets from my GP who also referred me to a brain injury unit.

March 2023:

Went back to my GP and got perscribed a low dose of sertaline due to my mental health decline.
I started having suicidal thoughts but just thought they would go away after a while.

Had meetings with the brain injury unit over the web and they basically said I was all okay to do a phased return to work due to my head scan being all okay.

April 2023:

My thoughts of suicide got worse to the point where I had to tell my dad and the next day we went to A&E and I talked with the mental health crisis team and voluntarily went into a physciatric ward where I was diagnosed with clinical depression, my sertaline was uped, had another CT scan and an EEG (all okay) and I was discharged 3 weeks later.

May 2023:

Still have those thoughts and had to make an appointment with a pychcologist because I am still having so much trouble processing all this.

I just keep on saying to myself 
""just get through another day"" and ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem""
everyday.

This is the most messed up year of my life and I have no idea how I am going to be okay as there is so much uncertainty that lies ahead :(

I Feel Like I’m Drowning,"I feel this consistent heaviness in my chest. It’s worse during Spring/Summer (reverse SAD), but it never goes away, though I do feel a noticeably better in the Fall/Winter when there’s less sunlight. 

I’m not motivated to do anything but there’s so much I NEED to do. I’m mourning the loss of my sister and as of last week, I’m mourning the loss of one of my dogs. Work stresses me out so that makes things worse and I dread Mondays…I dread every weekday, really. The only day the pressure in my chest lets up a bit is Saturday…but once Sunday hits it comes right back. 

My mood only lifts slightly if I drink because that’s also the only way I can sleep. 

Why is life like this? Why must we endure hardship and heartache? Why isn’t there a button we can push that allows us to opt out? It’s not like we consented to being born anyway. And an opt-out button wouldn’t hurt anyone or be anything sad, it’d just be like, “Have you seen Jane lately?” “No, she opted out a few weeks ago.” “Oh well good for her!” But we don’t have that option. There’s no do-overs, quitting…we just have to press onward. It’s terrible. 

Anyway, I just needed to vent. Thanks for listening/reading.",1
Feeling so stressed and overwhelmrd at home,"So I'm Kat I'm f21. I go to college but I'm here over the summer with my family.I have a mom and dad and 2 sisters. I've been feeling very stressed here. I'm not sure how to handle it anymore. I have a car but my parents don't allow me to take it to college(pls don't ask idk), but my sister in HS takes it everywhere. And everytime something is diffirent about my car (ex the emergency break is on) she gets mad and tells me to not put it on. 

My parents are stressed all the fucking time and j mean all the time. My family is in a bad mood everything single day 24/7. And rhey get furious over small things (like for example all the spoons being dirty) will throw them over the edge. This is extremely hard to live with. My family fights everyday too about dumb stuff like the dishes or like the creamer being low. Every single day I'm struggling with my mental health bc of them. The other week I asked my dad to move the elliptical out of my room that they put in my room without asking or even telling me for that matter. My dad was screaming at me saying ""this isn't ur house"" ans no one uses the elliptical so I'm confused as to why it has to be in my bedroom. My parents wouldn't budge with it. 

And basically my whole life I've been struggling with mental health and I've told my parents countless times about it. But they tell me I'm faking it. I've had so many panic attacks in front of them and they just don't care. My sister is a junior in HS and SHE IS GETTING THERAPY. Like wtf??",1

Advice on hospitalization,"My depression and anxiety at are at an all time low, so much so I feel like I’m starting to lose grip on reality. I keep having these episodes that last for hours where I feel like I disappear into this pit of paranoia and spiraling thoughts, i feel impulsive, I feel dissociated etc.

I have a psychiatrist but I’m thinking I’m at the point where I need more help until this passes. However, I am terrified of going to a mental hospital. I had an awful experience with one 10 years ago and the thought of having to go back without my phone, my husband, privacy etc makes me sick to my stomach. Are there ANY other options to get help without being hospitalized? Despite the impulsiveness I’ve been feeling I haven’t really acted out on my thoughts besides a few unhinged texts or two. So I truly do not think I’m on any danger of harming myself, which is another reason I’m so reluctant to be hospitalized. Any advice?",1
need someone to talk to. i’m a horrible person and i’ve ruined a life. please dm,"i don’t want your pity or make me feel better i just i don’t know i need someone to talk to. i feel so guilty. so horrible. and they feel so much worse. i’m so stupid and careless. and as much as i want to, i can’t kill myself bc that would just make it worse for them.",1
I really wish I didn't feel like such a loser and wasn't so consumed by anxiety and self-doubt.,"Throughout my entire life I've had a lot of issues with socializing, anxiety, and confidence. I developed a stutter around age 6 that probably reached moderate levels of severity as a young kid but over time it improved significantly to the point where it doesn't usually affect my life or make people notice at all. Even though it improved I think it contributed to me having a lot of self-esteem issues and probably stunted my social development and I still worry about stuttering even now. Adding to that while I think I grew up in a great home I had an extremely competitive and ambitious older brother who clearly had some narcarssistic tendencies. We argued constantly growing up and I didn't live up to the expectations that I perceived as being set on me as a child by him. I was also just a lazy child and didn't really care about extra-curriculars and I was always an outcast on sports teams and I would spend most of my free time just playing video games so I think I missed out on a lot of opportunities to learn what it's like to be a part of a team and community. All of these I pinpoint to my social and self-image development being really stunted and at 25 it feels like I'm really far behind and in a lot of aspects I'm lacking on a lot of what I want in life and my youth.  
  
I have really bad social anxiety and it's always been that way to some extent or another. One of my earliest memories is from when I was around 10 and I was playing catch with my best friend at the park and a group of kids from our school showed up and were doing whatever and my friend wanted to join them. I really didn't want to go because I was afraid of being made fun of so I told my friend to go and I left and went home. In early high school I gained a bit of a reputation for being a weird kid and I was so afraid of being bullied that I felt that my reputation was unfixable (it wasn't) and the best course of action would be to just hide in obscurity as much as I can and not make waves so people would leave me alone. I was basically never invited to parties and I didn't go to any grad events in my senior year except for prom, the grad ceremony, and the convocation (so I didn't go to the annual grad campouts, the boat party, the end of year parties, none of that). I've really only been to a few parties and whenever I do go I have almost insurmountable anxiety.  
  
It's funny looking back at high school because despite all this, I actually had a decent amount of friends, or at least people that could've been friends if I tried harder. I would still joke around with people all the time in class in my later years, my senior yearbook is filled with funny comments and inside jokes, I had a ton of people that I'd talk to regularly at school and online, but I never really saw any of them outside school except for a few. I guess I just didn't really think they'd be a friend and I never pursued. The only friends I made in high school that I kept long term are people that did pretty much all of the heavy lifting at the beginning. I would almost never be the first one to say that we should hang out.  
  
And I never really learned how to make friends. I went to a community college after high school and never had any interest in the limited social aspect of it. I went to a big university after a few semesters and completely failed in the social department. I didn't meet a single person that I considered to be a friend. I went to a few study meetups but that's it for social meetings with people from school. Never went to dorm or frat parties (huge regret). I worked in a restaurant off-campus and would drink with my coworkers, almost none of whom were students. I liked my roommates but I knew almost nothing about them. I never knew how to get into that social community at university. I was too nervous to ask anyone to hang out outside class or the dorm room because I was nervous about stuttering and sounding like an idiot.  
  
I only have 2 people that I would consider friends and honestly? They're shit friends. One of them has really horrible drug and alcohol abuse issues and all he ever wants to do is binge drink and watch movies in his basement and the other just never wants to do anything interesting. I love him but besides going to a hockey game in December I can't remember doing anything memorable with him for years. I've brought him to my family's summer place every year for years now and while I'm glad he comes after a while all it ends up being is he and my brother taking every opportunity to get on my nerves and I just want one of them or both to just leave. We used to be so much closer - us three called ourselves ""the dynamo"" and along with their girlfriend's or mine when I had one that was our friend group. I remember my awesome 19th birthday, the barhopping night right before I left for vietnam, the awesome day we spent together right before one of them left on a long trip, us staying up all night and sneaking out until 6 AM in high school, going to the driving range, the bike rides into the forest, the camping trips, going snowboarding, going longboarding around town, all with them. But all of that is so long past and I don't think either of them want to do those anymore. This is different than in high school when I didn't realize that there were people I could've made solid friendships with. At this point there's really nobody I would consider as somebody that I would see on a regular basis recreationally.  
  
There was a point where life was really good. Second year of college I meet this girl at work and she's clearly very into me. After a month of flirting I ask her out and we embark on a 2 year relationship. That relationship flourishes, my friends and I are all still together, I'm going out and making memories, I'm losing weight, I go on a trip to vietnam, my confidence is improving greatly. I fucked that relationship up and I gradually lost contact with my friends and were never really the same with them since. It just sucks looking back and thinking about the time when I had a vibrant social life and real connections with people and comparing it to what little I have now. Now all I really am is an overweight line cook making a shit wage at a restaurant I don't care about with 0 skills or network gained through a 4-year degree with terrible and unresolved social anxiety issues, 0 good, close connections with people outside my family and can't get passed the first date on those frustrating dating apps. It makes me feel like such a loser.  
  
It really sucks because deep down I really think I'm just like everybody else. I have the same interests as tons of other people my age and I'm a nice guy who loves to laugh. I love following sports and going to shows and going out at night just like everybody else but I don't feel apart of any community at all. I know that somewhere there's a version of me that can flourish socially because I've been that before. I'm just so anxious about everything and have such low self-esteem and it's been that way ever since I was a kid and I hate it. I really, really don't like the fact that I'm me. I feel almost embarrassed that other people get to be themselves and I was unlucky enough to be me. I'm not happy with it at all. I really just want to be normal and happy but it seems so far away. I'm 25 now and I'm wondering if I'm just completely screwed, like I fucked up during a critical period of social development and I'll never be the person that I was supposed to be.",1
I think my dopamine receptors are shot,"I’m trying to just enjoy my summer break but I just… can’t. The first two weeks were okay, getting to do stuff I didn’t have time for with classes and such.

But now (even with the new zelda game which is really fun btw) I struggle to find joy. Everything just sucks again for some reason and i don’t know how to let myself enjoy things again.

I’m trying to not smoke weed as much (and didn’t yesterday!) but it’s made me relapse with sh. I don’t want to smoke tonight because I don’t feel like it, but my leg is already destroyed. Are my lungs more worth it or a section of my thigh?

Side note- I am very careful with the way I sh. I always clean before and after and I don’t go deep at all. Please don’t be concerned about physical safety!! Maybe mental safety tho lol

I’m pretty sure scrolling on tiktok is the only thing that fires some of my dopamine receptors. But even then it’s not much. Listening to music isn’t that enjoyable anymore, I just do it to fill the void of no noise

Depression and love problems,Idk what’s wrong with me I’m only 14 but i have never felt love or happiness since i was 12 y’all maybe think I’m just faking it and that I’m only 14 it’s nothing serious but that aint the case im trying literally trying to even love my parents or anyone but i can’t it’s like they’re just people i see everyday im not sure what it is hopefully there’s someone who can understand me or sum.,1
no sunlight. no socializing. Getting really depressed,"I work 40 hours in a tiny office with no windows, my job doesn't require me to speak to anyone so for 8 hours everyday I sit alone in this room doing monotonous work that requires no brainpower. 

After work I go home to my solitary room and either try to clean, or workout. Sometimes I'm so brain dead I do nothing but lay in bed. 

On weekends I go to see my boyfriend and his toddler, she requires 100% of my attention every time I'm there because she loves me so much. She doesn't even want to play with her dad when im there, only me. She is VERY hyper and high maintenance. 

80% of my socializing is with a toddler who's not even mine. After she goes to sleep I get a little time with my boyfriend but we're both so tired that we just watch TV. 

If I'm lucky my boyfriend and I get 1 day a week when he doesn't have his child and we go do something fun together. I live for that 1 day of light a week. 

I'm starting to go insane, and snap at him and resent his daughter. I love her very much but it's exhausting, mentally, emotionally, and physically. 

I feel hopless and am falling into a deep depression.",1
Is this depression?,"26M: I think I'm pretty high functioning - I have a well-paying, stable job, good habits (sleep well and work out daily), eat healthy, etc. Yet despite these I feel like I'm never happy. I think one of my biggest problems right now is just a lack of feeling any sort of emotion at all. As an example, before when I would go on vacation to new places, or see family/friends after not seeing them for a long time, I used to get an excited feeling. I used to be genuinely happy/joyous doing these things. But now everything is just so whatever - its like I know how I *should* feel in these situations, but I just *don't*. I don't know if my emotions are suppressed, or just gone, or what. A lot of times after work I come home and lie in bed watching Youtube for hours together until its time to go to sleep. I don't think I have any serious thoughts about suicide, but I can't say it hasn't crossed my mind once or twice (although I don't think I could ever act on it). Additionally when I'm talking with anyone (friends, families, coworkers), I struggle to empathize with them. I remember when I was younger when someone told me something sad, I would feel sad with them. Now I don't feel that anymore. Again, I know how I *should* feel, so I can fake it, but I get the feeling it comes off as inauthentic and fake. And then I get mad at myself for that, which in turn makes me feel upset. I also have bad anxiety and often find myself obsessing over and thinking about inconsequential things, especially in social situations. But contrary to most other people, I don't feel any physical symptoms? (maybe my muscles tightening?), but I don't feel my heart racing or out of breath or any of that. Idk what's going on, but the whole thing has just had me really down for the past couple of years. It's like a switch flipped in my brain and I've just lost all emotion, energy, and enjoyment in life. Can anyone relate?",1
How do normal people spend time?,"I come home, I usually got 8 hours of free time (teenagr years) and I just don't know what to do with them.

I'm scared she thinks I never cared, or don't care. I don't know how to accept this. It's so unresolved. Probably never will be. I'm breaking down. Sobbing into my pillow, so guilty, so powerless. I was happy not to feel numb anymore, but this sadness, despair, hopelessness, it hurts a lot more than feeling nothing. I want to explain that I did care, I do care, but wow that's selfish.

Why is it never enough?,"Bit of backround. Sophmore year of highschool I broke, hit with sever anxiety and depression disorders  that I still struggle with to this day. Dropped out, went in and out of various therapists and programs. Some helped, some didn't. Im sure many here know the story.   


I try my best. I live on my own, pay the bills well. With my disability coverage im reasonably comfortable, the ever crumbling economy not withstanding. But despite it all I never feel like im enough.   


I just..can't handle everything. Not all at once. Something always slips. Maybe I forget to clean the bathtub during my chore list. Or I keep putting off my dentist appointment because the bills scare me so much it stops me from doing anything else. Or just...getting the trash out.   


I always, without fail, can't handle EVERYTHING I need too. Most, but not all. And everyone reminds me of the fact.. What set off my current episode was I called my aunt, the woman who took me in temporarily after my mother died, to wish her a happy mothers day. Barely took her a minute of conversing to remind me im ""Really good at not keeping appointments."" And it just...it hurt so much.   


Apart from my therapist, no one seems to understand that even if I seem to be doing well, every day is a struggle to get done what I can. I always feel like im swimming with my head just barely above the water. Some days I choke and have to stop to cough out. Other days im mostly okay. But it never stops being a fact of im barely swimming as it is, any everyone expects me to handle it, or get stronger to handle it. But no matter what I do or how much progress I make, there's always... more. More appointments, more chores, more things I need to do that I inevitibably fail at in one way or another.   


So now, here I am again. Four trash bags sitting in the corner. Bed half made and falling apart. Clothes strewn about. Carpet needs vacuming, and I haven't eaten a proper meal in about 16 hours.. and im too cold to do anything. Too...empty.   


Why even bother? Nothing I do is enough for anyone, and those few who get it can't help for one reason or another. Im not even feeling like...sad sort of depressed. Or maybe I am? Tears tickle my eyes but I don't...feel anything but cold. Cold and Empty. I don't know anymore.   


I just want to rest, to not worry for a while.. Is that too much to ask?",1
Why is it so stressful to get help?,"For me growing up, I asked for help with my depression and I never received it until I was 14, when I got hospitalized for trying to kill myself. I was lucky when I found my first therapist. He understood me while I was going through everything. The process of taking pills was so scary and draining. All the different medication I tried, the mood swings, finding the right dosage, talking to a psychiatrist that didn’t really understand me. It was all too much with everything that was going on in my life but I had my therapist who I had such a good relationship with to help me through it all.

I decided to stop doing it when my grandfather in Florida passed away during covid. I felt the pain but it was muted, like I didn’t recognize myself. It scared the fuck out of me and I just decided to quit on it. 

Now, life has been really hard lately, harder than I’ve ever experienced and I’ve been really desperate. I’m scared to go on medication and my therapist who was with me during that process left. I have a new therapist now but she’s not like my old one at all. I feel really fucking scared. Scared about everything.",1

I just wish people understood that depression is not just feeling sad but it is something that actually affects your lifestyle and is debilitating in every way.

I've been suffering from depression for several years now and when I hear some of my friends say ""I don't feel like going out because I'm depressed"" it really makes me angry.  There is a difference between feeling down occasionally from feeling bad almost every day. Am I exaggerating in saying this in your opinion?",1

I don't know what to do,"first of all, I hope this is the right sub reddit to post this

I have thought about me might having depression for quite a while now. Lately it has been such a string feeling, that I've considered seeing a doctor, reading about experiences from others and taking those quizzes on Google.

I know they don't replace a doctor I can talk to and sometimes I had to pick answers which aren't particularly true because they were kinda in the middle, if that makes sense. I've taken about 10 quizzes and they all said either I could have low or moderate depression.

The reason why I'm thinking about it is because I've felt this void inside of me I never could fill, I have no energy to do basic daily things, like cooking, vacuuming or buying groceries. I'm living with my mom and only clean up when she cones home from her boyfriend who live about an hour away, if I don't have anything to cook or whatever I can always visit my dad so that's a good thing ig. 
Anyway, I also have always felt like I don't belong, or that I feel home nowhere. No matter where I moved I never felt like home. 

One of the questions in the quizzes was if I enjoy things less then I used too and I like doing many thing, like playing bass guitar, doing vocals or drawing and playing games. But literally the only thing I'm motivated to do is either sleeping, playing games or sometimes drawing.

I feel like I have depression not severe depression, I've never even thought about harming myself or commuting suicide or anything but just all of the things above make me wonder if I have depression.

I really wanna see a doctor about this but I also really wanna try getting better without meds. 

I'm just wondering if anybody has the same experience or what are your experience? Is there a chance to treat depressions without meds?",1

Messed up and a rejection,"Had to share this. Went through rejection.
As it is, have been a reserved, introverted socially awkard chap my whole life. I used to be in a military school for 6 years. Now I am 23.
Getting out of the military school and adapting to outside world was a tough thing but somehow got connected with some old friends from elementary school. Pretty nice people. These people pushed me to do a bit of socializing. I always stayed away from girls on my own. But during one of these sudden hangouts, I met this girl who is a jolly and friendly person, quite gregarious as well. Slowly fell for her though I got to meet her only twice. Let me call her 'P' for now. Then on, I texted her once in a while but nothing other than some casual conversations. I realized that I do have something for her but never knew how to go ahead or approach her. 'P' used to have a boyfriend who cheated on her and messed things up for her. 
Someday, I was asked by one of my friends to approach her but I didn't pay any heed to his words. Later on, I realized that I should give it a try by asking her out though I accepeted that most likely I will get rejected.
I decided to do this by writing a note and send it to her through a mutual friend of 'P'. I talked to this mutual friend (another girl) of her and explained this to her. She said it was quite a nice idea and be hopeful that it will be a 'yes' though I told her that I am not expecting such for reasons.
Then the note was handed over to 'P' and she said no. I was okay with it. But she added that she felt very uncomfortable because of this which basically makes me look like a creep.
Just these facts of unwillingly bothering someone I do like and getting passed on as a creep have messed me up from all possible ways. I feel like throwing up. Moreover, I don't know anyone to share this with. This happened two days ago. My exams are going on. Today while I went to attend my exams, a few minutes into it I realized I don't have any drive to finish the exam, all these intrusive thoughts engulfed my mind. I submitted the script with nothing on it. I am just horrified with the fact that this whole thing has started to affect other spheres of my life. Some friends have told me apologize to her (though I don't know how did I bother her), but the idea of reaching out to her again freaks me out. I don't know what's ahead. Some support and advice will be appreciated.
I pray and hope this happens to no one else again.",1

"Is the world really more bleak and dystopian than ever, or am I just getting older and more miserable?","I’ve suffered from depression most of my life, but growing there was at least always some piece of future optimism I could hold onto. Moments of clarity and ambition.

In the 90s and early 2000s the world seemed optimistic too. Yea it wasn’t perfect, but as a whole society didn’t seem as bleak. Almost like everyone was moving in the same direction. People of different political parties could at least get along somewhat, politicians at least pretended to not be psychopaths…conspiracy theories were seen as fringe. People could genuinely get excited about new technologies. 

I’m in my early 30s now, I have a wife, a good paying job….but Im having a harder and harder time finding any positivity to hold onto anymore.

My many metrics were living in the safest and most prosperous time in human history. The average person has more personal convenience  and luxury than ever before. Wars are less frequent, access to information is universals Al.

But everything feels somehow much darker and bleaker. Social media is dystopian. Political division and corruption feels dystopian. Things like AI advances feel dystopian, sucking up all ambition among artists to be creative. Society almost seems poisoned by disinformation…nobody trusts anybody or any news. Everybody is selfish, and we’re destroying everything on the planet.

Is this depression?,"Growing up in an immigrant family, mental health was never a reality. Depression and anxiety were just excuses. A few years ago I was diagnosed with high-functioning anxiety, which I successfully addressed with therapy and self-help books (moving out of the dysfunctional family home helped tremendously too). Since I moved in with my partner recently (after living alone for a year), those self-help books are biting me back. As I understand, moving in is a big deal - it takes time to acclimate and work out a healthy dynamic since you now spend so much time together. We disagreed a lot about small things that ultimately don’t matter. My self-help knowledge made me aware of a new (impossible and often conflicting) standard I can keep myself to, but it also taught me that humans are imperfect so any mistake can be written off. Now, I don’t feel grounded. I feel complacent and apathetic. I can’t seem to enjoy just existing. My favorite activity is sleep. People talk of having clarity, joy, and peace but it’s always while dealing with a problem, or working toward a goal, or being in a certain environment. How do people just exist happy while also being authentic to all the bad, good, and ugly pieces of themselves?",1
Many people have noticed how depressed I am and it’s killing me.,"Today, a girl seated in front of me in class keep shooting glances at me every so often. It made me very anxious and scared but I tried my best to ignore it. Until the teacher came down and asked the girl next to her if she was being too chatty, she replied “No, I’m depressed”, then quickly corrected herself to “I don’t talk much” and glanced at me again. She was talking about me. It took everything for me to not start crying right then and there. This isn’t the first time someone have noticed my dark gloom, but I’ve never had someone made a remark like that in front of me. I don’t know what I was expecting, she’s completely correct. But I tried so hard to appear normal, to mask my anxiety and sorrow but it never works. I have garnered so much unwanted attention from doing absolutely nothing, I keep asking myself is it that horrible? Is my depression so bad strangers take one look at me and know. Worst part is, no one ever asked if I was okay directly. People only make remarks on my condition like that. I didn’t think it was possible to hate myself even more, I want to disappear. I can’t take it anymore.",1
Is it me or is it his depression,"I have an on off boyfriend of about 7 years. We are both in our late 30’s. We don’t live together.  Over the past 18 months he has let me on much more and I’ve realised he has anxiety and depression sometimes which seems quite debilitating. He can’t get to sleep normally with something and he struggles in every aspect of life really although he has been working to improve them ultimately he is still quite stuck. 

He is really a beautiful person and I’ve seen the changes he’s made going from extremely angry acid tongued to now quite mellow albeit quite sad. The changes are what’s kept me around. 

However he has been saying he needs space and although my attitude was like ‘yea right’ as we were having the best time in our whole relationship I found this hard to believe. He has few friends and is alone a lot. 

I know I can’t make up for what he doesn’t have in friendships but he is actually my best friend and always been really supportive. I’m now trying to be on the same page and support what he needs which is space.

I’m just finding it hard to grapple with the great times I experience when I’m with him and him not finding value or fond memories of it to keep it going? 

We did spend some time together last weekend doing some selling which was planned months ago and when I left he called and asked if he ends the space will I come back? The issue is now I’ve seen the extent of the depression, anxiety and how evening something like a holiday, new experiences and total change of scenery will not pull him out of it I think he needs therapy and that’s the only way I would even consider going back. He really has done a lot by himself in improvement but he has got some traumatic memories if I think about it from quite young (being abandoned) all the way up to recent adulthood. 

I guess I’m trying to find out if he is just actually tried of me or if the depression is affecting his perspective on the relationship. We have had our issues but we have always worked through them. I’m just struggling with the space as we’ve kinda gone out on a high.",1
Thoughts?,"When the black dog comes, 
you don't hear it arrive.
One minute your happy,
Not a care in the world.
The next moment he is there. 
His tail all waggy,
He wants to play.

You play fetch with your mood,
He runs around with it, from high to low,
Bringing it back you feel quite good
But the dog wants his ball
So you throw it away
Just for him to play with
Feeling negative all day.

You play tug with a rope
Pulling your thoughts all over
Shame he is a strong dog. Not like the rest 
What was fact is now fiction
You question everything.
Pulling on the rope you do your best,  
Such a strong g black dog.

Then there's the stick, he loves it so much,
Knawing at your insecurities
Stripping away who you are bit by bit
Till you question who you are.
A strong tree, reduced to saw wood
By the big, black dog.

When the day is done, all you want is to sleep.
So worn out by the big black dog. You are.
But tomorrow you awake, knowing you have to play with him again. 
It's exhausting. I wish the dog would go home.
But I am his home. And he'll be here again, day after day.
Maybe if I coukd just have some more sleep, I'll one day be okay.",1
Depression & intrusive thoughts,"Hi I’ve been struggling with depression & anxiety etc for a few years now but I found that  my intrusive thoughts have been getting stronger and stronger and sometimes I feel like I can’t tell myself apart from them

I feel like I shouldn’t be alive with the thoughts that intruding my head I believe they aren’t me but I get really depressed and get worked up over the thoughts because I feel like I’ve had them for so long I can’t tell myself apart 

I could be even just doing regular tasks like playing games , doing the washing  , while my eating dinner etc and I’ll hear thoughts in my head but like it’s my voice in my head saying it like does that make sense? 

I just don’t know how to continue on anymore I want to start going to therapy but I don’t want to discuss about my intrusive thoughts because they are really bad and I feel like people should leave me over them and I’m worried that like they will think it’s myself actually thinking these things

i was so happy,"just under a month ago i was at the beach with my girlfriend and our two best friends, i told them that i hadn’t felt that happy and peaceful in a long time. flash forward i’m crying in bed and have been crying at least once a day for the past week and a half. i’ve been dealing with some major health anxiety and anxiety in general in this time but now it feels like it’s morphed into more of a depression. i wake up anxious, it’s hard to eat anything, i don’t like driving because i’m scared something bad will happen, it’s hard to breathe, my body hurts all over, i’ve had to get all my shifts at work cancelled for this week, it’s hard to communicate to my gf and people my age, i can talk to my dad and stepmom but they live an hour away and both work busy jobs so it’s hard to stay in contact all the time, i went to the er for the worst panic attack i’ve ever had last wednesday, and the two year anniversary of my mom’s passing is today. i know things will get better and i have a meeting with a psychiatrist on wednesday as well as my therapist on thursday, but it’s hard not to feel hopeless and angry when things had been going so good. i’m trying not to let the pain i’m feeling permanently damage any of my relationships but it’s just so hard. i’m 19 years old and now that i’m moved out for college i just miss being a dumb teenager, having my gf stay over at my dad’s house for the whole week, fantasizing about what moving out on our own would be like. and it’s been great until whatever has been going on with me started, and now i just feel so horrible and want nothing more than to feel better. we have our 3 year anniversary trip coming up in early june and i really want to get the ball rolling on feeling better before that. i’ve talked to my family and gf about a worst case scenario where i’d have to go to inpatient, and while it started out as something i wouldn’t want, now it doesn’t sound like the worst thing ever. i’m just sad and i hurt all over, i’ll take any advice i can get.",1
Can I ask my partner to leave me alone for a while,"So I’ve been with this guy for over 5 months, when we first met my new meds had been working and I was doing great but after a while I shared with him that I’m on depression and anxiety meds.

Im going to see my doctor today but in the meantime, I’ve already told him that I needed alone time for the past 5 days because I came back from abroad and needed to rest but it’s not the real reason but I told him we can meet today but I really don’t want to but I don’t want to lose him as well.

Is it even possible to get out of this?,"Tw: suicidal ideation 

23F, living with my single mom (57) since I was born. she's a recovering alcoholic and has been sober for almost 3 years. on and off depressive episodes since I was born, which I also struggle with. 

I desperately want to move out but she has breakdowns every other day about how guilty she feels about ""messing me up"" from her addiction and how she can't forgive herself. she is in therapy and does daily AA meetings. she has epilepsy so she can't drive. she has no friends. she doesn't go out. 

When I wished her a happy mother's day, she said that she couldn't celebrate being such a failure. Today, she said she wants to die.

It feels impossible to leave her even though we barely can have a conversation without fighting or with her starting to cry. I am her only support system. I feel like I'm just going to die and there is nothing I can do about it. I don't know what the point of life is. I've never had any dreams or ambitions. Even during phases of my life where I would not have considered myself depressed, I am aimless. I feel bad for my mom because it's like she's counting on me to do better than her but I also just want to die. 

I've been through multiple therapies, I've taken all the antidepressants and antipsychotic combinations possible since I was 11 years old. I had a year long severe depressive episode in 2021 and spent 2022 climbing my way out just to crawl back in earlier in the year. I feel like there is no way out this time because I don't think it's worth it. Depression will always come back and break down more until there is nothing left.

I see no reality where I am not suffering because my entire life I've been scared and depressed or just. empty. and I feel like everyone around me is going to leave me. and everything is scary. and I want to go to a place where it's quiet, I don't want to die but I want to go to a safe place, where everything is alright, just for a break",1

Yesterday first time in my life i got anxiety attack after smoking weed.
Ive been active smoker for 6+ years
Never had anything like this,
Ive had this very uneasy feeling in me 
And it pretty much stayed today aswell.
Ive felt like my life is worthless and i wont be able to accomplish anything.
I got so scared in my head cause i never had mental problems. This idea of having them scared very much. Im 22years old working low paying 9-5.
I dont have many friends and im quite alone. I really dont want to be anxious or worse - depressed. I thought maybe its because of poor diet or no vitamins? Maybe i can drink some supplements to feel better? Im currently taking magnesium. I will stop with weed for a while but is there a way i can feel better?",1

What do depressed people suffer that others take for granted?,"  
Crippling indecision. Depressed people can be consumed by an overwhelming inability to make decisions. Everything is questioned right down to the granular level. This constant self-questioning and evaluating leaves the person paralysed and unable to function. For instance the depressed person might make a decision to take a shower. What follows next is a tsunami of questions “should I wait to later” “what if I don’t have the energy” “why do I need a shower anyhow I am not going anywhere?” This can literally play out for hours and hours until the sufferer finally says something along the lines of “what’s the point?” Needless to say this self-doubting will be followed by recrimination and more than likely self-hatred for being so weak, which in turn feeds the depression, an almost perfect vicious circle.  
Critical self-judgment. Depressed people don’t really see themselves as ill. They rarely give themselves that good a break. Instead they can very easily view their depression as a personal weakness they could overcome if they just tried hard enough. This train of thought is perpetuated by other people telling them to just snap out of it, or a thousand other platitudes they have heard a million times before. Instead of seeing this nonsense for what it really is they turn it internally and berate themselves for having a character flaw that doesn’t allow them to function like normal people. They don’t need other people to be judgmental as they are expert at doing it to themselves a thousand times worse.  
Interaction is painful. It’s something most people take for granted. Interaction, conversing and relating are things we mostly don’t have to think about. For someone suffering depression this natural ability can become excruciatingly difficult. In most instances we pull on a socially acceptable mask and pretend everything is fine. We are present but not really there if you know what I mean? We can be surrounded by people and feel painfully alone lost in the quicksand of depression. We are experts at hearing but not really listening. We are ninja warriors at the art of avoiding talking about how we are feeling. Everything is great and fine when in reality we are dying inside. While you are talking about how your day went we can be reliving the worst moments of ours and at the same time making sure you don’t see our pain.  
Fear of the future. Ask a depressed person what they think their future looks like and they will more than likely tell you “more of the same or worse” Depending on the severity of the depression a sufferer doesn’t see a future. A future is something other people have not them. Their future is the struggle they are going to have tomorrow morning when they wake up and think to themselves “please, not this again, I don’t think I can go on like this” We think about the future by comparing it to our past. It’s very difficult to imagine a nice future when all the evidence from the past is telling you it isn’t going to happen. For the vast majority of people a future is something they can feel optimistic about. For a depressed person it can feel like something to dread. Something filled with hopelessness and helplessness. Not living in the present is extremely common; it can feel like we are adrift in an ocean of misery and torment stuck in a no man’s land of despair and apathy. Once hope is lost, everything is lost.  
Even the good times can be bad. Imagine not even being happy at the birth of your child or in fact any landmark occasion that marks a supposedly joyous event in our lives. A chronically depressed person doesn’t have to imagine it. For millions of people this is a reality and is something that is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. Guilt and shame which feed the depression are experienced in equal measure. They know on a rational logical level they should be happy, unfortunately they have lost the ability. Their happiness has been replaced by numbness and indifference which they have seemingly no control over. I well remember when I was going through my own depression someone asking me what I would do if I won a million pounds. Without even having to think I said I would probably give it away as no amount of money could ever make me happy again. These are the depths a depressed mind can sink to.  
Observing not participating. There is a song from the movie midnight cowboy sung by Harry Nilsson that I think sums up depression beautifully. Here it is. “Everybody’s talking at me, I don’t hear a word they’re saying only the echoes of my mind”. Severe depression is probably like having an out of body experience. You can see and hear everything happening around you but you are not part of it. It can feel very lonely and isolating to realise that you are a spectator to your own life. Your heart aches to be part of something that will make you feel like a human being again but your depressed mind is constantly telling you that this is for other people to experience, not you. Just like the song you literally do hear what everybody is saying but you are lost in mire of the echoes of your own mind. It can feel like you are living a life where the pause button is permanently pressed. A state of non-existing if you like.  
Dysfunctional relating and relationships. It’s no coincidence that the rate of breakups and divorces amongst people suffering depression is quite high. Relating to another human being requires motivation that is sadly lacking as they struggle with their illness. Maintaining relationships requires effort and energy both of which have been sucked out of them. It’s not that they don’t care it’s because they have lost the ability to care and they feel powerless to do anything about it. When you don’t care if you live or die yourself it can be very difficult to care for someone else. They are trapped inside the prison of their own mind desperately hoping for someone or something to set them free. For a depressed person isolating themselves can be preferable to relating even though they absolutely know this is doing them real harm. A depressed mind doesn’t think rationally it will push away the very thing that could help them. It can see relationships as having very little consequence, even though the opposite is true, such is the contradictory nature of depression.  
Lack of autonomy. The most important thing to every human being on the planet is having a sense of autonomy or control over their lives. When depression comes into a person’s life that sense of control is taken away. Choices start to become very limited and the person’s world can become microscopic. In an effort to fill that emotional void many people turn to food, alcohol, drugs, shopping anything in fact that alleviates, however temporarily, the crushing feeling of being out of control of their own destiny. These strategies can of course bring about bigger problems to add to the depression. A sense of meaning or purpose to their lives is missing and in its place is a gaping hole. This can set some people off on a journey to find that missing piece in the vain hope that it will complete them. They never find that thing that will make them whole again because it doesn’t exist. It is a depression generated wild goose chase that can easily turn into an obsession. Depression holds out the promise that if you could just find that thing outside yourself everything would return to normal and the depression would vanish. Unfortunately as many people have found to their cost, including myself, it’s simply not true. The answer lies internally not externally.  
There are a countless different ways that people can experience depression. There are however quite a few commonalities between the different types. If any of the above resonated with you it’s time to seek professional help. These types of symptoms won’t be exercised away, prayed away, snapped out of or ignored. If left unaddressed they have the ability to devastate your life for a very long period of time.

Rx,"Hello all,

I am 34M and I'm looking for some suggestions from the community. I have been battling depression my whole life, but when my dad passed 7 years ago it ramped up to a whole new level. I've been having depressive episodes on and off some worse than others. I'm just coming out of a really bad one, worst one since 2020 tho, but I'm really sick of struggling each day just to get by. A lot of my energy goes to just functioning. I've tried wellbutrin before back in 2020 for 8 months and came off it because it wasn't working plus it made me very sort fused. I am in therapy and have been using medical cannabis to help. Which it does, the downside is I can't be high at work which is a good chunk of my day. I think I want to try medication again, I just don't know what to try and am worried about the side effects. I do have a Dr apt this Thursday morning with my PCP to see about getting an Rx for something.  Any advice, insights or suggestions are welcome.

Thank you.",1
"“If that was your worst, then you don’t know true mental illness”","Was talking to my friend on discord the other night and we reached the topic of how messy my room was when she came over a couple weeks ago. A corner in my room had begun becoming a bit of a “depression den”, with trash and boxes piling up that I was too depressed to take care of.

I’ve always kind of considered myself to be functionally depressed, because I can get up and do things for the most part, and I can go to work. But I’m constantly suicidal and depressed. When it gets particularly bad is when I start to stop taking care of myself and my belongings, hence this pile of trash that had built up in my room. 

Somehow we shifted our conversation to this and I apologized she had to see it when it was in its worst state (which wasn’t entirely true, but I didn’t wanna go into detail about the other times my room turned into a trash den). After I said that she told me, “if that was your worst, then you don’t know what true mental illness is”. Honestly, I didn’t know how to respond. I don’t know if she necessarily had bad intentions, but she knows I have depression and anxiety, so hearing that from her honestly just felt like a slap to the face.

She doesn’t know how bad my mental health has been lately. It’s a miracle I’m still alive. Hearing her say that felt so shitty because it almost sounded like, despite the shit I’ve been going through, it’s not enough to be *actually* depressed. It just left a bad fucking taste in my mouth and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. It just feels like a really shitty thing to say to someone who is clearly struggling with mental illness. It’s not the first time she’s said weird shit about my mental health. She treat my depression like it’s a fucking joke and I’m sick of it.",1

It doesn't get better no matter how many more months I think about it. For the past year I kept thinking about it for ""just another month"" and every single month I dragged out it only got worse and worse. In the past few months there have been multiple attempts which sadly all failed, but these failed attempts made me even more desperate to die instead of giving me some ""holy wake up call"" like it does with a lot of other people who talk about this. I've planned yet another suicide and I am 100% going to make this work, this time it will not fail, I will not be a failure again.",1
PMDD and SSRI’s? Depressive episodes and libido problems. 27F,"I’ll try to keep this short and to the point.
About ~9 months ago I started taking flecainide and metoprolol for an irregular heartbeat. At a similar time or a bit earlier  I started having depressive episodes. Episodes where I would feel passively suicidal, hopeless, irritable, and at times full of rage. During these phases I fantasise about running away, abandoning my husband and kids (for at least a while).

Every time I tell myself it’s just PMS and to wait until my period is over before I do something hasty. And once I’ve had my period I come good again. Recently it’s gotten more severe though, during these episodes there is a lot of uncontrollable crying and feeling hopeless. I came very close to telling my husband it’s over on the weekend, and I embarrassed myself in front of his family with my hostile and miserable mood.

I’m thinking about seeing my doctor and requesting SSRI’s to control PMDD. But I haven’t had sex with my husband in two months - will SSRI’s make my libido even worse? I’m in a miserable and depressive dry spell.

My husband is very supportive but it’s starting to take it’s toll. I can sense the kids are picking up on the bad vibes too. 

Does this sound like PMDD? If you’ve dealt with something similar, did SSRI’s help you? Was anybody able to see a libido increase getting it under control?",1

New Citalopram (Celexa) user here with a few questions about side effects.,"Started taking it last week for social anxiety and depression. 10mg for first 20 days and then 20 mg a day thereafter.

So I’m only on 10mg per day and already feel better as far as the anxiety and depression. Started feeling better on day 1.

The bad thing is that sex has become difficult to finish (climax). It takes me forever and is a lot more work and effort to finish. Last night I almost just quit cause I was getting tired and couldn’t get there.

When to know if you actually need professional help,"I'm quite confident that I'm not clinically depressed. So, I know someone like me shouldn't be looking for a therapist and acting like a poor baby who just can't accept that I'm a privileged, ungrateful brat. It's just that I'm pretty sure my behaviour is starting to annoy the people around me and I was wondering if these reasons are good enough. 

1) I get suicidal thoughts 24/7. Nothing serious, but when I get thoughts like that I become either really bitter or sad. I become somewhat irritable, cry easily and honestly just a pain to be around. I know my family and friends (I think they're my friends) are getting tired of it. 

2) It's starting to make me hard to focus in school. It doesn't happen frequently, but sometimes I think of cutting myself or suicide so much that I literally can't focus in class.

3) I always get annoyed that I can't cut deep and I'm afraid that I might grab a knife one day and try to chop off my entire arm (ironic isn't it that I say I want to die but yet I'm so afraid of hurting myself I'm also the world's biggest liar btw)

4) Idk but I've been kind of zoning out a lot as if I'm not really there in my body?? And so I've been doing a lot of stupid careless things which is also quite annoying and I think I embarrassed myself more times than I can count and that makes me want to yeet myself off the building",1

They don't understand that with depression, it affects everything. I could barely eat or get out of bed. I never had the energy to take care of myself so my health declined. Everyone is always for mental health advocacy until they see the side they want to ignore.",1

what resources are available to me in england?,"for context i’m 19M doing an apprenticeship in a healthcare setting. living alone and doing a fair amount of drugs to cope with loneliness and past trauma. 

i regret not opening up about it when i was younger and had the chance, but it could sever the last connection i have with my absent but financially supportive dad. 

i’ve tried opening up several times directly to my dad in many different ways but it’s always greeted with explosive denial to say the least. my mum knows little bits but her being in another country (she left me) makes it harder as she’ll just worry.

i’m scared to say anything to my GP incase it effects my job. 

while i can have great days where i feel like i’m on top of the world, i also recognise this can’t go on forever and it isn’t healthy at all.

i just want to function like other people do and move forward in life and with my career like i should be able to.

any resources or advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks for your time.

note: i’ve realised i don’t have the ability to stop and maintain life as it is, i really need help and i’m scared.",1
"/rant/ depression getting worse, contemplating if quitting my job helps","graduated during the global pandemic. went to work with one of the big 4 in accounting firms. realised that i get terribly stressed out with the deadlines and the pressures, couldn’t cope with the workload, got put on Performance Improvement Plan and cried everyday. nine months after, i said goodbye and quitted.

two weeks later, started my second job at a non-big 4. the environment is a stretch better. the managers are respectful and treat you like humans, i made friends with colleagues. however, my depression starts to get bad again (maybe it’s never gotten better in the first place). went to get a psychiatrist and she prescribed me lexapro. work isnt doing well. manager put me on PIP also (second time at second job, the consistency is amazing). manager is super kind, super supportive but she can feel that i’m lacking effort.

i feel bad about all this. i know i have to get better. i know the maps but i can’t walk anymore. my mental health is declining. i feel like i’m sabotaging my career and my future. manager is positive about me staying but i don’t feel good. what should i do? i am so tired. i’m not sleeping well. i’m losing weight. i’m tired of going out and putting a facade. i wish people can see through my mask. i wish people can help me do things, i can’t do it all. i can’t do anything.",1
I feel embarrassed at getting a lowest score,"I know it sound childish but I feel devastated and ashamed of my self for getting a lower score in my midterm exam, and whats more is that my proffesor post it online where my dignity and self esteem shattered in pieces, I'm totally feel ashamed to go in his class like, I want to skip and run away, I don't want to look at my proffesor, I can't make it back at my final test since it's 20% of my grade and I don't intended to get a high grade like 1 , I'm fine if it's 2.00..

How are y'all coping?,"Unless one looked closely, everything in my life would seem fine from the outside. I am at college, am lucky to live in relative comfort and have parents who are decent people.

The thing is... I am absolutely miserable. My life feels completely empty and nothing I do is fulfilling. I got a job offer for a graduate position due to start at the end of the year and I declined because the thought dealing with real world responsibilities while living an empty existence is too much for me. I know it would drive me to suicide. Even now I think about suicide on a daily basis. 

How do people cope with this life? How do people even hold down full-time jobs? For me it seems it's just all too much. And in this modern world it feels as though our lives are increasingly devoid of meaning and purpose. I am so lonely and I know I'm not the only one, but it's like we have lost our way as a society. 

I don't mean to be so depressing but I need something to hold on to. At the moment it seems like death is the only answer to this dark and painful existence.",1
I'm Falling Apart... Unable To Break,"I'm a newcomer here, I hope you all don't mind my rambling and all.

&#x200B;

I'm in my early 20s and in college. 3rd year specifically and am an Education major(A.K.A. I do wish to b e a teacher). And I just feel absolutely worn out. In the last month my girlfriend of 4 years broke it off with me, I had to visit  several wakes of my friends(this includes my uncle, my old teacher, a few friends from Church) have my money stolen from my crackhead brother and am having anxiety attacks which stop me from actually moving forward with my research papers and other school papers.

As I write this, I'm trying not to fall apart as I've been informed that I'm failing two subjects and have no time to revise or redo any of these projects.

&#x200B;

I'm just done. It's been so long, I'm so fatigued, school is hell, especially in asia which gives us more than 25 units each sem. I'm sorry if this may sound like a stupid copypasta or may sound like I'm Karma farming or shit... It's just. I need some support if that's okay. Maybe tell me a joke... it feels bleak guys.",1
Amazed by life,"Depression fucked my high school life over, but at least I met amazing people there and my friends were my only reason to keep living. Now in college, things went south again...I started smoking weed a lot, cigs are ruining my lungs, i dont party very often but even that feels boring now and most importantly, i feel empty as hell, i like what im studying i guess but i want something else, ffs, i took the decision to quit everything and go almost straight edge lol (no cravings, lets hope it keeps like that) but everyday i just wish for the week to end and every weekend im just hoping for the next week to never start.

Planning my last week,"Last night, I’ve decided that this my just be my last week. Yesterday when I left my dads house to visit I just had this sinking feeling in my chest. I hate where I am in life right now and I only have myself to blame. I cried the 2 hours back home. Talking to people about why I’m feeling this way doesn’t help because what can you do? I’ve asked God to at least show or tell me if one day everything will be okay but I can’t do it anymore. I feel trapped. I feel alone. I feel like no one will ever want or love me enough to have a family and that hurts even more. It hurts even more when you realize that certain people were right. So even though soon I will be going to work, I plan to go through this week weighing the good and bad. I have days where I’m really good and days where I’m good and immediately my mind thinks about my situation. I know if I do it I will at least have peace and quiet. Off to work I go in the meantime, it’s the worst when all I can think about is killing myself…",1
How to deal with weight gain from anti-depressants? And constant hunger?,"I am getting several different drugs throughout the day for almost a year now. And every single one of those meds has ""weight gain"" in their effects. 
How to deal with this? I was quite fat before but I got fatter, like 15 kg more. I hate my body so much and I hated before. I just want to stop taking pills so I wouldn't be constantly hungry, especially for sweets.
My psychiatrist says it's either healthier mind and fatter body or depression and a little thinner body...",1
Acceptance,"I woke up one day, and said to myself ""face it, you are a sad sad individual"". I know I can survive, I'm a competent guy. I can find a wife, start a family. I know how and it is within my abilities to do so, it will probably keep me alive. But even though my mind says I must survive, I don't feel it in my heart. I don't want to rush to make a family, throw my self into responsibility of a family man. I can't ever see myself waking up to other people and not being self aware that i get exhausted around other people. Being alone for majority of my life, and switching to a family man in what seems like an instant will exhaust me. This acceptance of my sadness has given me a clearer path towards freedom.",1
I'm scared of getting better,"I don't know what things would be like if I was better and the thought of getting better or even trying to terrifies me. I just want go to work, go to uni, listen to sad music and keep it going until it gets so bad I get to give up.",1

Just been diagnosed with depression,"Hi, everyone, last Thursday i went to a psychiatrist after a long period of struggle and he diagnosed me with depression. I got prescribed fluoxetine and i just started 3 days ago. 

My whole ordeal started with health anxiety and after a ton of tests I decided to see a psychiatrist who said that, if everything else is ruled out we have to consider depression.

I have to be onest, i am very afraid of the possibility of a misdiagnosis. I feel so weak and tired every day. I used to run almost every day and now i can bearly do it at all. I feel light headed 24/7. I feel like I'm wasting away day by day. Can depression really do that? I am afraid my doctors missed something...
(I did a complete blood test, multiple geart ultrasounds, ecgs, xrays, spirographs... All clear)

I don't know what i have or who to urn to...",1
Info on what is next,"Not sure if this is okay.

So decisions are made, and I was wondering where someone can get more info or 'talk' about what they've decide without people trying to help them or stop them.

For example life insurance, if a certain choice will affect the payment towards family.  A will.  I note.  Body repatriation. Things like that.

The perfect opportunity came to do it and I kind of regret not doing it because all my stuff wasn't in order.  


Is there anywhere I can get info on this?",1
"Suicidal thoughts, Low Self esteem, Maladroit","My life has gone literally downhill from the past year. Something I couldn’t have ever imagined. In fact, I thought it would get better, having started pursuing a postgraduate degree.

I now have lost hope on life. Looking at me, no one can discern the sort of thoughts/pain I am going through. I have no one to look after or any dependents. Sometimes I think the unthinkable.

Any advice? It’s literally SOS signal.",1
Here's my little introduction,"15 yo here, don't judge me too hard. So I'm depressed, probably not the first time you've heard this. I've been going through quite a bit. I don't know if this is allowed to say but I've self harmed before (like any totally normal person would do). I've been in a mental hospital but that really didn't help. My counselor hasn't been helpful tbh. But most importantly I don't have any purpose to live, I just don't know what to do at this point anymore... erm bai bai! :3",1
"Hello Void, its me again.","Hello Reddit! It's been a while since I last posted something of significance.  A lot has changed, lately. I don't see the purpose in my life anymore. That sounds far fetched considering I'm a 23 y/o with a fiance, a decent paying job that isn't too strenuous, family that cares about me, etc. But it's true. I feel as though my life is a never ending groundhog day situation th at is inescapable unless I die. I would love to get help, but due to having no health insurance (it costs too much with rent and everything else piled up) I can't get the help I know I need. All I do is work, come home, clean, eat, sleep, repeat. There is nothing in my life that brings me joy anymore. One reason for this is bc I don't have a car. That should be an easy hurdle, but it's not. I feel trapped and miserable with nobody to talk to. I hate myself, and even when I know the feeling of wanting to die is temporary (for the most part) I just can't seem to see the ""bright side"" of any of it. I've never planned my inevitable end, but I've thought about how peaceful it must be to not exist. If you have no consciousness, then I'd have no need to feel in the first place. My life feels like this cruel joke, and it feels like I'm chasing my own tail every time I try to better my life. I want to give up, buy I know if I do I will just disappoint or frustrate anybody left in my life that gives a shit. And any time I try to talk about it with anybody I'm met with ""that's life"" or ""grown up shit"". Fuck. That. This is not part of ""being an adult"" this is dark and empty and there is no white light that guides me to a better future. I'm stuck.. and i don't know if I'll ever get out. The only solace I've found is that through Satanism and even the fulfilled heart I grasp at is fleeting once I put my book down.. and just a fair warning, i don't need the whole ""God has a plan and is waiting for you"" speech. I'm a Satanist by choice, because it's the only thing that brings me satisfaction when I'm at my lowest. I would get more involved, but nobody I know believes in the same stuff as me. I feel like an outcast. And I suppose I am, so.. cest la vie I guess.",1
What do depressed people suffer that others take for granted?,"  
Crippling indecision. Depressed people can be consumed by an overwhelming inability to make decisions. Everything is questioned right down to the granular level. This constant self-questioning and evaluating leaves the person paralysed and unable to function. For instance the depressed person might make a decision to take a shower. What follows next is a tsunami of questions “should I wait to later” “what if I don’t have the energy” “why do I need a shower anyhow I am not going anywhere?” This can literally play out for hours and hours until the sufferer finally says something along the lines of “what’s the point?” Needless to say this self-doubting will be followed by recrimination and more than likely self-hatred for being so weak, which in turn feeds the depression, an almost perfect vicious circle.  
Critical self-judgment. Depressed people don’t really see themselves as ill. They rarely give themselves that good a break. Instead they can very easily view their depression as a personal weakness they could overcome if they just tried hard enough. This train of thought is perpetuated by other people telling them to just snap out of it, or a thousand other platitudes they have heard a million times before. Instead of seeing this nonsense for what it really is they turn it internally and berate themselves for having a character flaw that doesn’t allow them to function like normal people. They don’t need other people to be judgmental as they are expert at doing it to themselves a thousand times worse.  
Interaction is painful. It’s something most people take for granted. Interaction, conversing and relating are things we mostly don’t have to think about. For someone suffering depression this natural ability can become excruciatingly difficult. In most instances we pull on a socially acceptable mask and pretend everything is fine. We are present but not really there if you know what I mean? We can be surrounded by people and feel painfully alone lost in the quicksand of depression. We are experts at hearing but not really listening. We are ninja warriors at the art of avoiding talking about how we are feeling. Everything is great and fine when in reality we are dying inside. While you are talking about how your day went we can be reliving the worst moments of ours and at the same time making sure you don’t see our pain.  
Fear of the future. Ask a depressed person what they think their future looks like and they will more than likely tell you “more of the same or worse” Depending on the severity of the depression a sufferer doesn’t see a future. A future is something other people have not them. Their future is the struggle they are going to have tomorrow morning when they wake up and think to themselves “please, not this again, I don’t think I can go on like this” We think about the future by comparing it to our past. It’s very difficult to imagine a nice future when all the evidence from the past is telling you it isn’t going to happen. For the vast majority of people a future is something they can feel optimistic about. For a depressed person it can feel like something to dread. Something filled with hopelessness and helplessness. Not living in the present is extremely common; it can feel like we are adrift in an ocean of misery and torment stuck in a no man’s land of despair and apathy. Once hope is lost, everything is lost.  
Even the good times can be bad. Imagine not even being happy at the birth of your child or in fact any landmark occasion that marks a supposedly joyous event in our lives. A chronically depressed person doesn’t have to imagine it. For millions of people this is a reality and is something that is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. Guilt and shame which feed the depression are experienced in equal measure. They know on a rational logical level they should be happy, unfortunately they have lost the ability. Their happiness has been replaced by numbness and indifference which they have seemingly no control over. I well remember when I was going through my own depression someone asking me what I would do if I won a million pounds. Without even having to think I said I would probably give it away as no amount of money could ever make me happy again. These are the depths a depressed mind can sink to.  
Observing not participating. There is a song from the movie midnight cowboy sung by Harry Nilsson that I think sums up depression beautifully. Here it is. “Everybody’s talking at me, I don’t hear a word they’re saying only the echoes of my mind”. Severe depression is probably like having an out of body experience. You can see and hear everything happening around you but you are not part of it. It can feel very lonely and isolating to realise that you are a spectator to your own life. Your heart aches to be part of something that will make you feel like a human being again but your depressed mind is constantly telling you that this is for other people to experience, not you. Just like the song you literally do hear what everybody is saying but you are lost in mire of the echoes of your own mind. It can feel like you are living a life where the pause button is permanently pressed. A state of non-existing if you like.  
Dysfunctional relating and relationships. It’s no coincidence that the rate of breakups and divorces amongst people suffering depression is quite high. Relating to another human being requires motivation that is sadly lacking as they struggle with their illness. Maintaining relationships requires effort and energy both of which have been sucked out of them. It’s not that they don’t care it’s because they have lost the ability to care and they feel powerless to do anything about it. When you don’t care if you live or die yourself it can be very difficult to care for someone else. They are trapped inside the prison of their own mind desperately hoping for someone or something to set them free. For a depressed person isolating themselves can be preferable to relating even though they absolutely know this is doing them real harm. A depressed mind doesn’t think rationally it will push away the very thing that could help them. It can see relationships as having very little consequence, even though the opposite is true, such is the contradictory nature of depression.  
Lack of autonomy. The most important thing to every human being on the planet is having a sense of autonomy or control over their lives. When depression comes into a person’s life that sense of control is taken away. Choices start to become very limited and the person’s world can become microscopic. In an effort to fill that emotional void many people turn to food, alcohol, drugs, shopping anything in fact that alleviates, however temporarily, the crushing feeling of being out of control of their own destiny. These strategies can of course bring about bigger problems to add to the depression. A sense of meaning or purpose to their lives is missing and in its place is a gaping hole. This can set some people off on a journey to find that missing piece in the vain hope that it will complete them. They never find that thing that will make them whole again because it doesn’t exist. It is a depression generated wild goose chase that can easily turn into an obsession. Depression holds out the promise that if you could just find that thing outside yourself everything would return to normal and the depression would vanish. Unfortunately as many people have found to their cost, including myself, it’s simply not true. The answer lies internally not externally.  
There are a countless different ways that people can experience depression. There are however quite a few commonalities between the different types. If any of the above resonated with you it’s time to seek professional help. These types of symptoms won’t be exercised away, prayed away, snapped out of or ignored. If left unaddressed they have the ability to devastate your life for a very long period of time.

I experience this all the time and it isn't a happy experience, cause throw the word depression around like it's so kinda cold but it isn't.",1

Stretching and moving your body feels awesome,"What's up my depressed peeps

Haven't been to the gym in about four days after a consistent month of going back. I'm here now and just spent a good 20 minutes stretching and it feels amazing.

I feel like my whole body is having a mild orgasm and I'm swimming in an ocean of yawns.

Is self harm ever healthy?,"Half question half vent: I feel like the stress of trying not to hurt myself is almost worse than just giving in and lettingy brain win.

Also I didn't realise how deeply I was cutting until I realised there was still a couple scars that hadn't fully healed. 

N tbh sometimes I feel like it would be so easy to just take a couple pain killers n pass out just to feel like I'm in control of whether I die or not n that I'm not scared to die because I know I wouldn't actually die - can't tell if I'm thinking of killing myself or thinking about cheating death at this point but I never got to the point of writing goodbye texts to loved ones anyways so I think I'm fine.

I had a gun in my mouth 2 weeks ago.,"It's a Ruger Redhawk in .44 Mag. I was lined up on the brainstem through the soft palate. I was fantasizing about how nice it would be to just turn off instantly. Like flipping a switch and making all of the hurt just go away.

I see posts here of people talking about how rarely they shower. Or how hard it is to force themselves to eat or go outside. I get up every day. I shower, I shave, I groom myself. I eat. I go to work and maintain performance. I interact and socialize. I paint a smile on and continue moving forward. It feels necessary, but meaningless at the same time. I'm not allowed to leave. It's not fair. I have people who rely on me. To teach them  how to perform safely and get through high stress, dangerous conditions. Two beautiful children who need guidance and support. But I feel so empty.

The medication does nothing to alleviate the suffering. I have therapy every week and it's all I look forward to. But once that hour is over, it's back to this unbearably painful existence. The one person who ever made me feel joy in this life is gone. I've lost all interest in everything that once I was passionate about. For 30 years I've toughed it out. And I thought that I had been sent a savior. But, like everything else that provided any relief, it's been torn away. Leaving me lower than I ever was before. And I've almost done it before.

I work in conditions that most would consider unacceptable. And I've always loved it. I'm not scared. But I have such a fragile heart. I have so much love to give, and I feel like everyone just takes it, and leaves with it. It builds in me until it hurts. I need someone to give it to or it's going to kill me.

I really wish the best for everyone. And I hold out hope that, somewhere in this world, joy does still exist. Even if it will never be mine.",1
"I wouldn't take my own life, but I would be so happy if someone just ran me over",I'm so fucking tired of nothing ever going right for me. Being awake is just painful.,1
Why can I cry around (trusted) others but not when I'm alone?,"I tried looking this up but could only find people reporting the exact opposite problem...

I can never cry when I'm alone; honestly, I never feel emotions very strongly at all when I'm alone. I'm a 25 y/o man and I consider myself to have a healthy view on crying/emotional release.

I generally consider myself to be a very emotional person. When my girlfriend tells me a sad story from her childhood, I'll tear up. When she says something sweet to me, I'll also tear up. I frequently cry at touching moments in movies, both happy and sad (I guess this is an exception to the ""alone"" thing, but I still feel like I have some emotional company and something to cry about).

I'll occasionally tear up a bit when answering a question from my therapist. Otherwise, I have an extremely hard time crying alone or about my own life, even when I feel exceedingly sad. 

For some context about me: I've dealt with anxiety and depression for most of my life now. I've also struggled with some fairly serious physical health conditions as an adult as well as severe chronic pain.",1
I’m so utterly alone. Everyday.,"I have no friends, once that school bell rings I no longer matter to them. They don’t invite me to activities, they don’t include me, they don’t do anything. A few weeks ago I was invited to the park and the second I got there I heard “See, I told you I could get someone to bring food!”. 

My “friend” says I’m generally a distributed person. My girlfriend just left me because of some bullshit. I’m failing EVERYTHING. My dreams have been set ablaze and pissed. 
I can not do this anymore.",1
“You tried and you failed. The lesson is: never try.” - Homer Simpson,"(Buckle up, this is a long one)
I wish I didn’t relate to that quote. I wish I felt like there was some reason to keep trying. I just turned 41, and I’m DONE. I’m not going to do anything, but I’d be entirely content to just not wake up one day. Everything I’ve ever tried to do with my life has gone to shit, and I don’t have the will or the energy to try anything else. There’s no point. I don’t know what I would want to do anyway. And when I say everything, I mean it. My emotional support dog was robustly healthy until about a month before she died of cancer at age 11. No genetic history of cancer, and her father and mother passed away at 15 and 18 respectively with nothing worse than arthritis and general old age. As far as I know her littermates are all still thriving. My psychiatrist is weaning me off meds because I apparently have treatment resistant depression that the meds don’t affect at all anymore. I’m at the least-drugged point I’ve been in *years*, and yes I’m completely miserable, but I don’t feel any worse than I did when I was drugged to the gills a year ago. Meds up, down, changed, nothing. So I guess this is my life now. I don’t even know when this started, but one of my earliest memories (age 5 or so) is a red flag in hindsight. I tried to do myself in when I was about 12. I realized later that what I did never would have worked, but at the time it was a genuine attempt. I was initially medicated then, and I was balanced through my early teens, but the downhill slide started again after about 5 years. Ups and downs, but mostly one step forwards and two steps back. Fast forward to about 4 years ago, and it’s been a steady downward spiral. I was in an increasingly toxic situation at work, so when I got covid in spring 2020 I was perfectly ok with a mandated 2 week quarantine. It turned out to be long covid (which wasn’t a known thing at the time), but continued illness and my boss being an ass about it gave me an excuse to quit. I haven’t worked since, and I don’t want to. I don’t want the responsibility. I don’t have the motivation. I don’t have the energy. I’m at a point where feeling like I *have* to do something makes me resentful. I tried therapy when I was younger, but my therapists always wanted to find the root trauma that triggered my depression. There isn’t one. Sure I was bullied all the way through school (I mean ALL - kindergarten right up to high school graduation), but I was never physically hurt. No one played nasty pranks on me. I was mainly just teased and ostracized, which of course is hurtful, but it’s nowhere near as bad as it could have been. I was not abused. I have loving and supportive parents. We aren’t rich, but we aren’t struggling either (thank goodness, because while I’m fully financially dependent on my parents right now, I’m not a financial burden to them). Yes my older sister was one of my bullies, but she grew out of it and I don’t hate her for it. She was no worse than the school bullies. We don’t have much of a relationship now, but we get along fine at family gatherings. Not a great childhood, but no traumatic event to resolve. I’ve taken a number of hits in the last few years, and I’m trying to get back into therapy for that, but it’s either a waiting list for government funded therapy, or about $150/hour out-of-pocket for private therapy. That second option is a full nope. And if I end up with a therapist who’s determined to help me with unresolved childhood trauma, I’m going to walk right out the door.

So today: I have 2 friends. Total. One friend I’ve had for probably about 15 years. I can talk to them about anything, but they’re a terrible listener. The type of person who can carry a long conversation entirely on their own, which is great, because I don’t have to contribute much if I’m not in the mood. They care, and are empathetic, but don’t really understand what I’m dealing with because for them depression is feeling blue for a few days once in a while. Constant soul-crushing despair for weeks at a time is a foreign concept. On the downside, they now have kids and I don’t like kids. It’s straining the relationship (from my perspective at least), because the kids are everything now, rightly, but I can’t stop myself from resenting the kids for coming along and changing the friendship dynamic. The other friend I’ve had for about 10 years. It’s a very different relationship, and we spend chunks of time in quiet companionship. It’s restful, and I need it, but it’s not someone I can talk to about everything. Complete trust, that’s not the problem. But it makes them really uncomfortable when I’m obviously unhappy and they can’t help. I can’t make them feel like shit to make myself feel better. I won’t. (I won’t confide in my parents for the same reason - it’s distressing to them when I’m unhappy and they can’t fix it.)
I had a couple of other people I thought I could talk to. Not fully confide in, but at least know they were on the other end of the phone if I needed to vent. Apparently not. One randomly ghosted me a few months ago, and when I asked the other one for advice about something related to social anxiety today they pretty much told me that my crazy is above their pay grade and I need counselling. They blocked me the second they finished typing.

So now I’m turning to the anonymity of Reddit to vent some misery because I don’t know what else to do. My psychiatrist isn’t a counsellor, and can’t be reached (if I leave a phone message they might get around to calling me back eventually). I’m still on a waiting list for a therapist. I called a crisis line once, and got the feeling that if I wasn’t in any danger then I should leave their line open for people who were. THAT was really helpful. I’m bawling my eyes out at 4am because I want to go to sleep and not wake up, but because I have no plans to make that actually happen I should just try to get some sleep? Oh, but ‘call us back this afternoon so we know you were serious about not being in danger’. Thanks.

Downward spiral, mediocre health, no desire to continue to live, no interest in hobbies I used to enjoy, and no energy or motivation to do anything. I don’t even know what I hope to accomplish by posting here, except I can’t keep everything bottled up, and I have no one to talk to. I’ve given up. I even feel like my attempts to get a therapist are more about trying to pass responsibility for the progress of my life to someone else. I’m lost. I’m miserable, and I’m completely lost.",1
why do i rather sit and think about being depressed than doing fun things,"I buy all these new video games, download new movies and tv series etc.

But instead i rather sit in my room in silence and think about all my life issues and how depressed I am. Then want go sleep.

Im literally choosing to waste all my time. I spent lots of time at work and study so in my free time I should use it better so why does my brain want to do this? How can i change it?

Why cant I watch a movie without wanting to switch it off after 30mins to stare at the wall instead?",1
Never ending obsession,"I asked for help in penis related subs and have been told to come here for advice. I hate my dick so much. I know I shouldn't think this much about it, but I can't help it for two reasons. 1.) I have absolutely no desire  to be alive and I'm repulsed by my body. I'm not being hard on myself when I say that I have zero reason to love my physical appearance. It causes me so much pain to think of how I'm trapped in this dumbass body for another 60-70 years. 2.) While most women wouldn't have issues with my size, I have no interest in having sex or being involved with anyone. I don't want a huge dick because I think I need it to satisfy others. I wish I was huge because it would bring me pleasure and enjoyment that I haven't really ever felt. Again, I know that women don't care too much about size, but I don't want to have sex. I stress this because people always tell me, ""Dude you are literally fine as long as you aren't micro or huge.""",1

Does getting married means being selfish? (BREADWINNER HERE),"I've been a breadwinner of our family since then. My life only evolves on working hard to provide for my family. I sent almost all my salary for my family and I solely  support my brother who's studying a medical course at the moment. I don't have any savings. I couldn't even treat myself for pampering. I'm so burnt out from work and I'm suffering from depression.  

Now that I'm turning 31 next month- I crave to experience life. I wanna get married, settle down and start my own family. My boyfriend wants us to get married soon. But I am afraid that if I will get married and move to the UK for my bf, I will lost my job and I'm putting everyone on risk. I really crave to be happy coz I'm tired with the kind of life that I have right now.  Am I too selfish if I will choose my happiness this time?",1
Burnt out and depressed. Should I pause my eduaction?,"Hi, I am a 22 year old female. I am in the deepest depression I have ever experienced.

I got my degree this year and am in the middle of my Honors program. I have put so much pressure on myself for the last 5 years of studying, that I've been suppressing my anxiety and depression almost the entire time. I have been in fight or flight mode for years, and am so burnt out I can't get myself to do anything. A few weeks ago, I was put under a lot of stress with my studies and the flood gates just opened without warning. Now, I can't open an assignment, textbook or anything academic related without having debilitating waves of panic attacks. It feels like my mental capacity has been deteriorating exponentially since then. I can't enjoy anything I love anymore either. I am lucky enough to have a very supportive family, however none of them have experienced this (aside from my sister that has moved away). They do not understand how crippling my anxiety has been. I have no apatite, and I cant even get myself to go shower, let alone get any work done. It has come to the point where thoughts I am having thoughts of self harm and even sometimes suicidal ones. I've secluded myself from all of my friends, and only see my boyfriend and family (whom I have been loving with throughout my studies). I am at the point where I feel nothing but pain. It feels like I can not mentally function.

I have no idea what to do about my studies. I have adopted an avoidant lifestyle, even though I love what I am studying. I feel like I need to terminate or pause my studies until next year, and give myself time to work through all of this, but am so embarrassed about my mental state that I don't know what to do. I have a therapy appointment on the 22nd of this month, but I have no idea how to make this decision without counseling, and I need to make this decision as soon as possible because of the financial implications of my studies. I don't know what to do.",1
when you lose everything,"and have to start all over, that pain hurts.

just a bit of a rant post. i spent the past five years (18-23) building a life i was so proud to have - found a nice enough place to live, a min wage job that i was happy enough in, with colleagues i liked, and a strong passion and determination to become a full time musician - I was singing and busking, lots of friends and saw/interacted with a dozen or so people every day! financially stable and progressing. after a horrible childhood and almost 20 jobs hopping around (bad luck with workplaces etc) i finally started having some kind of stability, staying at a job for almost a year. going to the gym, taking driving lessons to the point i was ready to pass, performing in venues, smiling!! actual mental recovery and health 💪 

then stuff happened in december...this will sound crazy but i'm a stranger on the internet so you don't have to believe me - i fell off my bicycle, hit my head, got psychic abilities and started interacting with ghosts (with freaky accuracy), but then I started having unexplained seizure like body spasms - wound up in hospital three times via ambulance...the third, they didn't know what was going on and i ended up in a psychiatric facility for a few months (i should've kept my mouth and my third eye shut lol). so i lost my job and my place. and a bit of my grip on reality / i started talking about vortexes and dimensions. 

fast forward from nov '22 to today...may '23 - i pushed away all the psychic stuff (ignoring it COMPLETELY) i am back living with my parents (a lot of abuse history with them and i fought so hard to leave that, so winding back here now hurts to my core) now witnessing my dad get loud and angry to my mum/ grandmother is so triggering it aches. i witness my mum living a very depressing life too. i'm financially back to zero. living in a small bedroom which is quite dilapidated and rundown, in the middle of nowhere. insects galore which triggers old OCD habits. all of my things piling in storage containers around me and nowhere to put it so i never bothered unpacking. unemployed and will be seeking yet another min wage job. i haven't been outside for almost a month now. i'm basically hiding just watching stupid tv shows and movies, because everything feels so...lost. no friends in this area and the ones i did have last year have all somehow evaporated except for the odd ""hi"" and basic text.

the only thing that ever made me so happy and gave me purpose was music. but i haven't sang or written in months and i think i've given it up. 

i've tried speaking about what i'm experiencing but i end up in tears. so i've just stayed in bed, and for the first time in my life, i've become everything i always feared and worked so hard to stay away from. i think i am in real depression. 

anyway, i'll probably get another job soon within a few months, but with that salary...i can't help but think, i'm probably stuck here unless i find a small houseshare to move to. last time i was lucky, it was a friend's place's garden house after a series of crappy houseshares - but then i had to hit my head and lose all that. 

to what end? i will get a job that pays maybe £1.3k a month, but that's not enough for my own place. eat, shit, sleep, be a cog in the concrete jungle machine. that's what the future looks like. it seems so sad without any of my passion or love left. 

love. even just if i had a sibling or a pet or a close friend. love would make this easier.

because isn't that really why we live? to make memories with people we love. what happens when everything collapses and everyone and everything you loved is gone from under your feet without warning? 

i had no bloody warning.",1
I’m so low,"I just realized how bad my depression has gotten, and I’m not even sure that I care. My life has been long and tiring and sad. My mom died when I was 7. My first husband committed suicide when I was 26 (he was 27) on Christmas leaving me with 3 and 1 year old daughters. My second husband abused me, cheated on me, broke me into a million pieces. I eventually got the strength to leave him and start over, but it left me in a terribly financial place. I was laid off last year. I finally have a good job again but I feel like an imposter. 

I don’t think that my kids (now 21 and 19) need me anymore, or particularly want me around. I’m alone most days, with my cats. It’s lonely. 

Due to my layoff, I just had to file bankruptcy. Which, because I was trying to keep my house, meant filing Ch 13. Those payments will leave me with barely enough to pay my utilities. 

I cashed in my entire retirement between leaving the ex and being laid off. I’m flat broke. I will never be able to retire. (I’m in my mid 40s). 

In 3 years, my life insurance through work would pay out enough to leave my kids with a solid nest egg, and my youngest should be through college. I’m just not sure that I can make it that long. 

I’m not even sure why I’m posting. I usually get high when I feel like this, and I’m better for about a week. But then the numbing darkness comes back. I’m sober as a judge and will keep being so since I cannot afford weed anymore. I’m on meds for depression but I’m not sure that they even make a dent. Because if I feel this shitty on them, what would I be like OFF them? 

Thanks for reading. I guess that I just needed to get this out. I have a large family and I cannot talk to any of them about this because I don’t want to disappoint them. Or worse, have them not care and tell me it’s all in my head. I know it’s in my head. What I don’t know is how to fix it. I know that other people in the world have had a worse/harder life.

""What's the difference between accepted obligation and love? Perception.""

I still feel the same way all these years. Being depressed sucks, I have friends I have family but all I can do is twist myself into knots convinced that they don't care about me truly they just feel they have to. They've just accepted me as a chore that they are obligated to see to. I get the briefest of flashes not feeling like that then it all goes away again and if I keep coming back to it how wrong could it be? If I keep finding ways that it's true how could I be wrong? I don't think I'll ever understand how some people can truly feel and accept love without deep doubt or guilt.",1
It didn't get better,"I just don't know anymore. I feel like I have tried everything. Things just don't seem to be getting any better. I've been depressed since I was 13 or 14. I'm 36 now. I often think about a teacher I had in highschool who told me things would get better. He lied. There's not a day that passes where I don't think of ending my life. The meds help and then they don't and so I switch..rinse and repeat. I've tried making friends but nobody is really interested. I know they think I'm weird or ugly or something idk.

I'll be 40 in four more years. And I have accomplished nothing. I still live at home with my mother and everytime I come out of my room I can see the disappointment on her face. My 13 year old nephew asked me one day: ""how are you 36 and still live with your mom? I was so mortified. I didn't know what to say. He's right. I'm a terrible example. I feel like such a waste of space. Often times when something tragic happens on the news where people die, I wish that I could have taken one of there places so that they could keep on living.

On top of it all I have anxiety and it makes me paranoid. People are either talking about me, laughing at me or out to get me in some way. I could never make friends online because I was terrified. I think I've been lurking on reddit for almost eight years and I just made my first post a few months ago. Ridiculous! Why am I so scared? I love video games but avoided online ones bc I was too scared to play with strangers.

I quit everything. Every job I get, project, hobbies, everything. I took me 14 years to get through college! It's so hard to keep my room straight. I have too much stuff and refuse to throw it all away bc it's all I have. I don't have anything else. It makes me somewhat happy but at the same time I'm drowning in stuff. I just wish I could restart. But at this point it just one step forward and two steps back. This post is all over the the place. Sorry.",1
Just need to tell anyone and not bottle it all in.,"I can’t be completely honest with the people around me but cannot keep bottling this all up, so I’ve resorted to telling strangers on the internet. It’s a long post. 

I struggled with depressive thoughts my whole life. But this has got worse these past few months for one main reason and a couple other reasons that have compounded on top of the main one. I am just so sick and tired of pretending I’m at least a little bit okay to a majority of people other than my mum. Who I can’t even tell everything to. 

Recently, my thoughts have deteriorated to thoughts of suicide, nothing that will be acted upon at this moment. I’m just so sick and tired of feeling this way. I don’t want to die, I just want the pain to end. 

I have moved into a new house since the split and I just feel like an imposter. The three of them get on really well and whenever I get in the vicinity they go quiet and when I try and join in conversation they just disperse and everything ends. Even after I’ve heard them laughing and joking. I pay rent in two places, one is with the girl I love, who isn’t in love with me back, and the other I have bad imposter syndrome in. 

Medications don’t seem to help and fluoxetine actually had nasty side affects that were worse. The closest medication seems to get is making me feel numb, a complete and whole lack of emotion seemed to actually make the thoughts of wanting to die even stronger, if I can’t even feel emotions then what is even the point of bein alive? 

I wrote a very long suicide note and a couple individual ones to certain people, not sure why. Maybe in case I just decide to do it one day. So at least they’re there as back up. 

I have two key reasons to not at this moment. One is my mum told me when I was really bad and she sensed something that if I do anything it’ll probably kill her as well. She’s not very well and I do believe her and if my mum died then my sisters life would crumble as well. Which cannot happen as she has two kids, of which I am in her will as the next of kin. She has a bit of a dangerous brain condition and she wanted to be safe. 

The other reason is that it would probably devastate my ex. Her leaving was what triggered this steep decline, i don’t hold any negative feelings toward her at all, actually the opposite. But it wouldn’t be a stretch for her if she heard that I had actually done it that the steep decline as a result of the breakup led to this, and I wouldn’t want her to feel guilty if I did do anything. To bear the thought of my mum and her hearing about this and their reactions is probably the main reasons I haven’t done anything serious.  

I just needed to tell anyone. I’m seriously losing motivation. The doctors don’t really help and are just trying medications to hope something works. Doesn’t seem like they really care that much. I’m starting to feel like a lost cause. Destined to be alone and depressed. Like I said I don’t want to die, I just want the pain to end. 

I just had to tell anyone that would listen (or read), it’s getting too tiring to hold the thoughts in.",1

Nothing is the same...,"The world seems off. Or maybe it's just me tbh. I feel like this world needs to end, or get a hard reset. Technology has ruined the human experience. The music of today I don't particularly like. Social media is pure fiction. I used to enjoy video games but I just don't want to play. We have to earn money to pay to live on a planet we never asked to live on. The more I look at modern life the more I just want to opt out of it. I hate having to get up and go to work for paper notes. I don't really enjoy anything anymore and I can't remember the exact moment I began to feel this way. Am I the only one? Like what is it all for? Is this all there is to life? Just earn money till the day you die....I don't really want to be a part of it. It's bullshit....all is emptiness. I lost my joy in life when I began to see things for what they are.",1

Is there any way to beat this kind of behaivours?,"First of all, sorry for my terrible english.  
About 4 years ago I was diagnosted with dysthymia by a neurologyst when I went for sleeping problems,  is a mild chronic depression but i never took the antidepressive meds that were prescripted because my family asked me not to, i think that was a mistake. I had some traumatics events in the past but I was able to function, even though the thoughts that all I did was for nothing never left, I was able to made peace with that and keep them for myself, put a mask on and go as I was optimistic to my enviroment outside my home.  


My condition was very well controlled while i was in college, but when covid pandemic strikes, It got worse,  I was in my moms house like for 2 years, so now i struggle a lot with trying to get out of bed, i do lots of things in my room for trying to shut my head and dont think in anything, games ,videos, i sing and play guitar, anything that make me not hear my head, my anxiety, and my sadness.  
I been living with this my whole life, and now Im at a point that im burning bridges with my closest friends, being mad for any reasons while they are very far away and dont have a lot of chances to get them back.  


I started to go to a psycologist but at the 2nd session he told me i also need a psychiatrist as well, and Im going back to my neurologist. I m going to try to do all they said but I cant shake the feeling that is all for nothing. I dont know what is going to change. Also I notice my family is getting really affected by this, they are trying to help, but they dont have enough tools, they end up getting mad and saying horrible things, even though i know they are trying to help the only way they can.   


I really dont know what to do because I feel like my life is getting destroyed by myself, and even though i can rationalize that is my sickness, the feeling that is just me who is doing this wont go away.   
Is there anyone here that beat this kind of behaivours? Is there any hope for this to get better? I just need some hope, and advices for the day to day.",1
I just can’t find happiness.,I’ve always struggled with depressive thoughts but it’s been so bad recently and I have nobody to turn to. Nobody knows I’m like this I’m so tired of being alone I’ve never felt so alone in my life i recently quit a job that I was content with for a “better one” and it’s honestly a lot worse I hate every moment I am awake I can’t stand it I just need to vent but I have nobody to vent to. I constantly think about suicide and I hate it I don’t want to die but I can’t stop thinking about ending it all. I work 12 hours a day to distract myself but I hate my job I quit drinking and smoking weed awhile ago because I know it’ll only help in the moment and dig a deeper hole. Fortunately I never got too involved in hard drugs. I just got home and it’s the same empty feeling I constantly feel I’m just so sick of this I’m so young and it’s only gotten worse as time has gone on I’m genuinely terrified that it will keep getting worse. I’m tired of telling myself that it’s going to get better and that I just have to keep pushing and trying but it doesn’t and never has idk why idk what’s wrong with me. I can’t find a woman who genuinely likes me either I don’t know what’s wrong with me I mean I’m not the greatest looking but I’m not ugly I workout frequently and am in good shape but I’m just not enough. And it’s not cause I’m depressed like this like I said I never show these kind of emotions. But for instance I recently had sex with this girl that I’ve known awhile and we began talking every single day and then she hits me with “I find you really attractive and we get along well and we vibe together but I just can’t see us in a relationship” like why what’s wrong with me idc about sex I want someone to spend genuine time with and I just can’t find that idk what’s wrong with me I do everything I’m supposed to and it’s just not enough. Idk there’s so much i want to experience but idk how much more I can take. Idk I just wanted to vent I can’t sleep for some reason even tho I only slept 3 hours last night I just want the day to end and I can’t even sleep.,1
I planned my death day to cope.,"Anyone plan their death day to cope with depression?

I struggled a lot with sucidie thoughts, anxiety. 
I frequently have panic attacts. And I tried to kill myself many times. 
I seeked books, therapy, friends and family, but nothing helps.
But then I just think: fucked it, I'll just kill myself and all my problems will be gone. 
So I saved my birthday this year as the day I will kill myself. I planned my will, and get everything in order. 
After that, I feel relieved. I stop worrying, i stop being anxious. Nothing stressed me or upset me anymore, because I will die anyway. So nothing matters. 
I don't think I got better, or this helps. I'm just running away from my problems. 
I am serious about my death day, I want to see it through.
It's just that this helps me live a relatively normal and peaceful life thus far.",1

i’m a homeschooled 8th grader about to go into high school. my brother is grade 11 right now and he does amazing in school. my brother is autistic and suspected not to do well in school bc he could barley say a sentence in 2nd grade and he struggled for years. when he got to highschool he just did so much better. i’m happy for him i really am but now i’m such a disappoint compared to him. i get so jealous and it hurts. my family has such high expectations beacuse of him, he’s been the favorite since we were little and always babied bc of his issues. whatever i’m done venting i’m just tired and don’t think ima be here by 10",1
I think I'm addicted?,"Currently, I'm living in a group home on the campus of a psychiatric hospital. I've been outpatient here for the past couple of months. I've been struggling with self-harm, and I had to go inpatient twice. I don't think that helped me much, though, and they've given me a lot of chances. I've been warned that if I self harm again, I'm getting thrown out, so I'm trying my best to control myself and use some coping skills, mostly breathing exercises or listening to music to calm down, but sometimes these urges are just so strong that it's like I'm so ready to act on impulse, but I also think about the fact that if I risk self harming again, I'll actually be homeless, and I don't want that it'll make everything worse for me. Everything is just so hard right now. All I feel is constant stress and depression; so many things are building up inside of me. I'm just so used to using self harm as a relief for everything. It's like I'm an addict, and I need it so badly as an outlet to relieve myself. I know it's up to me to try harder to help myself.",1
Suicidal thoughts get in the way of living,I can’t motivate myself to do anything because I keep thinking about killing myself. Whats the point of doing anything if one day I am just going to blow my brains out anyway. I could probably get better if I had motivation but I don’t like myself enough for a better life to be motivation. I think I deserve to live a short shit life that ends in suicide. Thats what my brain tells me is right even though i’m miserable.,1
Mother's day,Personally I've never celebrated mother's day . My mom left when I was 3 .After a while my family moved in right next to my grandma. I spent so much time with her I basically lived at her house. She got me to go to church to do sports and really everything I did in my life.I would say she was the mom I didnt have. She died though and honestly I miss her so much.She would be so disappointed to see me now anyways.Though maybe I could go for a visit and spend mother's day with her one more time.,1
I think I’m scared of the idea of not having my depression,At this point I’ve been dealing with depression and suicidal ideation since I was 12. And I am getting better…it is slow progress but I am trying. But the thing is if I don’t have my depression who am I? If I’m not sad who am I? What was it all for?

Life sometimes feel like a McDonald's reheated fry,"Soggy, flavorless, pointless, sometimes just want to give up and be fed to a dog to get it over with,

Don't want and can't?,"I am currently in a very deep major depression, . I was okay for a long time but now I am at a point I had already been 15 years ago. I find myself planning how to escape. I know I need help and I was actively trying to, but there are some points that don't work out. I am so tired of trying. I need more meds and I start questioning if a life on meds is worth the struggle.
This morning I already had a panic attack and I cried. And I need to sort my thoughts and give them space so that's why I am here, writing. I did some awareness excercise to calm down amd afterwards I started thinking in circles what a mess this is. It is getting harder to get out of the circling thoughts. And how shall I go for a walk when I can't open the frontdoor to step out? When I try progressive muscle relaxation I find myself all tensed up.
I feel bad for just sitting with a coffee and not being able to do normal stuff, feeling guilty for not being functional. And all I can do is concentrate on breathing. 
And there are the thoughts that everyone around just things I don't want to, not believing that I can't and yes through all this I can't... I additional don't want because it feels exhausting to only think about. I know I can feel better, I know It won't stay like this, I know I have to be patient and accepting and nice to myself, but my whole life experiences work against me and I just want to give up.
Is it okay to just do the absolut minimal things? Is it okay to just sit and stare and cry? 
How do you give yourself a friendly hand, when you hate yourself for being sick? Because all you ever heard is that you are weak not sick. Sometimes it even hurts to breath. I am holding on. But I don't want to. How do others cope with this I can't and I don't want anymore?",1

Late realisation,"I've been emotionally abused by my brothers in my childhood. I haven't realised of the traumas I've been through until recently. The stigma of having a normal happy family stopped me from looking at back. I have asked myself so many times how did I turn out to be this way? And the answer, the main reason, lies within my family. Infront of everyone I have a pretty much big family. And they all get along. Except for me and my brothers. We had our share of brotherly fights but at some point it went out of hand and detached me from them forever. We don't talk anymore.. We don't even smile. It's been like that more than 10 years. I'm 23 now. And I feel more alone and depressed when I'm home. Don't have that many friends. But I feel more comfortable when I'm with them. 

Years back when I first got diagnosed for my mental health issues I didn't know it was only gonna get worse. That I would be left hurt for the rest of my life. That I would be constantly thinking of death. At first my parents were the reason that held me back from it. the pain they would suffer. the trauma I would cause them. Nothing matters anymore. They are the main reason for me to turn out like this. And yeah, of course my mind isn't normal from early days there's that too. A couple of months more. I know a miracle like someone coming to your life to save you is not gonna happen. I had someone like that, very precious, and it turned out to be the second most haunting thing now. So I'm just waiting it out to all end. I beared myself these fucked up years what's a couple more months. It's going to be hellish like or worst than the past six months. But yeah I'm preparing myself for the end. I have tried to die two times. But it was more like a suicidal gestures, a cry for help. But there won't be another one of that. The third is going to be the last. And I learned it the hard way. NOT EVERYONE'S LIFE IS WORTH LIVING FOR.",1

How to have fun?,"l feel empty, currently nothing I do is truly ""fun"" Hobbies such as music, videogames and sports are all unfullfilling and none of them are fun. I feel like im wasting my time because I do these things to have fun and yet I dont, I never have fun.

No matter the game I play, the sport I do or the music I try to learn I never feel like im having fun. My life currently just feels like, studying and then I waste my time trying to be entertained. None of these hobbies are satisfactory, fun or fullfilling to me. After those long hours of studying and not achieving my unrealistic goals I go and try to have fun but I never do. I feel like a idiot wasting my time

I want to have fun in life but im not able to do so. That sensation of doing something you enjoy and having fun feels just so out of reach... and everyone else can just have fun but I dont.

This is a very long read, uhm.
I got sent to the mental hospital because I sent a friend my goodbye message, and I was planing on committing suicide by overdosing on all of the pills I find in my house when school ends. Getting sent to the mental hospital made me feel like I was being punished for wanting to die. I am so fed up with life. Getting sent there made me feel worse. I had these certain friends that I could trust and be myself around, and they were encouraging me to live but over time, they started being distant. They pretend that I don’t exist now. I asked my friends if I could hang out with them on the weekend and they said yes. They ALWAYS hang out without me and always post about it. But suddenly they ghosted me again today and I feel like shit. I was so excited and happy, but they ignored my multiple texts. I wasn’t being rude... I’ve always struggled making friends as a kid, and this reoccurring moments give me terrible flashbacks. I struggle with communicating because I am neurodivergent. Luckily I have therapists. I wonder why I have to experience this…",1
Lacking Purpose (TW),"TW for suicidal ideation. I 100% understand if my post gets deleted. I'm posting this to anywhere I think I can find somebody, ANYbody who could give me some semblance of advice.

I'm a 24yo American male and I'm completely lacking in motivation and purpose.

I've always been a lonely and mentally ill person. Anxiety, depression, suicidal, etc. I feel very little positivity and joy. I lack the motivation for self-improvement and self-reliance.

Ever since my youth, I've never been much good at making friends. Was never a very social or motivated kid. I've seen it said many times that charisma and having connections are essential to success in life. I severly lack social skills/people skills and fear that this has crippled my ability to live a well-off life.

I suffered a mental/emotional breakdown in 7th grade due to the stress of the workload. I got diagnosed with Asperger's and spent proceeded to spend most of my time in the special needs classroom. I've suffered several breakdowns throughout my years as a middle and high school student. Lots of banging on walls, lots of crying, lots of screaming, etc. I was the stereotypical ""psycho"", the quiet loner kid with no friends and no social skills. I dropped out of several high-demand classes and clubs as a result of never being able to handle the workload/responsibility (APUSH, robotics, Beta Club, National Honor Society, etc.). I never took the SATs or anything like that. I feel horrifically ashamed and guilty and useless and worthless because I could never make it in these classes/clubs. It's resulted in me feeling constantly suicidal to this day due to never living up to my own hefty expectations of myself.

In 10th grade, I confessed how sad and angry and suicidal I am to a guidance counselor and it landed me a week in a juvenile mental facility. I wasn't allowed to return to school for half a year after that. I totally screwed myself even further. Shoulda just kept my mouth shut.

I'm still living with my parents and am totally dependent on them for everything. I never learned how to do all the things kids are supposed to learn. How to make friends, how to swim, ride a bike, etc. I'm 24 and I don't know how to drive! And as an adult, I know diddly-squat about insurance, homeowning, taxes, etc., or any other important adult stuff. I've been working part-time as a dishwasher at Cracker Barrel for the past 8 years, less than 20 hours every week. I still rely on my parents and grandparents to get me to and from work. I feel like such a massive burden and have attempted to take my own life multiple times.

Sis got accepted into college recently. She's absolutely amazing, an extremely talented and intelligent young woman. An artist, musician, writer, etc. Recently, I overheard Dad telling her how great she is while talking trash about me behind my back. Said I'll always be dependent on him and Ma. He's sick of it and moving out in September. I'm absolutely terrified of what'll happen to us once he goes.

I confided in Sis about what I heard and she told me she wanted to yell at Dad and tell him to shut up right then and there. That a parent should never talk like that about their child. She offered to help me learn how to drive and she offered to help me apply for college. But I'm so genuinely terrifed that I'll crash and burn in college (see my previous academic history of stress and mental breakdowns). I'm so, so, so genuinely scared outta my mind that I'll never make it. That I'll never amount to anything, so why bother accumulating debt if I'm probably just gonna drop out like I always do?

I've become hyper-fixated on the concept of euthanasia. Death with dignity, the right to die, etc. This suffering is just too much to bear. I'm so sick of myself. I wish I was normal. I wish I wasn't so emotional and outbursty. I wish I wasn't so socially inept and helpless. I wish I leaned how to swim and how to bike and how to drive when I was a kid. I wish I knew how to be responsible and own my own place and do taxes. I'm the type of person who needs firm directions from others in order to achieve some semblance of function. Can anybody give me direct and concise orders on what to do next? I can't do this alone...

I apologize if all this comes off as whining and complaining, I'm just so very sick and tired of myself. Seriously, what should I do? What CAN I do?",1
Is this it?,"Really……is this it? It has to be better. I mean it was. I basically lost 16 years of my life. I was in a relationship, I had 3 kids I raised and 1 that came from me. After my ex wife and I divorced I lost my kids. Not legally. Our relationship was spotty to put nicely. She pushed buttons and I’m not a fan of that. Being from an abusive father I tried not to be him the the genetics lead me. Now that stigma of me still lies with them. Even my ex, I still get the third degree of how I was not how I am. I don’t know, i wish they knew how it’s hurts not to talk to me and I spent way to much trying first. Now my current ex. She was a sweetheart at first. Beautiful woman, loves sex, loves to be kinky, she said I was the only to give her multiple orgasms. We lost our baby and I think after that was the turning point. She had a trouble past and alway would bring it up. I had a trouble past and my past was in a good place, way long behind me. I know this is all over the place. It turned out bad because she would always leave then I had trust issues. Granted when I explained what pushed my buttons and open to talk about them she took it offensive. So naturally I’m the asshole. Once again I’m the asshole. I’m always the asshole. Always will be. I will die being the asshole. My kids still think I’m an asshole. My first ex still thinks I’m asshole. I hate when I look at myself. I have nothing. I have my mom, sister, brother, those kinds of family. But I need my other family. Yes need them. They don’t want me. Depressed. Yes I am.",1
Support,"Love being told I have support but hate knowing I am letting everyone down.  I have planned everything and I am going to try my best to not letting anyone down. 

I have delusions of hypocriticalness it’s ruined my pathetic life",1
Would like your feedback AITA?,"To begin this has been an incredibly trying couple of years. I am also using a throwaway account. I want to know in terms of me and my family if AITA or if they are. If they are I am willing to walk away.  
  
My parents are fairly well off, have a couple million for retirement and enough rainy day money if it should arise, multiple homes in different states that type of thing.....  
  
In high school I worked, in college I worked, between college and medical school I worked. None of this should be surprising in fact it is probably expected such is life. While in medical school admittedly overseas I was the victim of crime(s) by the medical school and forced out in good-standing. I did try and alert my parents/family that the medical school wasn't what we thought it was and that transferring would be a good option, used my connections to make it happen.... I needed cosigner's on loans and they refused to co-sign on it if I was transferring anywhere else. They also acted incredibly derogatorily once I was in to me in general. I am not sure what changed or why they choose this approach but they treated me with almost disdain. I get co-signing on loans isn't fun but on the other-hand they knew this had to be a possibility when I went to medical school. My life in the medical school wasn't good either and I was incredibly isolated had no friends there etc....  
  
When I was the victim of the crimes I did my best to alert them to it and I asked for help. I wasn't asking for money as I had enough for the situation, I just needed a phone call to a lawyer so they would talk to me using their connections. I fully understand if no crimes were committed and would admit if it was my mistake. I spent some time (alone) trying to get legal help to no avail and they absolutely refused to help. During this period I wasn't partying, hanging out with friends (I have none), just surviving and trying to handle things legally. I also wasn't legally able to work in the country if I wanted to. I eventually couldn't take it any more and went voluntarily to the psych ward for 5 or so days.  
  
I came home directly after.... They still refused any legal help. They live in the middle of the country and I am from a very cold wintery state. I have no car or any real transportation... Therefore, I applied for numerous remote jobs over a 6 month or so period. While dealing with the mental health issues arising from the crimes as well as continuing to do my best to handle things legally... They themselves admit crimes were committed and they just outright state they don't care. Suing ""wouldn't benefit them"". I was informed they won't spend a penny to help me in my future anymore.  
  
Again the same suicidal and overwhelming feelings returned and once again I checked myself into the psych ward. I will note I was overwhelmed, anxious, etc... And did cause some damage involuntarily after once again being denied any help. While in the psych ward I was informed they were kicking me out and therefore homeless (on my 29th birthday actually). Dealing with realizing I won't likely be successful, be a doctor, broke, etc... Has been a lot.  
  
\-Look I understand I am too old to be at home, I don't want it either. I have done in my opinion everything I can, including trying to prevent the situation in the first place. I just couldn't get a job. I get it's a strain and I am a burden, etc.... But the net result is I lost my family and extended family. I feel like I worked hard in my life and my family wasn't there for me. I will say the community now that I am homeless has been helping a lot. I would like your feedback who is right here? Thanks if I am wrong I would like to know it.",1
Sad Fantasy,"You do something to my heart: like bioluminescent water in the rain: I don’t even know where to start: I forgot that I ever felt pain: but what’s wrong with my now?: why can’t I stop feeling this way?: I can hear my pulse, it’s so loud: I think I’m going insane: How did I ever feel sadness?: how was I ever so depressed?: my feet are dancing in a puddle: but I’m too numb to feel the rest: old tears fall from my eyes: the salty sting makes me rub my lashes: the next tears come fast: they’ll sit there while time passes: I wonder what it means: is my sadness finally coming to an end: I wake up with a deep breath: time for it to start again.",1
Expectations,"I don't know why I expected more today, its always the same, barely a mention. I don't know why it hurts me, I know what's going to happen any time it's for me. No gifts, handmade or store bought, no hugs or kisses telling me I'm a great mom and thank you for everything you do for us. Nothing. So why am I sitting here about to cry? Why can't they put any effort into making a day special for me? Am I wrong to think this? I'm so heart broken right now, and i don't know what to do about it. I do know it does no good to cry, it's every time birthday, Christmas, valentines day and mother's day. I just want to feel special to someone sometimes too. 🥺",1
Got to vent...,"Im 30yrs old and i spent the majority of my life wishing for death and it became normal to me. Around 25yrs old i had nothing to lose and took about 7g of mushrooms praying for salvation... sure enough about a week after and till about a month ago i was completely absolved of depression. Still got sad and anxious like normal but the depression was gone.... im summarizing heavily because i honestly just want to get this out because im disgusted with myself and the healthcare system and its 1am and dont know what to do.... anyway i had a mental break the birth of my latest child, i was under a lot of stress and phycosis took hold. I knew it was stress related but i let doctors help and gave benefit of the doubt.

"Would anybody actually care if I killed myself, or is it just out of pity?","I've heard people online say, ""don't do it, I care people care about you."" Or "" people will miss you when you die.""

I find that hard to believe.",1
Struggling to care whether I live or die,"For the last few months I feel like I have lost the ability to care about whether I live or die. I am by no means suicidal, but sometimes feel like it would almost be preferable to die rather than continue the same cycle of life I am currently in. The weird thing is that I do have a good life. I had a very traumatic upbringing but have found happiness as a young adult, especially in my career. Ever since starting anti-depressants, I have also found it easier to socialise and keep hobbies. I have good relationships, and don't struggle to get out of bed in the morning anymore / be productive. But at the root of it all I just feel exhausted. Even with the small moments of joy life offers, the pain that comes with being alive – loss, suffering, fear – almost seem like they outweigh the good. 

Recently I had to have an op and went under anaesthetic. When I came around I began crying because I didn't want to wake up and told the nurse I wanted to die. She put it down to withdrawal from the anaesthetic, not knowing my psyche over the last few months. Like I said, I am not suicidal, but I just feel like I'm struggling to find the will every day to care about whether I live or die. It's as though the state of the world and the actual fact of existence seems less preferable to me than the alternative. 

Anyone out there feeling the same? It would be great to not feel so alone in this.",1
Functioning alcoholic,"Hey guys.

I have been struggling with depressive thoughts for about 3 years. It all started because of a girl, but since then it's evolved.

Ever since I turned 18 I have more and more frequently been turning to drinking to cope with my problems. I'm drunk as I'm writing this, and would love to stop. The problem is that I frankly enjoy being drunk. 

As a 20 y/o man, struggling with alcoholism isn't that much of a problem in my close one's eyes. I don't tell them why I drink. We party and have fun, and they don't recognize that I have a problem. 

As a coping mechanism, however, it doesn't work long term. I'm fine in the moment, but when I wake up I'm just as miserable as I was the day before. My therapist says I should find ways to stop, but hasn't really given me clear cut advice.

If you are like me, by all means stop drinking. I wish I'd never started, but life got in the way. The whole point of this post is sharing my experience, not necessarily seeking advice.",1
Realizing some disturbing facts and want all to end,"Well, I've been depressed pretty much since I was a child. I've tried therapy a lot of times but everything is like a cycle, it never ends. I keep ruminating everything, that I never will be enough and valid to anyone, that I will never be alright, that I will never be the best at anything... I'm always and I say always comparing me with others. I compare me pretty much with everyone. I always lose the comparation. I just want this all to end, It's not worth the torture of living. I'd like to just die, but I'm not brave enough to kill myself. I always change my mind, 'cause I don't want physical pain. If I could just press a button to die painlessly I would press it doubtlessly. 

I don't know if this is going to end, I think I will end commiting suicide one day, and knowing that, I think everything I do is useless.",1
I want to kill myself,I am stuck in misery. I don’t deserve better and can never achieve better. Anything I touch burns to ashes. I am a failure in every way and I will never be any better. Everyone hates me. I hate myself. I have no reason to be alive just a worthless piece of shit burden.,1
I wish my problems would go away,"I got really depressed during the pandemic. If was a nightmarish experience and it felt like it would never end. I dropped out of school and was very fed up with life and hopeless. Some time after that I started on meds and therapy, and after some months my life is bearable and often even enjoyable, even though I'm still depressed.

At the same time, I never had a job before and I'm struggling to keep up with my new obligations. Sometimes I wish I could just give up and die, but it would mess up my family really bad so I can't do that. I can definitely keep on going if things go well, but sometimes I feel overwhelmed.

On top of that and other issues I have, the people around me aren't good at being supportive, and are often mean and dismissive and make me feel miserable. I wish all my problems would go away so I could live a better life.",1
I'm lost.,"I would like to firstly say that I am not diagnosed with depression, but I feel like there's something wrong with me. Take this post more as a way for me to vent out my feelings and frustrations. I don't feel the need to hurt myself or anyone around me, so breathe easy.

I'm a 30 year old guy. During all my years up to this point, I have never felt understood. I try to be honest with people when I'm feeling down, but that always results in those people going away. I've always had these moments where, even unprovoked, I just fall into a pit of sadness and can't get out for a varying amount of time, usually from 1 day, up to maybe a week or two. During this time in the past I've tried reaching out to people, but now I just sit and wallow in my sadness.

I'm alone, ever since I moved out at 18 I've always lived alone. I've put my heart on the line and tried to make meaningful connections with some people, but it was never either the right time, or the feelings were unreciprocated. I don't blame the people for not feeling a certain way about me. But what hurts me the most is that because every time I've tried to find that special person who I would want to give my all to, who I want to make happy, it's never mutual. I'm left to feel alone, unwanted and unloved.

I've had partners, who I've been close with, who I've been intimate with, but I've never been in a committed relationship.

I don't think that I deserve anyone to feel a special way about me, I don't think I deserve someone to love me. But I want, at least once, for someone to feel that way about me. I want to feel like I matter to someone. And I know that I matter to the few close friends I have, and to my family. But that's different. People don't care about how a 30 year old man feels. They just don't. I don't care what anyone says, the feelings of a man are always disregarded and thrown away like a used napkin.

I'm lonely.",1
I can't love myself,"I'm an idealist, I keep making the same mistakes and keep getting my heart broken. And when someone does care for me, I end up hurting them. But at the same time I'm a confident and bright person, I joke, I go out, I'm arguably funny to at least some people. But I'm socially inept, making the same blunders over and over, I talk like a fucking movie character.

I don't know how to make the hurt stop but every time I trust people a little bit less. I'm afraid one day when the conditions are right, I will actually just kill myself.",1

It's so hard realising my dreams will never come true,"Maybe I'm just being pessimistic, but it feels like the odds are stacked against me. I'm not sure how to keep my dreams alive when everything around me feels so hopeless. I want to believe that anything is possible, but it's just getting so hard to fucking hope. I've held onto this one dream for so long, but i cant find any way to achieve it.

I know that I'm still young and have a lot of time to achieve my goals, but sometimes it feels like the clock is ticking faster than I can keep up with. I'll never be good enough and I'll never be happy.

Unaccomplishment,"That’s all I feel. Every day of my life. Every minimal action that ever occurs around me just reminds me what a waste of a human being I am. I can’t seem to do anything good. The only thing I do is waste time and oxygen. Everybody around me has and is achieving great things, mainly with college and work. And I envy them. I just rot inside out every time I think of that. It’s a poison that’s killing me every day. The fact that I will never be as good at anything as my peers. The fact that I won’t ever achieve anything great. I’m just hoping this feeling faded away, bc I honestly don’t know what to do or how to make it go away.",1
Helplessly Hoping,"I apologize in advance, I tend to go on tangents and this post doesn't really have a goal in mind. I'm also fairly new to reddit. Anyhow..

Fresh off a breakup from a relationship of 5 years, having to move back home with my family. It's barely been a month but my sense of time has been distorted. Some days seem to fly by, some days feel like an eternity. I am facing loneliness for the first time in years, despite knowing I have a good support circle of coworkers and friends who have been really crucial to my well being in this time. I've always found myself latching on/jumping into relationships very quickly because I never really liked the idea of being alone and the negative connotation I attached to it. The thought of going to the movies alone, or taking myself out to eat alone, still makes me really uncomfortable. I'm scared because I want to go out and explore more of the bustling bay area, but I can't bring myself to go to these places as an individual and potentially seek out new friendships, relationships, or just to distract myself.

The icing on the cake is that I have always struggled with perfectionism, am subject to spiral and catastrophize more often, and generally just always feeling like I need to figure what it is I want to do with my life and distancing myself from people I labeled as ""stagnant"".  I've struggled with MDD since I was a pre-teen and was formally diagnosed a few years ago. I was on anti-depressants when I was about 19, and pre-emptively requested a prescription in Nov. of last year as I was anticipating a major change (transitioning from my job of 4 yrs). I think this is what has been keeping me afloat. I didn't anticipate to break up with my partner, but by then I was pretty adjusted to the medication.

(I feel) I've always valued and contributed to my emotional well being and ways to be a better friend/communicator. I've had many therapists throughout the years and always appreciated the value in opening up, as well as how understood I felt by each of my therapists. On the other side of that coin I know I am an irritable person and struggle with regulating my emotions. I tell myself that as long as I try every day to be better, things will work themselves out.

It's hard most days. I have all this momentum with job interviews, teaching myself new things like riding a motorcycle and how to (finally) swim, reading more books, discovering more podcasts, but it all is just busy work. Stuff to distract me. I often find myself asking, or more so stating, ""What's the point?"" All these things, don't seem to matter because I can't envision a future where I move on from this split and feel good about my accomplishments. Even comparing myself to 5 years ago, I know I've come a long way and I know I have my whole life ahead of me, but I can't accept it. I can't come to terms with it.

The universe works out in ways we cannot foresee, and it is unfolding as it should. I fear the unknown and what lies beyond this plane of existence, so I know I have to see this one life through. I allow myself to cry and feel my emotions, and find myself feeling a bit easier afterwards. I know it gets easier. It has to. There's a point to all of this, I just am not privy to it.

I've listened to this Sinatra song once a day, I know this is a popular song. I just hope someone else feels a bit better after listening.

I've felt this way since grade five and it hasn't gotten better.,"I have a diary entry from the age of eleven talking about how much I wanted to die. I'm nineteen now, and not a day goes by that I don't regret not ending it sooner. 

I go to a good school, but I'm not overly passionate about my major, but then again I'm not really passionate about anything. I have a generally great family, and am upper middle class. I had a mostly good upbringing too; I only doubt my mother's love sometimes. So there's really nothing I can complain about.

I just am so lonely a lot of the time. I don't have a best friend. There's always someone better to hang out with. I'm a good person, I think, but there's always someone better. One of my friends comes to visit sometimes, but ditches me after an hour to hang out with her other friends in the area, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't cry all the way back to my dorm. I find myself doing dishes at other people's places, baking them things, giving them gifts, desperate to feel wanted and kept around. But there's no one with whom I've really ""clicked"" with, and certainly no one who actually reaches out to me. One of them even forgot my birthday. All of my friendships feel so superficial. I don't add anything to my family or my relationships. I feel like if I just disappear, it won't even be a blip in the radar.

Like I said, I've been sad for almost longer than I've been alive. I don't even know what's holding me back at this point. Why haven't I ended it? I'm not diagnosed; in fact, I don't even know who my doctor is. I just keep everything inside. And I have some friends who have gotten help for it and are better off for it, and I can't help but compare myself to them. One of them cried in bed for days, dropped out of school. For some reason, I just power through. I cry myself to sleep and hide behind long sleeves but I'm still functional. I shower, I get passing grades, I pull my head out of my ass and attend class and study and exercise, but I still feel so empty at the end of the day. Like all of it was in vain. I want to be like my friends who got help, but I don't know who to talk to (again, I don't know my doctor). I can't talk to my friends, because frankly, none of them actually *care* about how I feel when I would move mountains for them. I cried for hours when I realized that no one will ever care about me as much as I care for them. 

I feel like I'm a lost cause, honestly. Like the only way I'll get help is an un-alive attempt. I've gotten this far without help, like, do I even need it? Maybe I'm faking this all for the odd chance that someone asks how I'm really doing.",1
Does this count as abuse or something like that?,"
Hey, well this is something that I haven't told to my therapist and I don't know if, as I said in the title, it counts as abuse so I just want opinions, is okay if it isn't, in just genuinely curious if it has something to do with my depression or anything 

So, when I was really little I used to eat very slowly so I had to stay in the table for a long time, until I finished my food, and while I was staring at my food or eating or just seating there my dad (his desk was in front of the dining table) watched like erotic videos; it could be girls dancing sensually or, I think, even straight up porn. I think he touched himself sometime but I can't be sure bc my memory is really bad, and even if he did it wasn't like recurrent or anything. 

I remember one time I was fake sleeping at my grandma's house, I was face down with one of legs up ( I'm sorry I don't know how to explain ) so my ass was like flexxed ig idrk and he entered the room and said like 'damn'. I also remember one time I had a sexual dream with him and I felt really guilty after but not disgusted.

Also I've watched porn and known about sex since I was really small, fantasizing about having relationships and everything. When I was growing up (rn I'm 16) I've watched and listened my parents having sex without them knowing.

Well I don't know what else to say but please comment what you think :))",1
My life is exactly where I want it to be and I'm unbelievably depressed.,"I (37/F) feel like I have it all. I have a job I love that pays well and can buy most things I want. I am managing my debt very well and am making big strides to pay it off early. I live on my own in a clean, well decorated apartment. I have 10 people I can call my best friends, and we get together in person often. I have a boyfriend that I feel super secure with relationship wise. I am incredibly physically fit and am working towards my first strongman competition. I have trauma from childhood stuff (long story, family of addicts, hoarders and enablers), but my family is now clean and did 180s with their personalities. I forgive my parents for what happened and, while I still butt heads with my sister at times, overall have a great relationship with my whole family. My cat is healthy and loving. My car is paid off and has no issues. Everything is perfect. Everything.

And I'm miserable. I have trouble sleeping and focusing at work sometimes. Sometimes, I am not actively doing something, my body feels like it's gonna explode with anxiety. Tonight, after a great workout day and day at the horse barn with my mom, while playing video games with my male friends, I started sobbing and as far as I can see I have NO reason to be upset.

I'm on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds already too. Why. Why is this happening to me? I feel like I am falling down a dark hole.",1
Why does life take so much initiative?,"I hate the fact that if you stop doing anything, no one ever reaches out to you.. Community around you couldn't give a fuck if you died. Been part of so many groups and communities and even after years theres no genuine connection.

With all that being said, I started a new job last week and I feel like its making me worse. It's not the people or the job itself, it's just me. And idk what to do. I want to work, but I feel like I just can't. I get so anxious I get sick, I cry everyday before and after work and I only work part time 5 days a week. What do I do?

Thank you for reading this much",1
I am worthless.,"It's been ten years and nothing has changed. My parents were horrible to me. Abused me when I was a kid and they still gaslight me about it and put down everything I do. They sabotage me but I also self sabotage. A lot of it is also on me but I feel as if everything is against me too. I've worked but it's horrible out here. Even people making a livable wage have a list of grievances. I'm down here at the bottom being underpaid, getting in trouble for using the bathroom, not being able to take meal breaks. I've had a job where the boss was engaged in some illegal activities and I had to leave as quick as I could. I'm just that unlucky.
But Ive also accomplished nothing and have nothing. I just feel horrible everyday. There's so many that can power through it and make it on their own while i envy and live with my abusers at almost 30 years old. I dont have much hope. I wish someone can kill me before I do it myself",1
Can't remember the last time I thought life was worth living,"Hey reddit.  
  
I've never made a post on reddit before, but I've read alot of post lately because I'm going through some sh\*t and it makes me happy to see a community support eachother, so I thought I maybe give it a shot.  
  
I'm M 24 and I live at a university dorm. Some weeks ago we had a easter party with my dorm kitchen and our neighbour kitchen. When I arrived at the party I saw a girl I havn't seen before and she just moved in a few days ago. I remember looking at her and the thought of her was amazing, but that would never happen. Fast forward a couple of hours and we're making out in the kitchen and after the party we hooked up.  
  
After the party everything just felt right. She's so nice and pretty and I definitely liked her. We found a day where I could help her find some stuff for her dorm room and after that we just sat and chatted in her room for hours. I found out that she was really drunk at the easter party, I was also a little drunk, but I didn't remember her being that drunk. So I started questioning myself if she actually liked me at the party or if she was just drunk. But after that day I just liked her even more cause we have so much in common and I really enjoy being around her.  
  
Fast forward to last saturday (may 6th). We had another party, this time with alot of other kitchens. I hoped that at this party I could figure out what me and this girl had, if it was something or if it was something I just made up. I wanted to be around her all the time, but I didn't want to feel clingy, so I gave her some space and enjoyed the party. After some hours i noticed that she has been talking alot with this guy from my dorm kitchen and I was starting to get at bit jealous. At some point they were in his room, with the door open so I guess they didn't do anything, but my thoughts were all over the place, I decided I had to talk with her about us. So I did that and yeahhh.... She didn't like me back, but would still like to be friends and I told her I was okay with that, I'm not btw, but it was better than it being awkward between us.  
  
Fast forward to now. I've thought alot about everything. I've never had succes with finding someone i really liked like me back, so it's not like this is new to me, but it's just like eveything felt so right this time and I really had my hopes up, but after alot of unsuccessful atempts at finding someone who likes me back I'm starting to lose hope. I get attached to people so quick and I hate myself for it. If I just didn't get attached to her so quick, then this wouldn't be so difficult. I mean, I've known her for maybe a month and that I feel so much for her already irritates me. I'm realy starting to lose hope and hating myself alot for making things so difficult. I'm seeing her again this monday, just to hangout. A part of me wants to keep being around her and try to become friends instead and another part wants to forget about her and just move on even though it would be hard cause we live like 3 dorm rooms between eachother.  
  
I don't actually know what I want to get from posting about this. Maybe it's a cry for help, maybe I want some guidance or maybe I just want to know that I'm not alone in this and that everything is going to be alright. I've just not talked to anyone about this, I've actually not talked to anyone in person for the last 6 days. I just keep to myself cause I'm scared to have a breakdown infront of someone and show them what a mess I am. I feel so hopeless all the time and so alone. I have nothing to look forward to. Every day is just a day I have to get through and I just don't feel like I have anything to enjoy anymore. I sleep most of the day because I enjoy the few seconds when I wake up before I realise what a mess my life is. I'm not thinking about ending it all, I could never do that to my family, but it's starting to worry me that it's actually just my family that's stopping me from doing it. I just feel so depressed all the time and I don't have any motivation to do something with my life.  
  
I'm sorry for grammar mistakes, english is not my first language, but I hope it's readable. Thanks if you've made it this far and if you feel like you could have written some of this then I'm sorry and I want to believe that everything is going to be alright for us.

It. Doesn’t. Stop.,I just don’t even know what to say anymore. Life keeps shitting on me and I’m buried so deep. I truly don’t know if I can dig myself out.  This sucks.,1
Putting others before myself is my most fatal mistake,"Last night I helped one of my best friends get into a relationship with someone who I actually had feelings for. I was going to make progress but unfortunately, she saw my friend as her soulmate. I’m glad that they are together considering my friend has never been a relationship. I’ve been heartbroken for years, she managed to put it all together for me, then I handed to her and went to my friend.  I’m now heartless.

I helped many of my friends that got into a relationship, some of them are even married. I haven’t been in a relationship in 7 years and that was my only time in one, and it ended off so terribly that it’s stuck with me to this very day. Thanks to that, i have depression and a shit ton of anxiety. 

To others, they see me as a great friend with the best advice. But what I think is that they think I’m very weird and very socially awkward. Truth is, I am, and I don’t think I will ever be like a normal person ever again after that relationship. I put on a face for others that, I hope, will make them smile and laugh. I always ask them how’s your day? or how are you? And are you doing well? I feel like whenever those questions are turned to me, it’s all false sympathy to me. 

All this time, I have never took care of myself mentally in the last 5 years. It’s draining and taxing my entire lifestyle. I’ve lost all interest in hobbies and even looking for a relationship since that’ll turn into me begging for love, and I know that’s not how a relationship works. I honestly think that I won’t be ever the same again before. I even can’t trust myself anymore and I don’t even think I will ever again. 

I don’t want people to make the same mistake I have. Please care for yourself before others.",1
Life just seems like an endless looping torture,"I (16M) and just so tired and exhausted and this sick cycle of life and it only seems to be getting worse. Life seems so pointless and nearly like torture. It’s just chore after chore, test after test, job after job, working towards a goal that doesn’t even seem to great: survival. I cannot express who I love, so I will never date and never marry, growing old alone, and being forced to watch the only people I love - my parents - fade away from earth, and frankly I don’t wanna be around to experience it. I don’t wanna leave their arms, grow old and overworked, loveless, work and sweat just for survival that doesn’t seem to be something I want. I’ve isolated my friends down to nothing, I make every conservation and meeting worse, I’m not attractive or charismatic, even my “friends” gossip about me. I’m not a genius and have little accomplishment to show for my life at all. I can’t talk to anyone, express my love for anyone, it all just feels like torture where I’m being forced to run through the cycle of life until everything I love is taken away from me. And there’s no reason I should feel this way, I’ve been blessed with a stable family, food, education, and still have made no use of it. I just feel pathetic and useless and frustrated that I have to be around on this filthy planet just to suffer. 

So far I’ve been too cowardly to act on this. But I’m just done with life. I don’t want to work so hard, just to watch everything I cherish fade away. I just want to rest.",1
Ideations,"Becoming too aware of my living causes me to feel like I’ve woken up to a bad dream that I can’t escape. I don’t desire to do anything, I don’t want to see anyone, I don’t want to be someone. I don’t want to take up living and breathing space anymore. I feel like a waste. Peoples lives are no different without me in them and I’m glad nobody cares so they won’t have to face it. I feel like I am walking through a winter desert with no civilization or anything but the cold and harsh snow and wind. I walk alone frozen with no purpose or destination. I’m stuck and abandoned here.",1
All in a year,"Pretty crazy how you can go from the best you’ve ever been to the worst in just a year. A year ago I was down 100 lbs, living on my own and having fun. Now I’ve gained it all back, live with my mom and am horribly depressed. I am so tired of starting over. I don’t have the willpower. I want to die.",1
Or am i just a bad son?,"I (30m) didn't wish my mother a happy mother's day. I suppose I'm here to rant... I don't return texts, calls, or anything to any of my family anymore. I'm either bipolar or just generally depressed and have been for about my entire life, I've never been to therapy. Seven years ago i moved from Ontario, Canada to Nova Scotia, and then had probably the worst year of my entire life. I used to fly home for Christmas and New years, and tried to reach summer, but haven't been home since the beginning of the pandemic. My parents visited me here once that first year, and my mom and grandma came out three or four times. During the pandemic my mental health got way worse than it ever had been, and it's been a very difficult few years. At this point i have maybe three friends and only one of them I've known for more than a year... For years now, any contact with my family started with them criticizing my choices, like nothing I've done since highschool was remotely acceptable. My career, embarrassing, my relationships, failures, my achievements now go unannounced since i don't bother telling anyone... Two years ago for like... Mental health Day or something... My older sister made a Facebook post about her struggle with depression, got an outpouring of support from her extended family(shes married with two children) and her assistant maybe number of friends, and then like... A week later she started texting me all pissed off that i missed her kids birthdays... I didn't bother responding, i did consider offing myself... Not that i actually see that as an option, i don't think it's in my character to do... I was raised to take care of others and to sacrifice and give and be kind and now that I'm so depressed i can't do any of those things i just remain silent while everyone else gets mad at me... I feel like any attempt to to reach out will just lead to criticisms that will just make me resent and/or hate my family, which i might already anyhow. So yeah... That's where i am... Writing this down didn't make me feel much better, but maybe we can talk?",1
MAID,I am soooo upset that maid got postponed to next year for mental health. I have very bad anxiety to be committing suicide but I do know that I don’t want to be living so maid was what I was hoping for and I know it’s a process to even get approved but the fact that it’s pushed to 2024 makes it even worse and the wait even longer. What are some things I should do to get my “affairs in order” prior to Maid (in hopes they do accept my mental illness’ and approve me)??,1
Idk where my life is headed,"I'm 27, just moved from India to the UK last year for my masters and everything in my life is so shit rn. All I ever wanted to do was be a musician (I play drums for a couple of metal bands) but instead I got caught up trying to live life according to what my parents wanted and ended up here for my PG degree that I've severely fucked up because of my no interest in academics. I'm now left with the crippling doubt of whether I'm going to be eligible to get my degree or not and if I don't, I'm going to be neck deep in debt (30L INR). I've been dating this girl from back at home for the last 7 years and while she's nice, I don't want to spend the rest of my life with her but again, too much familial pressure which means I've to marry and her and I'm fucked because I've cheated on her multiple times while I've been away here in the UK. I've basically fucked up my entire life up to this point and I've thought about offing myself a bunch of times now and all I do is just do drugs and get drunk and I'm lonely as fuck, someone please tell me there's a way out of this without completely burning all the bridges in my life.",1
How do people do hobbies?,"It baffles me how people manage to say “I enjoy doing this thing so I do it”. I know I obviously don’t feel that because of depression, but I even see people with depression talking about how doing their hobbies helps. How do you motivate yourself to do things? 

I can’t even begin to make myself do the things I used to enjoy and haven’t done for years. They are still things I have an interest in and would like to do. I don’t know how to describe it, I just can’t. I just have no drive to even try. I’m 32 and have had a depression diagnosis for 21 years. The last year has been a real drop in being able to do things I used to enjoy though they’ve been had for 3-4 years overall.",1
What should I do if my depression/anxiety prevents me from working?,"I'm an entrepreneur, and after a couple of years of burnout, my condition has significantly worsened two months ago, and I've been diagnosed with moderate/severe clinical depression. I've been having an indescribable feeling of sorrow, anxiety, apathy and helplessness, whenever I think about work, I experienced an immense sense of anxiety, fear and anger, as well as physical symptoms, such as massive headache, body tremors, and faster heart beats (and one time, almost hyperventilating). As a result, I've not been productive at work and of course found it extremely difficult to work, or even think anything about work.  
What should I do?",1
Question About Unavoidable Interaction with Abusive Person,"I’m in a situation where I may not realistically be able to politely avoid being around someone who was really abusive about my depression. I forgave them for it, but the fact is they encouraged me to commit suicide and did a bunch of threatening things that were unhelpful to say the least. I don’t want to interact with this person, but I may not be able to realistically avoid it.

What do I even do in this situation? Demand an apology? I’m not sure anything would really change my perspective that they are simply a bad person.",1
"Thanks a lot, if you're reading this.","I've had some sort of personality fixation that I can't back away from, so I need answers based on what I've said below:
I want to start by saying that I am a minor. My whole family is closed and frankly strange, it’s immediately clear that I went all in them, so I doubt that it’s an injury or something like that, it’s clearly genes.
I was in a psychiatric hospital, but it didn’t help me in any way, through an endless amount of tantrums, I learned to hide my emotions, and then I was released after 2 months.
I am still on pills, but they do not help, sessions with a psychologist too. Doctors do not understand why nothing works, and I have already ceased to believe in therapy.
I am very bad with social contact, every time I have contact with people (even now), I get wildly worried. For me, the most ordinary things like friendship, love or ordinary communication is something unimaginably difficult. I literally Googled ""How do you start conversations? How do you start dating? How do you end a conversation?"" and everything like that. I do not know how to conduct empty conversations, I literally have nothing to discuss with others. My voice is monotonous and lifeless, it is unlikely that people will be interested in listening to me.
I hate myself, I'm helpless compared to other teenagers, I have no interests (even what causes at least some emotions is very boring and turns into a routine almost immediately), prolonged depression and a year of apathy and, possibly, anhedonia (?)
It is very difficult for me, I am very tired, rest has not helped for a long time, every day is filled with disappointment and self-abasement, although I understand that this does not make sense. There is and will not be any sense in any of my actions, I will not be able to achieve anything because of my psyche. Even when I was set up confidently and positively to win, it did not help anything, since then I consider every action a failure.
The psychologist diagnosed ""personality disorder"" after studying what it is, I studied it, noticed numerous similarities with borderline disorder, so I may have BPD, the psychologist refused to voice the full diagnosis. She was still mistaken in many ways and behaved, frankly, creepy, so I insisted on changing the psychologist, I will go to her soon.
I have huge memory problems, I can’t remember what happened yesterday or even today, it seems that the days drag on endlessly.
It was very difficult for me to write this, my thoughts diverge or stick together into an incomprehensible haze, it took me a very long time to write this, my concentration is at zero, I don’t even understand what I wanted to say, but I’m interested in this: what kind of diagnosis? What is wrong with me? How to help it? Please, I need some answers, guidance, direction, advice, whatever! I no longer understand what to do.",1
Necrosis,"My life is necrotic, literally not metaphorically. Starting in my mind, depression is moving through me like a gangrenous wound killing every glimmer of what made me alive; my energy, my hope, my ambition, my curiosity, my health, my relationships, my sense of self, everything. ... I am technically still alive, but any part of my life that was ME is now gone, and I am left here, napping until my body stops being animated.",1
I don’t know what to do anymore,"I’ve taken all the pills, been to all the therapists and psychiatrists. I’ve done all the talking, I’ve sought out all the help and I still thinking about killing myself at least 3 times a day.

Sometimes I sit there and just fantasize about killing myself and the only thing that stops me from trying to fulfill one of those fantasies is fear. 

I sit and try and rationalize suicide to myself for hours everyday to try and eliminate that fear but it doesn’t work. My stupid survival instinct is too strong. 

But things will get worse. Eventually things will be so bad that the survival instinct will diminish and I won’t care anymore. Eventually things will be bad enough where I abruptly end it all.

I can’t wait for that day to come.

My life is an endless cycle of sleeping and scrolling through my phone. I rarely leave the house, I have no job (can’t find a decent one), I have very few friends, nothing brings me joy. 

I feel stuck in a suicidal prison where I want nothing more than to die but my brain and body won’t let me. I’m stuck in this limbo for days and weeks on end. Laying in bed motionless just imagining the various ways I could kill myself. 

Nothing helps, inpatient is a scam, therapists don’t care, psychiatrists just want to put me on so many drugs I don’t feel anything anymore.

I think I’m not compatible with the modern world and there isn’t really a place for me.",1
I’ve realized I feel “cured” when I forget about the depression,"It’s fucking weird, I know I ain’t cured cause Im bound to relapse, but sometimes I can carry that feeling of forgetting for a while.

Idk if it’s the way, I mean sustainable, cause I only fall flat on my face afterwards.",1
It honestly can‘t go on like this,"How am I supposed to continue if I despise everything I do. What’s the point if everything degrades into meaningless drivel or another mistake for the pile. Where’s the sense in struggling if there‘s nothing to be gained from it but endlessly recurring disappointment. When moments cease to exist and blur together to form a mass of drab bodies of experiences, all categorized, defused, stale. Where every escape leads back to the inevitable confrontation with the real infused with new anxieties and struggles.  When success is shallow and the only real emotion is exasperation in face of illusory ideals. The only thing keeping me going is the anxiety of possibility reflected in the future, which is dispelled by the inability to escape myself.",1
I either just want to drop everything in my life or blast my brains out with the air rifle. I can’t give a fuck about my life anymore.,That’s all.,1
I'm a Christian pastor living a solitude ministry,I started on this way of life to deal with OCD behavior without any compétant help from psychiatry.. Who all couldnt diagnose a splinter.  I took on theology studies alone along with psychology and what not... And Im cured now... No medicine needed anyway... But in the persuit I found out just how hollow most people are for being double stanarded immoral perverts and fools for being Hypocrites.  The value remains in Jesus and the church and not in outsiders who want to abuse you sexually and take your money for it too.  It's lonely being on the top and it's too bad for those who don't fit in to the superior human being... The Christian,1
Alone and Overwhelmed,"I have caught myself saying that I want to die more times this year than I would like to admit. 

It's not necessarily that I don't want to live.. just to feel a moment of peace. A moment of relief that doesn't seemingly get taken away and discovered later to be a complete lie. I hate that I find myself even struggling to write on the internet ANONOMYOUSLY that I am broken and mad and lost and I wish that my parents gave a fuck about me, I wish I was a priority with friends, I wish I was anyone's choice and I understand that what I'm asking for is too much..  I struggle with CPTSD, ADHD, incredibly high perfectionism + social anxiety.

I feel as though I am lost. I have no idea how to navigate the world filled with weird rules and ways to manipulate others in a self serving nature. Most of the people I have met love the fun, playful, positive and excited person I am - but are never consistent in showing up or working with any part of me depressed or miserable. More often than not, I am told that my grief around not being anyone's first choice or priority is just loneliness and I need to embrace being on my own... How will that heal the pain or allow for healing of the grief that I hold over the fact that I am absolutely no ones choice? Not a first choice, second choice - nothing. I've attempted to articulate this before but continue to hear the same thing - ""learn how to love yourself, be alone, and become your first choice and priority. That's the real magic!""

I try to not hold resentment over the people that treat this like it's so easy to move on from. As if they don't call their parents daily or have someone to reach out to when they are sick, have a challenging day, get into a car accident, need support with their kids.... but honestly, fuck, it is so hard to feel so alone and not a single person can understand this. I am perfectly content being around myself, I love doing what I do on my own, and that doesn't change the fact that I don't have a safe home base outside of myself at all. I'm 32 and I feel like I've been alone my whole life and I am grieving without any end in sight. 

I been struggling with my health for years, very significantly over the past few months and today, I heard back that my body has high nuclear antibody title displaying a homogenous pattern that is suggestive of Systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic autoimmune hepatitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. I'm scared, and I'm alone, and I don't want to do this anymore. 

I feel like I am already struggling with so many basic aspects of my life... how can I keep motivating myself to keep living, when all I want more than anything is to put down my sword and rest? I guess really the whole point of me even writing this was to speak it out loud, my attempt at going somewhere for a virtual hug where I may get ignored and not noticed but at least a hug won't be rejected as I cry.",1
Attempt,Noose was loose. Feeling dumb like a goose. Too fucking fat like a moose. WHY THE FUCK AM I STILL HERE?,1
Why am I happier off my meds than on?,"I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety a little under a year ago. I attempted and was sent to a psych ward for a week and put on lexapro as a parting gift. I still felt horrible so they upped my dosage a few weeks later. And then I still felt like shit so they gave me 2 grams of Abilify (an anti-psychotic) to even me out. It still wasn’t working as it should’ve and my symptoms were already scary enough (I was extremely numb, nauseous all the time, and wouldn’t stop shaking). So not wanting more shit put in me I stopped taking them.

I know that’s usually a bad idea and I should never stop something with such high risk factors cold turkey like that. I accidentally admitted to not taking my meds one time to my friends and they wouldn’t get off my back about it (and they thought it was just a one day thing, I haven’t taken them in months).

Thing is, I’m much happier and content than I was before. Of course I’m not always on my a game, but I haven’t felt suicidal in weeks and I actually have hope for the future.

It’s a big contributor to many things in my life right now, and Id love to tell my therapist but I fear it would count as me harming myself and the last thing I want to do is go back to the mental hospital.

I’m not sure what I’m doing is good or not, maybe I should give the meds another chance? Or maybe I should tell my psychiatrist the truth? Idk. 

What do you guys think? It would be nice to hear opinions of strangers that would know what I’m going through and aren’t being paid to help me.",1
Nutshell,"We chase misprinted lies
We face the path of time
And yet I fight, and yet I fight

My gift of self is raped
My privacy is raked
And yet I find, and yet I find
Repeating in my head

Losing reasons to even try to improve my life,"As someone who lived for 21 years moving from place to place. I always were lonely and when I meet people they dissappear or hurt me. It's always I will be there for you only when it's convenient for them.

Losing people you care about is so painful it feels like I'm being stabbed with a knife over and over. 

When WHEN is my turn to be the happy one? When can I find someone to love me for me?
When am I enough? I try and try. Tired or not. I move forward. Still lives takes more then it gives and what it takes can't be recovered. 

My old depression creeps back up. I FEEL IT ON MY BACK. I thought it was over but when life gives me another hit it grows. Suicidal thoughts from long ago came lately. I got scared of them myself.",1
Belief in God,"Hi all,

I used to be a strong believer of God. Then I entertained the doubts which grew day by day until very little of my belief has remained.

With that, my mental well-being went downhill as my anxiety was through the roof.

I've lost some of the ideas that used to make life so much easier such as 
-Everything happens for a reason.
-God has chosen what's best for me.
-I have a connection with a higher power and he'll take care of me.
-I have a high purpose in life.

Ever since my faith has weakened, I've become much more dependent on people for emotional support. I've become more needy whereas all I used to need was a quick prayer to make my worries go away and be content and hopeful.",1

Look, I clearly appear miserable to people, but can't a lady just appear in my life and accept that thats just apart of who I am? Why do people say that nobody will love you unless you love yourself first, like I'm a cancer unless I'm super outwordly positive all the time?

I don't even feel like I'm worth anything anymore, i feel like I'm not enough and I'll never be enough for anyone. I don't understand what I did wrong for that to happen. I've been crying for hours now and i don't even feel like eating or getting out of bed anymore. I was just starting to get a brighter outlook but now I'm back to 0. I don't even want to be here anymore. He was pretty much keeping me alive. I genuinely feel like anyone would be so much better without me now since I'm so pathetic and i can't even keep a guy interested.

I’m depressed. My friends try to help - but they don’t understand.,"Let me start off by saying, I am in no way bashing my friends nor am I not recognising that they are just trying to be kind, but it doesn’t help. 
My life feels like a pit of nothingness, always. I have little moments of happiness but then it’s just back to my bland baseline, or worse. And right now, I am deep into the ‘worse’ category. I’m barely functioning and avoiding social interactions and when I do talk to someone it feels like I am watching myself in a simulation selecting the correct responses until the interaction ends. 

I have very few friends. I have never fully trusted anyone, even though I know deep down I should trust these people. I always just end up saying ‘oh ya I’m okay, just a rough patch’. When inside, I feel like I’m dead. I have no family, apart from my mum who is preoccupied with her other family in another country. I’m not in a relationship, no where even close, I feel entirely unlovable because I have nothing to offer from my empty soul.
Loneliness literally courses through my veins, there are times when I will be sobbing and I feel actual aching pain in my fingertips and body from lack of physical touch or companionship. I grew up surrounded by abusive men, my grandfather, father and step dad. But because we were wealthy, when I acted out it was ‘oh she’s just spoilt not getting her own way’ because I had all the material things I could want, when I was literally begging for help, having anxiety attacks, without even knowing it. I was never protected or nurtured and that theme has continued in my life. 

Where my friends come into it: I’m 27, had a job that I was actually thriving at for the first time in my entire life. In fact, when I was at work it was the only time I have ever felt competent or proud of myself in anyway. I met some great people during that time, and am still in touch with them regularly. They know that I get ‘down’ sometimes, and we do try to talk about it. Everything they express is with the best of intentions, you know, ‘it will get better’ and ‘something good will come along’. I always have, and always will support them because I am well aware that people from perfect scenarios get down sometimes too. They grew up differently to me, and I don’t want to explain my past and either have it 1. Traumatise them or 2. Feel that I am now a burden and their responsibility. 

I simply don’t know how to communicate the sort of things that happened to me in the past that now dictate my emotions and slumps into depression, especially considering that they come from very loving households with a lot of support. I don’t want to be pitied, or tiptoed around, if they find out. I also don’t know how to accept support and feel like I am a huge drain on my friends energy when I am in this down stage. 
If anyone has navigated this, please help me. I want to be open, but I don’t want to be that fucked up friend in the group, you know?",1
The thought of ending it all soon gives me a sense of peace and relief.,"I’ve had depression for how many times and always came out of it stronger. But this time, I can’t find an escape. I tried all the things I used to do to fight my depression before but everyday it just gets heavier and heavier. Nothing works. Therapy doesn’t work. Meds doesn’t work. Going out for a walk to appreciate the little things doesn’t work. Having good friends around to listen doesn’t work. Nothing works. Everyday I literally wake up with a heavy heart and the only thing that calms me down is thinking I’d end it soon.

I also would just like to say Goodbye. You all are internet strangers but it calms me down knowing I’m sharing in a place where people understand. I wish I could be saved but I have no options left to feel better. I have loving pets too. I just feel numb. 

Goodbye and thank you so much.",1
I'm going thro attachment issues and I feel like I'm gonna die,"So I'm 17y I've witnessed some things when I was young that I wasn't supposed to witness (such as a my parents abu$ing eachother)..I also didn't have a family like a cousin or a grandma because we don't talk to them.

When I was 14y I've seen my parents fighting in front of my face and I couldn't handle it so I went into a panic attack so I still have this panic attack from a time to time and sometimes without any reason!!.

So when I turned 17y exactly I start getting attached to any guy I talk to also girls! For example when I'm talking to a guy i just met and he's kind to me i tell myself omg I'm gonna be with him or I'm gonna marry him and I get attached to him so fast but when I meet someone else who's more kind to me i forget about the other person and I get attached to the second person and it's going like that...

After I talk to that person and they start ignoring I start crying and sometimes I feel depressed for three days or smth...sometimes I want to kms so baaad cos I always beg for attention or dying to find someone who can take care of me idk why I wanna be loved so bad!!!!! Even tho I do love myself is just I feel like with a strange feeling when someone really take care of me and idk whyy! But I love that feeling it's like heaven so I keep looking for attention...I'm starving for LOVE sometimes I think I'm crazy but I just need a caring person so I get attached to people so fast thinking that they're going to give the love that I'm dreaming about but I'm always wrong.

Tbh I think this is all because of my childhood trauma!! Or like my parents didn't loved enough.

So I need some tips or idk like how can I get rid of attachment and this kinda of stuff because they're affecting my mental health.",1

Not that I don’t want to “be happy”, but I genuinely do not believe that is possible, anymore. My life has gone too far wrong. I’ve made too many life-destroying mistakes. I genuinely don’t have anything left to give.

So yeah, I don’t want to “get better”, if all “better” means is being a lonely weirdo with no real friends, a decade behind most people my age, with fuck-all, just playing constant catch-up for the next decade, while my body deteriorates.

I would rather simply *not be here*. And that’s not new, or “impulsive”, or something I haven’t considered extensively.

I genuinely don’t expect to still be around, in a month’s time, and I’m more than happy with that. Frankly, it’s all I have left. All I want is for it to be done.",1
I don’t “want” anything?,"After lamenting about my lack of drive to a friend for a bit too long, they just plainly asked me, “Well what is it that you actually want?”

It stumped me. 

I don’t really “want” anything. I avoid discomfort, try to extend time in bed as long as possible, use my phone for 14 hours a day, etc. But it’s not really that I want to do those things, they are just reflexive. I’m just in so much pain and I’m so exhausted I need to retreat - constantly. 

Do I want friends? Hobbies? A job that I love? 

I mean of course I do in theory, in concept. When I actually imagine having those things, or attempt to conjure some kind of spark of interest, there’s nothing there. It’s just a dark, cold, cavernous pit in my chest. In THOSE moments I can definitely tell you what I want - I want to go to sleep. 

I have no vision of my future. I barely make it out of bed each morning. I keep putting one foot in front of the other, but sometimes I need to ask, “Why?” and the silence is crippling, I have no response. 

Does anyone have any advice? How do you feel connected with your desires again? What do I do?

Thanks for listening.",1

POSITIVITY IS GOAL TO WINNING...,"In any given moment, we have two choices: to step forward into growth, or step backwards into safety. Stepping backwards may make us feel better in the short term, but stepping forwards will undoubtedly make us feel better in the long term.... Listen to positive people and ignore negative ones. After all, people who doubt, judge and disrespect you are not worth your energy.Healing is a process, not an event. Give it time. Good things happen to those who never give up.Mental illness is NOT a life sentence.
Don’t be upset or caught up with things or people you cannot change. Instead, move on, let go, and concentrate on what you can change.
When your depression tells you that it’s impossible to be free of it, it is LYING! Today, do one little thing to take better care of yourself. Then, do it again tomorrow",1
Family and friends don't care,"Don't you just love it when you try and open up about how sad you're feeling inside and then your family member's response is, ""stop feeling sorry yourself."" Awesome, guess I'll just go kill myself now. Thanks! Glad I have no one to talk to.",1
I just wanna scream. How does one adult?,"Fitting that it’s mental health month cause mine is going down the drain… 

28 yo female. I have a lot going for me. I have a healthy relationship, a chill dog, I just finished my second semester of college (better late than never, right?) but I’m really really struggling. 

I’m fortunate in that I don’t go through every day feeling sad. I’ll have episodes of sadness but they’re short-lived. I don’t feel overwhelming happy but content, I guess. My main issue is just a lack of motivation particularly when it comes to work. I need to find a new job because every time I get a job, I don’t want to go into work. I think of those 8 hours and what else I could be doing like sitting on my ass watching tv or smoking weed so I’ll choose to do that stuff instead of working so I’m not making any money and I just don’t care. Someone on Reddit mentioned this could be a depression symptom. Anybody else experience this?

I love my partner but he does not understand mental health so while he feels bad for me, he does not offer productive advice and I just end up keeping everything to myself.

This month sucks. I had finals, I have to find a new job, I’m going on a 5 day trip where my social meter is going to be at capacity and I have to leave my dog. 

Just curious if anybody else deals with “laziness”… and if there’s any advice on how to have more discipline.",1
"Going to do an intensive outpatient program, terrified about putting in my leave of absence at work","My mental health has gotten severe enough that my psych referred me to an intensive outpatient program, which will require me to put in for FMLA at work. I may also need a short inpatient stay. I’m terrified to do say I need to take a leave of absence, as there are several deadlines coming up and a coworker just left, so I feel guilty about having to take leave. I am also terrified of getting fired. I know they can’t fire me for taking FMLA, but I’m afraid they’ll look at how poor quality my work has been (due to being nearly su*c*dal) and fire me and then I’ll have no job, no insurance, no chance of treatment. 

I’m just scared and feel guilty. I know I need this treatment or I will not be able to work at all. But I am so terrified of asking for the leave and giving the paperwork to HR.",1
confused and tired,"I've been going to therapy since the past few months, and it's lowkey working fortunately. But I still feel a tad empty and hollow. Things seldom excite me or make me feel actually happy. It's just me who's putting all these conscious efforts to keep myself sane and happy and it's tiring. It was never like this before, happiness was natural and quick to come and never felt like a chore. The more I delve deep into myself and my life the more I realise that life is indeed pointless and I struggle to find meaning in any of the stuff I try to work towards. Logic seems to fail when I'm overpowered by my emotions. I've got a life ahead of me but these feelings of hopelessness haunt me. I'm struggling to find out what's actually causing me this and how did my perspective on life change so quick. I don't know where life is heading.",1

I won't succeed in school or life or anything basically.,"Hi

I 15(M) won't succeed in life. You probably when you read this think, ""how can this guy be so sure about that he won't succeed in anything?""

I'm so sure in that, because I don't do anything all day have to repeat a year in school. I don't have any good friends and just am suffering.

I don't do anything which helps me. My mother tells me, how much I ruined her life. I can't even shower consistently so, how should I manage to have a successful life? I just simply can't. 

I guess many people will say that ""I shouldn't compare myself, everyone goes at a different pace."" I guess everyone goes at a different pace but for me comparing is essential. Because through comparing I see how much I failed.

My stepdad pushed once pushed me down ths stairs because I didn't shower, which is understandable. Also I told psychologist and staff in my mental hospital, which i'm in that my stepdad did that and they said it wasn't severe enough for an intervention.

I'm a failure. I have to repeat a year and everything. I also don't deserve anything in the world other better and more kinder people deserve all the success.

Sorry I won't succeed.",1

Most people say he’s being a dick because I’m the mother of his kids. One adult daughter doesn’t send a card. Texts mid day with a happy Mother’s Day as a last minute thought. The other will try and make the day niceish. She’s mad at her father. He’s watching tv. We have no plans. I’m wallowing in my own self pity with is pathetic. Decades of this feeling.

When I told you, you didn’t try to help me. You never tried, and still haven’t. You act like I’m not even depressed, like I don’t need help. And you tell me I never do anything when I’m trying my best to be good. Anyways, basically I almost blew my head off, and I regret it. And my gf never talks about it, or tried to help.

But then i realized that even if I do eventually earn enough to be safe and comfortable, even if I meet an amazing s/o, even if I find a job I'm so happy at it doesn't feel like working, I don't think it'll fix it. The world is cruel and sick. Good people are taken advantage of, children are stolen and heinous crimes are committed every day. People kick dogs and throw kittens in lakes. Geniuses and artists and philosophers never get to become such things because they're too focused on finding food or shelter while we throw out enough food everyday to feed the whole world twice. While thousands of houses lay abandoned. I can't fix that which has been so deeply carved into our society. I can't stop evil, or help enough people to make this world worth living in. These crimes against humanity feel like crimes against me. How can anyone be truly happy with this knowledge? How can I relax while so many suffer. How can this ever be fixed? I think I'm doomed to a life of misery, and then guilt, because there is an unlimited number of people who have it worse than the last. I'm starting to think this planet isn't worth saving.

Stress,"Hello again Reddit,
Not really sure why I’m doing this but it helps to just type things out. I’m still super stressed with college (UK) 

I (18M) have exams incredibly soon and I’m super stressed about failing and going no where in life. I’m worried about disappointing everyone I know and fucking up my life. I have no ambition I just want a decent paying job when I’m older, the issue is I can’t be a labourer, I struggle with arthritis and dyspraxia that makes it hard to do physically demanding tasks.

I’m scared and I can’t talk to my friends about it as they all are unavailable. College is providing ok help but I’m still in a really bad spot, but since I’m not suicidal there’s little urgency.

Thank you for reading, kinda just want a conversation right now to be honest",1
I just think I hit a new low for myself...,"... And before I eat everything up or have no idea how to describe it to my boyfriend when he comes home in an hour or two I'd decided to write it down here. 

I'm 21 F, had to stop going to the therapist because they're just for kids and teenager and that ends with 21, at least here.

I've been on sick leave since October last year (because of my depression worsening) and left my apprenticeship in March, hoping that I'd do alot better with A) not being bound to a place anymore that hurts me mentally (software developing in an office with a huge lack of support from the trainer due to there being 5 for 80 apprentices) B) I don't have the stress from being on sick leave and C) I could make a change in my path and go for a more creative job with physical work like woodworking. 

I am not doing better, I'm not sure what I just had, but I was just crying, at least close to hyperventilating, stressed and throwing up. I feel like I'm getting suicidal again, but at the same time don't as I don't want to die, just need a break maybe... I feel trapped... Every day it feels like it's getting worse. 

My health insurance is forcing me to go to rehab(which I now see more as a chance to get better that I'm grateful for), the paperwork is quite alot and annoying but I got people that can help me. I just somehow need to get there. I'll probably try to find a new therapist, but I have problems with phone calls (one of the reasons I didn't call an emergency Hotline), but the social workers at the place I have to go to due to me not working currently offered to help with that aswell. 

I just stepped into a way too cold shower to distract myself enough so I can start to make myself busy, collected my favorite plushies and blanket, made myself comfortable with chocolate a tea and something normal to drink as I realized that I didn't drink for the last 5 hours and put on one of those dancing vegetables sensory videos to try and calm myself a little before playing a cozy game until my boyfriend comes home... Hopefully with food... I don't have the strength to make anything to eat right now... 

There's many more things going on, stuff I can't do that also just stress me even more.

Writing this down made me feel a bit better, so thanks for reading.",1
Going nowhere in life,"So long story short, in the last few years my life has been going downhill.

Pissed my mother off on Mother’s Day,All day I haven’t been in a mood. I’m at an all time low with being depressed and I really don’t feel like being around anyone. I went out last night with a friend and he met this girl. I’m really happy for him. But it sucks when no one wants anything to do with me. I sat there alone in the middle of this bar for at least a half hour. I’ve asked people to hangout in the past and I’ve been shrugged off by everyone. He was the only person I hangout with now. And I heard today they’re hitting it off great. Again I’m happy for him. But I’m tired of the pressure of everyone asking me about a girlfriend.

Am I actually depressed?,"I've always wished I was never born, and it has been a persistent thought throughout my life. I commonly joke about offing myself because I actually do, except I'm too much of a coward to do so. Quite frankly, I'm in a state where I don't know what I'm feeling now; at times, life seems relatively okay and I feel happy? But once I'm alone in my room, I just want to cry. But I don't know if I'm actually depressed/suicidal or is it just my hormones acting up. 

I'm only asking this because I know I'll never be able to see a therapist and most of my friends, despite being concerned, probably think I'm joking half the time. I do try my best not to appear to mentally depressed (though I'm failing these days).",1

Vent or smth but id like support no one needs to though,"TW FOR self harm  / suicide

I've been doing well for like 6 months and now I'm not

I completely relapsed on self harm on Friday 

I feel bad because I told a friend and they made me let them clean it 

They were great I just feel bad that they care 

I feel bad if someone gives me sympathy for my emotions- I feel so fucking guilty I feel like no one should be around me but if I stop talking to people they will lose the positive person past self from like a week ago 

I feel like I am a bad person rn and I don't have a good reason but that I let someone care about me because my mental health is getting worse again

I am depressed again but now I keep getting a thought that says ""I'm gonna kill myself"" whenever I think about mysf or past actions even if they weren't bad

I see my cat and I wanna cry cuz I didn't cuddle enough with her this morning then I think about killing myself and then I remember my cat would permanently lose me and I feel sad and like a bad person

This constant thought to KMS is new idk what to do when it happens it usually goes like this

*I think about myself or think about life*
""I'll just KMS"" or now ""I will kill myself"" or something along those lies then
""Uuhhh no I don't wanna do that""
""Why not you don't matter"" smth like that then
""Cuz people will care""
And then I have an internal panick cuz I kinda don't disagree with either sides and it's becoming harder to believe the staying alive side

Like one thing that has been consistent is I get super depressed but never suicidal, I never want to KMS but idk if that's true anymore this feels like how I thought about self harm before I started but also I don't wanna be. Dramatic my best friend lost their childhood friend to suicide and they are suicidal it's a serious thing but idfk I have school tomorrow I can't wear shorts I'm fucking not ok but I should be im so sick of this BS wtf

"I'm not living, I'm just killing time.","I don't know if anyone sees this or will comment, but I'll give it my best shot.

I am 22 years old, and believe it or not, I have been suffering from depression for almost a decade.

I have nothing genuine,no friends or purpose to go on with life,I have had ADHD since I was 2 years old and major depression with anxiety diagnosed about 3 years ago,although in reality,it has been going on for quite some time.

I feel so exhausted, so angry and so lost, that I don't even plan to be in the future. I feel like hurting people, even though I know it's not right. If I knew today that I would never wake up again after sleeping in my bed, I wouldn't mind ..... Yes, I would be afraid, but it would give me the peace I so longed for.

The only reason I haven't taken my own life is because of the harm I might cause my family.

Sometimes I wonder if teachers,classmates or people who barely knew me today wonder where I am,what I'm doing,or if I moved on as that kid who breaks out of the mold and doesn't like to be like everyone else....


But here I am, hoping somehow that things will work out, if I can have something genuine; love, friends, a life that makes me feel that living is good.",1

I am about to quit. I am just tired,"What is the point on life for some of us?
I am almost 25 (M), I started working and studying when I finished school with 16. 
I have been a honest person, with values, hard worker all the time, (I even worked so hard for couple seasons that ended up in the hospital for burn out). And still, I am nowhere in life.
I grew up in South America in a poor country, I was hungry of success of course, to help my family, to help my parents when they can not work anymore, to help my little sister to study the career that she wants. Emigrated to Europe, and still. I am just an average Joe, with a little. bit of money saved, working for a big company, with a normal boring life.
I did my military service and was very good at it, I was one of the most strong ones and intelligent in my unit, because I developed good leadership and other habilities and workout a lot too, motivating some people around me. But that does not help me at all, like, in this world it seems you just have to be a nerd on Software development or some thing like that , to be able to succeed financially and provide for your family and have a great life.

And now, I am living in Europe, in a country where its raining and snowing most of the time of the year, but with good and stable economy. Just depressed, alone, with my boring life. (When I could be on the Caribbean with sime friends if I just decided to take the other short way of making a living). 
 
I have some friends here in Europe that I made, but they just care about girls and partys and alcohol. Thay had a really easy and really quiet life, so it is difficult for me to really comnect with them, and I try sometimes to explain how I feel but they just say that their country is to perfect to be feeling like that. 
 I started to join some.sports clubs, to workout with people, but they dont put the work in, it is like people forgot what is like to push yourself sometimes. 
Everything around is just, average life, conversations without meanings, drinking alcohol, planning where to go on your 2 weeks trip vacation if you are lucky to recieve a bonus.

I just want to end my life, I have not done it because I know how much pain will be for my family, and they dont deserve that, and I have my two little brothers who look up to me and I just want to make them proud. But at this point I dont see what I have to do in order to succeed in this world.
Should I stay here and be miserable but stable? Should I move to other place where the climate would be better and I can enjoy life a little bit more even when I make less money? 

What career should I take? I was already in the military but it is not like USA where you can actually get deployed or something, so I am just a reserve soldier. I though about police academy but this country is so peacefull that it is just boring for me to be one. I though fire fighter but you can just be on a side, there is no like full time career.

I dont know if I should move to somewhere where I can have the Sea close and becoming a diving instructor or something like that interesting.

How do people succeed with 25 or 30. I dont get it, I mean, I have friends that are doing really good in life, they had wealthy parents and now have their businesses and everything, and I am happy for them, really. They are making money living a great life. 
I knew for me, was going to be a little bit harder because my situation is different. But bro, I have been working my ass off the last almost 10 years and I am still a loser. 

I think some of us would never be able to taste what been wealthy or having enough money to not worry about it is. 
I feel there is.people.like me who learns really quick and are intelligent, but not able to go and study 7years at university following a system. 
I just did a 2 years career in a trade in order to be able to get out there and live life sooner, that I could learn sooner. And I have been always promoted and stuff, but is still nothing that will take you to another level.

And nowadays when you think like sidehustle, is just ecom and dropshipping, things like that. People just sealing courses and stuff.

I know my parents would have loved for me to be a doctor, lawyer, or something like that. But thats not me.

I know  this post may be confusing a little bit, maybe there is too much information on different topics, but I just dont know what to do. I am just tired of life, I do everything right everyday to be a good human and a hard worker, and it seems that its not worth it. I grew up around people stealing with the goverment and doing some dr*g dealing and things like that. And I always though  that taking the other road (the honest one) will be always better.
 I just think I am wrong, those people live better than me, because I know them.personally. and maybe they just live under their own rules, they make life how they want.

I feel everyday the temptetion to take the shortcut, and use my knoweldge in some areas to just live life by my own rules, because it seems like doing the right thing and following the rules of society is just not worth it. 

I would just like to know what you think. How did you overcome things like that? Hiw are you able to find your path and be happy? Proud about yourself? 

And please, I dont need the ""be more positive it will change"" thing. I already did see a therapist a couple times and it did not help, and is really expensive. 
I know that no one can help me better but myself, but I just dont know what to do anymore. 
Im tired of living this life, I always had the mentality that not matter what happens or the enviroment you can always succeed and bla bla. At the end I am still a loser after years of waking up thinking that anyways",1
Something oddly comforting about the thought of crashing into a big tree.,"Just me, my car, my Spotify playlist with my favourite songs.

Disappointment,"Today I felt awful and not worthy of anything and this evening that feeling went away and I was feeling better but I felt disappointment because I was feeling better, I lost the excuse for doing anything now and am expected to participate in real life.

How do you date with CHRONIC moderate to severe depression?,I am talking to specifically those with very low to zero self esteem/self confidence who has not had much success with therapy & medication. Those with passive suicidal idealization. How do you navigate dating?,1
What do I do.,"I’m 22 y/o female have never been in a relationship and sitting here right now is hard . This dude i went to a festival with and have known for 8 months we finally hung back out recently and went to a festival together. I thought it was well i started falling for him he even texted me today reassuring everything was okay and called me babe.. But then i see him post on his snap story with a girl that was from a month ago and captioned it, “mi amor”. I broke down . This always happens to me no one ever wants me and jumps right into a relationship agter talking to me. it makes me feel worthless not good enough and why am i not good enough. I don’t feel like living anymore just because i have no hope i’ve tried to stay positive for so long. But it hurts me so bad because i care way too much. I really just don’t wanna live anymore .",1
Why do I enjoy things outside my house but not in my house,"For example I went to the arcades and played on the racing machines and vr games and enjoyed it so much. Yet I own these things in my house but always feel to depressed to play them.

Nothing makes sense to me haha.

I can go cinema and enjoy movie but cant watch anything in my house to depressed.

Seems like just being in my house makes me depressed? But one cant always be out there house",1
I feel so alone,I never hear from anyone .. my parents won’t talk to unless I initiate it.. may father uses me as his punching bag and truly seems to hate me.. i try to stay to myself and not talk or complain .. I stopped crying over the times my dad verbally tears me a new asshole..,1
Zero motivation,"I run a business and in some ways it’s doing well but the stress is killing me. Managing the staff is probably the hardest thing, lack of communication, lack of initiative, and if they are sick then tough shit but if I’m not great still tough shit for me.

Logically I know I don’t have a bad life but emotionally I feel like it’s the worst ever. My past taught me that things can always get worse. But I have no desire for anything, to do anything, to feel anything, to go anywhere. Every little thing sets me off either upset and angry.

Fucking fed up.

I thought running my own business would take me out of the rat race but it feels even more endless and pointless.",1
Starting with self injury,"I've seen a lot of people with self-injury marks. I thought it's hard not only to do that to yourself, but that everyone around sees those marks afterwards.
And now I'm there, trying to resist this urge to hurt myself, and I don't know how to stop.
Do you have any advice for me?",1
Why do I always feel so tired?,"
My blood test are fine, but I’m always so tired. Is it from depression? When I’m at work I don’t feel like this but when I get back home I don’t have the energy for anything. Especially weekends. On weekends I don’t work so I’m laying on bed all day. My anxiety has spiked the last two weeks and I can’t even eat my whole meal (I never leave leftovers). Why do I feel like this?",1
Mother’s Day,"I honestly hate holidays, birthdays . Any day that you’re supposed to make someone you love feel special . I always feel so unimportant, so lonely. Someone usually hurts me. I don’t want gifts I just want someone’s time. Someone to be beside me someone to offer some form of emotional support none of that costs money. I just don’t want to feel ignored & abandoned. I suffer some depression & some days are just so hard. I’m a mother of a 10 yr old & im currently 6 months pregnant. I feel like they will be better off without me instead of seeing me break down. I love them so much & my son is the reason why I’m still alive but I’m honestly getting so tired. I feel like I’m drowning , the world is choking me I can’t breathe. No one thinks I’m worthy of pulling up. I’m just sinking.",1
Confused honestly,"I'm 16 and honestly I don't know what to do.My family used to be good enough financially a few years ago but ever since father's company shut down it has become tough.I was like 12 when the financial status began to hit but didn't get bothered too much because I knew something was wrong.Even growing up after it i didn't let me bother it cause I thought ""Nah it will get better,who cares if I don't have enough clothes or can't get the food I like it's not like this will affect me later on"".But since last year I have felt odd.I see my classmates go out and post on insta how they have fun and all with their nice clothes and the food they eat.At first it was fine since I tended to not care cause I had my games on my laptop and didn't have that much connection with others but I too wanted to have fun and have friends.Now it just eats me up a lot.My laptop's broken now so no more games and can't afford a new one or to even repair it.My parents are nice and loving and I love them the most and have no problem with them so I never say that I have a problem or anything but it's getting hard now.I have got some really important exams this year as I'm now in 10th grade and my cousin scored 95% so yes there's a bit of pressure.My cousin is really nice and motivates me a lot.He takes me out to movies and hangs out with me.Teaches me to socialise.Has a lot of friends and... I just envy him.I don't hate him I like him a lot but just... How did life just take a turn.I did think about ""no this time I'll do well in exams""But constant fights between my dad and my mom really does not help.They say not to interfere.I have a few friends but it's not a close relationship.Obviously i don't have a gf but I can't even afford one so yeah.The point is I don't even know what's the point to just survive.The only good feeling I get is just by cutting myself up with a razor blade.its not too much rn but I want to cut more big.I think 2023 is gonna be really bad for me.

Update:Had a really bad day.Might just end it now don't even wanna continue.",1
Part of me died when I was seventeen,"I met with some friends last night. I anticipated it as the highlight of my month; year even, and it was nice - I enjoyed it - although I got the feeling it was no big deal for my friends. They're functioning, busy people. I often go blank and feel emotionless with them. I'm lucky to have those few friends, they're beautiful and supportive people. I feel crushed today.

I'm 40 soon. I attempted suicide at 17 and it broke me, I think. That and a dour upbringing, and some physical illness in early adulthood.

I was so sure, when I made the decision. But some time after taking the tablets I.... changed my mind. I couldn't believe it, after being so sure. And now, after ~8 rounds of therapy over 20 years, I still can't make a single large decision and feel utterly condemned to my half-life. I'm an empty vessel. I've buried my feelings all my life and I no longer feel authentically.


If I can share anything positive it would be:
1) please don't attempt suicide, if you're thinking about it - truly confronting death permanently alters your brain chemistry. Some will recover well, some not. I'm not sure it's possible to truly confront death by simulation, and when it happens, you may change your mind halfway through. It can be very, very scary. Get help - humans aren't supposed to overcome all challenges alone.

2) therapy does help. My first ones didn't, but later I understood myself better and I kept trying, when I badly needed help. I'm at a place now where I tell my therapist everything. No secrets.",1
life is beautiful,"in late march a close friend of mine when i was (16/17) committed suicide.

the end of the month i relapsed because life started becoming to much. 
in may, days before my birthday my ex blindsided me. 
i’m pretty confident that i will fail this spring semester because i cant stay concentrated. 
all i think about is the things that transpired in the last 2 months. 
i can’t get more than 3 hours of sleep & i know i’ve lost weight because i haven’t eaten properly in a while and getting out of bed is an achievement.

Unraped,"I wake up with agonizing muscle ache listening to the wind whispering to me while giving me a strong feminine grasp. I watch as the world, no, the universe, move around and I only keep watching the gloomy streets while the wind speaks to me. The feeling of warmth is what is desired but only the coldness of the breeze comes to me. Watching my mind slowly but inevitably corrupt itself due to the humanity that surrounds me. Wishing I was unraped mentally and physically in order for my childhood to be full of glee and rather left in isolation and peace with the beautiful roses and daffodils giving me the soft touch that I keep yearning for as the cold wind finally blows the flowers sweet smell. I hold a child's hand as I sit on the rock facing my mother's grave and cry solemnly knowing I'll be there to give her a rose or two a day. For her warm spirit will finally allow me to achieve comfort with the hand of the child that I will raise, safeguarding me from the trauma that I was yielded upon.",1
Title,I can’t stand this Monday to Friday fucking 8am-6pm working shit. I just feel like I’m dead on the inside. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything on Sundays because I know what’s coming after today. I only ever enjoy Friday nights and Saturdays. I’m so over it,1
I think i have the strongest depression known by humans,Took 3 different anti depressants and so many drugs but i’m still feeling so damn sad and anxious that i can barely breath. Oh Lord i’m suffering so much…,1
How severely depressed am I?,"I can't even tell anymore.

I can't bear to shower, and only do it every 6-8 weeks (occasionally it might be 4 weeks). I wash my hair that often too.

I cannot deal with doing chores or housework. I last did a load of laundry in June 2021. Seriously.
I don't go out anywhere much and I have way too many clothes so I still have clean clothes to wear when I go out.

Around the house, I wear the same comfy clothes for months on end. I just don't care.

I only change my bed sheets every 6 months. I cannot believe people do this every week. I cannot cope with that.

I never eat in the day as I've had no appetite since 2017. I never feel hungry. I never feel empty. My stomach never rumbles or gurgles. I feel like it doesn't even exist.

I sleep all day and feel RIDICULOUSLY stressed and nauseated with anxiety if I have to get up before 1pm.

I stay up until about 4am as after 11pm is the only time I get to be alone and have quiet time to sort of relax.

I have major anhedonia and feel no pleasure, enjoyment or interest in anything I'm NOT addicted to. I sleep to avoid the chronic boredom and emptiness. And constant sense of dread and impending doom.

I brush my teeth, but I haven't gone to the dentist since 2016 and partly due to gum disease and also jaw clenching in my sleep, 4 of my teeth are loose. I can't eat properly when I do eat, but I just can't care enough (or afford) to go to the dentist to get these teeth either removed or somehow fixed.

I have not done any housework since 2018. I have a cleaner who comes every 2 weeks.

I pick at my skin. The skin around my fingernails has been wrecked since I was 4 or 5 years old. I've picked at my scalp since age 8, my top lip is ruined and I began picking that since age 15. I also began picking at both my inner ears at age 38.

I started self harming at 17 and still do it. I hate myself. I feel ugly and I repulse myself.

I never had any career ambitions or anything I wanted to do. Nothing has ever given me a sense of achievement, accomplishment, pride, fulfilment or satisfaction. At all. Ever. I don't even know what that feels like.

I have no friends apart from old friends who live in a different state and I haven't seen in over 3 years. I have no local friends, and nor do I particularly want to. I don't have the interest or energy.

A few times a week I wonder how I would kill myself. I can't do it because I won't do that to my parents, but otherwise, I honestly don't know.

I have been like this consistently for years. Some symptoms have been 4-6 years. Others 40 years. Most about 10 years.

I've been on 8 different antidepressants over the last 10 years, a mood stabiliser, an antipsychotic, a stimulant, and various benzos. Nothing has helped, except for the benzos.

I've been in therapy on and off since 2018. Nothing helps. Not CBT, DBT, EMDR or psychodynamic therapy. Just...nothing.

To me, this is my ""normal"", but I am not living. Only existing. Barely.",1

Circumstantial Depression - will my dr increase my meds,"I’m curious if anyone will know this but I’ve been having a lot of issues in my personal life. I go to a psychiatrist for medication management and have a separate therapist. My meds before everything went to shit were working but now with the circumstances changing and getting worse, will she change my meds or increase them?

It's past 10 currently, I'm supposed to fall asleep by now but these stupid meds don't work at times. 
I hate having to wake up everyday. My SH cuts make me want to do it more and more, wanting to isolate myself, but I can't afford to do either of those for now. 
I am so fucking exhausted. A part of me wants kill myself and another part of me doesn't want me dead.",1
Pulling Yourself Out of the Fog,"Hello, I have had some pretty severe depression for as long as I can remember. I have severe clinical depression (officially diagnosed in 2012). I have spent years trying to work through my depression with some success. Unfortunately it's been hitting me really hard lately. 


 Recently I was laid off from a job I really liked. That sent me into a spiral because I thought I was finally going somewhere with my life. I have a new job now, and the thought of going to work tomorrow is really weighing down on me. I feel like I am being sucked into a void that I will never return from. It's a 9-5 desk job and those jobs have always made my depression worse. How do you work through these really low moments? Thanks in advance.",1
Having a hard time finding happiness,"Went on vacation this week and I don’t know what to feel. I had a decent time, even had some good moments, and then a lot of feeling empty and lost. 

My wife is nice and I love her, but she doesn’t seem to like me very much. She loves me, just doesn’t feel like she likes me.

Sometimes I feel miserable for no reason. I think I hide it well, but it’s been a rough year or so. I’m really a mental wreck but no one knows.",1
I don’t know how to go on also if I have a good life,"Hi, I don’t know how to continue with my life. 
A bit of contest here. 
I’m 21f and I was diagnosed with depression in the last months by my therapist. I always had depressing thoughts during my life and also some suicidal ones but I’ve never ever done anything in the concrete, I think I was too scared (just one time I tried to take a lot of meds together but I stopped and asked for help). 
I never considered myself ill, nor everyone around me. I have the perfect family and I live in a privileged contest, middle class kind (not rich but I always had what I wanted). Others think I’m a pretty girl, skinny and very gifted in social contests, outgoing, always first in my classes with fantastic grades, not very good at sports but it’s not important. I’m very empathetic and always had some kind of “perception of the deepness” around me, and my therapist says it’s a gift. I write, sing, and have too many hobbies including gaming, reading, painting and so on. I’m the gifted kid of the extended family and the good girl type, that did something rebel only one or two times. Now I study history and work as an emergency rescuer. I have tons of friends in real life and also online. I wanna be a writer.
I have the perfect life, I’m convinced that I’m so lucky and I just don’t understand why I am … I am depressed. I know I had problems in my growing. I was the loser, always bullied by everyone and against me there was intellectual and actual violence. I had to be always perfect because of my parents and my family, I am the first of the grandchildrens and so I’m the role model. At 19 I had a toxic relationship that leaved me with the fear of love and also a little stomach sindrome caused by anxiety, but never less, I didn’t have a real trauma. A REAL one like a bad family or rape or something like that. I always been dark and sad all my life and i know that when I was a child I was so happy and a little overwhelming so others will call me “strange” or “freak” but I was so innocent and wanted the friendship of all of them. (I want to return to be that happy, like a child.)but this was never something like real real trauma.
Now I’m here, trapped in my bed every time I return from work. When I am at work I am someone that is happy and I help others and fight in very difficult situation but when i return home I just turn off. The worse thing it’s that I’m numb every time, also when I am happy at work. I worsened in the last weeks and I’m trying to don’t see my friends and it’s working. I have a deadline for my university studies soon and I didn’t study. I feel useless and I hate so much myself. I hate the way I look, the way I act, the way I think and the way I am. I hate every inch of my being in this world. I want to see my self being wrong and fall into the deep end. I love my friends and I will do anything for them, they deserve the world and I want to cancel myself for them. Right now I have only two girl friends that I try to be in contact with but three days ago I messed up over a very stupid thing because I panicked and with my anxiety I didn’t responded to them. Part of me don’t want to lose them but the other part knows I want to be alone cause I think I deserve to suffer, I deserve cause I’m an horrible person. I feel like an impostor that it’s acting all her life and everyone just sees the good things while I’m so horrible and selfish. My therapist it’s trying to convince me that it’s all in my head but I don’t believe her. I sincerely think I am a freak, a bad person, a sociopath of some kind. I don’t deserve the life I have and had , I don’t now why I had such a good childhood and I will happily switch it with someone more worth of my family and the ppl I have around me. I don’t deserve anything. Im wrong. And now my two bff are so angry with me, I tried to explain them I panicked and I wanted to write to them, not ignore them, but I didn’t have the courage because im so scared of the anger of others. If they go away how will I do? It will be the end? I’m not lucid, idk what is happening in me or around me I just wanna sleep all the time. I try to seek help from my Parents but they are convinced it’s the period cause it’s spring and everyone it’s a little sad and tired and I said to them that I have depression but everyone it’s a little depressed don’t you think? I don’t know what am I doing and I don’t know how I will live a peaceful life if it will be always like this. I feel so alone and if I try to explain I just seems to victimise myself so the others Will be around me. Am I doing it? I don’t know anymore. 
I don’t want to un live myself but I don’t want to live also right now. How can I go on? 
I hate myself so much cause I just created problems when my life it’s perfect. I’m such a loser, a drama queen, idk, just a fucking pathetic self-centred girl with a god complex i think 
I don’t want to call my therapist, I’m scared
I’m always so scared 
How can I do
I just can write this on the internet to totals strangers 
I know I’m pathetic sorry 
Sorry for my existence",1
My life has gone to shit but I’ve been working out,"At the end of my ropes. About to lose my job, my apartment, trust in family, and I feel like I’m too old to be starting over. But Ive been going to the gym this last 2 months and I noticed some great results. Now im depressed and kinda built. Which was a funny feeling last night during my existential crisis. It’s a weird feeling to look in the mirror and see a piece of shit with muscles this time though lol",1
I hope I die soon,"I'm in a weird position with my ex where we both love each other but now is not the best time for trying again.  I don't even know if she wants to try again. I love her a lot and it hurts. The uncertainty over the future is painful. 

 On top of that, I have exams for a month in 12 days. I have an university offer to meet. I need to meet it or else I will disappoint myself and everyone else. Honestly,  I don't want to deal with this stress anymore.  

I know deep down romantically it's not gonna work out.  Academically,  I am about to fail the hardest in the most important exams of my life. I can't relax or do anything for myself.  I have no self respect for myself and nothing but regrets. Offing myself is so much more relaxing.  

I wish I was an orphan, so I could kill myself.  Parents will hurt the most. Because of them, I can't do it yet. I hope often that I die in an accident . That way they won't be in too much pain.",1
I have never been loved.,"I realized something.

I grew up with almost no love around me. That's why I don't know how to love someone or even myself. I can't give something to myself that no one has given to me. It hurts. Until now, I don't get that treatment (except from my bf sometimes). This is probably the reason why I always find a reason to hate myself because I have no one who reminds me that I deserve to be loved. I almost broke up with my bf again. But I feel like if I do that, I'll lose everything. He's the only person in the world who has been affectionate to me. I don't know anywhere else to find love. I long for human connection but because I've been alone for so long, sometimes, I just want to forget everyone I know and disappear in the forest.",1
Motivation decreasing,"Hye everyone. Hope you guys are well.  

I wanted some advice from some mature people. So here is my story:

In 2022 July I completed my graduation and got a job too. So a 20 years long struggle of my mother came to an end. During this time I also went through bad patches(depression and shame). But during the 4 year degree I didn't have time to get depressed since I got so busy in the excessive workload. After 2022 July, I started feeling lonely. Like it was very hard. But few months back I got a new roommate. He is a great company. 

Now out of no where when my brain realized that there is nothing bad in the present, lets bring back the bad memories of the past to ruin the present. Past memories are jumping in again and again which triggers my shame. So the incident(9 years old) which triggers my shame is linked with my mother and sister. The both don't even remember that incident or even if remember it, they are not bothered, neither they ever reminded me. They both love me a lot.But they both don't know that I am still carrying it. Also another thing is the thought that I am gonna die at the end. So why work so hard? 

So currently these two things are killing my motivation to study and do other productive stuff. I have wasted 2 weekends. 2 days ago I went to a therapist and he has prescribed escitalopram(10 mg) to me. However, I don't have any generic anxiety symptoms or suicidal thoughts. 

I am 26 and I think I should be fearless and on attack mode currently and try to live these years with full excitement and enthusiasm. But I don't know why my brain is teasing me.",1
"How I felt in my whole life basically, sorry for being cringey.","There’re tons of flowers in the garden, including you. You’re somehow different than them, not better nor worse, just different. 

You try to get along with them and be like them, but deep down you know you’ll never be able to assimilate and feel, experience joy and the same advantages of being a flower like them. You’re a flower as well, not better nor worse, but still you start to feel like weed, and that’s how the other flowers are starting to treat you as well, every mistake you make, every good intention you have, will be regarded as either a diabolical goal, self-pity or non-significant. 

They perceive you as a burden in the garden who only wants attention and chaos, they even make fun of you or judge you,while not even getting to know you, but all you really want is just acceptance and love. You keep wondering what’s wrong with you and your actions. You keep punishing yourself, feel guilty and ungrateful because the soil you’re in is proper, you get enough water, sunshine while you’re well aware that there’re flowers without any of these, but you just keep asking yourself: “Why can’t I be and live like the other flowers?” 

Self-hatred takes a toll on you, until you eventually withers, but just before that, you realise that’s the best thing that could ever happen to you, you never had a chance, you were taking away resources from the other flowers while you were just suffering and in constant pain, and as the saying goes: “It’s better to burn out than fade away”. None of the identical looking flowers’ll notice you’re gone and none of them’ll miss you, they never even wanted you in the first place.",1
Do any one have any idea how to control your thoughts.,"I’m not talking in the sense of flow of thoughts, but just negative one’s. Like I know how positive affirmations and vibing at a good frequency can change my life, everything can be perfect if I just stick to the positive and optimistic side. Knowing all of it, but the negative thoughts in my mind over power those practical valid positive points and make me worry for no reason.
Like I know if I’ll study and get good grades I’ll be able to do that I want, I have a proper plan. But rather than solving the problem by just studying at the moment I like to create a more intense futuristic problem to cry about.
This pattern of thinking is so frustrating that sometimes I have to hit myself to get in the senses, but I don’t want to abuse myself like this.",1
Anxiety and depression with my best pals,"I had a falling out with 2 of my childhood friends a few years back, one of which is my ex girlfriend. As of the last 3-4 weeks, we’ve all made up and have been talking/hanging out again.

We broke up YEARS ago and I’ve gotten over that and have seen her multiple times since then. I don’t know if this is my brain missing something nostalgic or why I’m feeling so anxious. The entire time I didn’t talk to them, all I wanted was to make up with them and for everything to be good and I still feel that way, I just can’t handle feeling like this and I don’t know why. I really don’t want to pursue any type of romantic relationship with her and I want to be able ti hangout with my friends without feeling anxiety and sensory overload every 2 seconds, any advice?",1

I’m just a loser,"I am 20 (m) and my depression is at an all time high. On November 1st 2022 I quit my job at Walmart for an opportunity to leave state and go live with my grandfather in Mississippi. I had only met him once in my life after my father had passed. He wanted to get to know me and wanted me to stay with him. I live with my mother and before I quit I had lashed out at her a couple times (yes it was stupid and I highly regret it) I lashed out at her because I was just so angry where I was at in life. Living in this stupid town where there’s nothing for me and working at Walmart which now that I look back was the only thing I had going for myself. I didn’t have a car and was just frustrated with everything. I blamed her for not helping me enough, she didn’t teach me how to drive and I didn’t have a car and most of all for moving us to the town. I did apologize to her but my mom was listening to what I was saying and contacted my grandmother. So long story short I suppose my grandmother contacted my grandfather and he offered me an opportunity to come live with him. He said he had land and stuff and he’d teach me how to drive and everything plus it was a change of scenery. So I thought yea I’ll take this opportunity. I quit and my aunt was supposed to get me but let’s just say me leaving never came into fruition. Also found out my grandfather is very negative very very negative and he pissed me off so I don’t even want him in my life anymore. November wasn’t really that bad since I got my last check from Walmart and had money. In December I had a fight with my stepfather because he was drunk and threw my mothers phone so I confronted him about it and told him to get the fuck out. He told me “you don’t even do anything” and yes he was drunk but that statement is very true because at the time I was waiting on something that just didn’t happen. We moved past that and now on to 2023 this is easily the worst year of my life since 2010 when my father passed. Every job I’ve applied for I either don’t get or I get stood up. I’ve applied to Kroger, the local hospital, a car wash, sherwin Williams, a machine operator, lowes, planet fitness, big lots, super 1 and I haven’t gotten a single offer. I’m damn near going broke and I feel pathetic. I feel like my father is looking down on me with disappointment. I can’t be happy with my current situation, everyone is getting to their goals and mines just came to an halt. It’s my fault, everything. The one good thing I had going for myself I fucked it up and that was Walmart. As shitty as Walmart is, I may have to go back there. No one really talks about how being unemployed fucks you up mentally. Feeling like you’re nothing and and embarrassment. I feel like I’m not good enough and I’m still just trying to hold on but this darkness seems eternal. I know my parents think I’m an embarrassment. The truth literally came out of my step fathers drunk ass mouth. They probably think I’m a lazy bum who sits on his ass all day. I’ve been struggling and I’m just about ready to give up.

How can I help?,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub but I wasn't sure where else it would fit.

A friend of mine is suffering from depression, she is currently seeing a psychiatrist and not having much luck with medication. I message about once a month - I've previously asked and she said this is okay - I am worried but I try to keep that out of the messages as I don't won't her feeling guilty about me worrying - I normally keep the messages to ""how are you"", ""just checking in"" etc.

I recently just quit my job that I felt miserable at, hoping it would make me feel better to get a new one. I still find myself in tears. the weird part is that I'm not even sad. I just feel numb. Like my chest is empty. I'm desperate to get help. I'm afraid to keep reaching for my boyfriend I'm scared he thinks I'm just doing it for his attention, and it's not his responsibility to manage my emotions.

I sometimes wonder if therapy would help, but being that I've been in it most of my teenage years and it never helped then, although I was told to keep quiet about home life in fear that they would take me away from my guardians. It's also an issue financially for me to even start therapy. 

I just really don't like who I am, I act on impulses often, I have full on break downs, I have no close friends. I struggle to even form sentences its just like a running dialog of negativity. I try to do things that might make me happy and can only focus for a few minutes until the numb feeling over takes me again and forces me to just curl up in bed and replay every time I've been a shitty person.",1

Maybe it's because of the depression I can't practice enough to be good at anything, and I know this will never change. I'm closer to 30 than 20 now, I am a complete failure and disaster in everything I do.

And it feels like SO many people out there can do it. Just look at how many bands exists out there. Why can't I sing or play like any of them, despite constantly playing guitar and singing?

vent post,"hey, 17m, just want to get some things off my chest. advice is appreciated but not required - even a comment to say you understand is enough.

 ive been depressed for years but rn i feel overwhlemed. im in my final year of school and i have exams in the next months. i'm not very worried about my grades because i can do well, but the homework and study i am required to do is exhausting.

 i have no plans for my future because A) the only hobbies i have is art, english and poetry & B) I haven't sat down with my parents and asked for their help. Every time over the last year i've asked my mother for advice on what to do next year she hasn't given me anything. And any time there was a college/uni open day, or anything, she wouldn't go with me. I feel like my parents don't care about my future. and it's painful because i see my friends and their parents give them guidance on where to go in life, and they are supportive of them and boost their ambition, but with me when i say i want to do a course in english or something my mother doesn't approve because it doesnt give me a qualification. 

my dad is a drunk. he came home an hour ago after using going to church as an excuse for drinking. i would rather my mother just left him and everyone would be happier. he's also depressed but he doesn't talk about it to anyone, and i'm not very close to him either.

i have 2 sisters and 1 brother. my brother is nice but hes small minded. my sister is nice, but only when she wants to be ( when something upsets her she snaps). my other sister (in her 20's)  bullies me constantly. when i used to complain about her fighting with my mother she called me a baby and told be to get a grip. i try not to talk to my other sister if i can because she makes me uncomfortable but she always starts fighting with me over nothing.

also, i haven't gone to a professional barber in about a year. i started cutting my hair myself because my social anxiety got bad, and i didnt feel safe in a men's barbers as a queer man. this has become a constant topic for my famliy to get angry with me about. my mother tells me my hair looks awful and shouts at me to get it cut. it makes me feel bad. my sister also bullies me about this and makes me feel like i'm worth nothing.

i want to either go to college or emigrate the country and live in another european country, but both options would be expensive and i may not be allowed to leave the country by my parents.

i live in a very expensive country in europe and i want to move away from my dysfunctional family but i'm afraid that i won't be able to afford to live independently . also my country is depressing - there is a housing crisis, which means even if i do find somewhere to rend it will be thousands a month. in the cities, there is antisocial behaviour and hate crimes that happen to people daily. our capital city is dirty and is full of teenagers that attack others. this makes me scared for the future.

to be honest i don't even feel like a regular person anymore. i'm not able to do simple tasks that all of my friends are able to do, like keeping a job or socialising. this also worries me, like i'm some kind of freak and im stagnant developmentally.

I'm guessing you are heading to the comments suggesting that I go see a therapist or talk to parents, friends and or other family members about it, but I wont. You see, therapi is a scam (I can't even afford to go, even if I wanted) and I don't believe that it would help me, it might help for some, but i doubt it would for me... The therapist prob would just give me some anti depression medicine and throw me out to the world again. Therapi useually just makes you get a view from other angles, it can't solve problems with the world which makes me depressed... You can't trust the therapist either, he/she doesn't actually care about you in an emotional way, the therapist just cares about you working in the societiy and not killing yourself, heck they even sometimes be sending you to psych wards, that sh\*t would just make me more depressed. Meanwhile, when it comes to friends/family, I feel as it none of them could relate to my problems and once my feelings are all in the open, it would just make it more awkward to be around them, they be scared do anything wrong. I don't want it to be that way, it's better if I just put on my fake act of being happy, all tho it's painful for me...

&#x200B;

I wont go too much into my depressive issues, cuz there is way too much wrong, and I have accepted that there is no way be happy nowa days (other than anti depressive meds, but I don't wanna have fake happiness). Being happy = lying to yourself about reality, and that is something I just can't do... I bet most of ya'll would prob just skip it all anyways.

Only child + immigrant,"Hi I’m 22 I’m an immigrant and a lonely child. I came to canada at 8 years old, grew up with my mother and my dad came 5 years after. I saw how hysterical my mom was. Being the only parent to take care of a child can be hard. My father was supposed to make everything easier. It did in a way and make it harder in another way. Basically, they were fighting with each other. Growing up with a violent family was hard. The thing is I new it will be hard but i didn’t know I will breakdown sooner then expected. At 17 I snapped and became depressed due to the father being really violent at me for a little comment I made about not caring on a object he wanted me to care about. I run away for 3 days, came back and they never cared about how I felt. I moved at 20 and cut contact but they found me and we talk to each other time time but now I am the one being very agressive. I was the calm guy all my life, quiet talking to no one. I stopped going to school because I was having suicidal thought. And I don’t even care anymore. I could be on the street right now and I would be careless. I’m just writing this in hope In 2 years i will feel better and look back to this text I made. 

I’m currently just working on a business on the side that made me feel less depressed. I’m still planning to go back in school even tho it will be the third time I would take a break from it.

It's critical. I can't TALK!,"Please be patient while reading. 

I have been an introvert since childhood. But I was a happy introvert. I had a good friend circle, I was confident, I was getting straight As and I even had a healthy relationship. 

I had a brutal breakup, family issues, academic failure and covid isolation all in the same year (2020-2021). 

I slipped into depression. It was very bad. I isolated myself and cut people off from my life (everyone). I lost all my self confidence. I didn't utter more than a few words in 2021-2022. 

I came to college in 2022 August. I faced a lot of discomfort interacting with new people, making new friends and I again isolated myself. I rarely talked to anybody. Although after a lot of constructive introspection and self-care I managed to get better and I brought myself out of that depression. I regained the motivation. 

But even now I can't ""talk"" to people. I am confused whether it's in my nature that I don't like ""talking"" or that I have just become worse in expressing my thoughts. My friends go out in groups a lot while I just sit in my room studying or watching something. I can talk for hours if it's business or academic related, I can express my idea clearly and just when the discussion about the project is over, I will stop interacting at all. 

I am worried it's going to cost me potential friendships. Or relationships. I want to talk. But I don't know how. And I have tried talking, I sometimes talk with my best friend (whom I reconnected with just a few months ago) for an hour or two. So is it about me being uncomfortable around new people or something else?

I have no idea what exactly I am asking here; maybe it's that am I in trouble, is it going to be very problematic in future, what can I do to improve my situation here, is this normal, any other advice will help.",1
I don't know where to go from here.,"For years I've had pretty bad periods of time filled with major depression, and severe anxiety has been a constant for as long as I can remember. This was my entire life and as such it was not as big a problem as it could have been, because it was just what I was used to. I still had desire and purpose to do things, I had friends who hanging out with was purpose enough for me. 

At the start of this year, I found a girl, and every cliche in every love story happened. We had (and still have) an incredible connection, I'm talking favourite shows, songs, interests, everything was the same, we were both incredibly emotionally intelligent and we would make each other laugh and were invested in each others lives, yada yada- you get the point. Everyone says it, I know, but I've had relationships before and I like to think of myself as emotionally intelligent enough to know that she was and probably will always be the ""one that got away."" 

Naturally that implies that yes, a few days ago, she broke things off with me. We talked in person for a few hours about it, both cried buckets into each others shoulders, and there wasn't a hint of maliciousness from either side. We both agreed it was better for the both of us in the long run. I wanted to be pissed at her, to have a reason to hate her, but it was no-one's fault she lost the spark.

She said that it was up to me, but that she does truly want to remain friends, because while the romantic feelings were no longer there, we still connected on an incredible level that she didn't want to lose, and that when/if I was ready, she would like to be friends again. (Again, huge cliche.)

After talking with her, and a lot of self reflection, I realised that I made the mistake of having her be such a major part of my life, and purpose. This whole year has been with her, and every day I was thinking of when I would see her next and waiting for a response, which would sometimes take more than a day. Nothing else was even half as important to me as her, and so obviously it absolutely killed me to not get a text more than once a day, to go hours without constantly talking to her. This was my fault, and even if I had realised it sooner, that wouldn't have affected her not feeling a spark. 

Now that we aren't together, and I know that I have to take time away from her to get over her, I am completely and utterly depressed. Everything that I have now after she's gone is simply useless to me.  I haven't stopped thinking about what I am supposed to do. My workplace, Uni work, even hanging out with friends, these all became things to pass the time until I got to see or talk to my girlfriend, whereas before they were way more than that. They were actually my life, and my interests. 

I don't have any desire for anything. I don't have something to look forward to, I have nothing to feel but regret and absolute grief for the way things were. The only time I have felt any sort of relief since then was bawling my eyes out to my mother on the phone. Getting wasted on alcohol, which usually would do the trick, does nothing. 

I can't help but feel like such a fucking loser now. I had the perfect girlfriend, I had a social life I was happy with, I had plans and desires for the future. Now I'm back to being a student with ADHD and OCD who's only friends are the three or four people from school, and the most we do is go to someone's house and play games until we go home. I am in pure agony and I have to make a constant effort to not think about how good things were. 

I have nothing to show as an 18 year old. I understand people have it worse than me. But to now have 3 guy friends that I barely hang out with, brother's who I barely talk to, no social skills or confidence, University work that I'm struggling with, and a mind-numbing workplace, I can't do anything but miss what I had. I think about how most Uni students have networks of friends, go out to bars and socialise, drink, party, have fun, and I just don't have that. 

My girlfriend breaking up with me is not why I am this disheartened. I was like this before, and I was like this during the relationship, but because I was happy when I was with her it wasn't as bad and so I paid no attention to it. I'm really struggling to know what to do with myself. I am at the point now where the only reason I haven't seriously considered or attempted to hurt myself (for lack of better wording) is because this girlfriend doesn't deserve that, and neither does my mother, or brothers. It's getting harder to not entertain the thought, because all I feel now is not numbness, but pointlessness, pain and sheer, utter grief. 

I know these feelings will pass. But while everyone tells me this, it's irrelevant to me in the current moment because it's happening right now, and I can't do anything but wait. 

I have medication for these feelings now, and I have organised professional help, but they all take time to work and I cannot just put these feelings on hold until they help.

sedentary lifestyle,"Just kinda ranting a little bit... but I've been thinking about how modern life seems to be detrimental to everyone's health.

Most of my life is spent sitting, laying down, etc, and this is probably how it is for many people.

Even though I can go to the gym, or walk around outside, it's still difficult not to feel caged in sometimes. I don't want to go out at night because there are drifters and scary people walking around, but I wish I could. I wish I lived next to hiking trails.

I am tired of failing and feeling like a burden,"I wish I could just die. Moments ago my heart was aching and I was hoping it was a heart attack. Unfortunately it was not.

I tried to kill my self once and it didn’t go as planned, that was like 5 years ago. I never tried again and I don’t think I have the courage to try again. I wish I had ;( after the event I realized I actually enjoy life. I do enjoy life and I do want to live, but I’m just so tired of feeling this sad. I’m tired of failing. I feel like life just isn’t for me? I don’t think I fit anymore. 

3 years ago my partner had an emotional affair, nothing physical happened. I asked her (I’m a woman too) to cut the person from her life, she did, but today she decided to befriend the person again. I know I can’t live with that. I can’t live without her either. I have friends and I have family, but I don’t feel the same connection with them. 

I’m struggling financially and can’t work properly. My life is falling apart and the one person I trust is pretty much leaving me behind. I feel like I’ll rot and the pain is unbearable. I just want to sleep and not wake up. I don’t know what to do anymore because I already go to therapy and have medication. I think I simply failed. I feel so sad because I’m actually a very decent person. I feel sad because I have a lot to contribute, I have a decent mind, am respectful, vegan, not racist, not a scum in any way, very interested in stuff overall and somewhat creative person. Life failed me ;(",1
Lost everything,"A become so ""neutral"" aphatical, i lost the love of my mom, mey dad, my nephew, i really donT care if anything good or bad happens to me, i just don feel anything, at all. I don't live this way anymore, had more than enough, not even a film, a video game pleasu
res me, i am 31, and lost completely interest for women, like 6,7 years ago, life for me is agony, i can't take it anymore",1
I don't even know what I'm feeling anymore,"Days are blurring together, I'm not sad, but I'm not happy. I feel fake, like everything I do is premeditated and I have zero-control. I can't even remember what I ate for breakfast, school work has piled up and I'm scared to start trying to catch up. I'm such a burden, nothing I do is ever right. I wish I helped my mom more, I love her, but don't want to be around her. It's gonna hurt so damn bad when she dies, everything is going to go haywire, and she is going downhill. I'm almost 15, all my friends have part-time jobs and know what they are going to be when they grow up, while I'm over here trying my damn best to function. Functioning is probably the hardest part about all of this, I'm able to seem 'okay', but at what cost? Barely taking care of/caring about what I look like, what my room looks like? And my mom hates that I don't care what I look like half the time, but really, would she rather me lay in bed all day and let the dogs and chickens go hungry? UGH I DONT FREAKING KNOW ANYMORE, all that I know is that I HATE feeling like this, this weird, empty and angry feeling with an anxious buzz in the background. My chest feels heavy, but my stomach empty, with this ache that I can't rightly explain. I just want people to see that I am trying, that I'm a person too. Hell, I'm so disconnected from reality that my vision is blurry, I know what I'm seeing and I can describe it to people, but it's also like I'm watching a youtube video. The only reason that I even picked up photography was because I could actually *experience* the pictures. And hell, my mom wanted me when no-one else did, and now she's leaving too. She adopted me when my bio abandoned me, I don't know a thing about the lady, I was barely a year old. I had a brother I never knew and had to ATTEND his funeral. I don't want my mom to leave me like everybody else, sure I've got a sister and family I love and care about, but it's different with her. God I'm just so sick of it all, sometimes I want to comit suicide because then they'll wish they saw the signs but I know thats shitty of me, and other times I wish I could commit but I always shame myself down from it. I just don't want to exist anymore, not if it's always going to be like this. And for anyone even thinking that I should go to therapy, trust me, we have tried to get me in counseling, the places in my area don't take my insurance, and that crap is expensive, and frankly we are not in the best of financial situations right now. Nobody around me would understand if I told them, I've been this disconected since I was around 7, and I genuinely believe I don't deserve help, I deserve to suffer for all the bad shit I've done, and I know nobody agrees with that, but they would if they just knew the half of the crap I've done. In some twisted part of me I just want someone to agree that, ""Yes, I am useless and I deserve everything bad that has happened/will happen to me.''",1

I’m reliant on drugs and can’t feel enthusiastic about life without them. I have no destination to my life and my most sincere fate has been with the bottle. The safest I’ve ever felt was being strangled by somebody and the most liberated I’ve ever been was overdosed, feeling like I don’t have to fucking explain myself and my pain for another second because it’s written all over me. Dying, I’m fucking dying, that’s it! That’s the way I feel reflected inwards and out, and how comforting the feeling of death was. I loved every second of my pain and my mind for once, stood still, quiet.",1
Why is it so dam hard to be a part of this world,"You can either do a repetitive boring job that will let you live in misery for the rest of your life and make you a disappointment and the laughing stock of anybody who knows you. 

If you can manage something that requires more skills, you can probably land something like electrician, plumber, carpenter, things like that, you'll be able to work you ass off to be in the lower middle class. How and you get the perk of still being the laughing stock and a disappointment to everybody that knows you.

Maybe you can manage some higher education ? Are you ready to enter a world of elitist and self centered aholes. I hope you're brain is working properly and you are willing to sacrifice it because that' what you're gonna do. Maybe you are an absolute maniac that can manage something that actually has a point. But most likely you'll just be doing a stupid bullshit job that means nothing and profits no one. ""Oh yeah, putting good colors on the website of this scam company (which they all are) is definitely something meaningful that adds value to society""

If none of this inspires you and you are willing to walk the line between beeing a failure and beeing and garbage human beeing making a fool of themselves you can try entertainment. 

Or you can try, like fucking everybody, to be an artist, if you can persuade yourself that the shit you want to show the world matters and that living I misery is not a big deal, yeah you can try. You want to write a book ? Nobody cares, everybody is doing it and it doesn't matter if what you do is good or not because no one want to read it anyway. Do you want to draw something stupid hoping somebody will give you money for it ? Ha. (I don't care about music, I don't know anything about it, even after 10 fucking years of piano).

Every people that's telling you that you can do it is either trying to sell you something or feels pity for you. And they are both lying.

(I'm sorry about this stupid rant, it's very childish and I'm sorry if you felt targeted. It's just been a long time that I haven't felt that bad, and an even longer time that I haven't felt good at all. I just want something that makes sense, crumbs of purpose. To anyone that has made it that far, I love you, maybe you don't deserve it, but I don't care, you read something I wrote so I love you, and you can't do anything about it. On that note, I really hope to get better)

I pick him up from work, he doesn't say anything.  We get home, he hides in the basement.  WHAT AM I DOING WRONG!

I love him, sooo much... if I cause so much pain when I'm here or when I am gone. Why am I here when I should be gone. Selfishness is based on not allowing others to help, well, there is no one else.  So when I die, I'm not selfish.",1
Why can't I be happy?,"I'm 12 and I wanted to no longer exist. Everything I do, I don't want to do it. I don't want to eat food. I don't want to talk to my friends. I don't want to draw, which is the only good thing I do. I don't want to do it. I can't be bothered to be happy when I've been raised in this type of society. I don't like to talk to my parents because I'd rather just cry alone. Cry. Cry. Cry. That's all I do. It's pretty much my new skill. I was born a girl, so I have period problems, and my older brother makes jokes about that time of the month, and I can't bring myself to tell him to shut up. Why can't I be human? Why do I feel this way? Why do I have depression? Why can't I love myself like I used to?",1
Am I faking it?,"I think I'm faking my depression because I like eating a lot of junk food. Most people who are majorly depressed don't enjoy eating. So I guess I'm not actually clinically depressed?

Like I am diagnosed with depression but I just think maybe I don't have It",1
All I do is sit and play video games or lay in bed being miserable.,"That's literally my entire life. I'm so miserable all the time and I hate everything about my awful life, but I just can't manage to make myself change anything. I'm helplessly addicted to video games, they're the only way I can distract myself from how awful everything is around me, and I need them to help regulate my emotions. But, sometimes, I get so miserable that I can't even manage to sit in my chair and play video games, so I just lay in bed for hours. I already sleep over 12 hours a night every night, but I spend at least an hour or two in bed throughout the day, as well. Sometimes even longer.

I'm in awful shape and I don't really take care of myself well. My diet is garbage, too. I mostly eat beef jerky and granola bars because there's never any food in my house (I live with family and they just don't give a shit about me). I know I'd feel better if I was in better shape but I just can't force myself to exercise, or do anything. It's just so impossible to do it - and, even if I can manage to make myself do it once, I can't keep it up and make a persistent habit out of it. All I can do is sit and play video games or lay miserably in my bed.",1
Need help..,"My girlfriend is hospitalized for attempted suicide and before that we saw each other on the vast majority of days but since 4 days ago I feel an emptiness after I say goodbye to the visit everyday. I'm unmotivated for some things and I just feel like being out of the house waiting for time to pass so I can see her the next day and at the end of the day I end up crying and also the fact that I can't be there to support her when I want to. Today after the last call of the day which is at 6:30 pm she was feeling lonely because two of her friends left and from that moment I walk with a sadness because I do not know her state at this time and if this can worsen her situation and that so far is being a very good recovery. Do you think that loneliness in an internment worsens treatment?
Regarding what I've been feeling for the past few days, do you think I might be on my way to developing depression?",1
Can i vent to someone?,I promise i will listen you too 🥺,1
I am so lonely and isolated!,"Something happened that really drove home how lonely I am and also how isolated I am from everyone.  I am still crying and mostly posting this to vent.  How do you find friends and community when your personality drives them away. I realize how broken I am, but I don't know how to fix it.  Thanks for reading.",1
I can't cry anymore or sleep.,I feel so depressed and my body wants to cry but i physically cant. I feel like a disappointment and that i am not good enough. I fake it through out the day and its so exhausting i cant do this anymore i just want it all to end. When i get home from work i just sit in my car and listen to music but it doesnt help like it use to.,1
I think I might relapse on heroin,"I’m a 19 year old heroin addict, I’ve been clean for about a month now and I’m on a methadone program. I’ve had a history of depression but it’s worse than ever now, it almost physically hurts how depressed I feel. I want to kill myself so badly. Heroin is the only thing that will make me feel ok. I hate myself so fucking much. I just feel so empty and lonely it’s extremely overwhelming. I honestly don’t know what to do, I’m moving soon and won’t have a therapist because I don’t know how to get a referral to one and I can’t afford one of pocket. Heroin seems to be the only answer but it’s so expensive too. My life is a living fucking hell I can’t do it anymore.",1
I'm done.,"There's nothing that interests me anymore.

I want to actually live,"I’m 23 and if it wasn’t for the weight of leaving my family in pain I would have already killed myself.
I’ve gone to therapy for the past couple of years, tried some courses to deal with emotions and currently being followed by a professional.
I feel like I make no progress, every time I think I’m doing okay I dwell once again in desperation. I cannot create genuine boundaries with people, feel very alone and unattractive. I got a very creative brain and interest in many things but act on nothing because overwhelmed by every feeling and fear. I feel constantly paralysed and unable to change my situation.
I wake up, if I got the energy hand some cv around, mostly for job I don ‘t really want, I don’t actually know what I want.
Sometimes I think I should start an university course that excites me and persue my creative attitude learning building, making and engineering but terrified by the commitment, I’m not good with mathematical disciplines. 
I actually want to leave and try to get better at something, but at the end of every day I find myself very disappointed and unsatisfied with myself, incapable of everything.
I ‘m terrified of living, terrified by solitude, I have no one to share my interests with, no stimuli, no excitement I can act on.",1
Everyone has given up on me. It has been years since I went out with family or friends now.,"My family doesn't try to get me to visit or go out anymore. I haven't had a friend in about 5 years now, with the exception of maybe my boyfriends friends, who probably would have nothing to do with me if I wasn't dating my partner. Even my partner is giving up on trying to get me to go out. I just need a push, I know its inconvenient for other people to have to push me, but its the only way I go out. I am so overwhelmed every minute of my days that thinking about doing something is just too much and freaks me out. It has to be at least somewhat planned, like a couple hours ahead minimum. Whenever my boyfriend goes out with friends, they just text him wyd and then 20 mins later they're out doing stuff. I cannot do that.

I feel so empty. I feel like I literally only exist to make money for the business I work for.

 No one would care if I died. It amazes me how there are some people whose passing would affect an entire community like a tsunami, yet I feel my passing would not even make a tiny splash, a drop, even. Some people would be sad, but they would not grieve. There would be no one to grieve, as no one really knows who I am. My gravestone would never be adorned in flowers. The grass would grow tall, as no foot traffic would pass over, and yet again, I would be invisible. 

My partner would have no one to talk about me with when I am gone. He is the only one. People would try and sympathize, maybe mention softly how shy I was, or how I had a hound dog, but they would never be able to talk about ME.

When my parents pass, I will have no one to go to and grieve. I will be alone in my sorrow and emptiness as the last people I felt truly connected to leave, and I will live with the guilt on my shoulders from not talking enough, not visiting enough.

I am convinced that if my body and mind were not so used up by the corporate job and the capitalist world, maybe then I could make connections. Be someone. But for now, ill let myself continue to erode until everyone leaves. I have no energy left after the day anyways.

I feel obliged to add the positives before I end my post. I at least have an extremely dedicated, loving, supportive partner. I think the love we have is truly one in a million and he does know me inside and out. I think people could go through hundreds of lifetimes before experiencing the kind of love we have. He is why I am alive, though I don't tell him that. I pretend to be strong and I pretend well. When I cry, its just because of a bad day at work, or stress is what I tell him. It doesn't make a difference, as long as I have him. I am financially okay. I wish I was doing better, because I know without help I wouldn't even be able to afford my own food, but I'm stable right now. 

Thanks for reading if you did.",1
Depression might win this time,"I got kicked out of my moms house. Im the oldest of 11 siblings and she always wants me to make them do stuff because they dont listen to her and seem to listen to me . Well the 12yr who is autistic is a nightmare to deal with. Ita always a fight with him.I cook , clean, babysit and give my mom money whenever she needs it. I make sure the kids get up for school and get on the bus .

My brother  stabbed me a few months ago and my mom told me he would be better. I came home yesterday and my internet modem i pay for the house he took and put it in water and then plugged it in. fried it.

I told her and she told me that my he doesnt want me there and Im taking up space in the house. She kicked me out knowing i have no where to go. All I have is my car. Which i need brakes and other thinga for it and im mentally feel like im going to checkout .

Im sitting here at a truck stop in my car and I feel lost. I have no friends always been a loner and she was my only family left after my grandma died a few years ago who raised me.

Im at a lost and I dont want to be alive anymore . There isnt anyone who would miss me . I slept in my car last night and I have been homeless before and i cant do this again.",1
Why is family so mentally exhausting,Today was a good day and the worst day at the same time. My sister graduated today and we had a grad party for her. (So proud of her!) I already was dreading the party because it shines the spotlight on college and how I am not currently attending. This means a lot of side eyes and judgement from my family. I had about five or six people ask me what I was doing with my life and it was very obvious what they were doing. I’m already introverted and it was super hard trying to defend myself. I did have to sneakily go into the guest room to let out a few tears because I was so overwhelmed. It’s very clear my family’s love is conditional. It reminds me why I don’t attend family gatherings and why I like being alone. I just have this gut wrenching feeling after every party. I’m just trying my best but clearly that’s not enough. Thanks for listening!,1
Im over everything,"I feel like a failure. Im 23 and havent graduated college yet, its taking me longer. I dont know what my talents or purpose is. Im broke. Still a virgin.

SAHM Blues,"I’m a SAHM and ever since my second child (3 yrs) was born I haven’t felt much happiness. She’s been a much more difficult child than my first (7 yrs). I feel like a terrible mother because I never feel much happiness around anyone anymore. I feel like I have no one to talk to or any sort of support system. I have my husband and he tries to be supportive but eventually gets frustrated when I put any sort of responsibility on him to help me out of this like putting our toddler to bed every night so that I can have some sort of break after being with her 24/7. He says he will do it regularly but somehow we fall into me doing it. His family are the only ones around to help us with our girls but my MIL watches my nieces so she doesn’t have much time for ours. Which is fine but she asked me to watch my niece a day a week so she didn’t have to and I told her I didn’t want to (lots of reasons for this which I don’t want to unpack). She cried when I told her no because she doesn’t dare to tell my SIL no and she said back in the day family helped family which has made me feel like complete and utter crap since she said it. Like she will only take our girls if I help her out with my nieces? That’s not fair. They’re not her kids. Besides I wouldn’t be a SAHM if I had free childcare like my SIL gets from her. It’s so messed up. This was months and months ago and that and so many things just have me so so down. Also so many sicknesses the past two years have trickled through the house so I get no sleep for a whole month at a time between me and my girls being sick. Last year it was literally without exaggerating 3 months straight of sickness (Covid, a cold, then a stomach bug). And now I’m currently recovering from a stomach bug that everyone got before me where I couldn’t eat for an entire week and lost 10 pounds. I also can’t rest whenever I’m sick because I’m home with my very demanding toddler. I feel like I’m in a hole I can’t climb out of and it just keeps getting deeper and deeper. Sometimes I truly feel like my family would be better off without me. How do I feel happy again?",1

Does depression ever go away for good,"TW ⚠️: mention of c*tting

I’m 17 and I’ve always suffered from low mood I have it where I’m in a really dark place for months/years at a time . It started when I was 12 I c*t myself when I was 12 . It makes me sad to think that , when I was 14 I got over it and  was sooo happy living the dream and now I’m 17 and about 7-8 months ago it has came back . I thought it had gone for good but no . I actually cant do this I never ever ever feel happy I had to quit my job drip out of school because I couldn’t mentally do it . And I’m wondering if depression will ever go I try sooo hard to ignore my thoughts but the more I push them away the stronger and louder they become.

I wish I were normal. I don’t find pleasure in anything like I used to and everything is just torture even seeing my friends is a chore I only do it for them because I do love them but I would rather sit in my room and rot . 

I’m literally a kid I need to get out of this ‘phase’ I want to be like everyone else . I want to be happy and see everyone but I can’t . 

Recently in like October I c*t and when I looked at it it made me so sad because I hadn’t done it sinse I were 12 and it reminded me of being a kid and not knowing why I hate myself so much . That made me stop c*tying for good . Ovc I get voices telling me too but I can’t do it again .

Sorry for rant it’s a bit embarrassing because I don’t talk like this to anyone irl . And sorry if some bits don’t make sense I’m really dyslexic.

But yeah does anyone actually get better and does it go for good?",1
I just need to get stuff off my chest.,"I needed to make a throwaway account to vent my feelings, because I just have to get some things off of my chest. I hope this post won’t get deleted because of my nonexistent Karma score on here, but we’ll see what happens.

I just hate my life. All of it. Sometimes I wish I was never born, and sometimes I just wish things were different. I hate being perceived as an incompetent weirdo, simply because I’m autistic. I don’t have the luxury of a support system, nor does anyone care about me. I’m all alone, fighting every day to even just get out of bed.

The more I do this, the more weary of existing I get. I live such a dead end existence, working a job that I’m so burned out on and have no motivation for. I’m in debt and can barely save any money at all. It doesn’t help that I have a chronic spending problem due to it giving me somewhat of a temporary high to fill the empty void where I’m given no affection whatsoever. It makes me feel good for a while, but it doesn’t truly make me happy. 

I don’t have a partner either, and I wish I did so that I could at least focus more on them instead of my broken mind and heart. I miss my Ex still even after we broke up in November. I want to be back with them but they already are with someone else. It’s super hard finding a partner at all these days now, and no matter how hard I try, I come up with no results. I guess I’m just not what people want, and I’m to die alone. Who knows? 

I lost faith in my religion as well. Nothing but bad has happened in my life, and when I turned to God for answers, more bad just ended up happening. If he exists, then he definitely hates me. I was told I was never meant to be born either way. Maybe this is my punishment for existing.

I’m surprised I’m not hooked on alcohol or drugs as a substitute for covering that gaping hole, but it just doesn’t really appeal to me. 

I just don’t see my life going anywhere anymore. I just want it to end, or I just want things to go my way for once.

I’m sorry for things being kind of crazy in this post, but my mind is just venting my scrambled thoughts.",1

I feel miserable,"Hi, I am a 18 year old male, and I need some advice and help, so I would appreciate any words of wisdom; btw my first language is not English, so please pardon me if the grammar looks a bit odd..

To start off, I think it would be better for me to provide my background information to understand my situation better, since I believe that significant chunks of my problems come from the trauma during my teenage years.

Every time I try to control myself from the emotional damage of the trauma, I feel like I am constantly damaging myself even though I try not to admit it. 

To elaborate, it started when my parents divorced and I moved to a different country for my school, and lived there with my father for a few years. Even though I could stay with my mother, whom I had a really close relationship with, my mother still sent me to my father, for the sake of the 'better future' in the new country. I was 13 back then. I had conflicts with him and was emotionally destroyed from his constant verbal/psychological/emotional abuse and neglect, and whenever he left home to meet his girl friend, it was the shittiest feeling ever that I experienced, and I think it is since then when my attachment issues started to worsen. I spent most of the time alone, and it was really hard for me to be alone even on my birthdays(I don't really care about birthday celebration stuff, but still..it was pretty depressing), and what was worse was when he cursed my mother's family..and every time he did that, would get mentally scared. 

And it was really painful to be aware of the the fact that I worked as a link that tied my mother and father still together, since they still talked to each other to discuss my academic and other stuff, and I knew tht my mother got agonized every time she had to talk with him, since I remember from my childhood her crying when she talked on the phone with him(they lived separately ever since I was born), and because I love her of course, I didn't want her to get hurt not even a bit because of him.

I thought I could handle all these things, but I got hit hard by depression, DPDR, PTSD, bipolar disorder, etc. I gave up on my school work and all other stuff, even my relationships with friends, since I was running out of energy to even barely breathe. 

And recently, I have been taking medication(Xanax and Prozac) to fix this mental trauma, and also having therapy sessions every month, but honestly, even though this did help me a lot, I feel like this hasn't resolved the fundamental cause of the problem. The PTSD shit hits me bad whenever I have a phone call with my father.(He pays my private high school tuition and other stuff for my family, so I can't just cut loose with him).  

Even nowadays, when I talk with people, even my closest friends, I never show my true emotions or thoughts, because it is much safer for me to just fake and protect myself from any potential offense or attack towards my authentic self.

And I hate to admit the fact that I still have hatred towards both of my parents. My father, of course, I think he deserves that, but I shouldn't hate my mother. In fact, it's just not that I hate her, I do love her so much, but whenever the issue is brought up, I feel so overwhelmed and depressed, and these emotions turn into my resentment and blame towards her. And I ask her 'why did you have to do that?' And this just turns into toxic arguments between me and her. I feel like a total piece of shit whenever I go through this, and have been thinking of suicidal thoughts from time to time. I feel like I have been losing so much of me, and I am losing control, sense of myself.

Sorry if this was a bit hard to read and understand, and I really appreciate you for reading this. And again, I would appreciate any advices. Thank you.",1
I'm so freaking tired of this,"My little brother and his friend went into the creek in our backyard and kidnapped a salamander. Now my parents want to let my loud, obnoxious, irresponsible, little brother keep this thing as a pet.

I *tried* telling them to release it, but they won't listen. They've bought a tank and a bunch of other stuff for it already. So I decided that if I can't get them to release it, then I'll do research to make sure it's at least somewhat happy. Well, i try to tell them *anything,* and they won't listen. They refuse to listen to me at all. This has gone on for almost a week now and im so sick and tired of it. Over and over, they say something about it not eating, or not moving much, and I tell them the reason why that's probably happening, and they get angry at me and don't listen to me.

And when I try to help them with anything, they give all the credit to my little brother. I'm pretty much the only one doing research at all, and they just act like I'm stupid. I cry about this poor salamander every single night, because the poor thing is suffering and there is pretty much nothing I can do to help it. I can't freaking stand seeing animals suffering, and my parents know this, and they just get angry when I'm concerned about it. We just kidnapped this poor thing from its home, I want to make sure it's OK, that's all I want to do. 

Not to mention all the other stuff going on in my life that makes me feel worthless, pathetic, and want to kill myself, this doesn't freaking help. I can't even keep a couple of plants alive, plants that are supposed to be *easy* to keep alive.

I hate this so so much, I want to freaking kill myself so freaking badly. I want to free the poor salamander. They won't even feed live food, they're feeding it dried and dead food. They even said it themselves, that this species of salamander is ""endangered"", and they still insist on keeping it. 

They favor my little brother so so much over the rest of me and my siblings, they would never let anyone else take in a salamander or even a bug from the wild and keep it as a pet. 

And the only one who will listen to me about this at all is one of my older brothers. 

I just want to end everything, the only thing keeping me alive is the fact that all my loved ones will be sad. 

I know there's more I can say, but I can't think of anything else right now. If you read all of this, thank you.",1
"I could be dead for days, and nobody would notice.",Edit: never mind. It doesn't matter.,1
I wish I could understand,"I wish I could understand what keeps people going. I mean, there's absolutely zero meaning to life for me, I know most people do think life has a meaning and I respect that, but if you think about it, it doesn't matter if life was terrible or perfect, it all ends someday, even if you leave something for people to remember you, it does not matter as you won't be there to see it.

I used to be happy when I was a kid, but as I grew older everything started to seem so pointless. I started hating everything and everyone. Now I'm not so hateful like then, but the deep sadness is still with me. I used to be afraid of death, but now it's what I think about the most, my own death.

Me and my family changed states, we live closer to our relatives, I have a job close to my home, I now have a dog that I love, my first dog ever. I do love my family and we get along. But I can't ever feel satisfied, I'm on medication for anxiety and depression, which in the start of treatment they helped, but now after a bit more than a year I feel like I'm not on meds at all.

I'm always thinking that I should try exercising, studying something to maybe get a better job in the future, but I can never bring myself to make these changes, it's just so pointless. I struggle with suicide thoughts almost everyday, if something goes wrong at work or at home I feel terrible and just give up for the day.

I've been wanting to give up on this job for a long time now (I've been working there for 3 years), but I know that I won't find a better job still close to home and with an OK pay like I have now, I only finished high school and did a few short term courses so I could start working, and my bosses have been very patient with me, even though I'm as slow as a slug, I wish they would fire me already but I don't think they will. I work with heavy machinery, and I have already hurt myself on purpose once there, but what I actually want is to just crush my head in that machine for once and never have to wake up again.

You know, I just wish I could endure life, because in the future my parents and my brother who is disabled may need my help. But after they're gone, after I've served my purpose on this planet, I will finally have the guts to kill myself and truly rest. The only thing keeping me from ending it now is my family.

Sorry for the long text and the bad English, it's not my first language.",1
i have no one to talk to,"hi everyone this is my first reddit post so please be nice.

i’ve always been kind of a morose person, but lately, it has gotten worse and worse. i’m in college now, and i’m struggling to find a summer job or internship, and because i have very few friends, the days drag on and i feel useless and empty. on top of that, my mom is sick right now which is also stressing me out, and my dad is not helping out much and is not good emotional support for any of us. 
i think the stress from that, the thoughts that nobody likes me or wants to hang out with me from my hometown (i didn’t make many friends in high school), and the monotony of my days is making me very anxious and sort of depressed (not enjoying much of anything, sleep problems, random crying, etc).

i think an important thing to note is that i am a Christian but i’m kind of struggling with that too (stuff i don’t quite agree with in the Bible (i know i can’t pick and choose so you can see how that might be a problem), and also the feeling that i am just talking into a void). so praying about it (for me right now) feels very disingenuous (but i am not asking for any cynical athiest takes as this will probably make me more anxious).
i can’t get a therapist because my parents control that and they already don’t think it will be useful.

if anyone would care to read, advice (Christian and Secular) would be appreciated, just something to lift my spirits and keep me moving forward. thank you.

edit: an important thing to add too is that in the beliefs i’ve been taught, thoughts and declarations are important because they can come true. so there’s also the feeling of hopelessness and then an added layer of hopelessness because you feel hopeless (if that makes sense).",1
What is this? It would be helpful to have an understanding.,"What specifically am I experiencing?

I'm 20 years old and for as long as I can remember my emotional reactions to everything has been really numb. It's gotten worse over the years but right now the very most emotion I can feel would be like the how the heat feels from a candle when at a distance but in my stomach, and this is the height of how happy I can feel for things I really really enjoy and am interested in. This sensation lasts for a few seconds and might happen a few times a day.

 I think its anhedonia? Does anyone know what this is called? When I heard someone very close to me had cancer I didn't care at all even though I really do like the person (they're better now thank god. If they died i wouldve been more annoyed i would have to pretend to be affected but i would miss them) it's pretty extreme...

 I've been on prozac/fluxotine for four years straight and have recently gotten on a higher dose because I was hurting myself. Everything is either very boring or suddenly I feel the need to either have a smoke, hurt myself or sleep for ten hours at any time. But I do enjoy things but I wish I could actually 'feel' instead of just not being bored...",1
I don't feel sad. I don't hate myself. I don't feel anything. I don't care about anything enough to hate anything. All I feel is empty.,"I hear self-loathing is commonly associated with depression, but I can't relate, because even self-loathing requires a degree of passion, and I can't find myself to feel passion for almost anything anymore. Maybe I don't have depression—I think I might, but maybe I don't.  Because my depression doesn't seem to be characterized by anything violently self-loathing as much as it is a severe and inescapable apathy, less of a ""the world would be better off without me"" and more of ""what's the point in sticking around?""",1
i’m suffocating,"note: this isn’t as clear as i want it to be, i’ve never been good at words and finding the right ways to explain things, so any of you have questions, i’ll answer if i’m comfortable. 
my loneliness is ruining me. i feel like i’ve ruined me. i’m so confused with who i am and what i want. i want a life i deserve, but i don’t know what that looks like. i don’t know what my happiness is supposed to look like. 
i have ruined a lot of my life because i am so indecisive. i have no decision making skills, i listen to what everyone has to say all the time, so i have no idea how to think for myself. i rely solely on advice from others and half the time, it’s people i barely even know. i feel like i don’t have any true friends who know me and know what i want or who i am, and i can’t blame them because i feel like i mask myself 24/7 around everyone. i don’t know how to love myself or how to remove myself from a situation to know what is good for me and what i want in life. how do i help this? where do i even start?",1
Why do i go on? I am so depressed... I can't deal with the fact that nobody really cares about me...,I lost so many friends... all the girls i loved just threw me away... my best friend doesn't care about me... my dad hates me... my mum is too self obsessed to ever care about me... Girls show no interest... i didn't get my dreamjob & failed in every other job... i feel so hurt & empty at the same time its like i am falling apart,1

idk anymore,"hey reddit, i don’t usually complain about my mental health or anything but here goes nothing.

i don’t expect anyone to read this or comment or anything, but it’s to get my thoughts out. recently for the past 5 months i’ve been incredibly depressed. and i mean, bed ridden, don’t shower for weeks, cry then laugh then cry then go numb depressed. i’m 25 male, ADHD out the ass. i can’t hold a job for more than 6 months and i’m not kidding. it’s embarrassing.

i have had suicidal thoughts recently and every now and the, but i’ll never act on it because i’m too scared and don’t wanna leave friends and family. i’m in a relationship where i love my girlfriend with a burning passion but it doesn’t feel genuine sometimes from her. i’m not sure guys, i overthink a lot and it amplifies my anxiety/depression like symptoms.

i would say more but i’m truly tired and exhausted. i’ll answer questions to the best of my mental abilities. if anyone reads. thank you~",1
Depressed after my psychologist dismissed me. Advice?,"I was dismissed from my primary care for a missed appointment. The appointment at 2:15 but I thought it was at 2:30 (my stupid mistake) and I arrived at 2:35. They have decided to dismiss me from the practice due to my missed appointments. My primary care and psychologist are both at the same location so I lost my psychologist.

It's literally the only good medical facility in my area.

This has sent me into a very depression. I've had chest pains and have been crying and haven't left my bed. I feel like such a terrible person.

I feel worthless and a scum of the Earth because my even my doctor didn't want me after helping me so much. I'm just so done with everything. I'm so dejected and terribly sad. 

I tried looking for support elsewhere, everybody assumed that I mistreated my doctor when I swear that I did not.",1
Switching anti depressant brands?,"
Hi everyone I currently take 50mg Sertraline by
ACCORD. Before moving to Thailand, I stocked up for 4 months from my home country in the UK. However I have ran out of my supply and need to buy some new pills. I can't find accord brand anywhere so I am having to buy some cheaper Thai/Indian made versions of Sertraline.
Will I notice any side effects etc? Is it a big deal switching?
Thank you",1

My mood is frequently so low, and I'm almost always feeling down and sad almost everyday.It's hard for me to take care of my hygiene and avoid passive suicidal ideations. I feel like nothing is helping. Maybe I'm not helping myself enough. I don't know. I just feel like I'm broken or something. I feel like I'll never get better. I'm currently looking for a therapist; maybe that'll help me better.",1
Depression is kicking my butt right now,I was doing good for awhile but recently it's been getting bad again just feeling like I'm not important to anyone who is important to me I have so much care and love to give the people closest to me but I'm just to much to handle so no one bothers with me much unless they are bored or have nothing better to do its really weighing me down again although I guess one silver lining is I haven't self harmed so small steps I guess anyway thank you for listening ❤,1
looking for someone to talk with,"Please, I don't want to bother, I'm feeling alone and unlovable in every shape, way or form, everything seems to be dark, and I feel disgust for living. I just need someone to listen. It would be priceless. Any interaction is very appreciated, thank you.",1
Missing my childhood,"I know it’s an absolute cliché— everyone wants to be young again, even if it’s for a day. It’s practically in our nature to cling to the past and miss the old days. 

But man, is it the most depressing thing (for me.) I’ve struggled with depression for about 10 years or so, my therapists have attributed it to an after effect of anxiety. I’ll momentarily have *up* weeks, but majority of the time— I’m depressed. It started because of a variety of other reasons, but recently it’s been nostalgia related.

I’m just turning 20, so I’m not far from my infantile days; I can still remember vivid details down to at least 3 years old. I’ve been missing my little friends, the ignorant bliss, my grandparents (who’ve passed), and it stings because it feels like more and more memories pop up every day.

Turning 20 has really given me a wake up call, I know I’m not old but I’m at most 1/5 through my life. It’s just crazy to suddenly realize: shit. Im really like UP here now. Im a genuine adult. 

I worry about future me missing the time that I’m spending right now, and all of the people that I’ll inevitably miss. I live in constant fear and denial of loss. I’ve recently tried meditation and practicing Buddhism, but it’s difficult for me to adhere to a genuine hobby or thought process. For the most part, my medication, therapy, and (as dumb as it sounds) philosophy have kept my spirits up.

Does anybody else struggle as severely with this? Any tips for management? Thank you all <3

Disclaimer: I am ok, I’m not in crisis. My depression has been mostly manageable for a year or so now.",1
I’ve reached the final stage acceptance.,"I feel like I’ve finally reached the last stage of depression which is acceptance. I think there’s 5 stages to depression, or, there has been for me anyway that are the same 5 stages of grief. The first stage was denial, this was stage I was in for the longest, I simply denied that I was depressed. Of course at first I wasn’t actually sure if it was depression, I was only 12 not long started high school so I wasn’t sure if I even fully understood what depression was further than just being ‘sad all the time’. I denied that something was wrong when my parents started to question why I was sleeping at any point I could and why I slowly withdrew from everything that previously granted me joy. I denied that I was suicidal and that I had thoughts about how I would kill myself to the school counsellor at 14 who had been asked to see me due to my declining behaviour in school and increasing distribution to lessons or the increasing amount of times I’d not turn up to the lessons all together. I even denied that I was depressed to myself for a long time, I wrote it off as being a teenager and the crazy hormones that occur when you are that age. 

Anger was the second stage. I was absolutely furious that I felt like this, that I had to be miserable and bitter, that I had to struggle to do even the most basic of things and most of all that it was something so difficult to fight. I was aggressive and mean towards everyone, taking my self hatred and anger out any anything and anyone. Third came bargaining, I rang the GP at least once a week asking about therapy or some form of counselling and was told at least once a week that there is a very long waiting list to see any sort of counsellor and that I was looking at around a year long waiting list until I’d even be able to start counselling over the phone. I prayed to every god or form of omnipotence that I could, I am not religious but I prayed, I begged for god or the universe or anything to help. To make me feel normal, to make me want to socialise with my friends, to let me be satisfied, to let me feel joy, to let me sleep or eat normally, to give me desire to want to do anything with my life, for luck friendship love anything, just to feel happy again. 

Depression was the fourth stage. I know what you’re thinking how can depression be the fourth stage if I’m taking about the stages of depression. To be as frank as possible I was depressed that I was depressed. I was in despair, There was not one single drop of hope left, it’s as if any last bit of light that was still shining in my life  lost power. No therapist or doctor was going to help me, no friend or family member, no god or higher power, nothing I was going to be depressed forever, and this broke me even further. 

I have finally reached the final stage. Acceptance. I have accepted that this is my life. I will always be depressed and thats that kind of. I will never beat this and things won’t get better because I’m 21 and by now they would have. I have no talent, no luck on my side, no future, no hope, no qualifications, no romantic experience what so ever, no good looks, I have nothing. And that is how it will be, that is my life’s path, someone has to be the person that you knew in school who went absolutely no where and lived on a council estate with no job on benefits for there whole adult life and that will be me. I quit my job two days ago. I’ve given up. I’ve accepted it for what it is.

I’m just wondering if anyone else feels like there at this stage or has been in this stage or way for longer and if there is any next steps I’m unaware of. I’m sorry if I’ve gone on too much, I’m not too familiar with posting and once I started typing i couldn’t stop. 

Also I’d anyones wondering why if I’m at this point why don’t I just end it all. I cannot currently do that due to be told by more than one person that if I were to die they themselves would bring about their own death. As you can imagine I do not want to be that cause of someone else’s death especially knowing the people that would be affected by there’s.",1

Tears Don’t Fall,"So. I’ve literally cried, at least once, sometimes 4 or 5 times a day, for the past 11 days; Since I moved into a flat-share through a housing charity. I should be (and am) grateful for the support of the staff, but after my last housemate and former friend of 20+ years couldn’t grasp that he’d caused me a mental breakdown we had a huge argument and he basically kicked me out. I don’t know if sharing with a stranger is making my anxiety worse, if being alone is making my depression worse, hell, my support workers think I might be autistic … but it’s the crying. I just cannot stop.

I cried night one, just lay on the floor and cried my eyes out. I’ve cried myself to sleep. All of my meetings with support workers I’ve cried during. I finished a Lego model then cried because I had to put it in the cupboard. I cried (silently) at my dads house, and today at my nearest cafe because I can’t handle this shit. I have support meetings this week and I guarantee I’ll cry. I think I’m actually broken.",1

I don’t know what to do,"I’m honestly not happy any with anything. Life, relationship, family nothing at all.

Mums disappointed in me always arguments and fights. 
Not close like that with either one of my family, only really my Nan and she’s elderly so I don’t want her to stress about anything hence why I can’t even talk to her about certain things in my life. 
I have a lot of unhealed trauma that I just keep pushing to the back of my mind. 

I’ve basically fucked things up with the guy I really like, might even love him. But it’s the fact that we aren’t even together so it’s just so weird. He’s around me 24/7 vice versa, but my trust issues and insecurities just makes things worse. I’ve grown up in a house full of arguments and it’s like l can’t be normal around him without feeling the need to argue. 
I pretty sure he doesn’t want anything to do with me and I honestly hate it.

I wish I could unalive because existing is painful. But alas I have to live.,"Something broke inside of me on Monday. A dam I've kept up for years and suddenly I have to come to terms with how much of a loser I am at 35. No job. No feasible education. Fat. And a decade old romantic relationship gone. 

Oh also in debt. It's not huge debt, but It's there and affecting my credit score. And I can't change it until I get a job. Which I've applied for but no calls so far. My resume probably sucked. 

But it's hard to be this functional. Or dysfunctional. Saying jokes. Laughing at things. But inside I can't breathe. All I think is death. I can't go to the gym. I don't deserve to do things I enjoy. Because I'm a filthy loser. An important loser to some people so I can't die. I can't do the undoable but i wish I could. 

I can't eat either. I have the opposite of a binge eating disorder. Food feels wrong. It feels undeserved. Every time I eat something I want to vomit it back up because I don't want nourishment. I want to die. I'm getting physical pains throughout now because I'm so tense. How I wish I was somehow somebody else. Is this the dark side of the soul? 

Feeling the shame I have inside me feels like cutting my insides with a razor. I haven't bitten off all my nails so I can't be that bad. I smile and I act empathetic to distract me from the tearing sting of existing in a body that I have failed repeatedly. People that I've failed repeatedly. Someone I never became. Someone who hyperventilates at will. Quietly. And wonders if it will show up on my fitness watch. Some proof of the darkness filled with scathing flames of pain.

My mom called me a waste,"21M I am in college but I’ve been staying at my parents house (which is in the same place as my college). I usually am living at an apartment but my roommates have been really awful so I moved back home.

I’ve been home for about a month and I’ll admit that I’ve regressed while at home. I’ve stopped working out, I barely get homework done, and I sleep too much.

Today I slept until 10:00 AM and my mom burst into my room screaming at me and called me a “suck” which is what she says in place of “waste”.  She said that she can’t have me sleep in and that I need to work out and all I care about is sleep and food.

She works out daily and has completely turned me away from wanting to work out when I was younger. I don’t mind cardio and when I was running briefly a month ago, I was really excited. I even lost some weight.

She however said that I have to do weights and that running isn’t enough. I gave up on running because I have chronic headaches and neck pain. The only escape I get from the world is sleep.

I went to bed at 10:30 last night and got up at 10:00 today. I know it’s a long time but it was good. I had a dream that I got back together with my ex who broke up with me because she lost interest.

I really cared for her and she made me feel at home. I miss her so much and my mom woke me from the dream and immediately began to call me a waste.

I can’t move back to the apartment because two of my three other roommates are super toxic and stay up until 3AM every night. They hate me.

Home is the best choice for me but my mom who honestly is toxic on her own (I love her but she constantly criticizes me for anything I do) is making home also miserable for me.

I want to die...but I can't,"I want to die. Not in a there's nothing for me here way because there is, I feel like I can and will do great things in life. But in an overwhelming, I hate this position I put myself in, wish I could go back in time kind of way. 
I feel like my life after 16 just kinda went down hill and has not been close to anything I've liked to since. Met my husband when I was 18, married at 19, and have loved him like no ones business since then... but if I could I would go back and not have married him. I wouldn't have been in the state I'm in right now because of my family. I would have done things and been across the world right now if I went on a different path. 
I don't want to be labeled with anything so I've tried therapy a couple of times and make sure I don't share too much because of my past family trauma and my sister's diagnosis' of bipolar and anxiety and my mom's depression and dads and such I know I have depression but I don't want the label. 
I get waves of BAD depression every now and then and I just want to die... I hate my life, I want to be alone, I want to leave my husband, I want to just ghost everyone and disappear and die. But I can't. My husband won't survive without me, we've talked about it before and he would probably kill himself because of his depression if I ever died. My sister probably would too. My parents depend on me for everything and I practically raised my sister because my parents didn't know what the fuck they were doing.

She is continuing in her pursuit with 4 charges of assault, one even being armed assault, and even said that i broke my restraining order and they took it seriously with. No proof whatsoever.  The one girl that i had been talking to for about 5 years that made me have problems with my relationship as i was hesitant to go towards her ended up rejecting me without even giving me a chance after i got left by my ex, yes i am a piece of shit for talking to someone else.

Nobody really cares that much and the people who do as much as it is mean , aren’t necessarily living the lifestyle i am looking for, i am not that interesting of a person who makes no new friends or if i do cannot keep them , i cant commit or make decisions for the life of me , 
People have killed themselves for so much less who had so much more going for them and then there i am not very good looking abojt to turn 30 , constantly reminded on how small and skinny i am , i am so sick and tired of what life has to offer and i jjst want to fucking end it all , who would ever want my life or to be me?

Graduating College,"I finally made it. I finally finished my spring semester! I never thought I would see the day where I finish college. There’s still some sad feelings about my overall performance and experience. I opted out of going to my graduation because I don’t feel like I belong there. It’s weird how our minds can make us feel these things. I understand I made the requirements to graduate and earn my degree, but I still feel unsatisfied because of my grades. Also, I took advantage of the counseling services at my school while I was there. The most heartbreaking thing about graduating has to be the fact I have to move on from my therapist. She was the coolest person on the planet and I’m happy she decided to work on my campus. I’m not going to lie, I am starting to feel very lonely now that I can’t have those services. She was the main person I could talk to about a lot of things and she understood me.

I cant really carry like this due to my bf mental health,"Hi, my boyfriend has been depressed almost since covid and he has suicidal thoughts. He doesn’t want to go to therapy because he went once and he felt he wasn’t making any progress so he says that it’s going to be the same again and he doesn’t want to make an effort. He hasn’t mentioned the suicidal thoughts in a while but he mentions it every time I mention that I feel it would be good to be apart from a while. I’m really exhausted as I’m usually a happy person and we live together and everyday is the same attitude and the same bad mood and sadness or complaints about everything. I’m really struggling with it and I don’t know what to do. I have anxiety and even if I’m better from my anxiety his mood just makes me feel sad, down or depressed. I think I just needed to share it with someone as having this conversation with him goes nowhere as he never wants to talk about it and the more I try to speak about it the more deflated I feel.

How do you deal with loneliness?,"I'm curious how other people deal with loneliness with this condition. I got diagnosed 4 years ago, I take my medication and eat well just like I was told I should. 

I get regular episodes where I just can't leave my bed but my biggest problem is how lonely I get. Even when there's people around me I feel a bit disconnected and when they're gone it really sets in.

I know that even having someone around all the time won't fix it, it's just part of the bad hamd I've been delt. No one can be around all the time and it's unfair to put that on someone, everyone has their own life and they can't just give it up just to make sure you're ok.

So how do you deal with just being alone? Hobbies aren't really enough but there are so many people who deal with it and function knowing that there's no one around to help and I want to know how.

People annoy me a lot more than before,"In the past year my depression has deepened and I’m trying so a hard to fight it. I really think I’ve reached the stage where I’m completely apathetic, unmotivated and struggle to enjoy anything. I feel really guilty about this but socialising with my friends doesn’t feel as rewarding anymore. I kind of feel like I’m being a glass wall most of the time so it does make it harder to interact/feel present. But I also feel like I almost start to dislike or get annoyed by some things they say or do, and my temper is shorter (not that I express it). They don’t do anything wrong though and I feel bad about it as it’s uncalled for. Does anyone feel the same? Is this something that happens with depression?",1

Chronic fatigue syndrome?,"Hello I just wanted to post because no one around me seems to be able to relate. I've been struggling with mental health my whole life (depression, anxiety, ADD).

 In the last year my primary doctor has suspected I may have chronic fatigue syndrome. There's no test for this other than to rule out everything else my fatigue could be. All my blood tests and insomnia test were negative, and the last test to rule out was sleep apnea. So for over 3 months of waiting to get tested for that I was mentally preparing for either. I honestly was hoping it would just be sleep apnea because that is treatable and cfs is not. 

 I got my test result back a few weeks ago and I have the lowest possible sleep apnea positive score. I was relieved at first because I had only mentally prepared for it to be one or the other. But when I saw my primary again, she said most likely my light sleep apnea isn't what's making me so fatigued all the time but she can't diagnose me officially with chronic fatigue syndrome until I attempt to fix the sleep apnea. So she told me it is most likely both.

Now I have been waiting even longer for the sleep doctor to tell me what to do and I still haven't heard back almost a month later. I may not find out a real answer for another year or maybe never. I'm feeling so hopeless because I researched and all they know about chronic fatigue syndrome is that you can get bedridden from it and it's not treatable and may in fact take up to 20 years off your lifespan because of higher rates of heart attack or suicide. 

Does anyone else have chronic fatigue syndrome officially that also struggles with depression and anxiety? How do I live with the probability of this? I am already out a job and can no longer leave the house easily by myself because I don't feel it's safe to drive. But I'm not much closer to finding the true answer so I just feel hopeless. I haven't included all the ways my fatigue affects me but it has ruined my life. Anyone dealing with something similar please share how you deal with this",1
Battling to Feeling like it Matters,"I don't know if I really feel hope anymore or if I keep going on just so I don't burden anyone with absolutely giving up. Some days I really try to find something that means a lot to me and something I can look forward to in my life. I try to do things that I know I enjoy and I even have a girlfriend who means the world to me. But, none of it makes it feel like it is worth going through the river of shit (as the poker players would call it).

I am constantly confused what it means to be happy. Sometimes I think I found it, only for it to just turn around and lead to more disappointment. I feel like the ultimate disappointment. I know there is a lot of trauma that makes me feel that way and my mind has been permanently altered to think as such from years of BS manipulation I have dealt with. I know that it is the result of a decay in my ability to process things in anything other than pain, a deconstruction of my ability to communicate in any fashion that is clear or unformed by the Bell Jar Sylvia Plath wrote about. Trauma physically changes our brain chemistry. It is not just the gross overstimulating anxiety we feel when we flash back to an old horrible event. It is also the fundamental way our mind perceives the physical world. The simple functions that are no more complicated than 2 + 2 are basically fed bad data over and over again until 2+2=5. Then it builds on that until we reach such a level of obfuscation that a million little pieces doing something wrong, makes a very ugly whole shape. That is what trauma does.

I know this. I have looked at it and observed it over and over again. I have looked at the things I do and I know what part of my past it comes from. But, sometimes it doesn't matter because even if I managed to conquer those aspects of my trauma, I feel like there is just more trauma waiting for me. More fights and struggles. More death and mourning. More systems that actively feed off my energy just to commodify my labor into such low worth. More decay of my body and mind.

It comes to the point where I don't even know what I want to do anymore. What do I even hope to get out of life? Love? Sometimes it really feels like I can't truly feel it. I care for people and my girlfriend, but it is so obscured by a fawning trauma response that I just can't feel beyond that need to be nice and supportive out of the need to not feel like absolute dog shit. I literally can't trust myself to know what love is. Success? I would love the security of success but I feel like most of the time success is sacrificing you self-worth and principles to gain that security. It is an insecurity at the heart of it. Fun? Maybe. Maybe I just want memories worth having. Maybe I would like times where I can truly put myself together long enough to really internalize what a great time is instead of pushing myself through activities just so I don't ruin other people's time.

What I really want? I just want to write a novel; I want to create a youtube channel where I can go over art history and over analyze everything and create parallels between a Russian writer like Fyodor Dostoyevsky and an anime like Gintama and have it work. I would like the security to celebrate what is beautiful and ugly in this life for the pure joy of it. I want to be good enough for someone without the crushing fear that I am constantly on the verge of fucking it up. I want to be able to trust how I feel and be able to put it into words without the basically half an hour pause it takes me to get even a slightly viable explanation together. But, even then I will never be sure that something horrible isn't just around the corner and it makes it so much more difficult to keep walking on. I know I can't live my life worrying about the future, but I can't stop it. I can't stop living in the past either. I don't know what it means to live in the present because it just feels like an endurance to get to a new moment.

Even now I hate this post because it feels like a pity party for myself. That I am just wanting to feel sorry for myself and have people feel sorry for me. Honestly, I just want it out of my head for a bit. I just want to be able to put into words other people can understand and maybe that will make it more manageable. Maybe that will put it into such a way that I can start taking it to pieces. But every time I try to put it into words, I keep thinking ""no, that's not it."", ""no, that is not how it feels"", ""no, they will misunderstand what I mean""...I just don't have any internal confidence. It feels like all that is left if pushing on just so it doesn't feel like a burden or it is just numb. Idk. I'm going to post this anyways, despite my mind telling me not to. Hope you are all doing better than I am right now.",1

Finding it hard to find my center,"Hey guys,

I didn't really premeditate this, so forgive me if it sounds a bit garbled.

I've hand-held my depression for years, when the risk factor went away in my teens - it became a looming sort of grey-area. I'm no longer suicidal, but have adopted this sense of apathy that has been bothering me as of late. As grim as it sounds, it's the whole 'would never seek to harm myself, but if harm sought me out, I doubt I would move' sort of deal. 

All the things I would love to doing slowly fade out into my apathy-zone. From sports and socializing to trivial things such as movies, music and art. I have constant fidgets, and an overbearing weight of guilt that constantly sits on my shoulders like a little gremlin constantly whining that had I spent my time better in previous situations, I would have met more success 

Rationally I understand how unhealthy it is, but can't find the drive or energy to be better, so I just sit with my thoughts and flow through a cycle of beating myself up. I'm real tired of my internal monologue.

I've prefaced looking for help, however, in Canada the wait times for therapy and what-not for somebody 'not-at-risk' (which I totally get, but still) leaves me in what possible could be year-long wait times, on top of finding a General Physician (which took me two years last time). It's not looking so good over here,lads.

What I'm wondering from this community, is have any of you found a way to break these kinds of cycles? 

Maybe pulled out from your 'apathy-zone'? 

Any tricks or habits? 

Thank you for the consideration,",1

First time experiencing serious depression (24F). I need help.,"i already see a therapist but i don’t think its enough. I feel like I don’t have it in me to try. There are so many things about my life I don’t like and i just can’t fix them. I don’t know how and i dont have the energy. I’m so scared - i have never felt this bad. 

I went from having severe anxiety about these things to just not even being able to work towards them and watching the things i want slip away and become completely out of reach. 

My self esteem is terrible and I hate my body, but I don’t have the energy to workout. I’ve been eating so unhealthily. I’m insecure about my non-existent dating life but i don’t have the confidence and just generally dont like to go up to guys at bars and at this point post-college, i don’t see how else i could ever meet someone. I don’t even go outside anymore except occasionally with friends to drink which makes me feel a million times worse the next day.

It feels like i’m watching myself do life and i hate what i see but theres nothing i can do. I don’t know how else to explain it. 

My life just feels doomed. I see other people navigate through things and they make it look so easy but for me, it’s so hard. why??? it’s not fair. It’s hard for me to be around people and impossible to be a good friend. I hate when people around me are happy or in a good mood because i feel like i have never been able to feel like that and now it feels like i never ever will.",1

I’m weak and glad in my circle of zero responsibility of this world that never belonged to me that would make no difference without me. I am unsure what to do with that knowledge.

Its been almost eight years.,"[Tw, mentions of suicide and suicidal thoughts] 

I've been like this for almost eight years. Maybe longer. I don't know how far the thoughts go back. The pain. All I remember is one sunny day when I was eight years old. Sports day. The bullying. It all comes back in a rush. My mother didn't attend that day, and I was sitting in the shade of a tree, eating alone. Watching, as everyone ate with parents and friends, smiling and laughing. I remember the feeling in the pit of my stomach.

It was the same feeling when they found my diary that night. When my mom saw the words 'suicide' and 'death' written in bright blue glittery ink. I wonder what she though of me. I still remember the look on her face. I don't think they cared as much as they said they did back then. After all, from there on out, it only got worse.

It never goes away. Never wavering for a second. It's always there in the back of my mind. It's left its mark as scars on my skin and a plauge inside my brain. Why does it have to hurt so bad? And then there's the numbness. I can't tell which ones worse. Feeling nothing, or feeling everything, all together, all at once. 

It keeps me up at night. And it's so hard. So fucking hard to make it to the morning. Blasting songs over my headphones until the sun rises, keeping the meds locked up and the blades hidden. Sometimes I just pace about in the hall, hoping not to wake anyone. I ponder it over and over. If I want this to end, I know I have to end everything all at once. It'll never go away if I don't. I reason with myself that it'll only get worse, like it always does. And I don't want to stick around long enough to see what worse looks like.

I get to writing the notes like I've done so many times before. And then I open the box. I keep my notes. Every one I've ever written. My sister tried to bin them once. Told me that it's what's keeping me sick. That and my dirty room. Those are the causes of my misery. She also tried to sell me a few of her old crystals under the guise that they would 'cure my depression' too so I'm not entirely sure how credible her advice is.

I could never get rid of the box. It means something. It's kept me alive. In there, is every birthday card. Every badge, every note, every plea with the universe, every memory starting from the day I turned 13. Its both a blessing and a curse. But I am a keeper. I keep things. I have folders filled with screenshots of messages my friends have sent me. Some current, some from people in my past. It's a reminder.

You mattered to someone once. Maybe one day, you can matter again. I keep train tickets and notes and all these little unnecessary things. Its a reminder. The sky looked pretty that day. You got a really fuckin good milkshake from the McDonald's at that train station. Your teacher wrote a note home to talk about how amazing she thought you were that one time when you were like, nine. All these things. Just unnecessary little things that I cling to. It's hope.

My hope comes in the form of collected rocks and faded sea glass. Bottle caps and scraps of paper filled with doodles and smiley faces. It comes in the form of pink and green scribbles, courtesy of the artistic talent belonging to my younger siblings, paintings of how it was. Pictures of what it will be. My hope comes in the form of little items that would often be discarded. And I cling to them so desperately. 

It's another one of those nights. The ones where my medication makes everything so much harder. Where all I crave is the end. If I close my eyes I can almost see it. A endless void filled with serenity and dotted with stars, the perfect kind of silence swallowing me whole as I dispute from the body I inhabit. Oh to be free. But then I remember my friend. My siblings. 

Oh what I would give to be able to slip peacefully in my sleep without causing them pain. What I'd give to let go, to end this fight I have no chance of winning. But I won't. Not until I'm sure they don't need me anymore. Not until I know they'll be okay. It's hard. All I want is to be gone. How am I supposed to argue with that? It would make my life so much easier. All I'd have to do, would be to end it. But it wouldn't make theirs easier.

And if it hurts them, then I guess my freedom will have to wait.",1
Venting,"Hopefully this’ll be the last time I post here but I keep having this thought of “what am I doing? What reward am I trying to achieve?” and granted I have a pretty good paying job but it is so unfulfilling to work but I can’t just up and leave as it pays my bills. What make it’s worst is I can’t find a therapist. I keep feeling angry with myself to be born into poverty and have to work so hard to not be in it. Then there are others just born to into wealth and they can just squander it as they please. But if I fuck up I’m screwed. Then at the end I don’t even get the reward I was originally trying to achieve. I just want my fire back, the fire to create again.

Note: This just me venting my frustrations in hope I just let this feeling pass.",1
functioning but that’s about it,"I have been feeling increasingly depressed for the past year and a half or so. I would say it got much worse after I was involved in an accident that was my fault around that time. No one was seriously hurt but I can’t seem to get myself to let it go. I think it like fundamentally changed how I view myself, and I think deep down I have some unpacking to do re: understanding that I can make mistakes and still be worthy of love and compassion.

I am trying my best to do the things that make me feel better. I make myself exercise for at least 40 minutes almost every day. I make myself go to bed early enough to get 7-8 hours of sleep. I take care of myself and try to eat healthy. I keep my space tidy and clean.

But like, doing that is all I can do. And it takes so much effort. I can barely get into my hobbies these days. I used to draw and paint weekly and now it’s like, maybe once every few months. I just end up feeling paralyzed and blank on what to draw. 

My job is very demanding and high-stress, for not much pay. I want to find a more fulfilling job, but I’m stuck in this like paralysis of feeling that every job will feel like this no matter what I do. And my skill set is so specialized, I feel like I don’t even know what else I could do. Every “entry-level” job I see wants 3-5 years experience. 

I live at least a half hour from most of my friends, so I’ve started feeling more and more socially isolated and lonely. They’re a more spontaneous crowd and tend to just meet up since they live so close, so I don’t get invited to things. I live with my boyfriend but he works odd hours and is tired and not always as romantic/affectionate as he used to be. He is also going through a tough time and doesn’t have the energy to do the extra stuff anymore. What sucks is just not feeling wanted. 

Every day I feel like I’m slowly drowning. My job feels like a dead end, my relationship is losing its spark, I don’t see many friends anymore, I don’t enjoy my hobbies anymore. My self-esteem is on life support. Every day I just wonder if this is it and I feel so empty and sad.

I haven’t told anyone how bad I’m feeling in a long time. My last therapist dropped me suddenly when she switched practices last year, and I always have such a hard time bringing myself to try again when I’ve had shitty experiences in the past. I have suicidal thoughts most days, but I don’t really want to die. I think I just want to feel ok again, but my coping strategies are just not enough anymore.",1

I don't know what to do..,"I am a 22 year old, who is feeling stuck in life. Not sure if this is the right thread of Reddit to post. But I really need some help. I feel like whatever I do is not good enough for my family. Me and my mum have a rocky relationship... which has created a lot of mental trauma for me. I.e. not wanting me to be born, due to my gender. Bodyshaming me for my height ( I am quite short). Or not receiving grades that she wants. Or literally calling me ""not beautiful"", and saying that other people I.e. my cousin is so pretty. I literally can't even work, or walk properly as I am not able to deflect or remove these negative unhealthy, toxic thought from my mind. Even my supervisor told me. And even my friends that I looked depressed. 
I feel like a failure. I don't even know how to cook, or clean properly. And don't even have the courage to get the driving license. As I feel scared.. maybe of failure. There is so much pressure from the family of getting married, and that no one will like me. How am I supposed to get married? If I don't even like myself? And I am not even Independent? I hate how I am so envious of other people.. Envious of them being happy, envious of them being loved in relationships, of having a kind and considerate mum. Envious of career progression in their life.. or being able to withstand negative family problems and still carry out with their lives. I am also struggling with my Deen (relationship with Allah) .. I feel like I am not a good Muslim, I am not consistent on my daily prayers. And they feel forced. I miss that spark .. when I was praying for myself & my own pleasure only. Amd not to please my parents. I also hate how my mum constantly compares me to my brother, bless him he has done nothing wrong. But she keeps on saying how lazy I am and evil. They definitely don't help the already existing negative thoughts that I am having towards myself. I also am struggling immensely with friendships, and being myself in them.. or comfortable.. I constantly feel like I am not good enough, or not as skilled or confident as my friends. I am already in therapy, and my therapist has mentioned to ignore my mum's comments. But it's really hard I don't know.. is this ever going to gey better. Some people might recommend moving out, it's not as cheap, I feel stuck. I also need a job. Or anything to keep me going.

Worst It's Ever Been,"So as long as I can remember there's always been a hint of melancholy below the surface. A single blue flower in a field of sunflowers. Some days the blue would spread to the other petals, others they'd be the natural yellow, and it was a balance that, although challenging, I thought I'd learned to live with. Well, I'm 18 now and something must have evolved because the whole field has decayed.

Depression runs in my family quite strongly, I think I've got it. I thought it was just situational depression (it's not been an easy time) but even after escaping all of it, it's still there, screaming instead of whispering now. I can't picture a future, I can't see myself in this world as anything other than a mistake or a cosmic joke. I feel like I'm simply just not meant for this world. If dying wasn't painful, I think I might have done it by now. I tested those waters fairly recently and I'm too ashamed to tell people close to me about it.

Doctors and therapists tell me all the coping mechanisms but for some reason they never bloody stick, they just slide off my brain the second they land, or they work once or twice but never always. I'm at a really precarious point mentally. I think I'm getting out but I'm still researching the least painful ways to die. I know that logically I don't want to die and that I just want this feeling to end, but if this feeling is clinical and festering inside me forever then isn't it the same difference? Everyone tells me I'll learn to live with it, but I don't want a life where the slightest inconvenience causes some reaction that makes oceans roar in my chest. The past week has been spent crying on the floor, sobbing in the street, collapsing in front of my friends - it's so pathetic. Is life going to be a pendulum swinging between emptiness and drowning in uncontrollable sadness?

I've been planning on killing myself for 6 months now,"(This is extremely long. To have an idea on how long it is, I started typing this at 4:53 pm, and finished at 5:15 pm)

I legitimately have tried my best to at least try to find the bright side to life throughout the 6 months, but holy fuck, it's hard to.  My life has pretty much gotten worse. My family is struggling to find a home as we don't have enough money to stay to where we're living at right now, so we might become homeless. I feel like I genuinely have no one to tell how I truly feel about personal stuff, and life  general. People always say that they're always there if I'm ever feeling a certain way, but whenever I try to text them if I can talk to them, they either haven't seen it for the past couple of days, or they see it, and don't respond. I try to talk to some of my friends in a group we're in, but I always get interrupted in the end, and I feel completely invisible when it comes to me trying to be social in general. I try to talk to my (not so sure anymore) girlfriend, but we barely talk anymore at this point. Yesterday, I called her to try to explain how I feel about stuff, and how I feel like I'm invisible to her, and our friend group, but then she ends up being the one to talk the most, with her saying that me and her should take a break. I don't blame her at all, with her giving some valid reasons, but it gets me sad and kinda fustrated at the fact that I didn't really have the chance to explain how I feel. Things are real awkward now, I get scared to join in any conversation with the group because of what happened yesterday, I get scared that I might cause something within the group, and mess everything up. I feel invisible towards everyone in general, I never really get the chance to speak, as I either get interrupted, or people just kinda trash talk me as a response. I can't even really have an important conversation with my broken family about how I feel with them, because they don't really take me seriously, and they just either brush it off, or yell at me. I feel like I have no one to talk to about how I feel. It's like being trapped in a hole, trying to get dirt to help build yourself back up, but the only way to get the dirt is to dig down. I don't know anymore, I'm only 15 years old. I shouldn't even be thinking about this type of stuff. It's gotten so bad to the point I've been starting to scrape my leg & calves with a knife, and what I find horrifying is that, I don't enjoy it, but yet I do. I know that I'm not supposed to do this to myself but, it's such a relief when I do. I feel so guilty when I do it, but at the same time I don't, I feel like I deserve what I do to myself. Maybe I'm just sounding stupid, or making no sense, maybe typing all of this was just a waste of time, but I'm far into this to stop. I don't know, at this point, I just give up. I tried my best to be happy, but it's impossible. All I ever wished for, was to be happy, and live a happy life, but it seems like that wish isn't gonna come true. I'm sorry if this seems messy, or if it sounds stupid, or if it wastes your time as you finish reading.

On a professional level, I often feel put aside by some of my working mates who keep me away from certain projects, probably because I am a bit too critical and I bring them more problems than solutions. I don't turn in my work on time, I can't find the energy to finish a task quickly and I often forget to call a client back or to give them news. I feel stuck in every aspect of my life. I feel like the noose is tightening and the avalanche of worries that will come down on me is getting bigger and bigger. I feel like I'm going to fall apart and that fighting is no longer a viable option because I'm not making any progress over time, because I keep failing at the same things. I don't know what to do anymore, or how to get out of it.",1
My goal,"I was thinking last night and I would be really happy if I got cancer and was given a year to live, I would be able to experience everything I want before I die, then I would feel like I have lived my life all that I wanted and then even better after I’ve done everything ive wanted to do, I would be in eternal peace",1
I changed my mind,"Realized what’s gone is gone. I can’t go far from that. Don’t wanna interact anymore, exhausting. Can’t change the person’s attitude to me, if the person simply don’t want to get it. I wanna see myself with my little boring life, but mine and happy, not fixated on somebody. Time to really enjoy being on my own, with peace. I feel comfortable with it, yet it craves out of me, interaction and love to people I used to give, because I thought it’s what was worth living for, what I wanted myself, not to please, simply enjoy life like everybody does. I wanna cut this person off completely but I think I’ll do it with time, so many apps where we’re mutuals, it’s in the way. I feel like I just can’t keep up with him, after everything that has been done, even after apology he didn’t change, it’s not even manipulation,it’s just me, it was only me. Cant describe at what low bottom I am rn. I just hope everything will be in it’s right place.",1
Depression turning to anger,"I am getting more and more angry at the fact that mostly everyone I know has a happy and fulfilling life with a partner and fun experiences and friends. Like why don’t I get to feel any of that happiness? What the fuck is wrong with me that this is the life I have to live? Why am I so unlucky? I’m already in my 30s and with each passing year alone I get more depressed. As a woman I will only get less attractive as I age. And now I’m just absolutely miserable to be around because I’m so bitter and I legitimately feel like I have the right to be angry at all these people with such fulfilling lives. Like fuck them. Fuck I hate myself, wish I had the guts to just end it all but I’m too afraid of being unsuccessful and becoming permanently debilitated then my life would be even worse. I wish I knew someone else going through this but I’ve somehow literally never met anyone else with depression. It’s fucked too because I am a relatively normal looking girl with a “successful” career and therapists seem to downplay how I feel because I have a”good job” which I also hate by the way (veterinarian- would not recommend). Fuck I need a way out and I don’t know what to do other than sleep away all my free time because I can’t stand being awake with my thoughts. I am so tired of feeling this way for the last 18+ years",1
At what point do you leave?,"I think I should leave my family. My depression isn’t responding to treatment anymore, I’m still trying and will to continue to try. It has been a lifelong struggle but two and half years ago got really bad and has not lessened at all. I have a husband and two teens. My husband supports us and takes care of everything including me. I’m not really parenting and I’m not really a partner. I think it would be better for everyone if I left and went to stay with my parents. They are retired and could take me to my ECT appointments. It would not be ideal as there is some tension and ugliness, but it’s not extreme. My husband has said it’s not what he wants, but my being here has a negative impact on everyone. It’s so hard on the kids to see me like this. I don’t really trust my judgment anymore and have learned to trust my husband’s judgment when I’m doubting my own, but I don’t think he’s seeing this clearly, doesn’t feel like he can be honest, or both. We can’t keep waiting for it to get better, maybe it will, maybe it won’t, but as of the last two and a half years with no change. It can’t dominate all our lives forever and I think we have to face facts. Thoughts?",1
Explain me something,"Majority of depressed people have difficulties to take pleasure in things, all they want to do is to feel emotions again. I just don’t understand why they are being prescribed drugs that makes you more and more anhedonic.

Phase of depression recovering from chronic stress and anxiety?,"I started complete life changes after 2 years of chronic stress and anxiety. Symptoms include 24/7 horrible full head/brain fog feeling like pressure without the headache or pain(main and worst symptom), unrested sleep, and involuntary head twitching that started in December 2022. Stayed in my house pretty much for 2 1/2 years with most symptoms.

Everything was better initially when I started in January 2023. Better mood, more energy, sleeping better, good dreams, just all that good stuff. Early on I did get sad, regretful when I started going out again and realizing how life kept going on while I shut myself in. This passed quickly as I continued my recovery. Now about 4 1/2 months in I am getting hit with extreme low mood, sadness, dread, loss of interest, and feeling as if I haven't slept at all despite getting 7 to 8 hours upon waking. Depression wasn't even a issue before this at all.

Is this normal? What could be happening now? Is the brain trying to balance hormones? Part of it restructuring itself? I'm at a loss and a bit scared.",1
I dont know,"Hi, I'm(21yo) currently very desperate. The desperation just exploded with my bachelor thesis. Even though I almost have it (only a few details are missing and a few sentences from my conclusion) my consultant is away(work trip) till the due date and 99% can't check it and approve it. Right now I am trying to finish it in tears...

Anyway, I have gf (19yo) for almost 2 years, she is a very good student finishing grammar school, and we decided a long time ago to send applications to really good universities in Denmark and possibly build our future there. But since I might not defend my bc thesis and finish my current university I can not go there. I will extremely piss off my parents and also my gf.

My current university became very stressful for me after the coronavirus lockdown (I had 3 semesters online from my bedroom) I couldn't find many friends. Recently I started crying regularly on my drives back home from the uni. The economics and business mngmt programme I study is kinda interesting to me but for my entire life, I haven't found an area or someone/something I want to become. In Denmark, I chose UI/UX and content creation since I have been goofing in cracked Adobe Photoshop and Premiere throughout my life. And for the past 1.5 years, I have been actively coding html css and did a little online product catalogs for a little company from: styling the products -> photographing -> editing -> putting them online. So I guess this should be my point of interest. 

And here comes my recent indecisiveness. I have trouble getting up in the mornings, I lack motivation. I can't plan my routine. I am acting very lost and frightened in public. I feel extreme pressure to finish my current uni, go to Denmark, accommodate in Denmark, and live there. It's not only this, my gf is not pushing me into anything, she is actually very nice and supportive. But the most pressure I feel is that I disappoint all the people who know me because I become in their eyes the guy who achieved nothing, prolonged his studies, or didn't even finish them...
Sometimes I wonder why she is still with me when I can't come up with nice dates and we only spend time at my place watching movies alone.

I can't get anything done. I start but never finish any work or assignments. My head is constantly spinning between I'm a failure and suddenly it wonders to how many things I could do, that I should go run every morning, study 4 hours a day, write every single line from my lectures, start a business... And I'm the failure cause stopped attending the lectures, procrastinated at the end of the semester, and wrote the thesis very late. But I couldn't persuade myself to do it. Now I don't even know what I want from my life, I'm not sure of anything... This is the indecisiveness I mentioned before.

And now I am a wreck sitting in my room as I do most of the time nowadays. I look out to all the successful former classmates from grammar school or friends building their careers and compare to them. The worst thing is that it shows that I do nothing. My parents see me in my room lying in bed, playing guitar, etc  -> simply procrastinsting and not studying. But I really can't focus on the studies. And I see that the time has been wasted which now eats me inside out on top the my current mood.

I also started thinking about what it would be like to kill yourself. Cause I want the burning pressure to stop when it gets serious sometimes. I remembered, a few years ago having a mental health lecture at grammar school and they asked if we have suicidal thoughts and that it is a bad thing and a lot of people might have them. I thought to myself, that I must be very lucky to have never actually thought about it. But here I am with the thought somewhere deep back inside my mind.

Sorry for my poor phrasing and grammar.
It really helped writting this.",1
I cried.,"For the first time in a long time, I mean it has been years, I cried. I was driving on the highway, alone with my thoughts and my emotions caught up to me. The feeling was unexpected, I didn't mind it though. Having real emotion for the first time in a long time kick me in the face. I can not explain what was happening because it was too much to handle at all. I hardly slept after I got home and just stared at the ceiling and let my emotions control every horrible thought that crossed my brain. It is just the small things that control certain days, sleepless nights and it makes me want to give up. I have just fallen apart to far this time and I certainly do not want to continue with my life.",1

Suicide is my only option now.,"I tried to kill myself when i was 12 years old. I swallowed a bunch of pills and unfortunately, i failed. i felt like nobody cared about me, no one would miss me and that everyone would be better off without me. why i did it? i dont know. my own mom didn’t care about me even after the suicide attempt, nor did she take me serious. that was almost 10 years ago, as i’m about to turn 22. i’ve been dealing with untreated depression for this entire time and it’s only gotten worse. overtime i’ve developed more issues such as social anxiety, persistent suicidal ideation, feeling like everyone hates me, nobody cares, im still not good enough, im boring, and the list goes on and on. it feels like nothing i say or do really matters, i’ll never be free of this thing. i dont want to see a therapist, and some days are better than the rest but the moment i take two steps forwards, i fall 10 steps behind its a never ending cycle.. i dont know what to do. the only thing i can think of is finally putting an end to my misery and killing mysef. a lot might ask what caused me to feel this way, and i really dont know. maybe the years of emotional abuse from my mom? the fact that i’ve never really had friends, everyone leaves me in the end and it does nothing but prove my insecurities and make me feel even worse? i’ll never really know.. it’s just constant headaches, feeling like i wanna die and feeling worthless and unlikeable 24/7.",1
Support for self isolation,"Hi! So I have been struggling with depression for a while now, and a major aspect of my struggle is isolating myself from others. I usually stay in my room and sleep since I don’t have the motivation to really do anything, especially to spend time with people even my family who I am very close with. 

On most websites that cover this subject it recommends going out and spending time with people even when you don’t feel like it, but I have found that even spending time with the people I love and enjoy spending time with the most makes me feel so much worse. I get way more irritable and upset when I’m out spending time with people, and usually this ends up hurting them way more than just isolating myself from them does. Any ideas on how I can improve on this?",1

Most people may not agree with me but some of us men are actually trying to find a mate to actually have a family but most boys get girls pregnant and leave when some of us are actually trying for a family, and then we men get the blame for their ex's mistakes that we didn't even do...

I just can't anymore,"Depression is getting worse. Being around people literally hurts. Everyday, my brain is like static on a TV. It really sucks because I can't articulate anything. I've been dealing with depression for years, and honestly, I'm slowly seeing no point in living anymore. I'm also autistic, and even though I'm high functioning, I can't express myself. I literally don't know how. People laugh at me, make fun of me, and I'm just tired of it. The only thing I want to do, is give into my symptoms. Stop working, going to school, all I want to do is just lay in bed, stare at the wall, and basically wait to die. And I'm 27, so I have a good 50-60 years of waiting to die. Then I feel guilty for feeling this way, because there's people out there with terminal illnesses that just want to live. But I'm just so tired of feeling sad, and so tired of being mistreated and misunderstood. I feel like my Autism is more of a curse than anything. Idk, people are just mean to me, and I'm sick of it. And the only outlet I know is self harm. And I can't so that, because then I'll get thrown into the psych ward again. So all I can do is just bottle it up. When I try to talk about it with my therapist and psychiatrist, my mind just blanks. It's as if my brain was made to torture me. I don't even know how to get my thoughts together to comprehend this, let alone, explain it. I don't even know if what I'm typing makes sense or not. I'm just so tired of feeling so alone.",1
One of the worst things about dealing with depression is just completely neglecting your appearance,I’m on my period right now and I never look good but I look especially horrible.

My life in a nutshell,"I grew up in the hood, I grew up being taught about death, gangs, loveless marriage. I never knew what happiness was. I spent everyday of my life wishing death on myself barricaded in my room because I was hated. I kept myself alive with daydreams believing I could have something more one day I fought hard I clawed my way up I put myself through hell held my head up high through discrimination, sexual abuse, let boss’s believe they had a chance just so I could have a possible future; I did this until it stopped working. My high end life came with a cost which was my soul. I was living in San Francisco being verbally abused by a meth addict, I was abducted and raped by a Lyft driver that got covered up by the company, I was used by socialites for image appearances until there was nothing left inside me. I slept in bed everyday barricading myself once again then I got fired while I was trying to work through it. My mental health issues ruined the job I had to let a boss touch my thigh for. I went back to the valley with family and it’s great I remembered I had a soul but I can see the damage in my sisters life how her upbringing affected her. We were ruined. Our father a liar and a cheater. Our mother who stayed for a better lifestyle. They abused us and now we are all the same. Disasters. I keep thinking what’s the point I went from working in high end positions that I literally bled and sweat for to working in a Taco Bell on the verge of being sued by my landlord because I owe money, about to lose my car; I have nothing. I’m beautiful enough but not enough to fix my issues. As a kid I felt like I was the monster my mother said I looked like wishing I was beautiful thinking if I had it then all my problems would go away but it didn’t it just gave me another set of issues. This world is corrupt our souls darkened. I sometimes wish I was a sociopath so I wouldn’t care. I worked hard to have emotions again I was willing to lose it all but was it worth it? Is living worth it? My life is a curse. I’ve read the alchemist so many times and I keep trying to hold onto the hope my life could be like his or at least similar so that instead of actual treasure I’d fee content or any sort of happiness. I’ve been craving happiness my entire life but I can’t find it the only thing I see is shadows of demons walking the streets of earth. We eat meat of those with emotions and call it survival. We let those less fortunate stay in the streets and call it life. We let the corrupt control us and we call it politics. I can’t take it anymore there’s so much pain everywhere I look and I’m so desperately trying to find the light. I tried going to church and they kicked me out before I got to the door because the conservatives didn’t approve. I’m lost please save me. I’m 23 and I feel like I’ve lived several lifetimes I don’t want to lose the small amounts of humanity I worked hard to find again. Nobody on here will know what to say other than it gets better or a sense of obligation to prevent me from offing myself but truth is you don’t care not really and that’s normal I’m a stranger.

Should I go IP?,I’m tired of living and working I don’t have plans to attempt yet but I’m getting there I feel like a coward for not killing myself and although people say your strong for not doing it I don’t feel it.

Weird depression things,When I was super depressed and extremely suicidal I’d go outside at night and lay on the cold concrete floor and just lay there as if I was sleeping I wasn’t even on drugs and I’d get upset as to why my parents were so like worried because at the time I never saw it as weird.

Dont know who i am anymore and how to gey out of this suicide seems like the inevitable outcome of my existence. Help,"Hi i am a 25 year old male and ive never been a good writer or been very good at describing how but here is me giving it a try .
i feel or maybe it feels that way now because to be honest i feel like i dont even know who i am anymore.
I feel like i have been depressed for most of my life and i feel like i am living through a third person view i can hear see and feel what is around me but it is like i have no emotional repsonse to anything almost as if i was blank. I do not want to live like this anymore sometimes i even ask myself if i even want to live because i dont see the point in anything, everything just seems like a struggle. The hardest part about all of this is, I basically have no social life.

When i look back i never had many friends but i was always outgoing as a young kid   I had a lot of people who wanted to be my friend  thought i was cool but i never knew how to maintain a relationship
Today when i am around people i feel as if i am a ghost and have nothing to bring and give to a conversation i feel empty and hollow, it is almost as if i was a zombie i hear people talk but nothing comes to mind to add it is almost as if i am frozen watching people in my own body not being able to react.
this for me is the hardest part to live with because i just want to be able to have friends and make connections with people more than anything but i just cant seem to do it anymore, it used to be natural when i was younger but it seems to slowly have started to fade away piece by piece.

I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder at around the age of 13 but it has been slowly getting worse as to now feeling like i have severe social anxiety and bordeline agoraphobia.
This is my first time even trying to describe my emotions which is really hard but it feels nice putting them down almost giving me a sense of existence.

I was always passionate about things i would read and learn new topics, i had a deep desire to be alive to feel and be someone i had things to talk about but now i feel as if this is all gone and i really just dont feel anything anymore.
Almost as if my brain does not fucntion everything is hard to do and even feels like i have an attention dissorder at this point where even if i was interested in something i wouldnt have enough mental
Strength to focus on the topic which leaves me wandering through life not knowing what to do or who to be.
I feel like i just getting worse as time goes on and i almost feel like soon i wont even care anymore, i guess since i am writing this i do care and i do want to be here,
But if things keep going this way i just do not see a point anymore, i will probably just isolate myself even more and become suicidal but somwhere deep inside myself i do feel like there is hope, i wish i had a answer to these issues but i dont, i just wish i had someone who could help me figure this out everything just feels so lonely and i do not want to live like this anymore",1
Is depression a part of life?,"First and foremost, don't want to downplay depression. It affects everyone differently. But the question I'm asking here is if everyone eventually goes through depression at some point in their lives. Almost like it's a normal process in life
My depression started when I got my first job when I came to realize that life for me is boring and repetitive. And that life objectively has no meaning, basically nihilism. So now i got curious, if it's part of life why does society choose to ignore it all together? Would be nice to not only say that it's normal but also how can we collectively improve from it",1
Broken because of my academic results.,"I've not failed any course by the moment, but I think I will by the end of this academic semester. This week I've failed two exams and later today I'm sure that I will fail another. I got minimun grades last year (my first) in order to pass the semester. Being an expert procastinator takes this to a whole new level. I never do anything on time and study hours before exams. The reasons of this behavior are my experiences during classes. I'm the one who never answers the professor's questions, the one who's never chosen for any team's work and the one who fails a lot of exams. It's hard to see other people excell and get excellent grades with less effort than me. I struggle a lot to understand what I study and this led me to think about how stupid I am.",1
Point me in the right direction?,"I am aware that Reddit isn’t a medical professional in itself and I’m not asking for medical advice… I’m just truly at a loss and have no idea where to even start.

The anxiety is still there but I’m feeling different than I ever have. Extremely unmotivated, always tired, achy body (with no actual reason), quick to anger, easily overstimulated, the smallest tasks feel SO daunting (brushing my teeth, starting laundry, picking up kids toys, taking dog on a walk), etc. The list goes on and on. 

Do I call my doctor and just say “hey I think I’m depressed”? Do I try to see a therapist? 

I don’t like who I have become- I feel like a lazy POS and a bad mom.

💔38 and never had a boyfriend. It feels like it’s slowly killing me💔,"I’ve dated, had one-night stands, one friend of with benefits.

No one has ever told me romantically that they love me. Or that I’m beautiful (I have been told what features on my body are unattractive by the men I’ve gone out with.)

I sleep with a guy once and they lose interest, so now I feel like my naked body is vile to look at. I go on a date with a guy once, and never hear from him again, so maybe I’m both ugly AND I have a bad personality.

It’s just crushing me. The unyielding loneliness is always there.

I’m tired of people telling me to love myself before someone else can love me. Bullshit. Insecure people find relationships ALL THE TIME.

They say “put yourself out there”. I have a pretty decent social life and don’t get approached romantically. I’ve been on dating apps for 23 years so it’s not like I haven’t blurred that. I go to bars and the only time a male stranger acknowledges I exist is when they’re interested in whatever friend I’m with.

I’m working so hard to stay alive. Other parts of my life are a disaster right now, but the lack of companionship throughout my entire adult life just hurts the most. I don’t know how much longer I can do this.

EDIT: fuck, man. Being a woman sucks ass so much. We’re not even allowed to be sad on the internet without manipulative, evil men trying to use the opportunity for sex.

If you have something to say, you can comment on this post. I’m at least mentally stable enough to see how fucked up it is that guys see this as a dating ad. I just wanted to be with people that could relate to my pain, not people who see my hurt and go “I can work with this.” Your interest in messaging me is manipulative and gross and only adds to my sadness because your interest in me is LITERALLY founded in what you can take from me.

I’d rather kill myself than settle for one you.

If you want to send me a PM, maybe instead call your mother & father and instead explain to them  how they failed to raise a respectable man.",1
40 and still depressed,"I have had depression and anxiety all my life. In my teens and twenties there was enough going on (classes, new jobs etc) that kept me on my toes and too tired to think about how depressing things were. I spent my twenties coming to an empty apartment and sleeping on a comforter on the floor by myself.  Now at 40 I am more depressed than I ever was. I cannot believe that only half my life has passed and I still potentially have another 40 Years of this bullshit. Atleast when I was younger it seemed like it could be a phase or something that will get better... now it's clear it's only gotten worse. I have been on meds and therapy for 10 years and still don't have the drive to want to live another day. 

When you have a physical terminal disease the doctors tell you there is limited time left. But with mental disease they don't... the expectation is that you live your entire lifespan with this suffering.

I want to be happy again And get motivation,"hey i have this problem for a while now i get up and every time i get out of bed i have no motivation to do anything that day. Let's say it's the day before and I say I'll do it etc and then the next day I don't do it anyway. 
I'll start by saying that a year ago my boyfriend proposed to me to do OF and at first it was going well and then at the beginning of the new year I made big progress upwards with OF. That year I really enjoyed taking pictures on instagram and OF and generally staying in and doing something to develop it. Now, in February, my grandfather suddenly passed away and it really upset me because I didn't expect it at all and I was left with just my uncle and my grandmother, who has had 2 strokes and is very forgetful, which makes me very sick of her because she is really annoying a lot of the time. After this death I started to have some strange depressing moments more and more often. My boyfriend was very supportive of me in these moments and even came to the funeral. Since the funeral I have been in a very bad mood at home, complaining about everything all the time, worrying that without my grandfather's pension we won't be able to make a living and arguing with my uncle much more often. He has often threatened to punch me in the face, to throw me out of the house even though I am still a student. I am still studying, but I am finishing school in June and I am going to move to my boyfriend's town (he is studying 300 kilometres away from my town). Since I've been in such a gloomy mood at home, I can see for myself that I'm constantly depressed and generally don't want to spend time at home, because it's really hard to cope with my family since the death. In March I was in a better mood after I had done a lot better in the OF and it gave me a real chance to go far in it and my boyfriend and I were very happy with these achievements. In April I did not do so well in the OF and then I started to fight more often with my boyfriend, among other things when he wanted to take me on a bike and I had forgotten how to ride because it had been a long time since I had ridden a bike. Out of stress I didn't even want to go on the bike anymore and I stayed in the room alone while he went rollerblading. Later he told me a lot that he was disappointed in me because, as he said, 'you don't forget to ride a bike'. He also told me that I was restricting him a lot with the bike. Then my mental state started to deteriorate. I had more thoughts about everything and was generally depressed. Now I still have the OF, but my boyfriend helps me less and I have no motivation, my family is still depressing, I feel unwell at home, I have no motivation to do anything useful, I have no one to whom I can talk about my problems, I hear from my boyfriend that if I go to the gym, etc., it will make me feel better, but I know that it will not.
I wish I had the enthusiasm to do things I enjoyed doing again like I used to and not spend all day crying in bed and wondering about the meaning of my existence. I feel like my boyfriend is cutting and rude to me. I would like to be motivated and get up and do something on social media on OF etc because I want to develop myself but I feel sucked out of any desire to do so. I don't know how to help myself anymore.",1
Suicide is my last and only option.,"I tried to kill myself when i was 12 years old. I swallowed a bunch of pills and unfortunately, i failed. i felt like nobody cared about me, no one would miss me and that everyone would be better off without me. why i did it? i dont know. my own mom didn’t care about me even after the suicide attempt, nor did she take me serious. that was almost 10 years ago, as i’m about to turn 22. i’ve been dealing with untreated depression for this entire time and it’s only gotten worse. overtime i’ve developed more issues such as social anxiety, persistent suicidal ideation, feeling like everyone hates me, nobody cares, im still not good enough, im boring, and the list goes on and on. it feels like nothing i say or do really matters, i’ll never be free of this thing. i dont want to see a therapist, and some days are better than the rest but the moment i take two steps forwards, i fall 10 steps behind its a never ending cycle.. i dont know what to do. the only thing i can think of is finally putting an end to my misery and killing mysef. a lot might ask what caused me to feel this way, and i really dont know. maybe the years of emotional abuse from my mom? the fact that i’ve never really had friends, everyone leaves me in the end and it does nothing but prove my insecurities and make me feel even worse? i’ll never really know.. it’s just constant headaches, feeling like i wanna die and feeling worthless and unlikeable 24/7.",1
should i be getting help,"i hate it all. life is so shitty and i've been in this hole where i can't see any way out besides offing myself. i could talk about how i'm a shitty person and there's nothing that makes me feel good anymore but there's truly no point because *no one's really going to see this anyways*.

to make this short and sweet, **should i reach out to my family doctor as a last resort to things hopefully getting better?** would a chance of diagnosis and medication actually help/do anything? therapy isn't really helping and only leaving me feeling empty or more miserable. it doesn't help that it's biweekly (and no, unfortunately, my mom doesn't believe in mental illness and is already not supportive of paying half of session fees for me going somewhere just to talk). i'm just done with it all. i can't do this. i don't see any point for me to keep living.

i talked to my family doctor early fall about this once but i wasn't honest in fear of not knowing her confidentiality policies. she never gave a certain diagnosis based on our one meet but suggested i go see a social worker or psychologist. here i am now haha :)",1
Catatonic,"Hi, 

I’ve reached a level where I am truly catatonic. I have had anxiety and depression my whole life and find it hard to organise myself, being unable to hold down a job or make any appointments. I know I’ve needed therapy for years and havnt been able to get myself there. I’m now 24 and catatonic. 

I’m so angry at myself",1
I don't understand,"I don't understand why everything I do need to be quick. I don't understand why even when I am doing chores or if I'm doing my things before chores I need to be quick. If I don't, I'll get scolded. I don't understand why I'm not allowed to take my time.

 My parents always scolded me ""I'm always the one doing this, that. You never do anything you're always so slow!"" They said without fail every single day. You might think maybe I'm overreacting or if I'm actually the problem because of what they said. I think so too. But this has been going for so long and it actually affected my mental health and my daily life.

I've always felt rushed. I feel like if I don't do anything soon or if I'm even resting not doing anything I'm useless, I'm garbage, human waste, I never ever do anything! For example, when I'm waiting for the bus even if it is a little late I would be nervous as if I've done something wrong and started waiting outside of my house eventhough it's actually still early.(my bus comes to my house) or when my father came to pick me up from school I need to get on the car fast. Even if I'm a little late because I waited for the kid in front of me to get on their car, I'll be scolded. 

I don't like the feeling of being rushed as if I don't do nothing I'm useless. I can't even take my time because I felt like I'm being wastefull. If someone does something for me I feel like a burden. I always feel restless because I think I don't deserve the time to rest. I need to do anything fast. Fast. I guess that was when I started to hate that word. 

Why do we need to be fast in everything to do? Does this mean we have to die fast too? If we can then I would be glad. But that is the only thing god wouldn't gave me. Even if I prayed I guess I would die if I get little older? I've always wanted to take a look of the afterlife. Whatever it is I hate the need to be fast. But I can't rest myself because it has been embedded in my mind that I need to do something fast. The only time stop was when I'm sleeping. Then I wouldn't have had to worry about anything. In that dream, it was a given that we would be so slow. If only I coulde sleep eternally, like aurora except without the true love kiss. 

When I don't do anything fast, there will be consequences. I.will.be.scolded. No matter where it is. I hate living so much. But I don't have the courage to end my life. I can only hope my natural death would be near.",1

Going through a lot rn,"This is really one of the few only communities i feel comfortable posting this in; I've been suffering a lot, I've sacrificed my own mental health for these past few years to be a genuinely good person. I helped local homeless people by giving them a safe place to stay, do laundry, eat food, give them a contact for applying, etc and i've begun to realize the help ive done is negligible, none of them have I substantially changed their lives for the better, and in rare cases there are people that take advantage of my kindness and charity. I have taken in local feral kittens as a foster parent, but it hasnt reduced the overpopulation of cats, and the people who feed them. I have helped run a political organization, i networked and made other contacts, i wrote theory and did commissions so our org would get sponsers, only for it all to fall in on itself as other leadership fell into dogma and ideological division. I have made a nice community of friends online, but I have made even more enemies because of my convictions, untop of that as cool as internet friends are, by all intense and purposes, irl i am a hermit, i have no real friends near me, and it has made me feel emotionally isolated. My mental health doesnt get better whether im online or offline, and psychiatrists have betrayed my trust, choosing to target the voices i hear, even though they helped my mental health, rather than targeting my anxiety, anger issues, depression, insomnia, and nihilistic thoughts. Everything in my life has also just gotten worse, I'm extremely poor, and even worse now as my food stamps dropped. I have neurological conditions that are progressively getting worse, which has led me to applying for disability. My phone is going to shit, and i dont find happiness in the hobbies i used to find happiness in, and instead they cause me misery and stress. Also the enemies i have developed, were all once longstanding friends i used to have, who built trust up overtime, which id difficult with my bpd and other prior betrayals of trust, but many still betrayed me to stand with my former abusers, because they didnt like my backlash to him. They also have gaslighted me, minimized my issues as being online too much, even though im the only person in the community who has repeatedly left the internet for extended periods of time. Also many have started lying about me, and calling into question the validity of my neurodivergency, my past traumas, my grandfather being anishinaabe, my disabilities, and even my queer identity. And to top it all off, because of my constant excommunication from leftist communities, and my low economic standing, theyve been able to do more for others than i have, even though i put more of my energy into it, which its good, except because of that, theyve been holding that over my head as well. They have done a lot to stain my image, and have made this a constant topic, simply to use me as a lolcow.

*Edit: I forgot to include, that i have been constantly busy, unable to really focus on myself, I babysit, I help the church, i help my neighbors, etc untop of this, i was recently a victim of sexual harassment*",1

At breaking point,"I lost my son 3 years ago, almost to the day. 11th May 2020 he was born sleeping. 

I fell into a downward spiral and I haven’t been able to come out. 

I was diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety and PTSD. The doctors told me I can’t work or drive until I get treatment which is ridiculous as due to the waiting lists in the UK, I have been waiting for 2 and a half years for the community mental health team.

In the meantime I have been trying to get help, by contacting charities and joining support groups (online and in person). I have been trying to get out of the house but I have a panic attack the second I try to step of the door alone. I’m 24 and having to rely on my mum to help me leave the house.

I just feel really miserable about myself and even showing my face feels wrong.",1
Just a long rant from an insignificant guy,"I went through a series of depression due to lockdown before. I felt so useless because I was fired from my job, and finding new jobs had been fruitless effort. I don't have any money to provide for my two kids, and had to solely depends on my wife income (she's a public servant, so her being fired is almost impossible). I tried my hands at several things, trying my best to find an income to at least pay my bills and commitment, but none yield any results. Banks had been chasing me to pay my mortgage and car loans, adding to the pressure. Because I am somewhat religious, I do not have any suicide thoughts, but the thought of dying is better than living kept lingering in my mind.

As luck would have it, mid 2021 I got a job offer at a startup company (at the time I don't care what it is, I just applied randomly), and I immediately joined the company, despite the salary offered far lower than my previous job (12k a year compared to 78k a year in my previous job). The job itself is mentally draining, but I had determined to prove myself.

So within a year, I went from the lowest position to being one of the top management, and my salary increased to 30k a year. I had my goals to help this startup company to become at least medium sized company. The job is hard, with me often staying in the office after 10 p.m. even though there's no overtime pay, dealing with clients, messy process and issues working with partner company. But I persisted. I have clear goals, and with my experience, I know what to do. The salary still not enough, but at least I can pay part of the commitment I have while the rest I refinance to pay lower amount.

But then, at the end of last year, my mom fell ill (heart attack, stroke, and malnutrition). Malnutrition part is due to wrong advise given by the nutritionist (my mom opted for APD dialysis, but the nutritionist gave the diet for normal dialysis). I took a month break from working to take care of my mother and my kids (my parents took care of them when me and my wife work).

In that time, apparently, my assistant wasn't able to cope well with the job I had given, and tendered her resignation to the owner of the company. The owner, called everyone from my department and apparently almost everyone have a problem with me. The main issue, I was not a ""leader"", but a ""manager"". Now the owner of the company became emotional and he dropped me from the position I held at the time, and told me to do other things, without listening to my side of the story.

From then on, he kept dismissing my ideas, highlighted my mistakes frequently without looking at what I had achieved, and held meeting daily to see what I have done for the day. The consequences of dropping me from the position I held? The department is crucial due to the bulkiness of profits comes from my department, but now it is mismanaged, there's no clear goals, and dissatisfaction among the clients kept on rising. Several signs of a failing business had begun to emerge. I myself had lost motivation. It became harder and harder for me to stay after hours like I previously did, and even the smallest matter made me take leave. I couldn't stay there.

My wife's attitude with me had changed since I got fired, and she seems to lost her respects to me (I think this is part of the things that spark my depression in the first place), as I couldn't provide for the family. But nowadays my wife's attitude had been getting worse and worse. She lost her temper almost everyday, and kept shouting and screaming at me, in front of the kids. I tried my best to be patience, but it broke my heart. My kids too seems to have followed their mothers footstep, yelling and screaming at me when I didn't adhere what they wanted. I still love them, but I don't know how long I could hold on.

I usually have three places that becomes my solace, where I feel happy to be there and it helps me deals with my stress. But now, the three of them, the office, my home, and my parents home, had become the worst hell for me. I am dying inside. My tears aren't coming out anymore. The feeling of thinking that dying is better had resurface. I saw graves, and thought that how good it is if it was me in there. I saw a fatal traffic accident, I thought how good it is if that was me. I still held the believe that suicide is not the way, but still, death seems to be the sweet release from all of this.

If anyone read this until this part. Thank you. I had no place or outlet for me to rant. To express what I felt inside. To meet with psychiatrist is not something I have money to spend on. In fact, currently I only have 50 bucks in my pocket to last me for two weeks. This is how I get by every month. So, this is the only place I can rant anonymously. Again, if you read until this part, thank you, from the bottom of my heart.",1
I feel unwanted in my home...,"A little context before we start: I am 20, and suffer ADHD (likely turned bipolar but have no official diagnosis), and depression. My mood swings and behaviour makes me believe its no longer ADHD but bipolar disorder instead. Please note that I am currently jobless, so while I don't pay rent, I do cook and clean, and generally make sure my younger sisters don't do anything stupid. Anything I do use up, I replace it if possible using my own savings. 

My dad and I have not gotten along since I was 13. At first it was just typical teenage rebellion stuff. While my mum and I have always had a close relationship. She was the person I could go to and talk to about my problems. She understood me, and she was my rock. My dad however...due to how he was raised he is not like my mum. He has no empathy (sympathy in case I'm getting these mixed up again) for anyone, doesn't understand what to say and when, and does not seem to understand that his blatant comments are hurtful to me. Sometimes I feel like he's being intentionally hurtful. Our personalities clash violently, so when we get in an agrument we tend to say really hurtful stuff we don't actually mean. We know when the other doesn't mean it because we don't say that same thing again later, its always something different. 

I know he favours my younger sister (15). She's like him in every way. No empathy (or sympathy), loves trucks, wants to be a diesel mechanic and drive machinery etc. He lets her get away with almost everything and this is admittedly the source of a lot of our fights. While he lets her get away with everything, he's constantly on my back about stuff I did, stuff I didn't do, stuff I need to do and what I shouldn't do. From age 14, he has treated me like the source of his problems, but never outright hurt me, laid his hands on me or said the worst stuff, he just acted like I could do no right. 

Recently, we have had more arguments than normal. I recently finished a contract to study a Cert III in Business, and currently have no job but I am actively looking for work, I actually have an interview next week so it is not like I'm sitting around doing nothing. I clean each morning: empty the dishwasher, tidy off the bench and clean it, and even vacuum the floors of dirt and kitty litter, and anything else. Sometimes when I'd get home from work I'd do the cooking but that wasn't often. Now, unless my parents have something else in mind I'm cooking almost every night. He comes home to a tidy house, a hot meal, and still often complains or has an attitude with me. 

Every single fight we have now, he has picked up the tendency to tell me: ""if you don't like how I run this house you can move out'. He was telling me this before I finished my work. Keeping in mind I wasn't earning a lot. I was making 25K annually as a trainee, so even if I'd gone for a Cert 4 and stayed in the job I still would not have been able to move out and stay out. But even after i finished work he still tells me to move out if I don't like it,  he knows I can'tleave otherwise Id be homelessand he doesn't care. I feel unwanted in my own home. Every time he tells me these words I cry myself to sleep. Sure we argue but I still love that man. I always worry for him, I always love him even if he treats me like a 2nd class citizen and favours my sister over me. I feel unwelcome in my own home and I am constantly reminded by him and my sister that: I have no friends, I don't have a job, and I'm single. I am constantly made to feel like I don't matter and I'm getting so exhausted that death sounds good right about now. 

I've been considering death for a while now, thinking about how I'd do it, when, how long it would take. And then I'd ponder: would they miss me? Would they even care? My mother does not call him out when he makes these comments and it makes me feel like I can't trust her to have my back. They don't seem to realise my lashing out is a cry for help, and even now as I'm typing this I'm crying after being told earlier tonight to move out. If he wants me out I'll go, but I know if I go he won't help with the house. He won't keep my sisters in check, they wont pass inspections because he can't even wash a dish and I know mum will divorce him when it becomes too much for her. I don't want to leave my mum alone to them but I don't want to keep enduring this. I can't take it any longer! My sister expects me to take her out places, buy her nice things but doesn't want to be nice to me in return, and my dad wants me to contribute around the house but cant even see the effort I'm putting in now. I've put in so much that my hair is falling out, I can't sleep, and while my appetite is still in tact, I know if this goes on that'll die too. 

Every time he says these awful words I die a little more inside and I'm exhausted.....I just want it all to stop. I feel alone, I just want someone to hold me and tell me its going to be ok. But I don't even want to go to my mum this time, as I worry she's going to get mad or tell me I'm being dramatic.....

Sorry this was so long but I needed to get this off my chest....thank you all for listening and I'm sorry if I'm taking up your time internet strangers...",1
Scared of psychosis,"When I was little I also had this long-running delusion (I think it would be called a delusion?) that my dad was going to kill my mom and I. I had no basis for this except that he owned knives, a gun, and he was very avoidant so if I suspected he was annoyed I thought it gave evidence for him wanting to kill us. This delusion got weaker over time and now I don't believe it at all. I told a therapist about this but she never commented on it or brought it up again.

A few years ago I was so depressed that I felt like I was losing touch with reality. I was convinced that my family and my ex knew I was planning to kms. My ex had texted me asking how I was and I remember being so paranoid and thinking, ""How does he know?"" I texted my cousin asking if she said anything to him since they he had contacted her before asking about me. I thought my parents had contacted him and told him to text me. I texted her again saying, ""I feel like I'm going crazy, everyone is trying to stop me but they're not confronting me"" or something along those lines.

Now it's 3 years later and I'm really depressed. I worry that I'll start being paranoid again because I feel pretty detached from everything and hopeless. I also have trauma and I've been triggered lately, which causes me to dissociate. That feeling is really scary because I'm already worrying about losing touch with reality to the extent that I become psychotic.

I watched like two videos of psychotic depression and they said how nihilistic delusions can be stuff about how nothing matters, you don't matter, etc. I mean isn't that just depressive thinking? I feel that way now so am I delusional? Please someone tell me I'm not crazy.",1

I am scared i am not good enough,"I am 16 f and a sophomore. Years ago, when I began school, I instantly made friends. I am told of how I had an outgoing and bubbly personality and I remember how I always tried to be friends with everyone. There were three of my closest friends C, A, and K. I considered C my closest friend due to how much we talked, yet one day she stopped talking to me and A quickly followed. Soon K became my closest friend for 5 years and we were inseparable, until the same thing happened. She ghosted me and acted like she didn’t know who I was. In middle school I was alone due to this but made a friend D. D introduced me to her friends and we all began to become a very tight knit group. Last year, as a friend of 6 years and treated like family, she ghosted me. This year we share classes together and even were paired in class work, yet she acted like she didn’t know me. After being almost entirely alone for a while my sophomore year began where I met 3 really good friends. But I’m scared. Am I the problem? I have always had people walk out on me so it must be me who is in the wrong? I’m scared my 3 friends will end up hating me like before I am terrified of being alone and depressed again. Please provide some advice!",1
Anything after death?,Do you think there is anything after death? I don’t know if it’s scarier if there is or isn’t. If it’s just going to be nothing forever or eternal torment. Nothing kind of sounds nice in some ways. It’s not as if I’ll be cognizant of any of it. But the eternity of blackness scares me. One day i’ll find out. And so will you. Maybe sooner rather then later. Who knows?,1
Life really keeps telling me to stay down,"After years of being depressed I started to hate on the way I look, of how much I've gained weight. So for the first time in 9 years I decided to go to the gym, I was doing great the first month, then... I got COVID 3 months ago, since then I can't go to the gym anymore. 

Doing anything just destroys my lungs, I kept going from time to time to see if anything improves but no, I went yesterday and after my first set I was done and had to take a seat because I  felt dizzy. Also I've been coughing since day one, so much that if I speak for a long period of time either I start to cough a lot or just get out of breath and need to breathe calmy again. 

My doctor said that even if I was vaccinated the virus just damaged my lungs a lot and they probably would never be like before. I'm 28 years old and I feel that life just wants to keep me down.",1
Does it stop sometime?,"I've been struggling with depression since I was 14. Now I am 18 and it didn't got better at all but I am young, I am just 18 years old. I can't imagine that I have to live my whole life whit that so does it stop when I get older eventually? I dont want to live like that",1

I miss my little mermaid so much,"We broke up weeks ago for various reasons, and everyone keeps telling my that things will get better, get easier with time, but it isn't it's only getting worse. I can't go 1 hour without thinking about her, or worrying if she's safe and alright. Other times I wonder what's going to happen to us when she feels ready to talk to me again.

Will she still love me, will she even want me in her life? Is it even possible for a LDR to work out after 2 past breakups, or am I just telling myself that it is so I don't hurt myself again. I'm so tired of waking up every day with a weight on my chest and heart. I'm so tired of not having someone to love and take care of. Someone I can give hugs and cuddles to everyday, and who will give them to me when I need them.

Honey if you somehow find this, I still love you with all my heart. I hope your safe and your life has been kinder to you since we cut contact, and I hope everyone at your house is doing okay. Say hi to Izzy and Bently for me and keep her safe.

*blows a kiss and holds my hand over my heart* I love you my little mermaid, more then anything",1
Ghosted again,"I don't understand what's wrong with me. We were getting along well and then they just cut off contact. This always happens, especially when I was looking forward to interacting with them. Just today my therapist of all people said they couldn't help me, which isn't a surprise because I don't need therapy, I need to not be me.

I should just stop getting my hopes up- I have nothing to live for.",1
Why keep going?,"Anyone else feel like there isn’t a light at the end of the tunnel?! 

I feel like no matter what I do, there isn’t a light at the end of the tunnel. 

I try to do things that would improve my mental health but I feel like everything makes it worse. I don’t feel like going on…

I lost my dog of 12 plus years. I got her in 2010 at 16. I’m now 29. 
And lost her in February this year 2023. 
Idk when the pain will stop. 
I feel like something is missing. 
I got her when I found out I couldn’t have children at 16 due to cyst that over grow and don’t she’d probably.
She filled that void for me. 

Now what?! 
I’m dead and broken.",1
"Existing, not living","A year ago i was released from the hospital. I knew then that it would be my last admition, no matter what. I have accepted that i will die by suicide at one point or another, be it 1 month or 50 years from now. I have tried to get better, i really have, but i no longer have any intrest in trying.



I am just existing for my loved ones, not living. And i have no intrest in living, i have no intrest in getting better. I am not as severly depressed as i have been earlier, everything just is. It's not good, not bad, it just is. I am not alive, not dead, i just am. I have no desires, no wants, no dreams. I'll just keep existing for a while longer for those around me.",1
Called a bum even though I’m really struggling. I hate myself and everything.,"I typically never feel the urge to post about my negative feelings but this instance really left me broken. Today, my parent kept “jokingly” referring to me and a bum, as I graduated a semester early and don’t work (I guess tutoring doesn’t count…) or drive. Taking a difficult course load with depression last year and the first of last year really exhausted me and I needed this semester for a mental break. My cognitive difficulties make learning news things very difficult and I have a very difficult time processing most things, so the smallest tasks feel like a difficult struggle. Because these tasks feel so difficult, I fall into a vicious cycle of fear and avoidance. 

However, my parent referring to me as a bum today really hurt, as they have done this before in the past but I shrugged it off.  This really hurt, because the smallest task feels so difficult, and I would do anything to get rid of my cognitive difficulties and lead a productive life, buts it’s not so simple. Being called a bum reminds me of how much of a loser I really am and makes me want to give up on life. Maybe I’m not good enough and will never be able to do well in university. I feel so broken right now and feel like there’s no hope for the future if I have trouble understanding the smallest things. Maybe I am just a bum, and objectively they would be right. I have no job, can’t drive, and absolutely no friends. If I were to die, very few people would care…I don’t  know why I’m especially sensitive today, but this really hurt because I’m trying my best (working hard on a driving course and preparing for several musical competitions) but don’t see any progress…

Has anyone else experienced being called lazy or a bum when they are really struggling? I feel like the signs are so obvious (not eating, sleeping too much, social isolation) but people are quick to judge tiredness and sadness as being lazy…",1
Controlling Life,"Hiii, Why sometimes i feel like someone is controlling my life. Whatever i do, it goes against me.

There are so many things I *want* to do on a daily basis, but I just can’t do them. What is one painting going to do for my life? What is one walk or one run? One shower? One meal? It’s all pointless. Even the seemingly helpful things feel so unhelpful and pointless. I’m so tired of battling myself, and I can’t imagine doing it for the rest of my life. I don’t want to. I’d rather just stop existing. The thought of having to deal with this forever is rage inducing.",1
My life is all F'D UP. What do I do...,"I'm turning 17 in 7 days. I've been dropped out of school for a year. I work at a fucking Hardee's with a manager who screams at me infront of customers and another male manager who makes me uncomfortable. I don't get to save my money because my family is poor I have to use it to buy groceries. If I quit my job we won't have money for food. I live in a trailer and my mom is homeless 700 miles away. The only person who really gave a shit about me just died. I have no friends or anyone to talk to, and even when I make a friend I have no motivation to commit to being friends with them. I can't get therapy. I just wish I wasn't born because this is getting too much for me. I can't kill myself because my family depends on me. I want to get my GED and maybe get a fine arts degree and transfer to university because I've always wanted to be an art teacher. Everyone told me that would be impossible so I just don't try anymore. I know I'm young and I ""have time to fix this"" but the pressure right now is TOO MUCH.",1

I try to be likeable and to be nice to people I care about but I just always get the feeling I’m not even wanted around or that if I wasn’t there it wouldn’t even be noticed.

I wanna die so badly and I think I should rod in hell,"Hey there,

I don't even know where to start. My life took a big nosedive ever since 2020 (not because of covid-19).
Reason was that my father, who lived one house further did terrorize me and my mom. He was screaming, hit the windows at like 2:00 or 3:00 AM in the morning and even broke one of our windows and stole some stuff from our house, insulted me and my mom heavily and even damaged both of our cars slightly.
He began drinking again at the end of 2019. Basically this stuff was ongoing for like a year. We did sue him many times and we called the police nearly everyday. But they couldn't do anything because when they came he behaved normally. It's hard to explain the details tbh.
From this point ongoing I was getting even more depressed than I have already been. I performed badly in school, bad at work and all because I had so many sleepless nights without any hope.

Then we moved out of our home where I've grown up at the start of 2021. Surely the situation was getting better because my dad couldn't find us anymore and we had peace. But the more time has passed the more I realized that I didn't heal. 

Before I was a rather emotional kind of person. I could feel empathy for people around me. I could feel fear, sadness, happiness and I were able to listen carefully when people where talking to me and I could remember most things.
Now I think im such a mess. Anything from the above I can't do anymore. It's like I'm another person and rarely it feels scary. But to be honest I don't care anymore about anything in my life. 

I have a girlfriend I am dating nearly 5 years now. The first two years everything went amazing and I truly enjoy my time with her. She helped me alot and I am more than grateful for her. But ever since my trauma starting from 2020 to 2021 I behaved like another person, which she told me aswell. I don't know how to communicate anymore. Everytime she wants to talk about our relationship and how to save it etc. my mind is just blank. I can't think of anything and how to even sort things out. She is mad at me and tells me that she's tired to come to me to sort things out. I should be coming to her now. But I just never know what to say.
I think I even became kind of unable to relate. I don't feel anything like love or attachment anymore. Not only for my gf. Just with nobody (same as my family). So it's hard for me to even figure out how to fight for this relationship.

My life is so meaningless to me everyday I search up for ""quickest"" methods to suicide. But fuck me I seem to be too scared to finally do hang myself or something.
I don't deserve to be here anymore and I'm sure everyone would be happier if I would die already.

If it wasn't enough I am addicted to masturbation and nail biting alot. Especially the part about masturbation fucks me up mentally since I do waste hours on it every other day. And my pervertions go to a level where it isn't considered normal aswell.

Just wanted to write my thoughs out which are killing me inside.
Fuck me. I should really rod in hell.",1
hit a down period again,i’m used to it at this point. every stretch of a couple days that i feel happy i know that the happiness isn’t going to last for long. any small thing that makes me a little bit sad will derail the happiness/ contentness i felt and send me down the spiral. i go through ups and downs but its kind of like 2 weeks of anxiety and depression followed by 3 days of relative mood stability and a little bit more happiness. but yeah i hit the low period a couple hours ago. it was fun while it lasted.,1
How do you talk yourself out of bed on bad days?,"Virtually nothing brings me any joy or fulfilment, I just always have tasks I have to get through. I have nothing to look forward to. I know it will be healthier to get up, get clean, maybe exercise outside and be around people. But it feels so hard and so pointless. How can I talk myself out of bed?",1
Starting to feel better,"Life has started to get a lot better once I stopped reading the news. I find I am less worried about the future, which has been a huge concern of mind since COVID, and feel a little more in control of my own life. Highly recommend just disconnecting from being informed by any news source. These articles are meant to trigger you. You are not getting informed about things you can actually change the outcome significantly (unless your one of the millionaires/billionaires on this sub reddit whom are depressed). It is such a struggle to just make a comfortable living in this world, and I just don't have the energy anymore to keep up with all the problems in the world.",1
My life is torture 16f,"I hate myself, and everyone around me. I can’t properly express myself without being treated like an alien. Nobody around me understands, even my own father. Never had the chance to make genuine connections because I’ve moved around so fucking much because my mom has extreme paranoia which makes her think people know who we are, or that we’re famous or something.

Almost got raped, and basically got coerced into sexual acts twice. One of my only friends doesn’t even respond when I’m trying to open up. One of my recent crushes blocked me after I opened up about cutting myself. Even tho she said she’d always be there for me. Had to move to 4 different fucking schools just this year. 

Got locked up in a mental institution twice. Been to like 9 or 10 schools total. Fucking bullshit man. Never got the chance to experience high-school normally. Probably won’t even go to prom. I’m probably gonna fail junior year. But I don’t care. I wish I could gain the courage to kill myself, im so close to just saying fuck it. 

I’m a porn addicted pervert who objectifies women. Why shouldn’t I die. The world would be better off without me. No one would care or miss me. I have no future, and he’ll even if I did idgaf. I hate living.",1
Its a repeating cycle.,"There are days where I am more motivated than ever to better myself. To find myself. To explore my thoughts and see where it may lead. 

Honestly, it helps me study better when I feel this drive of hope that I will be okay. I am almost a second year med student. 

After every exam the cycle ends. I crash. I lose myself. I dwell on how much I miss ex. I think about how heartbroken I still am. Im miserable. 

Its a mental game. I battle this everyday to not let my depression cause me to flunk out. I am convinced that I am so unhappy because I still want my ex back. Its been almost 6 months since we broke up. 

Studying majority of the day and taking multiple exams a week truly keeps one from trying to improve themselves. I tried new hobbies and socializing more. Its not working. 

I just dont care anymore to try to explore who I am now. It puts me so behind on school. How will I ever know who I really am? How will I ever move on from someone I still love? The cycle keeps getting longer and I need to break it.",1
An eternity of hopelessness,"For half a year I plowed to invest in something, but something felt better than Don Quixote disappeared, just like in my country the work, she  fled, having withdrawn all the money from the common fund, something left me like an idiot and I became bankrupt.

  
and when in the morning I look out the window, the street is dark full of people, but I don’t see anyone - only inadequate alcoholics who don’t care about all people for a long time, that’s why the world is going to the bottom.

  
why is it not embarrassing to anyone, only to me alone for the fact that a girl buys me food, and we sell the bike that i gave her because I can’t survive in fucking hell

Having a weak moment,"I’m having one of those moments where the sadness is so overwhelming. I realize that I’m falling short on so many things and have always been trying to measure up to impossible expectations to combat my crappy upbringing. I’m a failure as a wife, a friend, a daughter, an employee, and just a human being in general. I hate myself, how I think and how I act. And now I sit here thinking all of these and see myself as even more of a failure. Sometimes I feel like someone else deserves my life and the opportunity to do something better because I will never be more than I am not. It gets so hard to keep going. Depression feels like it’s engraved in my DNA. How do I escape it? Can I ever escape it?",1
How do I entertain myself when nothing is entertaining anymore?,"I got laid off and have been unemployed for about 7 months now, and as anyone who has been unemployed recently can imagine, it’s not for lack of trying. I’ve never had this much difficulty finding a job and I’ve lost all hope.

Currently, I have no hope but to live with my similarly severely depressed mom who doesn’t have any friends and uses me as an emotional crutch bc she doesn’t have anyone in her life except me. I find it extremely triggering bc being forced to hear her vent (sometimes about the same thing multiple times a week) reminds me of my own lack of independence. Therapy is not really an option bc therapists aren’t available in her language and her English is not good enough to express complex emotional feelings. 

I’m at the point where I can’t use anything as an “escape” anymore bc I’m unable to block out the feelings of hopelessness enough to engage in anything anymore. Even short youtube videos are not distracting anymore. The only thing that I have the energy to do at this point is stare at the ceiling the entire day until I fall asleep, and repeat that the next day. But that doesn’t seem realistic. If my life is going to be reduced to that, it doesn’t seem worth to stay alive, as much as I want to. It just doesn’t like I’m meant for it.

Really appreciate any advice/input.",1
I feel so empty these days,"The last few weeks, I have felt so empty and numb. It's not a simple feeling of sadness. I can't easily describe it. I rarely eat, I don't shower, I rarely even get out of bed. I don't really talk to my friends or partner much. Not even my roommates. I kinda just lay here, wishing the universe would end.

There's no trigger. It's been a gradual progression to this point. I tried getting involved more, going out more, doing things. But it all just kept losing its luster. Nothing is enjoyable, anymore. I only turn on music or TV for background noise, and can't even enjoy my usual go-to songs/shows. I still go to appointments and such, but I typically don't really want to. I just feel obligated.

I'm not suicidal. Honestly, suicide and even self-harm feel like they require so much energy, and I definitely don't have it. If the universe would just cease to exist all at once, that would be ideal. That way, no one would have to mourn anyone else's disappearance.

Anyway, I'm gonna go have a big cup of cherry Kool-Aid and dissociate for a while. Thanks for listening.",1
Just to be a great parent,"I can’t tell you how many times I have wanted to “unalive” myself or just pack my shit and run away to countryside Uruguay or something.

I’m good looking, I get compliments all the time and my boyfriend makes a point at how many comments I get.

Im literally the person I would want to marry lol, I love myself and I feel like if I was alone I might be happier? I’m constantly crying and punishing myself but I admit I hide it pretty well from others. The only reason I stay around is because I have a child who I want to give a better childhood than I had. I look at her and she’s so confident and happy and brave and smart, but I’m doing this all alone with no support and I need help I really do but I can’t stop letting the intrusive “whoever comes along to help you is gonna disappoint you the moment you really need them” and I want to stop these thoughts!

I don’t know what to do anymore aside from wasting away in bed. I barely eat and can’t focus on studying because I feel so pissed at how useless i am. I don’t feel particularly close to anyone in my life to talk about this with (and frankly, don’t want to anyways).I don’t want my friends to see me like this because I’m scared I’ll accidentally snap at them but it’s just so exhausting being cheerful all the time. For a few weeks I’ll be okay but I keep relapsing to this state and it just gets harder each time to pull myself back up.

I Messed Up Somewhere Along The Line,"26 years old, male. 

Military veteran. College-educated scientist. Definitely been ""gifted"" and ""higher learning ability"" all my life at the cost of severe social and generalized anxiety disorder and major clinical depression.

Bounced between careers. Army, secondary education, laboratories, warehouses. Bounced around multiple states. Don't have many real-life friends anymore. Cost of living has officially spiraled, and probably going to try to live in the car and try to figure out communal places for vets/homeless or something due to rent being this unreal.

Had girlfriends before, but haven't met a woman my age in like 3-4 years. All the apps are infested with bots. Definitely missing intimacy and just flirting in general.

Was a gamer for 24 years since before I could read, write, or talk. Played so many games on so many platforms that it all feels the same. Gaming isn't really fun anymore.

Got into drawing and painting, had fun, but got tired of it real quick.

Body works fine for now albeit unable to eat much or put on any weight and tired of being this skinny or weak but always had stomach problems i.e. nausea, unable to consume large quantities of food.

Feel like I really REALLY messed up somewhere along the way with the majority of my life and goals, and not sure to do, or where I messed up, but I don't find enjoyment from anything I used to, I've tried enough new things for a lifetime, and I don't see stability in my career, financially, and without those - DEFINITELY not in finding a partner or connecting with humans again emotionally.

I can't be the only one.... right?! Oh, please tell me this feeling is normal. Just lie to make me feel better even if it's not LOL!

I need help dealing with being a short man,"I am in my early twenties and am 5’6.5”. I have a hard time with women and so do my other short friends. My tall friends have a much easier time. 

I have a good physique, I have a very solid degree, and I’m generally well-liked and often make people laugh.

I constantly feel inferior to bigger, taller men. I train bjj but I know that most bigger guys could still beat the shit out of me. I’ve seen women approach my taller friends frequently. They also match with attractive women on dating apps, whereas I only match with overweight and/or unattractive women. I’ve learned to stop caring what women look like, but my friends and men in general will bash me for the girls I date/sleep with and generally respect me less because of this. 

I’ve spent an ungodly amount of time working out and paying attention to my nutrition in order to work on my physique, but no matter how hard I work, I will never be as physically attractive or powerful as a guy who is 5’10”.

I feel like I will never be respected or seen as dominant. I feel like this is a huge component of sexual attraction for women that I’ll never be able to satisfy.

I have dealt with relentless emasculation and depression largely due to this for about a decade now. I don’t mean to complain and I know this is incel shit but I just need help. I don’t know how any guy deals with this. Feel free to check my post history for more context. Thank you.",1

why is adulthood so lonely?,"im 33 and ever since ive left college i feel like i've just been consistently trying to process/deal with feeling overwhelmed by how lonely and isolating adulthood is. Everyone i know is busy enough where i only see my 'friends' once every 3 months(at best). I get it, kids, jobs, im not blaming people. When trying to meet people, its like swimming upstream to find people with any common interests, and even harder finding someone that has chemistry with you. i have chronic digestive problems so i cant really go out to eat or drink, which makes up a majority of how adults socialize from what i can tell. To be entirely honest, i dont like doing that anyways, i find no joy in being surrounded by loud strangers, so while most people are grabbing a drink to feel connected, i only feel isolated. 

 I have a helpful strategy of being paranoid of my depressive thinking patterns, but its not as effective here because while I feel like ive lost my passion for anything i was passionate for, im starting to get paranoid that my depression is either so invasive that its tricking me into believing life is this empty, or (when i think about it logically) being a lonely human all the time is making me depressed and passionless. I spoke to my girlfriend about joining clubs to try to meet people and i literally have zero interest. I hate large groups of people, and meeting new people in this manner. I just get anxiety and i will feel uncomfortable the entire time, and not to be overtly negative, but ive tried it enough times with no success that ive lost my desire to 'get back out there' so to speak, because its always amounted to lost time and stressful experiences, and having a lot of phone numbers i dont want to call.

Anyways, the one thing i miss about my college experience was having a community of people i would see every day that was working on the same goals and could help eachother out, or hangout regularly. Now it just feels like im floating in a sea of nothing, waiting for a random ship to sail by, and im not looking forward to doing this for another 20, 30, or 40 years. This isnt fulfilling. I genuinely don't like living like this, and frankly, im surprised anyone does.",1
Numbness and fatigue,"I feel like I'm going on new level of numbness that I have never felt before. I also feel fatigued and just want to sleep all the time. I recently tried my best to surpass my own emotions and I worked to be emotionless because the other way around was killing me quite literally. It was the only way to cope with the amount of suicidal thoughts and constant anxiety attacks.I don't feel anything, no happiness, no sadness, no nothing. I just exist in this weird state. I don't really get bothered by the things. I am absolutely terrified of how strongly I feel everything once I let myself go. I don't know exactly what happened recently with me. Anyone else?",1
Depression Mouth Gets Me Fired,"Before major depression I was more AGREEABLE and more extroverted. After major depression I am more DISAGREEABLE and more introverted. Problem is that my career is in healthcare sales and being disagreeable and introverted  is not good. We are suppose to be high energy, smiley people and I no longer give a shit.  I need to work another 4.5 years, but I just don't  feel like working anymore. Has anyone else notice that depression cause severe personality shift?",1
Getting a job,"Hi,

did getting a job help any of you guys in this fucking struggle that comes with even wanting to get out of bed? id like to see if it does for myself, even if im honestly not hopeful it will, and so hearing about how you went about it would be interesting. Being 21 going on 22 and having 0 current things going for me hurts a lot but even that's kind of starting to fade, i'd be doing it so my parents stop seeing me with disdain.

thanks.",1
What are the odds of recovering from Depression,"Like statistically, will you probably recover at some point?

I act all quiet and mirror whoever I am with even act vulnerable then when I get a context of whom I’m with I shape a personality to fit that person, I use white lies constantly even made a fake life, 
for the last 2 months I been hearing music when it’s quiet and even seeing hallucinations and hearing voices when I shut my eyes.

Attempted suicide,"So yesterday morning I attempted suicide. I was discharged from a psychiatric unit 2 days prior as the atmosphere was tense (trouble regarding other patients and doctors, not me). 2 days later, I took a load of xanax and anti-depressants. I'm now back in the same unit, but I'm so upset and annoyed that I failed. All I'm thinking about is how stupid I am for making a mistake regarding dosages. The docs are obviously trained to tell me it'll get better, but I don't want better. The day to day grind, worrying about bills and other mundane shit sends a shot of dread up my spine. I don't want to be alive and no amount of doctors saying it'll get better helps. I'm sorry for the rant, I just feel like rock bottom has a basement.",1

I do have friends rn but there's not really someone who I could talk to whenever i want and share all my thoughts with. You know, someone u can talk to freely and they wont judge you.

i cant tell anyone anything because whenever i feel like shit other people have things going on in their lives. my problems dont matter. i dont matter.

I don’t believe it gets better for me. I only ever accomplish these little steps where I’m eating healthier, spending time outside, trying to socialize even if it’s just online (I have crippling social anxiety, lack of social skills, low confidence, and some trust issues).

I’ve seen a couple therapists before, they didn’t help me at all and now, I’m seeing my third therapist. She is better than the previous ones but I still feel like I’m not making any progress. I also started seeing a psychiatrist because I thought I had ADHD and started stimulants but it doesn’t seem they’re working. I don’t know what to do anymore. I am a failure and my life is slipping away. Is it possible for me to change and be a happy person one day? Were you in a situation similar to mine and were able to turn your life around?

Annual Depressive moods/episodes?,"First poster here. I’m just wondering if any one here also experiences some kind of annual depressive moods - I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety 3 years ago and this time three years ago I was severely depressed. I’ll spare the details but I’m a lot better mentally these days. Although some days are harder than others, but for the most part, I have healed and there has been a overwhelmingly huge amount of self discovery and growth. To which I’m very grateful, but it seems ever since I’ve gone through my depression, the main bout of it anyways, this time of year, late April, early May I’m more prone to get back in that mind-set and the same feelings and emotions I felt when I was in the thick-of-it always return. It’s like something is in the air for me and never fails to trigger my depression, and it’s super easy for me to fall back into bad habits. 

I’m OK and I’m safe, have a good support system, a councillor and coping mechanisms, I’m just curious is all and wondering if this isn’t just a me thing, how do you folks cope or prepare if you know a time of year will trigger you, etc., much love and good energy ❤️",1

"How Disliked Tattoos, Severe Depression and Loss of Motivation Can Be Addressed Through Laser Removal","Over the past few years I've grown to hate the tattoos I got years ago. Since then, my motivation to work out and stay fit has decreased significantly due to feeling the tattoos ruin my physique. These tattoos have also negatively impacted my self-confidence leading to severe depression.  I have constant thoughts of inadequacy and hopelessness, making basic tasks difficult.   

I started laser removal 3 years ago but progress is slow. Has anyone else's disliked tattoos contributed greatly to depression, anxiety and loss of motivation to workout? Did laser removal restore your motivation and confidence by fading the tattoos? Any advice on coping with these feelings until my tattoos are removed?
 Lifting weights has always helped my mental health in the past; I hope removing these tattoos I now hate will allow weights to positively impact my mental health again.",1

My best friend is struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts-how can I help?,I’m 17 and my best friend is 18. She’s in a really shitty situation. Her family has no money and a lot of problems right now. She feels like she has to be the sole provider for her mom and three brothers. She’s stressed about school and college and money and I can see her reaching her breaking point. She’ll have breakdowns and send long paragraphs of text talking about how depressed she’s feeling and apologizing about why she couldn’t talk in school or something and all the terrible things happening in her life and how she had suicidal thoughts and cuts herself but then a couple hours later will try and just play it off. I feel so helpless and don’t know what I can do besides just say I’m here for her. I’ve told her a lot how much I love her and how i’m always here for her but she’ll always eventually say I don’t know why you like me or why you even talk to me. She’s terrified of losing me yet doesn’t seem to accept my trying to help her even though she’s always doing things for me because she’s scared of losing me.

Should I look into medications? I don't know where to start. Please help.,"I've been depressed for most of my life. It's usually not too bad. More of a back of the mind type of feeling. Sometimes it gets really bad, but I can usually pull myself out of it enough to start enjoying life somewhat. It's been gradually getting worse over the past two years. In the past few months, it's gotten really bad. I've slowly lost interest in a lot of things. My performance at work as gotten worse and my boss is starting to notice. I feel like I've over compensated in doing all the things that normally help me pull myself out of my depression. I moved into my dream apartment, I went on a week long vacation abroad, my apartment has never been cleaner, and I've been trying out all of the hobbies I've been wanting to do. Nothing is working and I feel like a shell of a person right now. I'm starting to get really scared about the path I'm going down.   


I've started to wonder If I should try anti-depressants.  I know that I need to start looking into therapy as a longer term solution, but the waitlist for therapist inn my network are insane. Plus I know it will take some time to find one that's a right fit for me. I don't know I can wait for a therapy appointment and subsequent sessions to be prescribed medication.

It pisses me off that i was forced to join the military. It pisses me off that my brother steals my interests and is immediately better at it than me.

I know all the things I hate to work on but i don't want to work on it because why should I have to change? Why am I the problem? Why can't I just be happy?  I like being depressed. The suffering gives me an identity. I've made my suffering an identity. If i can't do whatever i want then why do anything at all?

Everything is fine,"That's my motto rn. I feel as if I'm about to combust mentally, but I'm totally fine. Everything is fine. I told myself to just get up and start doing something anything in life. I feel stagnate but it's my own fault. All you have to depend on is urself. I'm tired of dealing with myself. All the mental gymnastics all the thoughts all the breakdowns. I'm exhausting. 

So I'm gonna try my best to not wallow or drown in the gloom and actually do something worthwhile. I know it's not like I wanted to be a giant failure at 21 then proceded to accomplish it, but nor did I take the proper actions to keep myself from careening off a cliff. So I'm gonna try for the umpteenth time to fix what I have left in this life. Either that or one day I figure I'm too tired too keep myself from doing something I won't live to regret. 

It's all good got hella energy until I get up to actually do something then I'm immediately exhausted. Life's just like that though for me anyway. I hope there is no afterlife cause I don't think I could or want to live again while dead. That would be pretty ironic to live in torment already just to get fed up, unalive urself just to wake up in hell after death.",1
The Relief From Depression Due to Sleep Deprivation Is Eye Opening,"I have been awake over 24 hours and I got to say, the relief that acute sleep deprivation provides is insane. I have not felt like this in so long. Damn I never realized how dark and heavy of a blanket depression has been on my life. Wtf What an eye opener. Not recommending it as treatment, but it is eye opening to do it once in a while and literally see night and day. This is not the only time sleep deprivation has provided total relief. It is well documented. We are talking about acute sleep depravation here, not chronic where a person only sleeps 5 hours a day for extended periods of time, that is really bad for you, but so can being awake days straight.The main point of the post was to stress the eye opening experience that is the relief from depression through acute sleep deprivation. Put it this way: I really did not know what depression was until I saw the night and day difference. Depression is evil. 

Edit: Not on any drugs except weed and caffeine, but those hardly provide relief from depression for me, at least compared to sleep deprivation, shit. Depression cannot be chemical related as I am like this whether I am sober for 9 months or high for 9 months, but sobriety and moderation definitely surely helps.",1

If everything is crap, I can start again, or leave it behind. I can take big risks without fear, because everything sucks anyway. I could address the root causes of what makes me unhappy and reforge myself into who I want to be.

My personal vent,"I’ve just been in such a slump mentally and I need to get this off my chest even if no one reads or reacts to it. I’ve just felt so lonely relationship wise, like my longest relationship has been 3 months long and I just have so much love to give someone and I know that sounds general and cliche but it’s the truth. I try every single dating app and while I do get matches it seems like the matches I’m into never respond or barely respond or barely wanna hold a conversation and it makes me even more upset.

And I understand people around me will tell me things like “oh it’ll get better” or “you’ll find someone when you least expect it” but even when I try actively to find a gf it seems like an unreachable task. I just don’t know what to do. I just wish a girl I liked gave my a chance and for once tried fighting for me. Like that’s all I ask for honestly.

Ive tried several councillors over the years but it always feels like theyre just going through a checklist and dont listen to what Im actually saying.

Things dont seem as good as they used to be. Doing the things that make me feel good just feel like distractions stalling me from figuring out what to do because I dont know what to do. 

I dont feel like Im a part of THIS as in EVERYTHING. I dont feel connected to myself alot, or to my environment. I feel incredibly bad because people have good things to say about me but I dont see what they see and I disagree. I want people to forget and not worry about me. I want to self exile in a cabin in the woods but I know thats not going to happen.",1
In pain,"At times, I offend people or act lewd towards them because Im in a lot of pain too. U know im just in pain that im gonna have for the rest of my life. 
And by some way, as little as possible, im trying to give some of that pain to y‘all.",1
"Can't gather the energy or will to brush my teeth or take a shower.. I think it's been almost a month. I'm disgusting, I know..",I smell so bad. My hair is oily. And I think my teeth are rotting too. Probably. Sometimes I tasted blood without doing anything.,1
Therapy is expensive,"The only thing that would probably save me is therapy and I can't even afford it. People casually shaming others for not going for therapy or casually talking about switching therapists have no idea how expensive it is to find one good one, let alone sampling many until you find the right one. I know it is an ""investment"" but some of us don't even have the capital for that ""investment"". Prices are soaring, salary is pathetic, literally no one will care if I disappear tomorrow. Don't know what reason I have to live.",1
I wish I had your problems.,"I do. I've had it worse than most anyone I've known. The fact that I'm even still alive and sober is a miracle. 

Most people's trauma is less than mine and I can't deny I get envious. I want to have what you have. Dismissive parents, fake friends, questioning who you are. It's sick but I wish I had those too. It's much better than what I was gifted.

I used to get mad that people could be depressed over things so much less than my troubles. I've grown past that now but my jealousy won't go. It's not fucking fair. 

I want normal problems. I want a family with normal levels of dysfunction. I want – fuck. I want to start over with the hand you were dealt.",1
Depressed and a bit hopeless...a little long,"I am not looking for sympathy. I am not looking for a reminder of all the good things that happened or that I have. I am just looking to get this off my chest in a place where others understand depression, and some may even be able to relate. I am not looking to end my life due to this; I just am feeling depressed and a bit hopeless; so I decided to share a bit of my story in hopes it will help me feel better.   
  
January 6th, 2023, I went to the ER for what turned out to be sepsis of the right leg. In 2013, I was in a car accident which left a wound on my right calf which, for the next ten years continued to open and close and eventually became septic. From that day in January till min March, I was unconscious; partially due to the sedation and partially due to what was to come. During the months of January and February, I coded 5 different times. The first code required 45 minutes of CPR to revive me. Within those months I also became an amputee. The doctors at one point told my wife that it was either my leg or my life, there wasn’t room for both. My wife did the only sensible thing and had them amputate my right leg above the knee.   
  
During these initial months, I had a tracheotomy, was placed on a ventilator, lost the ability to stand or walk on my own due to the trauma of losing my right leg and everything else that happened during my stay in the ICU.  
  
Today during PT, we attempted to stand, and it really broke me when I couldn’t. I have a bed sore on my tailbone from my stay in the ICU. They couldn’t move me at all during a period when I was on EKMO and Impala which were keeping my heart and lungs functioning. It was during this period that the sore became a thing. Unfortunately, because of the placement of the wound, the pain is immense most of the time and spikes when I move, it is touched, or I lay on a hard surface. When the pain became so much, I couldn’t take it anymore while trying to stand, I became depressed and now feel very much a failure. Logically, I know that I have been through hell and back, so not being able to stand the first time I tried isn’t truly a failure, however my mind doesn’t always follow logic. I have cried off and on all day, feeling like I will never live a somewhat normal life again. I fear I will be wheelchair bound the rest of my life and that, though I am still in rehab, I have reached my peak performance from here on out.   
  
After all has been said and done, I feel a little better getting some of this off my chest to complete strangers. I still feel down, still feel like I am a bit of a failure, but I know eventually, I will be my old self. Thank you for taking the time to read this and possibly reply if you so feel inclined.",1
Here if anybody needs to talk,"Going through some depressing stuff myself. 

Seems like I’m a good guy whom bad things always happen to. Starting to feel like maybe happiness isn’t meant for me. Every time I get somewhere I’m always knocked back. Sometimes I make mistakes but many times I’m treated unfairly compared to my peers. 

You can only go through so much stuff before it starts to take a toll on you.",1
I hate being expected to pretend to be happy all the time.,I don't have the energy to keep faking my own happiness for the sake of others. It's a lot more tiring than they know. I don't feel like smiling and I'm not going to. It just causes me more pain if I bottle up my emotions and I'm not going to do that.,1
chronic depression,I was diagnosed with chronic depression. Ask any questions,1
Metaphorically falling off a cliff,"I’m going to try and make this as short as possible. 

During the first Covid lockdown, I did some stupid things that forced me to move schools. Nothing malicious, but posts online were “found”. Moving schools during a period of extreme public health regulations led me to make no friends, and so I have sat on my own every lunch for the past three years in school. Coupled with losing most of my old friends, I have been challenged pretty extremely, but I didn’t face “consequences” until recently. I have been using coping mechanisms for the past three years, albeit flirting with suicidal ideation and, on many an occasion, considering it as a legitimate option. 

My leaving school exams are coming up in a few weeks, but I struggle to get out of bed before 2pm, laze on the couch all day not studying, and I don’t even get any exercise anymore. I eat mostly junk food, although eat very little now. I feel hopeless about my future and life, and have nobody anymore. 
Am I depressed, or just acting pathetically?",1
I am absolutely and utterly broken,"It's 5:30 am and it's really cold and I just took off all my clothes in the middle of a panic attack and ended up crying for like 30 minutes after not crying for practically years.

I am trapped in every single way I can imagine, in every single level I can imagine. I am trapped even in my own body, this body that I despise, I hate. I got naked just to look at it and I couldn't stop crying, just asking why me, why not someone else, what did I do to deserve all of this.

I dont know how will I wake up tomorrow and keep pretending its all fine. I have no idea. I don't want to. If I could die the next time I go to sleep, I'd accept it.",1
im just a pathetic loser,"i dont even know if im depressed at this point, despite being diagnosed. reading through everyone elses posts, they all have it worse than me. worst thing thats happened in my life was my dad dying, which was years ago so i can hardly use that as an excuse. i just feel like a fat lazy braindead loser. i do nothing all day except watch whatever bullshit on youtube or mindlessly play video games. i dont even go to college anymore. i cant remember the last time i went outside. its been over a month since i last showered. i havent spoken a word in weeks. i have no friends. im just a loser. im too much of a pussy to cut myself with something sharp. sure theres my pocket knife, which gives me scars, but its not like it hurts anyway. cant even use it anymore since my mum took it away. i just want to fall asleep one day and never wake up. or better yet, i wish i just didnt exist in the first place. everyone would be happier if i was never born. im just gonna listen to some shitty music and lay in bed. doubt anyone will even interact with this post, just like all the rest which i eventually end up deleting.",1
Sleeping through the days.,"I isolated myself from society because I want to recover and finally give me some time for my mental health. My doctor thinks I'm bipolar, so we're working to hopefully have a diagnosis of my case (28y now, have been dealing with severe depression since my early teens, and have been through a lot of traumatic situations and drug addiction)

Now I've been sober for 1month, but isolating from social apps was a decision that had to be made, so I usually don't go outside unless necessary, and the only people I socialize with are my parents, and a couple of friends like once a week.

I know it's a process, a very long process, but it's inevitable to feel pathetic, alone, miserable. I don't have a job because of agoraphobia, and a lot of mood swings. My friends are busy with their life and also dealing their own wars. To cope with all this, I've been taking antidepressives, mood stabilizers, and Clonazepam for panic attacks.

I don't know anymore, I just needed to vent, these years have been the roughest of my life. I apologize if my English may be confusing sometimes, not my native language. I also apologize if what I wrote doesn't have a very good narrative, I'm kinda threwing up my feelings. 

So I prefer to sleep, sleep a lot, I wake up with some guilt, sadness, and lost. But I feel warm, relaxed, at least a little time.",1
A good day,"Washed face,combed hair and brushed teeth,it’s a good start to the day!",1
I wanna kill myself,"I wanna fucking kill myself, I dint wanna die but I also do, I've taken so much to stop the shit I'm going through, prescriptions, alcohol, and still feel the same, I know this shit won't end unless I end it myself.",1
Addicted to pain,"I'm 22F and tonight I want to vent. 
My mind can't take it anymore.
There is literally nothing going right in my life
I prefer to stay in a toxic relationship instead of leaving because I have no one.
No friends to hang out with or to talk to.
Parents that don't know how to be parents.
Only child and an introvert.
Had a shitty childhood and adolescence.
Can't find a job despite trying many times...
I have troubles sleeping at night cause my brain keeps remembering me of how shitty my life is and past traumas.
I been feeling so dumb and tired lately,  I'm having troubles speaking (I slur a lot), remembering things, and at times walking too...I don't have balance anymore. 
I'm underweight without wanting it and look anorexic, I keep losing weight....and everyone keeps shaming me. 
I think is stress
Every people around me gaslight me every single time they speak. 
I'm having more panic attacks day after day.
I went numb and now I'm going crazy. 
Therapy isn't helping me at all... it's arleady been 4 months. I'm giving up.
I needed to share my useless thoughts as writing here makes me feel less lonely",1
Idk what to do,"Over the past 1-2 years I've not been able to stay happy consistently. I keep having highs n then lows. These highs are short but I feel amazing, I get motivated to do school work, workout etc. But in the lows I just feel numb ig. Like I find myself not caring for things like school and I end up being dead set focused on something, at the moment it's my martial arts. 

I've got gcses in less than a week and idk what to do as the lows fuck my work ethic up.",1
what in the world is the fcking point of stayin alive,we all live to collecz memories and fcking more shit. but for what. we all are going to die and than everyone will forget that we did live. so why,1
Wearing long skirts in warm weather,"Last night, I lost it. I cut myself in other one place I can feel it. More than a year ago now, I injured my leg badly in a vehicle accident and today, there's some nerve damage that prevents me from feeling that area. 
So last night while I was taking a shower, I heard someone aggressively banging on the door and pulling at the knob and it scared the absolute shit out of me. Believing it was my mom, I unlocked the door and told her the door was unlocked if she needed in, while I hid back in the shower. We do this sort of thing all the time. Being too anxious to finish my shower, I opened my door to ask if everything was okay because I was getting no response from anybody. So I put my clothes on as fast as I could and as I was doing so, I heard my Step Dad say he threw up. Mom was super pissed but kept insisting everything was fine.
I knew better though. This made me so upset last night that after having a long cry session, I tool pit my scalpel and completely hacked up my leg.
Today I didn't get up for work on time, so I had to figure out what I could wear with this huge bandage over my cuts. My head still hurts, I'm sweating like crazy, and I'm not sure how I will be at my toxic job. 
I've been trying to find reasons to live but lately there aren't many. I told myself if I couldn't find help or be happy by September, I'd kill myself via train. I'm so sick of being a burden in my parents home. I'm 24 years old and I honestly expected to accomplish more by my age, and not to mention, watching everybody I grew up with start their own families and buy their own homes. I'm tired of being a waste of space.",1
"Do I have depression, or just going through a tough time?","TL;DR: Lot of sad shit happened to me and while I was positive for most of it, this week I suddenly became more sad and suddenly lost care for a lot of things and lost enjoyment in everything. Do I have depression or am I just going through a tough time?

Before I start, I am unsure if this is the subreddit I should use. I am new to reddit and looked up ""depression"" to talk about this. If there is a better place to ask this or if this ain't where I should, just tell me. So, the last 2 months have been nothing but a nightmare for me. It started when my parents started arguing a lot, and then later, I found out they are planning to get a divorce. My dad is heartless about it and being an asshole to my mom while my mom is crushed, feels lonely as hell, and has been going to my sister and I for emotional support. Then a few weeks of this and I start to feel sad, and I got less affectionate with my gf because of my sadness. My gf then dumps me, saying she ""hasn't loved me for a few months and tried to regain love for me by herself"" which I felt odd about but was too heartbroken by the fact I lost my gf of 1 year to think about it. I later found out she actually cheated on me with her roommate and told me to hide his and her shame for it. For the most part, I was taking it all well. I was trying to stay positive, and I started exercising. But then suddenly I started to feel worse in a subtle way. I stopped caring about things as much, and I lost enjoyment in my hobbies. Then this week starting Monday, after a bad day at work when I fucked up a lot of things I went home and realized how awful I was feeling and cried myself to sleep that night. Each day I started feeling worse and worse. My sister has depression, and when I talked to her about how I was feeling she told me I might have depression because she's experienced what I'm feeling before. I don't want to believe I have depression because I've been known as the friend and family member who comforts everyone else, I don't want to be seen as the one who needs comfort because I do enjoy making people happier. I told my sister that everything recently is probably just catching up to me. Do you guys think I actually have depression, or am I just dealing with a lot at once?",1
My letter to the world,"I really don’t know how to start this, other than by saying I’m sorry.  I’m sorry to my mom and my dad, who have done everything in their power to ensure that I can live as comfortable as possible.  I’m sorry to my two siblings, who I love more than words can describe.  I wish I could have been a better brother.  I am sorry to my girlfriend, for being the way that I am.  You deserve so much better.  You deserve the world.

The world has given me everything I could have ever wanted and yet it’s still not enough to fill the void in my chest.  It doesn’t matter how much good I put into the world, how many people I help, or even how many people love me, the OCD will always find a reason to tear me apart.  I can’t fucking take it anymore.  

I’ve done everything!  I’ve made amends!  I help people!  I refuse to harm people, I never HAVE harmed another being, and still I cannot for the life of me stop trying to find reasons to hate myself.  It’s always something new.  There’s always something wrong.

I just want it to be over.  I just want to be happy.  But it’s clear that my own brain won’t allow me to.  

Thank you for giving me everything.  I’m sorry but I can’t accept it.",1
Why should I even be alive?,"The world is in chaos, the system we live in is falling apart and it would be a miracle if our children's children would be able to see a positive change. I just don't understand where do people find energy to keep going, working till they drop dead at 60, never having time and money to even look outside? 
What is genuinely good about life? Why do people not allow assisted suicide for those who can't do this anymore?
Like, I will never be any use to this world  because all I can do is art. I am mentally AND physically ill person, I can't do any useful job. I can't earn decent amount of money to live on my own with just doing art. There are countless people that do art better than me, and that's okay. I will forever be alone because of my mental illness, and that's understandable too. My home country is destroyed by war and the country i ran away to is now involved in another war, so I don't even have a place to call home anymore. And that's fine too, I know people have it worse. 

What I don't get is if I'm no use to humanity, if I will struggle, be poor and alone till my last day, why can't I just die. There is no assisted suicide option, and just doing it myself might not work. Is it really this hard to just allow people to die peacefully in this world, not by throwing themselves under a train or hanging themselves? I really only want to hold someone's hand when I die. To be at peace finally.",1
I am so very sorry,"I have been such a vile person. Countless friends, my family... I've been rude, manipulative, emotionally absent, selfish etc. I find it shameful to ever approach someone and share my burdens and my struggles when I would never afford them the same courtesy. I wish I could change & become worthy of all of my blessings. I am simply not capable of that. I am going to go & I am going to go soon hopefully but I feel so wrong hoping that people will remember me fondly. They won't see this but I can only apologize for all of the pain & hurt I have caused. Thank you for bearing me. I hope I brightened your life even if only for a fleeting instance.",1
Feeling suicidal again,"I think my life is okay right now. Trying my best not to do something silly when I get off work >,<“",1
"Tomorrow’s my birthday, but I don’t feel like celebrating","This year I’ve really pushed myself to go out more and do things (setting up my first bank account, walking more, getting things for others in town, trying to be more independent), but my ibs pain and my depression don’t feel any better. I’ve tried some antidepressants like amitriptyline but they haven’t helped.

I guess I have been extremely depressed for a long time now so maybe half a year isn’t long enough? It’s been over a decade of me being house bound and depressed.

I’m going to be 26 soon but I feel like a failure. I’m scared I’ll be lonely and housebound forever.",1
How to start making friends when you have none because you've been depressed?,"I've been depressed for a while and making new friends has always just seemed like an impossible goal, since everyone's basic answers to how you make friends is something like ""Go to parties with your friends and socialize"", and I'm sure that works but how do you go to parties without friends??? Like how do you start from nothing? How did some of you go about making friends from absolutely nothing? Like I kind of want to pick up a new hobby or join a group or something like that to help make friends, but I have no idea where to go or what to do",1
Depressed on the day of my sister's graduation.,"Here I am, I'm supposed to be happy for my sister, who is graduating from university today, but all I can think about is how fucking worthless I am. I have done absolutely nothing for the past 4 years. To make matters worse, my cycle of feeling good and then depression is on the depression side of things right now. I fucking hate myself. I know I should be happy for my sister and all the stuff she's done. I'm doomed to live paycheck to paycheck because of this fucking shit economy and the fucking idiots in Congress who won't get a deal done and get us into default, If someone doesn't blow us up with a nuke first. The world's going to hell in a hand basket and I feel like shit.

TLDR: depressed, should feel good for my sister because she's graduating.",1
I am so tired,"I'm getting all the help I need, seeing a therapist, taking my meds yet nothing is working. I don't even want to be a burden to anyone so I don't know who to talk to. I am so tired of having breakdowns everyday. I am so tired of hearing things will get better. I am so tired of hearing people telling me that I need to be stronger and get a grip. I am just so tired. Not knowing when this feeling ends or if it ends at all scares me",1
Problems make me feel depressive,"I'm 22 years old, I'm passionate about entrepreneurship, I have a business in the web development area, I'm married and we have a 7-month-old girl.

a year ago my life turned into a nightmare, due to gambling addiction (which I got rid of), I spent all the money I had + my wife's money + I made loans in the name of my father, mother-in-law, wife and the company.

after I got into terrible debt, I started to become frivolous. thus I lost clients and now I have two lawsuits in court with two different clients, because I did not respect the delivery deadlines. I am pressured by debts and the actions of clients, in the end I managed to obtain contracts that bring me about 10,000 euros per month and with which I could pay my debts in a few months, but I have to work about 15-16 hours per day.

I don't know where to go and how to make people trust me again and wait for me..

and the problems are on me without me realizing it, for example I rented a car, someone scratched it in the parking lot and now I have to pay for the damage to the car... that's the only problem I have

maybe you have some advice, I don't want to get lost on this road and I would still like to have time for my family",1
Finding it hard,"Every day I'm trying to find what is the point of living, I'm mentally exhausted i have someone trying to support me, but i keep pushing the person away,  it's really taking a toll on me, everyday i wonder how people do it, to live happily I just can't fathom it anymore, I wish at times I was never born",1
I wish I was destined for greatness,"21F. Maybe I would love myself. Maybe my parents would like me and be proud of me.   Life would feel like it’s worth living. All I feel is shame. I had potential and I wasted it. My parents really tried with me but it seems like they’ve given up too. I don’t know if I’m grateful for that or if it makes me want to die. I’m not worth anything. The bedroom I have, the food I eat, the electricity I use, it could go to anyone else. Someone who deserves it but wasn’t lucky enough to have it.",1
My Mental state,"Hello there, I doubt most people will read this but it never hurts to let some thoughts out. For starters, I apologize if there’s any poor grammar in this post,English class wasn’t my best subject. I have been in this world for 19, almost 20 years and the sad thing is, I still live with my parents, I’ve never been in a relationship, and I have little to no friends to speak of. It’s been like this my whole life and it’s constantly fucked with my mind since. One reason is that I’m a little on the fat side and I know people look down on those type of people but I am working on that, it is however a very slow process that I am aware of. Another reason is my looks, I’m not ashamed to admit that I am ugly and that I will always be this way, no matter what. One more thing is that I have a certain condition I don’t want to reveal but let’s just say it makes me harder to connect with others, especially on a personal level (yes I do know it’s not an excuse but I felt like I wanted to point that out). Because of my circumstances, my mental state has been going down hill since about high school and I really don’t tell people, not even my family cause what’s the point, they’ll just tell me the cliches like “it’ll be alright” or “we’re here for you” and that never really fixes anything. What doesn’t help was the my high school is full of rich stuck up white trash brats who think they’re better then everyone else, and I mean EVERYONE. Not only that but if I tried to talk to someone, they would just silently respond to me and move on to what they were talking about with their friends and completely forget what I said. Those 4 years of high school were the worst of my life mentally but not academically since I managed to ace a majority of my classes but I was so depressed, there were times I would sneak into my stepfathers safe and just contemplate on grabbing one of his pistols, loading it, and just finally ending this still pathetic and worthless life I live. If people saw me and the life I’ve lived they would think “why is this guy complaining? He’s got what most people wish they had.” Yes I will admit I am very fortunate in life because of the great decisions my mother and stepfather have made and I am very grateful for that. To those who have that exact thought, I do agree with you, why should I complain about my life and when so many others are having it worse than others me. Who am I to complain when I have food, clothes, a roof over my head, and a ok paying job. But I my mind, there’s no point of living a good life, if there isn’t anyone else to share it with. I do have people around me but it’s a very small number. My mom and stepdad won’t tell it to my face, but they want me gone, my dad is barley around and while he is a nice guy for the most part, he lives a very poor lifestyle and will end up dead sooner or later, and last but not least are my grandparents on my dads side, they don’t have much time and I don’t see them as much as I want to. I love the people around me but I’m selfish enough to say that it is t enough, I wish there were some people out there who could understand me and some girl to see me as a charming and caring guy and not some fat ugly slob of a loser who has no one. I will always cherish the great things my family has done for me but I always feel like a burden and that if I were gone, people would just forget about me and move on but I wanna fell like there’s till hope for me and that my life with take a huge turn. Thank you for those who managed to read the ramblings of a man with little worth in life.

I'm so tired,"I don't even have enough energy to wake up every morning. I'm sleepy as I'm writing this, I can barely open my eyes anymore. I really hope it means that my body is shutting down on me.
