"Hi everyone, I'm a 17 year old guy who is paranoid.
It all started with a meeting with a friend while watching a movie, I stared at the TV screen, and put my finger in my nose (but did not pick it). I lay there for about 10 minutes, but the problem is that I was afraid that he could take a picture of me on the phone (he took it in his hands while we watched the movie and when I stared a little) and maybe put it somewhere on the Internet. We have here such networks as vk, telegram, tiktok, facebook.
And the next day I came to the college and obsessive thoughts began - someone smiled when he passed next to me, two girls started laughing when I sat and ate lunch in the dining room, some guys laughed looking in my direction when I was waiting for the bus home , etc. .d. It seems to me that they all recognize me from this video or photo.
Everything got to the point that I asked 12 people (acquaintances and a friend) if they had seen me anywhere on the internet. Everyone answered that they had not seen, but I practically do not trust everyone (except relatives).
And I also asked my friend (with whom I watched the film) to show his gallery.
There were no photos or videos. But I don't know if he saw something on the Internet with me or not.
I don’t even know what to add here , some people on the street still smile when i go through them.
If you read all this, then I would not be against some advice (because it seems to me that I will go crazy soon)",5,paranoia

"I serve absolutely no purpose. My life is meaningless. I don’t mean anything, to anyone. Yesterday was my 24th birthday and I spent it in complete silence alone in my room. All I did was cry and want to disappear so bad since it’s like I’m not even here anyways. No one loves me, no one cares and I’m so tired of being alone. I feel like less of a human and person. I kept praying for some sort of birthday miracle yesterday and I always feel so stupid after. I asked my fwb (who was the only person to wish me hbd) if I could sleepover and he said yes but of course, I got ready and waited for hours just to be blown off for other plans. I have feelings for him and I’m not supposed to which makes me a dumbass, tbh I’m an idiot for even thinking I would leave my house. Nothing ever goes how I wish it would. I’ve been waiting for things to get better my whole life now. I don’t want to have a 25th birthday. I don’t want to keep going. Nothing works. I do coping skills and just feel the heavy stinging pain in my chest, and all I want to do is curl up in a ball. What’s the point? Of anything? I hate my life. I hate myself. I hate this experience. I don’t want to do it anymore",2,depression
"For the record, I am not diagnosed. Although I have been diagnosed with bipolar, BPD, ADD, pretty certain that I lie somewhere on the spectrum

I am currently stuck in a horrendous position in retail. Constantly with the ableism directed toward me simply because eye contact isn't my strong suit...

I want to get out bad, and while applying to other positions I would be interested and more comfortable in, I noticed that most of these places only do ONLINE INTERVIEWS

I am extremely uncomfortable in front of a camera, add the fact that I'd be essentially responding and speaking to the void while having to mask up and put on my ""happy face""

I PHYSICALLY cannot force myself to smile or pretend to be cheery on demand in front of a camera. It's so impersonal and cold. I get nervous and anxious just thinking about it

I just had a mini freak out because I put in 3 apps and all 3 want an online interview response. One of them too, I tried to ask for accomodations to interview in person rather. They denied it... Smfh

"My headaches are left-sided 95% of the time. It also only just occurred to me that the way I spend most of my days is sat down with a table by my left side. So I’m always slightly turned to the left, often looking down to my phone, so my neck is crooked.

Could this in theory cause the left sided neck and shoulder muscles to tighten up and cause pain in the head?

I do seem to get migraines that loosely line up with my menstrual cycle but also random ones too. I was trying to figure out why they’re often left sided and had this realisation about the way I’m sat with my neck on the left side all crumpled up. Could this be the root of it?",0,negative_samples

"Hi, I'm(21yo) currently very desperate. The desperation just exploded with my bachelor thesis. Even though I almost have it (only a few details are missing and a few sentences from my conclusion) my consultant is away(work trip) till the due date and 99% can't check it and approve it. Right now I am trying to finish it in tears...

Anyway, I have gf (19yo) for almost 2 years, she is a very good student finishing grammar school, and we decided a long time ago to send applications to really good universities in Denmark and possibly build our future there. But since I might not defend my bc thesis and finish my current university I can not go there. I will extremely piss off my parents and also my gf.

My current university became very stressful for me after the coronavirus lockdown (I had 3 semesters online from my bedroom) I couldn't find many friends. Recently I started crying regularly on my drives back home from the uni. The economics and business mngmt programme I study is kinda interesting to me but for my entire life, I haven't found an area or someone/something I want to become. In Denmark, I chose UI/UX and content creation since I have been goofing in cracked Adobe Photoshop and Premiere throughout my life. And for the past 1.5 years, I have been actively coding html css and did a little online product catalogs for a little company from: styling the products -> photographing -> editing -> putting them online. So I guess this should be my point of interest. 

And here comes my recent indecisiveness. I have trouble getting up in the mornings, I lack motivation. I can't plan my routine. I am acting very lost and frightened in public. I feel extreme pressure to finish my current uni, go to Denmark, accommodate in Denmark, and live there. It's not only this, my gf is not pushing me into anything, she is actually very nice and supportive. But the most pressure I feel is that I disappoint all the people who know me because I become in their eyes the guy who achieved nothing, prolonged his studies, or didn't even finish them...
Sometimes I wonder why she is still with me when I can't come up with nice dates and we only spend time at my place watching movies alone.

I can't get anything done. I start but never finish any work or assignments. My head is constantly spinning between I'm a failure and suddenly it wonders to how many things I could do, that I should go run every morning, study 4 hours a day, write every single line from my lectures, start a business... And I'm the failure cause stopped attending the lectures, procrastinated at the end of the semester, and wrote the thesis very late. But I couldn't persuade myself to do it. Now I don't even know what I want from my life, I'm not sure of anything... This is the indecisiveness I mentioned before.

And now I am a wreck sitting in my room as I do most of the time nowadays. I look out to all the successful former classmates from grammar school or friends building their careers and compare to them. The worst thing is that it shows that I do nothing. My parents see me in my room lying in bed, playing guitar, etc  -> simply procrastinsting and not studying. But I really can't focus on the studies. And I see that the time has been wasted which now eats me inside out on top the my current mood.

I also started thinking about what it would be like to kill yourself. Cause I want the burning pressure to stop when it gets serious sometimes. I remembered, a few years ago having a mental health lecture at grammar school and they asked if we have suicidal thoughts and that it is a bad thing and a lot of people might have them. I thought to myself, that I must be very lucky to have never actually thought about it. But here I am with the thought somewhere deep back inside my mind.

Sorry for my poor phrasing and grammar.

"I always feel like someone will know what I’m doing. Like my brother doesn’t like me hanging out with boys, but since my friends have boyfriends it usually ends up my friend group hanging out with a male friend group. I always feel like my brother will pop up. 

When I speak on the phone on the train, I feel like someone I know will be listening and catching me “gossiping”. 

I moved 6 hours away from my home city to another part of the country and I still feel like this. Even though no one knows me in this city, I feel like someone I know will pop up and “catch me” even if I’m *not* doing something that *isn’t* allowed.

"This time last year I was having a particularly bad time. It got to a point that one day, I left work early to get medicines in order to end my life that day. This was right before Mother’s Day and I had also gotten my mom a card so she would have something from me. But as I was preparing to overdose, something in me told me not to.

In the year that has gone by, I have moved countries this January back to where I grew up.I have seen family that I haven’t seen in years, reconnected with old friends, and explored places that I haven’t been to since I was a child. All things that I would have missed if I had gone through with my plans that day.

The first couple of months that I have been back, I reached a new low. I felt overwhelmed with the move I had just made, the rental crisis here in Australia and  trying to sort out transferring universities. I started to have suicidal ideations again but this time I reached out for help. I got the help that I have needed and I am so happy that I have made it to where I am now. I had to put my own personal shame aside so that I could help myself.

To anyone in a similar situation as I was, just wait. I know you probably roll your eyes when people tell you “it gets better”, because I used to be skeptical too, but it does eventually get better. Although I still have hard days and I am not happy all of the time, I have found hope and a purpose. I am glad to still be here today.",2,depression

"(warning for very brief mention of US political events; transphobia)

So what am I supposed to do when something actually is a problem? 
I dealt with this issue when covid first started, and I'm dealing with it now as a trans teen in the US. I'm medicated now and it's definitely helped a little, but things are still bad. How do I keep my anxiety from becoming debilitating when I can't just reason my way out of it? How do I look a situation in the face and acknowledge that it is shit and then just keep going?

"I have CFS and POTS, my CFS has been improving since diagnosis and proper pacing and I could get back to doing half days at work/internship/last part of my degree. Now the half-days are pretty much the limit of my physical ability, I spend each afternoon in bed recovering. 

Also during that time I can rarely if ever lay down, so I get coathanger pain and POTS-headaches, those get better by laying down (would be gone after an hour at most) but by the end of my shift this always has also triggered a migrane which means I now have migranes at least five days a week.

Anyone experience anything similar/has any Tips?

Edit: I currently use bisoprolol, compression socks and increased my water and salt intake. I lay down before work and if possible halfway through, I work in the medical field so often it isn't possible. Exercise is something I'm considering but am wary of because of CFS.

"TW: S/A mentioned 

I’ve had paranoia problems since I was a kid. One profound example I can remember is that I would apologize when accidentally bumping into or hitting inanimate objects like walls or my toys. I did this because I thought they would come to life and hurt me. 

It died down for a while until about a few months to a year ago. So, for years, my parents touched me inappropriately without my consent(like my boobs, butt, etc). I would tell them to stop as a teenager after I learned I could say no to them, but they got mad and continued anyway. It was really traumatic and my mind still feels messed up about it. A year ago, I started getting paranoid and fearing that I’ll be like them in the future. I didn’t have this fear until I learned that most criminals become who they are because of traumatic moments. Ever since then, I’ve been super paranoid and my rationality is going crazy because I keep second guessing my thoughts.

I sometimes wonder if therapy would help, but being that I've been in it most of my teenage years and it never helped then, although I was told to keep quiet about home life in fear that they would take me away from my guardians. It's also an issue financially for me to even start therapy.

"1. Never being able to fully take in information: my brain just refuses. When someone asks me to look at an excel spread sheet and make sense of the information in it, I just shut down.

2. Which brings me to point two. Impulsively deciding what is and is not important. Like sometimes I’ll email a piece of work to my manager knowing full well that I have not read all the information but my mind is too jumpy to sit an comb through everything in order. Actually this sometimes even leads to me reading things from top to bottom or just hopping around hoping to find importance somewhere in the body of text.

3. Being so foggy that you feel out of touch with reality. With yourself. With your emotions that sometimes you can’t even understand how you feel, why you feel that way and how to change it.

4. Getting the ick. I don’t know if this is ADHD specifically but I get the ick so easily from people I actually like and have feelings for. Then I find it impossible to know how I feel about them because my emotions are now all over the place because of something so stupid.

5. Feeling self disgust. I am so tired of myself and my ways that I sometimes feel repulsed. I hate that I’m sensitive, I hate that I’m moody, I hate that I feel like I’m always underperforming, I hate that I always think everyone hates me after one wrong look or flat text message.

6. Never realising your true potential. When I’m on meds I am amazed by how much I can actually achieve. How nice I am capable of being, how much energy I have to be fit and eat healthy. 

7. The exhaustion. Mental and physical. The tiredness lies somewhere deep within my bones. 

8. Cutting corners to stay above water but feeling like a fraud. I have always had to find easier ways of doing things to stay ahead with minimal effort but this has always made me feel like a cheater and a fraud.

"  As the title says, I (24F) have been friend dumped.  It was in the evening, over snapchat, where he (23M) sent me a text saying 

""Hey, I need to end our friendship.""

  At first I was thinking I read it wrong, but then he kept going with

""I need to do it out of respect for my ex girlfriend.""

  Now we had previously had a falling out where we hooked up and he didnt tell me he was in a relationship, and I was feeling really guilty so I told his girlfriend (22F) that I didnt feel comfortable keeping it to myself anymore, and I explained it to her.  After that both of them blocked me on everything.  Well back in January 2023, after a few months of not talking, he messages me and says 

""Hey.  I want to apologize.""

  And then it brought back so many memories and pain from the first time i was cut out, that I had my guard up HIGH.  He then started to say that he ""Valued our friendship"" and ""had been feeling awful about it since"".  Me being so easily trusting, I accepted him back in my life and gave him a second chance.

  Now, between January and May 2023, we started talking again like we were before.  Eventually there was some spicy content shared.  And at this point, I think things are looking up, and that he actually wants to work this out.

  The last week of May was when I was dumped.  I was furious, like beyond upset, because I trusted him with so much of myself that I don't often share with people.  I laid in bed and just cried, and asking why.  It felt like somebody had run a sword through me, and I felt so weak and helpless.  It was awful, and it felt like a part of me had just died, and there was a void now in my life, again.

  I still had to go to work the next few days, so I had to suck it up and not show that something is going on.  When I would get back home, I would sit there and cry, and sob, and write down all my thoughts and feelings about this.  How I told him to NEVER attempt to contact me again, and that he was a terrible person, somebody I considered a friend and had trusted, had just stabbed me in the back, like what was I supposed to do?  

  I sent him some messages that I do regret, like saying that I hope everybody he gets close to leaves him once they realize he's a terrible person.  How if I had a gun to shoot him, I would shoot myself instead so he'd have to live with it.  How I wish I could physically stab him in the back so that maybe, he'd understand what he put me through, and maybe think before doing it to someone else.  

  It's been 4 days, but it still hurts.  I go to check my messages, and he's not there.  I've cried so much these last few nights, and I know that he is going about with his life perfectly fine, and everything is just rainbows and unicorns over there.  And then I'm on the other side feeling every emotion on the upset spectrum.  My eyes would water up whenever I'd think about our chats or anything, and I can feel the lump inside my throat growing.

  It took me so long to get over him the first time.  I'm scared that if I trust somebody, they're gonna turn out like him.  I'm worried that my emotional instability will just remain unstable because of him.  I'm trying to tell myself that his words or whatever had ANYTHING to do with my self-worth.  I attach a lot of my self-esteem on other people's opinions of me, despite knowing full well that I'm the only one who can determine my worth.

"i’m exhausted of being myself i’m exhausted of being stuck in my head nothing i do works and i am only ever thinking bad thoughts— everyone hates me and i’m the most annoying person in the world 99.9% of the time. i used to have safe people that i knew i would never bother and never feel like i was being a nuisance all the time and now even those people don’t feel safe anymore. i feel like my family hates me too, and the only reason they put up with me at all is because they have to. i know i annoy my mom. i never feel okay with myself. any small change in behavior from anybody makes me spiral and im so tired. im just fighting my own brain every day. trying to convince myself every day that i am loved and i am cared for but i don’t believe it even a little bit. i don’t know how to. i hate that im like this i hate trying different medicines i hate not being able to have creative thoughts anymore because im always thinking about the bad things— im always contemplating my own existence and sometimes it just feels like it would be easier for me if i just wasn’t here. but i don’t want to die but sometimes i wonder if i need to. 

i don’t get excited for the future anymore i just get scared. everything scares me. i feel like half a person all the time— and i always feel like i’m making all this up. idk if this is even the right sub to post this in but i’m just having a really hard time. i know that i need help, but i feel like nobody takes me seriously. every professional help i’ve had has failed me— my psychiatrist made me feel like i was lying and being dramatic and all three past therapists eventually just stopped seeing me. they literally would ghost me after a few months of seeing me i just would never hear from them again. 

i want to grow old, i want to be here but everything scares me. i am scared of my own existence and my place in this world. i am scared to lose my mom, i am scared that people will find out i’m a fraud. i’m just rambling now. i’m just so tired",4,anxiety
"I am a 22 year old, who is feeling stuck in life. Not sure if this is the right thread of Reddit to post. But I really need some help. I feel like whatever I do is not good enough for my family. Me and my mum have a rocky relationship... which has created a lot of mental trauma for me. I.e. not wanting me to be born, due to my gender. Bodyshaming me for my height ( I am quite short). Or not receiving grades that she wants. Or literally calling me ""not beautiful"", and saying that other people I.e. my cousin is so pretty. I literally can't even work, or walk properly as I am not able to deflect or remove these negative unhealthy, toxic thought from my mind. Even my supervisor told me. And even my friends that I looked depressed. 
I feel like a failure. I don't even know how to cook, or clean properly. And don't even have the courage to get the driving license. As I feel scared.. maybe of failure. There is so much pressure from the family of getting married, and that no one will like me. How am I supposed to get married? If I don't even like myself? And I am not even Independent? I hate how I am so envious of other people.. Envious of them being happy, envious of them being loved in relationships, of having a kind and considerate mum. Envious of career progression in their life.. or being able to withstand negative family problems and still carry out with their lives. I am also struggling with my Deen (relationship with Allah) .. I feel like I am not a good Muslim, I am not consistent on my daily prayers. And they feel forced. I miss that spark .. when I was praying for myself & my own pleasure only. Amd not to please my parents. I also hate how my mum constantly compares me to my brother, bless him he has done nothing wrong. But she keeps on saying how lazy I am and evil. They definitely don't help the already existing negative thoughts that I am having towards myself. I also am struggling immensely with friendships, and being myself in them.. or comfortable.. I constantly feel like I am not good enough, or not as skilled or confident as my friends. I am already in therapy, and my therapist has mentioned to ignore my mum's comments. But it's really hard I don't know.. is this ever going to gey better. Some people might recommend moving out, it's not as cheap, I feel stuck. I also need a job. Or anything to keep me going. I just feel lost. I really don't know what to do. Please BE KIND in the comments section, I have enough negativity in my life & in my thoughts.

"We had some of my boyfriend's friends over and I had a couple realizations:

1. I have been so socially deprived throughout my life that I don't know how to be charismatic and entertain. I just never had to learn how. This really bothers me because socialization is good for your health. So without socialization I may be allowing myself to get sicker. The problem with this is I feel bad about myself when I socialize. I tend to compare and it is a bad habit.

2. My life is not rich with activity. These people both had full time jobs and found the time for hobbies and other things such as reading the news and listening to new music. Even though it is summer, I don't have a job and have no obligations, I tend to waste a lot of time being depressed or having avolition. I feel this makes me stupid and uninteresting.


The whole time we were talking my mind was like a blank slate or intrusive thoughts. I hate brain fog. I hate not being normal. I hate myself. This disease ruins everything and I NEED a cure ASAP.",6,schizophrenia

"(Buckle up, this is a long one)
I wish I didn’t relate to that quote. I wish I felt like there was some reason to keep trying. I just turned 41, and I’m DONE. I’m not going to do anything, but I’d be entirely content to just not wake up one day. Everything I’ve ever tried to do with my life has gone to shit, and I don’t have the will or the energy to try anything else. There’s no point. I don’t know what I would want to do anyway. And when I say everything, I mean it. My emotional support dog was robustly healthy until about a month before she died of cancer at age 11. No genetic history of cancer, and her father and mother passed away at 15 and 18 respectively with nothing worse than arthritis and general old age. As far as I know her littermates are all still thriving. My psychiatrist is weaning me off meds because I apparently have treatment resistant depression that the meds don’t affect at all anymore. I’m at the least-drugged point I’ve been in *years*, and yes I’m completely miserable, but I don’t feel any worse than I did when I was drugged to the gills a year ago. Meds up, down, changed, nothing. So I guess this is my life now. I don’t even know when this started, but one of my earliest memories (age 5 or so) is a red flag in hindsight. I tried to do myself in when I was about 12. I realized later that what I did never would have worked, but at the time it was a genuine attempt. I was initially medicated then, and I was balanced through my early teens, but the downhill slide started again after about 5 years. Ups and downs, but mostly one step forwards and two steps back. Fast forward to about 4 years ago, and it’s been a steady downward spiral. I was in an increasingly toxic situation at work, so when I got covid in spring 2020 I was perfectly ok with a mandated 2 week quarantine. It turned out to be long covid (which wasn’t a known thing at the time), but continued illness and my boss being an ass about it gave me an excuse to quit. I haven’t worked since, and I don’t want to. I don’t want the responsibility. I don’t have the motivation. I don’t have the energy. I’m at a point where feeling like I *have* to do something makes me resentful. I tried therapy when I was younger, but my therapists always wanted to find the root trauma that triggered my depression. There isn’t one. Sure I was bullied all the way through school (I mean ALL - kindergarten right up to high school graduation), but I was never physically hurt. No one played nasty pranks on me. I was mainly just teased and ostracized, which of course is hurtful, but it’s nowhere near as bad as it could have been. I was not abused. I have loving and supportive parents. We aren’t rich, but we aren’t struggling either (thank goodness, because while I’m fully financially dependent on my parents right now, I’m not a financial burden to them). Yes my older sister was one of my bullies, but she grew out of it and I don’t hate her for it. She was no worse than the school bullies. We don’t have much of a relationship now, but we get along fine at family gatherings. Not a great childhood, but no traumatic event to resolve. I’ve taken a number of hits in the last few years, and I’m trying to get back into therapy for that, but it’s either a waiting list for government funded therapy, or about $150/hour out-of-pocket for private therapy. That second option is a full nope. And if I end up with a therapist who’s determined to help me with unresolved childhood trauma, I’m going to walk right out the door.

So today: I have 2 friends. Total. One friend I’ve had for probably about 15 years. I can talk to them about anything, but they’re a terrible listener. The type of person who can carry a long conversation entirely on their own, which is great, because I don’t have to contribute much if I’m not in the mood. They care, and are empathetic, but don’t really understand what I’m dealing with because for them depression is feeling blue for a few days once in a while. Constant soul-crushing despair for weeks at a time is a foreign concept. On the downside, they now have kids and I don’t like kids. It’s straining the relationship (from my perspective at least), because the kids are everything now, rightly, but I can’t stop myself from resenting the kids for coming along and changing the friendship dynamic. The other friend I’ve had for about 10 years. It’s a very different relationship, and we spend chunks of time in quiet companionship. It’s restful, and I need it, but it’s not someone I can talk to about everything. Complete trust, that’s not the problem. But it makes them really uncomfortable when I’m obviously unhappy and they can’t help. I can’t make them feel like shit to make myself feel better. I won’t. (I won’t confide in my parents for the same reason - it’s distressing to them when I’m unhappy and they can’t fix it.)
I had a couple of other people I thought I could talk to. Not fully confide in, but at least know they were on the other end of the phone if I needed to vent. Apparently not. One randomly ghosted me a few months ago, and when I asked the other one for advice about something related to social anxiety today they pretty much told me that my crazy is above their pay grade and I need counselling. They blocked me the second they finished typing.

So now I’m turning to the anonymity of Reddit to vent some misery because I don’t know what else to do. My psychiatrist isn’t a counsellor, and can’t be reached (if I leave a phone message they might get around to calling me back eventually). I’m still on a waiting list for a therapist. I called a crisis line once, and got the feeling that if I wasn’t in any danger then I should leave their line open for people who were. THAT was really helpful. I’m bawling my eyes out at 4am because I want to go to sleep and not wake up, but because I have no plans to make that actually happen I should just try to get some sleep? Oh, but ‘call us back this afternoon so we know you were serious about not being in danger’. Thanks.

Downward spiral, mediocre health, no desire to continue to live, no interest in hobbies I used to enjoy, and no energy or motivation to do anything. I don’t even know what I hope to accomplish by posting here, except I can’t keep everything bottled up, and I have no one to talk to. I’ve given up. I even feel like my attempts to get a therapist are more about trying to pass responsibility for the progress of my life to someone else. I’m lost. I’m miserable, and I’m completely lost.",2,depression
"Good evening everyone, I don’t know where to start.

I can’t do this anymore.

Long story short, I have social anxiety and I always overthink.

I am a college student in a business school (I finish in a year) and I have 0 friends.

What I’m about to describe always happens to me ever since high school but today I’m just wondering why this keeps happening to me.

We often have teamwork during classes. When I’m in teams with other students, I feel very uncomfortable, especially around girls my age. I don’t come from a nice background and I feel so fucking worthless in front of these people. They all seem to be doing better than me in every spheres of life and that directly affects me. When we do group work, I have a hard time speaking up because I feel so uncomfortable around them and I feel like I can’t speak. I kid you not I panic so much i can’t talk.

Then when i do talk, I’m not even joking people ignore me and don’t even make eye contact, as if I were a ghost. I am never acknowledged and seen by people and it really is hurting my mental health. Can you imagine the courage it takes for me to speak up and then be fucking ignored by 4 people?

Whenever I’m in class i can’t concentrate as my mind is always thinking about how ugly and how useless and inferior i am to the rest of these people. 

I feel like a loser whenever I’m in class. I feel worthless. I feel that all these other students are far better than me in every aspects of life. And they probably are. They’re all good looking people while I’m the most ugliest guy out there (I’m 23 y/o and still never had a gf, it’s a me issue at this point). 

I really want to get a girlfriend who will be there by me and from who I’ll learn things and possibly improve my wellbeing. I just want to have a shoulder on which I can rest my heavy head.

I just can’t no more guys.

Idk what’s so bad about me that people feel disgusted about to treat me in such a way.

I’m often tired and when I do feel energized, I get totally overwhelmed by the way people treat me. I see all these other students talking with other students they never met, smiling and laughing and no soul even dares to ask me my pathetic name.

Wishing the best to the rest of you all.

"So, i have always had headaches on and off behind my eyes around my period. But thursday I experienced my first ever migraine at work. I had the bright white spot on my right eye and thought hm thats weird. Then it got worse and worse, spread to both eyes, I couldn’t see anything. Then I got the squiggly/flashing lines for around 45 min. Put my head down on my desk. My coworker came in shut off all lights and gave me a cold compress. After my vision returned the headache started. I moved to the floor of my office for an hour and took two tylenol. The headache would not let up so they wheeled me to my car in an office chair (embarrassing). 

My mom picked me up. Around 3 hours later the headache was almost gone but turned to a slight dull ache. I slept well. Woke up and still felt a slight dull ache. Went to work. Felt tired and out of it. Then the nausea and dizziness came back. I pushed thru. once home i felt somewhat ok. head still feels “tight”.  Slept fine. 

Woke up today and I feel worse. I took my daughter to gymnastics and sipped a coffee. Literally two sips. Im nauseous again. Very foggy. Almost like the fog I had with covid. Im having trouble concentrating, driving, just feel out of my body. Not hungry at all. Dizzy.

"I have major depressive disorder for many years. But I am not suicidal and have never attempted suicide. But I was locked in the Citrus Health Network by the Baker Act and kept under stress for 29 hours.  They threatened me, exacerbated all my phobias, brought me to a big panic attack and a heart attack. They forced me to sleep on a very hard bed in a terrible cold, although I warned them about the big problems in my spine. I could hardly move from the pain and could not sleep. After this ""medical care"", my life is broken, but no one answered for these crimes.

"So I'm 17y I've witnessed some things when I was young that I wasn't supposed to witness (such as a my parents abu$ing eachother)..I also didn't have a family like a cousin or a grandma because we don't talk to them.

When I was 14y I've seen my parents fighting in front of my face and I couldn't handle it so I went into a panic attack so I still have this panic attack from a time to time and sometimes without any reason!!.

So when I turned 17y exactly I start getting attached to any guy I talk to also girls! For example when I'm talking to a guy i just met and he's kind to me i tell myself omg I'm gonna be with him or I'm gonna marry him and I get attached to him so fast but when I meet someone else who's more kind to me i forget about the other person and I get attached to the second person and it's going like that...

After I talk to that person and they start ignoring I start crying and sometimes I feel depressed for three days or smth...sometimes I want to kms so baaad cos I always beg for attention or dying to find someone who can take care of me idk why I wanna be loved so bad!!!!! Even tho I do love myself is just I feel like with a strange feeling when someone really take care of me and idk whyy! But I love that feeling it's like heaven so I keep looking for attention...I'm starving for LOVE sometimes I think I'm crazy but I just need a caring person so I get attached to people so fast thinking that they're going to give the love that I'm dreaming about but I'm always wrong.

I’ve been experiencing seasonal allergies for the first time this summer season, which initially started with Eustachian tube dysfunction about 4 weeks ago and subsequently progressed on to possibly the worst cough and nasal congestion of my life over the past couple days. It got to the extent that I could barely sleep because I was coughing up a lung every 5 minutes - and so I went in to an urgent care today, where the doctor promptly diagnosed me with allergic rhinitis and suggested I get a Kenalog-40 shot since it’d give me allergy relief for a long period of time. I agreed and got it, but I’m also a huge hypochondriac and made the mistake of looking up side effects and am now freaking out about how people have claimed to have gotten depression, anxiety and insomnia (not to mention weight gain) after the administration of Kenalog and it’s honestly freaking me out because they’ve also claimed some side effects to be “permanent”. Has anyone who’s taken Kenalog had side effects as adverse as these, or has it been relatively normal/nothing at all? Thank you!

"Hi

I don't know how to start this properly but I want to talk about me feeling like im nobody.

I am 23 years old and living in a big family of 18, i am number 15 in line. From childhood i got little to no parenting from my parents, not that they weren't amazing parents, they just did not know how to raise a child to have good routines. When i was a child i did not go to kindergarten, we had an aupair while my parents were working at their company. They were never strict on me brushing teeths or showering, they would tell me to do it. But as a child, if you don't want to do something then you don't do it unless you get forced to. 

So as i am in school, i would start to skip days because i felt like it had no consequences. Which then without me knowing made me the weird kid. I had my friends, that are still my friends to this day and are great. Anyways the reason i am bringing this up is because this didn't come to my attention before one of my friends told me that i used to be the weird kid. And then everything clicked, now i understand why no one ever had contact with me outside of school, it's because they wouldn't want to be seen with the weird kid. I never felt bullied, but more unnoticed. And that is how i still feel, because it's kind of true.

2 years ago i went on a work and travel program where you can live for free in another country by working for a company in that country. We were 10 guys and i felt like we had so much fun and i felt like i made so many new friends. After the 1 year of working had past, we had become somewhat close at least that's what i thought. You see, everyone was close except for me but i didn't know this. I found out about this by seing all the Happy Birthdays posts they made for each other on instagram. But no one ever made one for me, and i see that they are still hanging out. While even though i have contacted them, no one has ever reached out to me... Like i don't exist and so that is what started my feeling of being a nobody. 

I feel like no one remembers me after having a deep conversation or shared laughs. 

And i feel like i haven't accomplished anything in my life. And i know im not dumb, i passed with top grades in school and have an iq of 120 according to mensa. It's just the feeling of nobody will ever remember me that weighs me down. 

We have a family chat group and everytime someone has a birthday, everyone congratulates people, and compliments them with 'Thanks for always showing up when we need something'. Meanwhile i haven't got a single meaningful comment like everything i do for my siblings or how much i care about them which i try to show them by coming visiting them. Its like they don't remember.

Right now we are doing carpentry work at the family cabin, and i hear ""Great work sibling!"" And i have a lot of carpentry experience so i was making the kitchen but all i got was complaining (from one of my brothers) all though everything i did was by the book and looks nice. 

And then he said a comment to me that made me absolutley resent him. He said you are just pretending to know how to do carpentry, while i put my heart and soul in to that project. And hadn't boasted anything about stuff i knew. It was so painful to hear that i felt physical discomfort. No one has ever expressed that they appreciate me. And i feel like i can't talk to them about feeling unappreciated.

Feeling like a nobody is draining and very deeply sad. 

I think the reason i feel like i haven't accomplished me is because i have never been recognised. And not being recognised also leads to lack of motivation.

Anyways thanks for reading my messy post, i will gladly take any advice or other thoughts on the subject.",2,depression
"In every freaking community I go in I kept seeing ""high functioning"" and ""low functioning"" every freaking time and it's really upsetting!

"I did it. I told him everything about what's been going on. I told him about the feelings of strongly believing that something evil has entered inside me and that it's been controlling my thoughts and emotions. I told him about the self harming triggered by these horrible intrusive thoughts, and how I have no control over these urges. And I told him how these voices in my head are completely destroying me. He was soooo understanding and listened so well. I feel so relieved! I feel like finally I'm being heard and that I'm going to get the help I need and deserve. Right now I'm on haldol orally but he wants to switch me to the injection so it stays in my body longer to try and control symptoms. He said that this belief of feeling this darkness inside is definitely a delusion and that I'm not crazy, but that it is the illness and it's going to be okay. I'm also taking abilify again which I hope will also help me because these symptoms are really kicking my ass right now. I'm hoping the haloperidol injection wont make me too tired? And that there aren't alot of other side effects. He also said if I need a hospital stay to sort all this out that he will bring me in and see what he can do. Honestly I feel so much better after today's appointment. Does anyone have any advice about how they manage they're delusions and hallucinations?

The only issue is we read horror stories of Hertz having a practice of renting cars that were reported stolen (prior drivers never returned vehicles, Hertz later received vehicles but never updated their software to say the cars were returned, rented cars to new customers who get stopped by police on flag for stolen vehicles) having to drivers arrested by the police. We prefer to avoid a company that puts its customers through this but want to see if the company is worth the risk since the settlement in December.

"So I honestly never really encounter many low levels, and I have only had a few minor crashes before. Anyways, today, right before dinner, I felt weird. I started getting shaky and a little nauseous and so I checked my blood sugar, and it was 118, so it was lower than it was at lunch. I was confused because I know what having a low feels like yet I was still in the normal range. Something I was told but I never exactly looked into it and confirmed it and just took it was that even though it was normal when doing a check, I could have been crashing and it was still going down and that I need to correct it.

"Hey guys! I (21 Born F) have a GI appointment tomorrow & am not seeking “medical advice"", just wondering if anyone has had similar symptoms because I’ve been toiling over this since it happened (Content warning, its very gross)

Ive had disordered eating for the majority of my life. In college I had pretty bad IBS symptoms, constipation & urgency but never medically concerning. The day before yesterday I was a bit stressed about my work hours but not even close to as anxious as I was every single day at past jobs. My full list of symptoms & timeline is as follows:

symptoms:
brightish red in stool (started with clear & yellow mucus, which was present for rest of day, with occasional leaking) 

constipation+diarrhea, frequent unhelpful bathroom trips

lower gut pain (enough to wake from sleep, more stress = more pain, slightly debilitating. All stomach pain was concentrated around & below bellybutton) 

trouble regulating temperature (too hot then instantly too cold)

shortness of breath 

lightheadedness & heavy nausea

physical weakness

timeline:
3am-7am: went to bathroom a few times, restless with light pain, constipated but didn’t check stool 

9am: clear & yellow mucus (present for rest of the day) pain continues to increase until ~5pm

10am: able to do small bowel movements, noticed blood in stool (small piece & spots of blood)

11-3pm: a little more blood in the next stool, stool afterwards had most blood (appeared on toilet paper)

3-6pm: went home, took softener+laxative, pain lessened & able to fall asleep

today: having no symptoms other than light stomach pain & some constipation. possible spots of blood but not even close to amount from yesterday.

Ive also had two general blood tests recently. This could easily be unimportant, but the only listed abnormalities are as follows:

4/11/23 - A/G ratio 2, Carbon Dioxide 23

5/3/23 - A/G ratio 2.3, Carbon Dioxide 19 along with LDL Cholesterol Calc at 107

I am REALLY confused as to how my symptoms could get so bad then largely vanish so quick. Id be really interested to know if this is the worlds first original experience or if anyone else has had symptoms start then stop so suddenly. Again I am not seeking “medical advice” as I have a GI appointment tomorrow, Im just anxious & can only think about this.

"I (M25) just had my fourth allergic reaction this last Sunday. Me and some friends were at a Mexican restaurant a couple of states away to see some other friends and suddenly out of nowhere, I got extremely red all over my face & chest, some hives on my chest, and breathing started to become more difficult than normal (I'd say 50% more difficult). My previous reactions weren't nearly as possibly life threatening as this one, so i never really paid too much mind to it, but this was sort of a wake up call so I now have an allergist appointment to finally find out what I'm allergic to.

The main thing I'm curious about is what I should avoid in the meantime. The allergic reactions have been extremely inconsistent with each other and I wouldn't know where to begin on what it is besides a possible mold. Anyone have any good guess till my allergist appointment?  


**First reaction** (Family friend's house for a party)

* Face became red and puffy
* Breathing required way more effort, but was still possible and easy to do
* ""Lightening strikes"" looking rashes on my skin coming from my throat to my chest
* Was drinking Bacardi (which I've had plenty of times before and after without a reaction) from a liquor tap

**Second Reaction** (Different friend's house)

* Woke up with hives ALL OVER my body (had to have been at least a dozen of them)
* Hives were extremely itchy
* Felt hot and sweaty
* Absolutely no trouble breathing
* Went to ER thinking they were spider bites, got told they were hives from something internal I ate or breathed

**Third Reaction** (Driving home from retail job)

* Breathing suddenly became extremely difficult to do halfway home (15 minutes into a 30 minute drive)
* Was not eating or drinking anything in the car
* stopped at a gas station to get benadryl, clerk let me take it and relax before having to pay because apparently I just looked that bad
* 30 minutes went by and I started feeling fine

**Fourth Reaction** (Mexican Restaurant)

* Friend said I don't look too good, then breathing started to become more difficult than usual
* Face was completely red and a little puffy
* Took a benadryl and felt better in thirty minutes
* I recall drinking a coronarita, eating tacos (with beef, sour cream, refried beans, cheese, pico de gallo) and that's it

Any suggestions on things to avoid until my allergist appointment? It seems breathing has become more difficult each time it has happened so I'm trying to think of what to avoid until then.",0,negative_samples

She is undiagnosed. 
She has been petitioned in for help 3 times in the last 6 months.

If people trying to help ask for more details about previous delusions or family history I'll provide it.

On to her current delusion...

Beginning roughly a month ago, she started becoming very concerned about things like 5g, wifi, power, being ""hacked"" (this started as her phone being hacked, but it's now her mind).

Fast forward to yesterday. 

She demanded that I get the kids in the car and drive the entire family to the nearest FBI office so she can report to them the imminent threat to our family. She got very angry with me when I refused, so much so that she walked to her mom's (it's right up the road).

This is the threat, as she explained it to me and as she described it on her tip submission form to the fbi.

Some group of people, unknown who, have been secretly ""ungrounding"" the electrical to our house. This is part a setup on our home so they have the ability to electrocute anyone in the house to death. The setup doesn't require anyone be using or even near electric devices, as they can pinpoint the electrical attacks through the air. At least one member of the attackers works for DTE (our power provider). 

I removed her from the situation last weekend by taking the family up north to our cottage. This didn't help, as they followed us there (per her).

She is aware of their plan because they have hacked her brain and have been telling her the details of it. Her staying at her moms for the night was out of self preservation, because they told her they were going to kill her that night. Since the electrical kill setup is only at our house, she's safe from that as long as she is not on our property. Lastly, in her words, she has been ""acting like she's crazy"" for last few months at their direction. If she didn't do this, they were going to kidnap our children. 

Sorry that got long, but it's still only a fraction of what's going on right now.

Here is my issue...

We are not married and I don't have power of attorney over her. I can only petition her in if she is a danger to herself or others. If anything, she is hyper protective of herself and others right now. I called our local mental health rep that I normally deal with and was told that there is nothing they can do.

All I want to do is help.

The only people left in her life she can go to for help is her parents and one of her brothers. I'm considering telling her that she has to make a choice.

1. Make an appointment with CMH (community mental health), attend all appointments and take all prescriptions or she is no longer able to live in our home.

Or..

2. Check herself in to the local facility and remain there until her medications are helping, or she is no longer able to live here.

I don't know which of these 2 is best and I can't put into words how terrible I feel just thinking about telling her she has to leave if she doesn't seek help.

Since I'm sure someone will ask, she is on medication right now (seroquel)  and I ensure she takes it.

Any suggestions?",6,schizophrenia

A couple months ago I had a personal problem with some people who I now really don’t like. Everywhere I go I feel worried about seeing them. I’m scared to even get the mail because I feel like I might see them even if they don’t live anywhere near me. I also have been really defensive when anyone says anything I don’t like even if I know it’s a joke. I always feel like they hate me and are just trying to make it seem like a joke.

"Even as i type this I am feeling anxious. I've been missing classes and have dropped a couple of shifts at work because I found it near impossible to take a train without feeling really anxious, needing to vomit and have a bowel movement.

Around 1-1.5 months ago the near-incident i am talking about was basically me needing to immediately have a bowel movement while taking the train. Now, I can get off on a lot of stops, there are shopping centers nearby the stations so it shouldn't be a problem? Yeah, it isn't, however, I don't know if I had something bad, or if it was just my diet as a whole (I went on a healthy diet, got sick, ended up on a crappy diet for a bout a month and a half, back on healthy diet now)  but I had one of those really, really ""emergency need to evacuate bowels RIGHT NOW"" situations.. while the train experienced a FAULT in the middle of two stations not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES. We were stuck for about 15-20 minutes and judging by how I feeling at the time and what my experience was like, I'm pretty sure I had a panic attack.

Ever since that experience, each time I went onto the train I've always experienced abdominal cramps even if I've had bowel movements in the morning (I made sure to wake up an hour earlier to get everything out of the way) and then I started experiencing nausea ontop of that. I keep 3 water bottles in response to the near incident because it barely manages to keep me from wanting to vomit. Then eventually I just couldn't stay on trains and caught ubers to my classes. I get really nauseous in the mornings and it gets even worse if I see someone with a coffee cup or even a small snack like a chocolate bar.

I've gotten a blood test and stool test done but I still need to wait for results. Is there any techniques that I can use apart from breathing/meditation (which is the first thing I focus on if i feel uneasy) that can make my experience bearable until I get over this? Because I feel like I have no option but to drive to the city and pay $20 for the entire day.",4,anxiety

"Hello everyone, I’m having a lot of anxiety lately (especially right now) about my headaches. To give some brief context, I started having nonstop headaches since mid 2020 I could barely sleep at night for 2 months with the pain and weird sensations and all the anxiety.

I did an MRI that came clear and also did a ECG with pulsing light to rule out seizures because I was scared it was that (I kept seeing little dots of light in my vision and it felt like my brain was going to explode any minute). 

I finally got seen by a doctor specialized in headaches and she diagnosed me with tension headaches and prescribed me amytriptiline which instantly helped (headaches were way less and I could sleep) and I stuck to it for a year. She then suggested I try to get off of it so I did slowly until I stopped taking it and I felt fine.

Then in April 2022 after playing some video games with flashing lights that always made me feel weird and triggered my anxiety because it gave me a headache I woke up one day a bit sensitive to light changes. Then a couple days later I could barely keep my eyes open because the light was killing me, I felt almost suicidal because I couldn’t do anything I just had to have everything dark the pain was so intense. It got better with time eventhough any flashing light would send me to agony, it’s like my brain would start squeezing itself and was going to collapse or something. That pain would subside more or less when the trigger was gone. 

I started having the tension headaches every day again but now with extreme photosensitivity and also some migraines (the one sided head throbbing headache). 

I have a hard time distinguishing my nausea, if it’s just anxiety or the headache. 

I went to another doctor and got back on amytriptiline and started feeling better again, still sensitive to light strobe/flashing but very manageable. Recently he suggested tomapax but I’m worried about side effects.

Yesterday I had a pretty bad episode at work because of light strobing and I got a bit panic attack, thinking I as going to have a seizure. I usually feel my head tightening on my forehead like in bursts and every time it happens I get more nauseous but idk if it’s just anxiety (I suffer from health anxiety). It’s like my brain is trying to escape from my head.

Idk if I should do more exams to see if it’s just migraines or if it’s more. 

Does anyone have/had these symptoms? What do you think? 

I just really want some opinions and to talk to other people who might relate

"This is Buddy, he was my therapy bird, and emotional support animal. My grandma gave him to me when she went into the hospital for surgery to remove some cancer, worried that if something happened to her I would be alone. 
I got him when he was just under a year old, and he thought me so much about body language and indeed he made me feel like I had someone, especially after she passed away, I coddled Buddy like my baby. 
whenever I was upset he'd always crawl or fly up to me and fluff up just comforting me.
I ended up entering a relationship with someone who was unstable, I would clean his self inflicted wounds, watch as he physicality fought with freinds, but when he reacted violently towards his cat I had to end it. During the break up he threatened to set me on fire, and stole just about everything I had. 
I had severe problems after that, I had to move back in with my parents and couldn't really communicate what was going on, and when they started trying to change how I interacted with Buddy I started to shut down. 
They removed him from my room, got upset because he wouldn't shut up.. Really he was screeching because I wasn't around. 
And eventually they said I wasn't taking care of him to their standards and said I had to get rid of him. So he got rehomed to my sister and died less than 6 months later. 
It broke me...as John wick said ""[he] was an opportunity to greive unalone, and you stole that from me, killed that from me"" 
I miss him everyday.. And the place were staying doesn't allow animals.. And a therapy or emotional support animal isn't protected by the disability act.. 
He thought me about gasses, specifically Teflon, which made him sick and I had to rush him to a 24hour vet.

"F25.

I've been having gut issues since forever, but always put it down to a variant of normal. Last year I was sick for a month 6+ BM/day with +/-mucus/blood. Also had night sweats and a low grade fever throughout that month. Lost a bit of weight and went into the underweight BMI.

I eventually went to the GP who ran some tests. Results were borderline low Hb and calprotectin at **2300**. I was  referred for a scope but eventually turned it down since I felt somewhat better and didn't want to waste resources on probably nothing (I work in medicine).

Spent the next few months with on/off diarrhoea with mucus but rarely blood. Recently went back to the GP who ordered bloods that showed lower Hb (100) and ferritin (6) than last time as well as slightly raised platelets (marker of inflammation). The GP suggested repeating the calprotectin and getting referred again if the result was high.

The thing is, despite getting frequent diarrhoea with blood/mucus again my recent calprotectin came back at **44**.

Not quite sure what to make of this. I'm assuming if I still have symptoms the GP will have me repeat the stool test again in a few weeks/months and will monitor my iron levels.

Has anyone's calprotectin varied like this without doing anything?

"“Water flows from high places to low places. That is the nature of gravity. Emotions also seem to act according to gravity. When in the presence of someone with whom you have a bond, and to whom you have entrusted your feelings, it is hard to lie and get away with it. The truth just wants to come flowing out. This is especially the case when you are trying to hide your sadness or vulnerability. It is much easier to conceal sadness from a stranger, or from someone you don’t trust.”

"I used to read constantly. All the time. Always a book in my hand even for a trip to the gas station. Then I started my adult life and naturally had less time to read - a book or two a day became a book or two a week - and that was fine. I discovered fanfics and book reading went down, but I was still *reading* and through the years I went back and forth between published books and fics, and it was fine. 

I've been in a slump though. I don't mean a recent one, it's been ongoing. I stopped being interested in any traditionally published book, but I told myself that was okay because I was reading fics, and then I stopped reading fics, but that was okay because I liked audiobooks and that's really fine because even if it's listening, I'm still reading books. 

But now I can't get very far through an audiobook before I'm turning it off and sitting in silence. I get books from the library and read the first few chapters and then return them because I just can't be bothered anymore. 

It's not that the stories aren't interesting. It's not genre burnout because I've been switching it up both genre and reading level wise, including ones I usually avoid full stop, just to try. It's not that I need something new because I can't seem to care about it, and it's not that I need something loved and familiar because I tried that and didn't make it past chapter 1. 

I can't even blame my mental health. I'm in therapy and on meds and in a better place than I've been in years, and I've been in this good place for a while now so I can't even say it's an adjustment period.

They just don't ensnare me like they used to. Instead of being something I get lost in, they're still just words on a page.

"I am in my 40s have adhd. When cornered and under stress I am rude and blunt. In other words I am the asshole. 

Situation causing me intense anxiety 

Mom :  75 years old , not healthy, obese. Has moved on with us from out of the country after my dad passed away. She cannot and will not stay by herself even with house help. She has no insurance in the US. I love her to death but I can’t sleep thinking of the time bomb that her health is.

I’m sometimes rude to her why I’m too stressed.

Kid : 13 year old  girl. Also with adhd. I have to be after her for everything. She is doing ok on school but is not doing another extra curricular activities. No sport. Very defiant. Very picky eater. I love her to death and I’m constantly worried how she will compete and be successful.

I’m rude and harsh with her when she’s doesn’t do things after repeatedly telling her to do something nicely. 

Wife : We loved each other to death. And we still love each other. I think. She is very hardworking but in the evenings likes to be on a phone, insta , making reels. She is a performer and very much into posting reels of her comedy, dance , friends. 

We sleep in separate rooms since my daughter sleeps in the master bedroom with her. They are very close. My wife is very patient with her does not force her to do anything (which irritates me). She has basically stopped caring about what I feel and does what she wants. But she takes care of the house even though she works. 

Me: I’m constantly reflecting on situations , sexually frustrated, indisciplined and not always completely cheerful. I try to sit in my room when I’m low. But I try to help around in the house but I’m not consistent. I just can’t get into a routine. I’m doing ok at work , earn 150k+. But it’s stressful and I’m paranoid about the future. 

The situation gives me intense anxiety but I get up everyday telling myself I’ll improve . I have low self esteem because of my inability to have self control.

I get angry but only after my polite ways are ignored or when these people are rude or unfair to me. And then I’m rude and an asshole. I always try to explain why I’m angry in every flare up .

I have best interest of everyone in mind and I try to be fair but people only point out at how I talk at times when my back is to the wall.

How do I deal with this ? I don’t want play the victim but I realize my post sure sounds like that.",3,adhd

For the past couple of months I’ve been paranoid its been non stop and its driving me crazy. I cant sleep at night, without thinking someone is going to break into my house shoot me in the head and harm the rest of my family. I have no reason to think that why the fuck am i thinking that.

If my parents arent back at their regular time after work it triggers it. Every little thing just triggers me being paranoid, noises and people.  Its been so bad its hard to function in my daily life. I know its bad but fuck man it’s gotten to a point where i sleep with a knife. 

I dont do drugs or drink or anything to make me feel the way i do. Its like i have the feeling of impending dooming over me 24/7.",5,paranoia
"Sometimes you just need to get it out of your head and into the world. That's all this post is..
(I don't have these 24/7, but these are the thoughts that fill my brain and really freak me out on bad days.)

My Delusions and Paranoid Thoughts:

- I live in a time loop that has happened over and over again. My life has already happened and I have lived through most moments multiple times already. Each time is slightly different but mostly very similar. 
- Scientists are studying my ideas and actions for research on individuals with non neurotypical brains. My entire life is a lie.
- There are cameras outside my window. Or someone can see through it eventhough the blinds are down. (Sometimes I have to put a sheet over the window to feel better)
- I can empathize with my cats and read their emotions.
- The love of my life is only pretending to love me. It's all a science experiment, or maybe a big joke. Maybe its televised to thousands of people. Maybe the entire thing is a rouse. They don't trust me enough to really love me.
- This life is not real. It's all a dream. Or in my head. I will wake up some day in a mental ward and that's when I'll really have lost my mind.
- People in my daily life are part of an elaborate scam. Not all of them, but some. So you can never fully trust anyone.
- There is a seperate personality living inside my body. Silent and always observing. 
- If I did something crazy enough (like spontaneously go skydiving) then I could break the system I'm stuck inside and  get my free will back.
- My inner thoughts speak to me while I'm drifting off to sleep, but I'm to close minded to hear them.
- If I get high enough someday (on weed, shrooms, acid, or what have you) My personality will fully split and I will be two seperate people. One good and one bad.
- My body speaks to me. (In a phantom way) 
- The art I make gets analyzed by professionals and archived to be used in treating patients with mental disorders.
- My controlling parents have trapped me in their own fake world. Where I believe I have freedom, but it's all in their control.
- The choices I make are pre determined. I can only have so many options.
- People (Managers) at work watch me while I'm on the job. They have to make sure I'm on task.
- I've read all the books in my personal library (I haven't), so what's the point in reading them again if I'm only being studied.
- The tv shows I watch are all directed towards me. They all have a different message to convey. Whether it's about my life, my relationships, my mental health, the fact that I think the tv is narrating my fucking life. (Same with the radio) They are always trying to help though, so it doesn't bother me too much.
- I get baited to watch the same shows over and over again (with gaps in between) to see how I react to them. That data is given to people who analyze my personality. 
- The manifestation of my childhood dragon friend lives in the spirit world and sleeps in the tree next to my old college dorm room. (This one's real interesting).
- My partner brings up the same conversations to see how I react (Similar to the tv shows)
- If I don't double check the door at night to make sure its locked someone will come in and murder my partner. There would be nothing I could do about it.
- If I tell my partner all these intrusive thoughts, they will be terrified and send me to shock therapy.
- Certain tasks in my life have been constructed to measure my strength and endurance. (This makes me work extra hard for no reason)


I might make a part 2 later bc this isn't all of them. It's making me emotional to wrote them down. It's good to get it all out though. 

Real Quick! I have been to therapy, not currently because of my finances. I'm planning on seeing a physiologist or psychiatrist asap. My partner knows I have paranoia and is always very helpful and understanding. Sorry for any typos :)",5,paranoia
"Basically all my life I’ve been super sensitive to pain. For example, whenever I’d trip on the sidewalk and get scraped it would feel like I was just stabbed with a dagger. Because almost any kind of pain response feels to that of burning or getting cut I have a relatively high cut tolerance. This means that I don’t feel as much pain if I’ve accidentally cut myself. But any other kind of pain hurts horribly. For example, If I’m punched once the pain lingers for at least two minutes. During that time frame, it feels like I’m being punched over and over again by a fist that’s over 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Due to this, whenever I get into a fight of any kind, my adrenaline is incredibly quick to build up, this leads to me feeling very exhausted and I struggle to breath while fighting. Even getting angry is enough to make me nearly pass out, and being angry feels like a brain freeze that never ends. I try to not get into physical fights of any kind because the lightest punch feels like a bullet shot and will be enough to trigger my fight response which results in me completely losing control. This is when I can be extremely dangerous to myself and the opponent. I just wish I wasn’t like this.",1,autism
"I am 23m and haven't dealt with Allergies before. Since the start of Covid, I started dealing with anxiety issues, but for the past year I have been able to manage much better.

A couple weeks ago, pollen has been flying like crazy here in Northern California, almost snowing. The only reason why I think it could maybe be allergies is because I only started to feel weird in the sense of balance, vision, and brain fogginess just recently out of no where. 

I am experienced with Anxiety and I know that it's possible my mind could be playing tricks, but after reading how there are people with similar symptoms with this allergy season, I started to question maybe it's all the dust and pollen that is flying in the sky.

"I'm afraid of people finding out that my different accounts on different different websites are all me for my security, even if there isn't anything criminalizing, so I word my posts and comments differently on different accounts.

Like if I posted the same question on  a different website, I'd ask ""Is this going a bit too far?"" and never use the word overboard on that account. On Reddit I go back and forth between ending the last sentence with a period and not, but on Twitter I almost never do. Another reason's the character limit, but I'd do that even if there wasn't one. Even this throwaway account's a little different than my main Reddit account. I wasn't always doing that on this, but now I'm making them more different.

"Hello, I'm a \~5'9"" 130 lb Caucasian/Filipino 21M living in California. I'm not currently taking any medication (besides Tums and 2 days of taking Prilosec), nor do I smoke/drink/etc.  


I've been have quite a lot of symptoms for the past few weeks and they've just been progressively getting worse, so I don't know if I should go to the ER or not. My GI said its UC, Chron's, or cancer; I have a pending colonoscopy mid-June. I don't know if I'm going to be okay, if I'm developing toxic megacolon (or something similar), what I should do, or really anything at all; so if anyone has any insight they can give, it would be really really appreciated.  


Some of my symptoms include:   


Bloody stool, constipated stool, very gaseous (today in specific, which weirds me out hardcore because nothing similar happens to me at all), a huge amount of tightness + pressure + pain all throughout stomach but by far most in the upper middle stomach area right below chest, lots of stabbing pain in the lower left stomach area, fair amount of intermittent stabbing pain in random areas of stomach, incredibly dizzy, a huge amount of tightness + pressure + pain all throughout stomach but by far most in the upper middle stomach area right below chest, lots of stabbing pain in the lower left stomach area, fair amount of intermittent stabbing pain in random areas of stomach, diarrhea (sometimes even just pure liquid), very irregular bowel movements in general (have to go often and it is often light green, very liquid-y, has white-yellow mucus included, or is brown but hard and pebbly), constant headaches, very hungry lately, potential worms in stool (most likely just sesame seeds), near 24/7 100 bpm or higher (I noticed it spikes to and stays around 130-140 when needing to use and while using restroom). All pains above are around 4-8/10 pain, with the average probably being about 6. There are definitely more symptoms than these, but these are just what I could compile right now.  


Again, I don't know what to do or what is happening to me, but I'm just very scared of toxic megacolon or some other potentially fatal disease. I don't know if I should stick it out and wait, go to the ER, or something else. If anyone has any insight or advice at all, I would appreciate it a ton, thank you.",0,negative_samples
"Due to online school I’m alone at home. I finished school but when the voices of my teacher and other students didn’t fill the room anymore I naturally got up, grabbed one of my knifes and checked the entire house for intruders. Carefully checking every room and peeking my head through every doorframe carefully. After my inspections I keep the knife close and go on with my day, but keeping myself aware of my surroundings at all times. Like turning my good ear (hearing loss in other) towards open doors or windows on the ground floor.

"My local pharmacies are declining to fulfill out-of-state telemedicine prescriptions, so while I wait to switch to a local clinic, I have run out of Adderall and have been off it for 4 days now. I was always on a super low-dose (IR), so other than tiredness (which could also be attributed to a mild infection I’m fighting), I haven’t felt anything other than…happy. More at peace than I’ve felt for a long time and more excited about life around me. 

I was initially scared of going off it because I am worried how I will have to muscle through projects at work that are sometimes boring to me. But I had forgotten how much more creative and lively I am off of it.

Now I’m questioning whether or not even going back on medication is worth it. I mean, yes, it makes getting on task and staying on task easier, but I am so emotionally blunted. Which is hard because my creativity and in-born sense of inspiration is apparently, emotion-based.

"The most extreme thing I'm struggling with lately that has made this obvious is that I worry about being transported to a horrible place. There's a story I've seen about a boy who pressed a button to receive a million yen in exchange for being transported to an endless empty void for 500 million years, and then at the end of it he forgets all of it. It details all of the immense suffering and loneliness he endures and it's pretty horrible. Basically I worry about that happening to me, that when I fall asleep I'll wake up there, or maybe I already have every night and I just don't remember any of it. For weeks now I've felt uncomfortable with falling asleep in general, since that sort of temporary death experience scares me. But now it's to the point where my brain is telling me that falling asleep will actually result in hellish torture. I suffered from this to an even worse extent when I was younger, I thought it couldn't happen to me again, but it has.

&#x200B;

Reading other posts here I'm also realizing that I'm paranoid in other ways. Like when people don't respond to me quickly especially my boyfriend I worry about and even visualize them being dead or in immense harms way. I also feel like if I don't constantly outperform myself and do my best and work as hard as possible, the world will crumble around me and I'll be on the street or dead. These feelings are both similar to posts I found, and I was shocked that I related so much to posts on a subreddit about paranoia, because I've never thought of myself as paranoid before. I also have really bad OCD these days and worry about stuff like touching a surface and then getting sick, or I touch the surface and then my eyes and then I'll become blind. I also have to check stuff so many times, like my car being locked and especially that the burners on the oven are off, even if no one in the house has used them that day. Despite a lot of things in my life going really well, my anxiety and mental health in general has just been falling apart over the months, and it's becoming so hard to deal with.",5,paranoia
"56 yrs old, Diabetic since my early 30s. Started taking care of myself 3 years ago. I became a vegan which helped tremendously. My a1Cs have been in check for 3 years straight (4.7-5.1).

"I'm a 45 year old man. I was diagnosed with ADHD during a meeting with a psychologist... 6 years ago.  I knew about ADHD, like everyone else. But it never occurred to me that I ""had it.""  To be honest, like most everyone else, I wasn't even sure it was a ""real thing.""  I certainly did not think it was something that applied to any adult. So... anyway... I am in a real ""bottom of a well"" situation right now... and I just thought I might reach out for some help after watching a YouTube video where someone mentioned this subreddit. If you read this post, and think... ""Well... okay... but what specifically are you asking?"" I must pre-apologize... because I am not 100% sure. My life situation has gone from doing-okay... to NOT doing-okay... in record time. And right now, I have more problems than I could ever squeeze into a Reddit post. So... I'm kind of just... reaching out... hoping someone can give me... some kind of perspective or advice.

My job:  The job that I had up until I was laid of in March, was... the text book definition of... the WORST job for someone with ADHD. My job was one of those jobs where, my manager would assign me some mega-task... where it was not clear to anyone whether the task might take someone 2-3 weeks, 2-3 months... or even > a year. The team was made up of absolute golden-soul kind-hearted people... so... it seemed to me like a *perfect* job. They would basically ask me how long I think something would take. I would give an honest answer. But... I always over-estimated how long it really takes to do something. Like... I would say... ""I can have that done by Friday."" only to discover... I should have said ""three weeks."" But it was okay... because they would always say... ""No problem... just have it done by the end of the quarter."" i.e. deadlines of three months were extremely common. So... of course... I would intend to get right on that. But then... two-and-a-half months later... I was always scrambling to get something done. And always disappointing everyone.  I am a very charming guy... so i was always able to get help from all my resources... and I would get it done. But. for 5 years, this job was one big feeling of... Oh my God, I am a terrible person!!! dot com!!! dot  gov!!! dot ORG!!!

Then... when COVID began, I had to do my job from home. I'm divorced, and live alone. So... I became the shut-in-extrovert. And.. after two years of the most complete loneliness I've ever felt... plus... having a job that I was clearly destined to fail at...  my outlook on everything was (is)... bad. Very bad. And... I could not seem to explain it to anyone. My mom... sister... friends... Try explaining how your job is basically a cake walk in the park... and it's making you miserable!!! No one understands. They think it sounds perfect! Flexible deadlines.. Given months to complete easy stuff... blah blah blah. It all sounds like job-porn to most people. Anyway... my self-worth was at -11... and then... one morning... I get an email that my position was being eliminated. Laid off. 

At the time... I was not even upset! I honestly felt a deep feeling of relief.  I felt like I could finally get back out there and find something that I could be proud to do. Well... now... it's been 2 1/2 months. I have done some very minor online job searching. I've completed my resume and sent it to some companies... but I have not actually gotten down to business and started a solid job search. My insurance lapsed, and as I type this... I have no health insurance. I don't even know what COBRA is... and I feel absolutely paralyzed. paralyzed with fear that I might have an accident and have no insurance. Paralyzed that I am 45 years old and have NO IDEA. what job to search for. I don't know what I want to be when I ""grow up."" I was taking adderal, but that ran out 2 months ago. I was also taking Lexapro for anxiety... that also ran out.

So... yeah... I was already depressed, lonely, and feeling worthless. I lost my job... and within a couple of weeks, I've gone from feeling worthless to not even knowing it was possible to feel this bad. Stopping those medications cold-turkey like that was... terrible. I am not a ""sad person."" Meaning... I do not cry often... I do not think bad thoughts... In general, I'm a pretty ""peppy guy"" usually. But... since I lost this job... I've been crying, every, day! Like... sobbing in the shower!!! I haven't slept an actual night's sleep in... months. I wake up at 6:00 pm... feel like I'm in some kind of bad dream where I am awake all night... and then pass out from exhaustion at 7:00 - 8:00 am... trying to NOT do that... so i can reset myself and try to stay awake so I can ""get normal"" again. 

I've started walking every day. I try to really push myself to do exercise hoping that it will reset my clock.. and I can get some good Vitamin D from the sun and some endorphins.  And I do feel a good sense of accomplishment, but it is not helping with the sleep. I don't drink alcohol (thank god!) I did in the past... but... I got away from that years ago. And, I've been trying to do as many ""Reaching out"" activities as possible. i.e. using Meetup dot com to find some hobby groups... tried online dating... trying to just meet some new people. I think the dating part is a little stupid right now...but to be honest... it's been great! I have been starving for just conversation... so... I enjoy it, even if I am not exactly ""boyfriend material"" right now. 

Anyway... I will end this post now... but really... my main ask... of you guys... is... How on Earth can I find a job that fits my ADHD brain? I did some Google searching for ""Best jobs for people with ADHD,"" and they were all jobs that I cannot just... get. Like... Teacher. Journalist. Food Service.  I'm 45... single income... have a $1,500/month mortgage. I can't just... be a teacher. or ... become a journalist. And Food Service... I wouldn't have the slightest idea about that. 

Does anyone here have a resource for, ""ADHD Tech jobs."" I honestly feel like my ""calling"" is to be something where I am helping people. But... like... within a tech sector, environment. Like... a manager... or a consultant. But I don't have any mgmt experience and... I just don't know where to turn for some help with getting my head straight.",3,adhd

I was just wondering if anyone else hums while walking around a supermarket? I've noticed I do this every time and it's the thing I think that stops me getting stressed out, as I can get really angry in my stomach when I'm walking around and people annoy me by standing in the way or just being not considerate of others... Just wondered if this could be an ADHD symptom or not",3,adhd
"Convinced I will go crazy, now I know this person took the same meds as me

I fucked up. I know not to watch disturbing crime shit or negative stuff. I recently started a medicine called “lamictal”. I watched a true crime series on Netflix today about a girl who took the same meds, stopped taking them and went crazy and hid in a water tank and died. I don’t want to discuss the film. I realize this is irrational. But I cannot stop this thought and I’m on the verge of tossing the pills. I feel like I’m going crazy. I’m scared and my heart is racing.

"I’ve always had a bit of a skeptical nature since I was a kid. But then my best friend (like ride or die  soul sister) in college told me after two years into our friendship that she had lied to me about being raped and having an abortion.

I was so surprised and never guessed that. Ever since I guess I’ve had a really hard time trusting people. I’ve been to therapy. I’ve done emdr. It just still bothers me. Idk how to heal ?

Like, I read in a way where the rhythm of the book is important to me. I purposefully read sometimes below average because I want to- need to add a certain tone or cadence to something in order for the book to make an impact on me. 

For fast readers, I just want to know why you read fast? Are you able to get the same results out of a book when you don’t take longer to think about tone or rhythm? Or are you able to still do that? Is it just about training your mind?

"Wednesday was the worst. I went to work in person, which I hate. The first thing I was told was that I forgot a step on the very last day of our biggest project of the year. I did not. Someone else accidently deleted it.

I sat at my cubicle and discovered that yet another person used it for storage without my knowledge and that my shelves and drawers are now full. They even moved my personal stuff. It's the third time it happened.

My doctor called with bad news. 

My 2 closest coworkers somehow forgot about me and went to an important meeting without me, leaving me to struggle to figure out where to go (we have multiple buildings) and did not save me a place so I had to sit by myself. By then, I was really tired and irritated. 

The meeting was with a higher-up that I don't know well, and he was talking down to us and being condescending, like we were too dumb to understand the situation and he had to simplify it for us. Of course, I had to run my mouth and tell him that we are, in fact, quite intelligent people. I won't get reprimanded, but I certainly did not make a good impression. 

I went back to my desk and opened my email just to find a dozen new emails about the project mentioned before, most of them so outrageously stupid that I don't know how to answer. 

Yesterday, I had to take the day off for more health tests. The most likely scenario is that I have brain cancer. 

Now, it's Friday morning. I have to log in to work in 39 minutes, and I am paralyzed. My head is spinning, going back and forth between being mad at my coworkers, knowing that the stupid emails are waiting for me and thinking about dying. Being sad, disappointed, or stressed always transforms into being angry for me. How in hell do I get out of the spiral?",3,adhd

When i’m not anxious I start to feel sad. Its like I become hypersensitive to how shitty the world is and it brings on depressive feelings.

I’ve tried all sorts but it just feels like i’m fighting against the world and when there’s no thoughts at all that sense of anxiety in the chest is always there and it causes me to overthink and feel like somethings gonna happen, like a bad thought or intrusive thought or worry that a bad dream will repeat and I don’t know what to do to stop that.

"So, I'm pretty paranoid about health.

Today I had a 2 litre Pyrex measuring jug filled up. I took it out of the microwave and as it was very heavy and hot I dropped it about a inch or two onto the counter top by accident. It made a loud bang. I checked the surface to see if there was any cracks, but there was nothing major that I could see. However, after closer inspection I found a faint hairline scratch, I guess is what you would call it, on the outside of the jug. I can't be certain that it was there before.

Then tonight I inspected the inside of the jug and found very very faint hairline scratches and I don't know if that is from today.

My worry is that I'm going to absorb some of the glass when I cook with it through the hairline scratches. I feel like if I was a normal person then it wouldn't be a concern, but I am considering buying a new jug as precaution but I don't want to spend the money (that's another issue for another day).  


I'm trying to rationalize by saying if the food that I cook with has the ability to discolor the glass and grim can build up in between the microscopic glass particles then what's the difference between the hairline scratches and this as the glass always carries a risk of absorption, if this makes sense.  
If the glass particle compounds are the same on the outside as in the inside is there any difference? Maybe it's coated with a different compound.  
Also, let's say I do absorb some of the glass, does it really pose any risk?

"Hi❤️ I’m a F23 with two troubled parents, I have BPD, my mom has ADHD and my dad was just diagnosed w schizophrenia today, he is 42 years old and has always been depressed and dissociative ever since I can remember. He begun having manic / psychotic behaviour beginning 2018. 

He is highly intelligent and sensitive, loves movies, music, video games and the cosmos. 

I want to be there for my dad. I want to know how it has been for those of u who are diagnosed to have ur condition and what to be mindful of. I also do have a few friends who are sc and I want to be as mindful as possible of what I can do to help when they are very triggered. I always make sure to ask them myself what they need too ofc in a soft manner.

I just got the «news» of his final diagnosis today, though he started experiencing drug induced (Ritalin / Amfethamine / Weed ) psychosis in 2018 and ever since then was he ever the same.

Up until now I thought he might be autistic with isolated incidents of drug induced psychosis’ that turned to the psychosis lingering for years after.

In his very intense episodes he mostly sees demons and wants to fulfill some sort of prophecy, and / or he thinks he’s being followed and is suspicious of everyone but me and my grandma.

I remember him as being calm, witty, sensitive and smart my whole childhood / young adulthood leading to 2018. Though, apparantly whenever he was ill I would stay at my grandma’s house and she would tell me he had a fever or stomach bug instead.. 

Since 2018 he has been aggressive, accusive, he breaks things (electronics, his windows and walls). He was recently forced to sell his apartment because he’s been screaming a lot, and broke things constantly and I guess my worry now is will he with his diagnosis and finally getting the right medication be able to lead a good life again?

I don’t want to be insensitive to my dad but I really miss the way he used to be so much, we were best friends and talked every day pre 2018, and I guess I thought there was a possibility that he would go back to his «normal» self again but I now understand that he has actually always been like this and I actually just never knew. He has been in a good psychiatric hospital for half a year now and after careful observation they finally diagnosed him 

I am curious to hear from those of you who have been diagnosed with sc yourselves in your later years and how it affected you. Also those who have sc parents and how it has been for u.❤️",6,schizophrenia

"There was an incident in my Food studies class a few weeks ago that has left me upset enough to skip the class for my own mental health as I no longer feel comfortable or welcome in the classroom.

I was working with my friend (17M) in class when another student (17F) who we were not working with put pepper into our bowl.

For some context I (16F) am autistic and have severe sensory needs that makes me react to tastes, texture, smells, etc.. Pepper is something I am unable to cope with as it freaks me out and I have a minor allergy to it.

I rightfully got upset with her as I was never asked if she could add anything into our food(and I'm allergic), so I freaked out and yelled at her. I admit I might have overreacted but at the moment I was panicked and confused. The yelling got my teacher's attention and she got mad at me for swearing, which I understand but I felt targeted as she was only telling me off and not the boy’s in my class who were saying things much worse than I had (calling each other the c word and a range of slurs).  
It was getting really Loud to the point that I was on the floor in tears trying to calm myself down, when my teacher loudly exclaimed to me “that is verbal assault and I'm going to have to send you out” I took off my apron, left the school and I went home.

I purposely missed my food studies class for about a week as I didn't want any more conflict, But I did show up today.

I pulled the girl aside and I apologized for yelling at her and tried to explain that I had sensory problems and that I was allergic to pepper and her adding it without me knowing really freaked me out, but she rudely cut me off saying that she didn’t care and that It was my problem not hers.

I then tried to explain how putting things in other’s food is NOT ok and that even if she had asked my partner, she should have also asked me as it wasn’t JUST his food, to which she just said I was overreacting and “you should be grateful I even tried to help” I was calm the entire time and I was trying my hardest to not sound like I was blaming her, as that wasn't my intention, but It was at this point I got fed up and just let her go as she just wasn't listening.

I then tried to talk to my teacher and she just pushed me off and wouldn’t listen to me so I gave up and went to the library and did work for my art class.

I still feel really bad and I understand that she has the right to be upset, but I feel like my need's aren't being taking into consideration and I don't know what to do :(",1,autism

"I have been reluctant to post this as I have been trying to be sensitive to those who desperately want anything that will keep them alive.

If that is you, you may not wish to read on.

I am posting because I want to see if there are any others like me out there.

I am 68, single, live in the UK and have no family other than a daughter in New Zealand whom I am no longer in contact with. 

Diagnosed with breast cancer last August during a work up for gender affirming chest reconstruction and had a double mastectomy.  

I knew there was one lymph node in my armpit affected but I refused to let them do an auxiliary node clearance because of the risk of lymphodaema as already had problems with that arm that hindered my driving. 

I was given a prognosis of 83% chance of making 5 years. 

I refused to take any anti oestrogens due to potential side effects. 

I also made it clear on a number of occasions that I didn’t want chemo or rad because of side effects.

Jump forward to March this year and I suddenly sustained a spontaneous fracture in my pelvis.  I was in my first day of going on holiday, so ended up in a hospital far from home. Scans showed that there were widespread bony mets in my spine, pelvis and legs. 

Got transferred back to my local hospital where they are still trying to persuade me to take various meds and have even lied about one of them not being chemo when the pharmacist who wasn’t in on the ‘game’ told me three times it was.

I have therefore lost all trust in them. 

I have had a referral to Palliative Care by my GP and am waiting…

I have never had a fear of death and at 68 I don’t feel my future quality of life is anything to get excited about.  I am very much about quality over quantity

Is there anyone out there who 

has refused all treatment other than pain relief and found you have a battle on your hands with Oncology?

Has bone cancer from secondaries?

"So basically I (F20) met a guy(M23) on tinder. He lives across the world, I’m from Kazakhstan, he’s from the US. We got really close through texting over more than a half a year and we had one call. I would tell him about my problems, he’d tell me about his and all of that. 

Then one time I complained how I had a hard time making a living on my job. So he offered me money. First time I refused, but next time he insisted and I took it. It was $120. Then he gave me $200-400 every month (april-june). And when I got uncomfortable with it, I told him I don’t want it anymore.

We planned living together in September for a month. He’s going to come to Kazakhstan, which is kind of weird in the first place. And I was excited for it to happen but now I have this sick fear about him being some murderer because of how weird our relationship is.

Also he gets very offended if someone doesn’t reply to him or leaves him on read, and it’s understandable. But these occurrences make him doubt humanity. 

He also doesn’t have any friends irl, hasn’t had a girlfriend and is a virgin. He has trouble with relationships because he doesn’t really like a lot of people. So he decided to stay away and be a loner because he’s more comfortable with that.

And one more thing, he’s very into serial killers and darknet, reads stuff about them. He says it’s because he’s interested in psychology and history. But it kind of makes me anxious.

And lately I just don’t really want to talk to him because he makes a big deal of people stopping talking to him (online). He thinks everything is a waste of time if he stops talking to someone. And he can be really mean when he has these episodes, tho he always apologizes afterwards.

But generally he was sweet to me and supporting, willing to talk about my problems. He helped me in many ways over this time that we’re friends.

But now I started worrying because I realized that I’m going to live with a guy I never met irl and could know nothing about, like what if he lied to me? What if it’s he’s evil plan? I’m like… paranoid.

I’m scared to calling it all off because he already bought the tickets, booked a place and started packing. I don’t want to be that friend who cancels last minute.

I don't think I'll be able to properly make friends. Idk people just seem to build a lot of relationships easy but I can't. And if I do I can't break them because of my fear of what they might do. They might doxx me or kill me or kidnap me or something. I'm still looking over my shoulder because I stopped talking to a friend who lives in my town. I just don't know what to do. I can't trust people enough to get close and keeping a distance just feels safe. You never know people enough to know they aren't gonna hurt you, and that's a worry constantly.",5,paranoia

"Life is 90% of the time a haze of confusion, fear, and paranoia. Then when my mind is somewhat clear I look back at life and feel nothing but existential dread knowing this is just how things are and I can't really do anything about it. I can see myself getting worse, but what am I supposed to do? 

They say ""get help"", I have tried this. I did exactly what I was told, and I can say beyond any reasonable doubt that ""help"" made everything worse. 

Go to the doctors, get locked up and dehumanized and abused for a week or two, beg the doctor every time you seem him to let you out of there as this is a horrible place to be, eventually get let out and despite the meds they put you on be notably more depressed, reclusive, and psychotic to the point that you try to game end yourself and end right back up in there bc you can't do a single thing right. 5 times.

I’m never going to be normal, I’m never going to achieve some of the most basic things like a stable healthy routine or being able to just live life like it’s not an uphill battle. I mean I’m getting heart palpitations from poor health and want to do all these things to improve it and I make all these plans to do it but when it comes to it I just can’t no matter how hard I try and I’m stuck in a viscous cycle of telling myself I’m going to do better and then hating myself at the end of the day.

I’m never going to be fully okay, I’m never going to just be normal, or just do the things I need to do. I’m never going to be able to stick to a routine or keep myself healthy. I’m never going to achieve my goals or complete my projects that give me the drive to keep going. And even if I was okay, and I did all those things, I still wouldn’t be happy because nothings enough for me. I always want more, if you told me 5 years ago everything I’ve done all the challenges I’ve overcome and how far along I am I would be ecstatic. But now that I’m here, it’s just not enough and I’m still not happy and I don’t think I ever will be.

"I have seasonal allergies that are present for most of the year.
The worst symptom I get that harms my day to day life, is messed up sleep.
I essentially get so congested at night time, that I can’t sleep throughout the night. 
This leads to severe sleep deprivation that harms my mood, my mental clarity, work performance, gym performance, and overall health.

I’ve tried reactine, Claritin, NAC, Sudafed,you name it.
The ONLY thing that’s works is Benadryl.
When I take Benadryl I actually sleep throughout the night.
The only catch is that if I take Benadryl every night, after a few days, I have this hangover brain fog affect, that’s harmful. Benadryl is also bad for longterm brain health as it’s neurotoxic.

Now I noticed if I pair this stuff with NAC, the brain fog reduces drastically, but this stuff is still not good to take every night.

What is a supplement or over the counter allergy med, or even holistic herb that I can take every single night, that will destroy my night time congestion and allow me to sleep throughout the night?",0,negative_samples
"Hello friends. I’m not looking for a diagnosis since I’ve already been diagnosed. However, I’m not convinced I received the correct one and want opinions I suppose if you’ve dealt with anything similar.

Almost a year ago now, I started having cramping with my bowel movements and it was almost all diarrhea. It started out of no where. I thought it was a bug but it didn’t go away and I let it go about a month so I went to my dr. They did a stool test and told me I had white blood cells in my stool. Gave me antibiotics and the symptoms stopped while taking the antibiotic. Started back the day I stopped them. They sent me to a gastroenterologist and they did several blood tests checking for autoimmune issues including celiac and crohns. Everything was normal with that. Gave me a colonoscopy and endoscopy and biopsied me for several diseases. The dr told me I had gastritis and “self limiting colitis”. What I thought was odd was my symptoms stopped the day after my colonoscopy. Like the cleanse cleaned whatever it was out of me lol. I almost went back to normal. They did another stool test to make sure I didn’t have anymore white blood cells in my stool and they said it was all clear. But about a month later I started having the diarrhea again on and off. Not near as bad and crampy but still. And now it happens at the most random times and my dr doesn’t want to see me because I’ve been checked for everything, they say. Telling me I have ibs now. I have huge health anxiety and I’m so worried it’s ibd and it will get worse without treatment. I can’t find very much information about self limiting colitis on the internet. Could this have caused permanent damage to my colon?? Or should I change drs and dig deeper? I was told I wasn’t inflamed enough for it to be considered ulcerative colitis or crohns and that it was very mild. I’m just concerned and don’t really know how to handle this. I carry anti-diarrheal pills with me everywhere now because I never know when it will hit and I don’t think it’s good to take them regularly. I’m 27 and my dr told me this is about the age when autoimmune diseases hit the average female. The only auto immune issue that runs in my family is psoriasis. Could I just be unlucky and maybe I developed ibs from this? I don’t have great insurance and can’t afford another colonoscopy. I can’t seem to pinpoint any of this to a certain food I’m eating but I’m not keeping track very well. Sorry if this is all over the place.",0,negative_samples
"Since I know myself I have recursive thoughts, meaning that it starts and while my mind gives continuity to it I inevitably return to it, for what I accounted from other people it is normal to have tem in stressful or disconcerting situations, or even with simple thing such as a catchy song or a new word they learned, but I also have paranoid thoughts about vile and gruesome deaths and deformations, on almost every occasion, Avery pointy, hard, heavy, hot, electrical, mechanical, or flammable, immediately trigger this kind of thought, but even with simple things which as corners, steps, windows, and ladders can trigger those thoughts, and when they are too discomforting they become recursive and the more I think about them the more paranoid I get, but it's not a well defined well stablish paranoia, is just an impending feeling of doom and eerieness.
But since my last camping trip, in which I had a paranoid anxiety crisis, triggered by the noise of a bug that woke me up that was extremely similar to a motorcycle, making so that my limbs became dormant and I thought I was having a hipotermic episode, I have been have a weird kind of paranoia, instead of having a gorey thought that keeps me distressed, I have a shutdown of my rational and lyrical functions just feeling me with a paralysing anxiety.

"I, 22 female, and my boyfriend, who is also 22, went to brunch earlier today. Side note my boyfriend is Chinese.

We had ordered our drinks and food, and when it got to us, it all looked delicious. I shared some of my food with my boyfriend, who ate the food off of my fork. I’m unsure if it was because he ate off my fork, but I heard one of the women next to us say, “I’m done here.” Another issue is that as a waiter/ waitress, you must check on your customers every once in a while, no matter how busy it is. I know this because I am a waitress at a restaurant too. Our server didn’t check on us, but there was a friendly waitress who did check on us and gave us our bill.

"graduated during the global pandemic. went to work with one of the big 4 in accounting firms. realised that i get terribly stressed out with the deadlines and the pressures, couldn’t cope with the workload, got put on Performance Improvement Plan and cried everyday. nine months after, i said goodbye and quitted.

two weeks later, started my second job at a non-big 4. the environment is a stretch better. the managers are respectful and treat you like humans, i made friends with colleagues. however, my depression starts to get bad again (maybe it’s never gotten better in the first place). went to get a psychiatrist and she prescribed me lexapro. work isnt doing well. manager put me on PIP also (second time at second job, the consistency is amazing). manager is super kind, super supportive but she can feel that i’m lacking effort.

i feel bad about all this. i know i have to get better. i know the maps but i can’t walk anymore. my mental health is declining. i feel like i’m sabotaging my career and my future. manager is positive about me staying but i don’t feel good. what should i do? i am so tired. i’m not sleeping well. i’m losing weight. i’m tired of going out and putting a facade. i wish people can see through my mask. i wish people can help me do things, i can’t do it all. i can’t do anything.",2,depression
"First of all, sorry for my terrible english.  
About 4 years ago I was diagnosted with dysthymia by a neurologyst when I went for sleeping problems,  is a mild chronic depression but i never took the antidepressive meds that were prescripted because my family asked me not to, i think that was a mistake. I had some traumatics events in the past but I was able to function, even though the thoughts that all I did was for nothing never left, I was able to made peace with that and keep them for myself, put a mask on and go as I was optimistic to my enviroment outside my home.  


My condition was very well controlled while i was in college, but when covid pandemic strikes, It got worse,  I was in my moms house like for 2 years, so now i struggle a lot with trying to get out of bed, i do lots of things in my room for trying to shut my head and dont think in anything, games ,videos, i sing and play guitar, anything that make me not hear my head, my anxiety, and my sadness.  
I been living with this my whole life, and now Im at a point that im burning bridges with my closest friends, being mad for any reasons while they are very far away and dont have a lot of chances to get them back.  


I started to go to a psycologist but at the 2nd session he told me i also need a psychiatrist as well, and Im going back to my neurologist. I m going to try to do all they said but I cant shake the feeling that is all for nothing. I dont know what is going to change. Also I notice my family is getting really affected by this, they are trying to help, but they dont have enough tools, they end up getting mad and saying horrible things, even though i know they are trying to help the only way they can.   


I really dont know what to do because I feel like my life is getting destroyed by myself, and even though i can rationalize that is my sickness, the feeling that is just me who is doing this wont go away.   
Is there anyone here that beat this kind of behaivours? Is there any hope for this to get better? I just need some hope, and advices for the day to day.",2,depression

"For context ,I'm from Hungary but I love in Italy since I was 6 because my mom found a job here.
I passed trough a lot of shit during my life,my weak ass father killed himself,I changed schools like 6 times,I had to go to live in Germany for 3 years with my grandparents,to then come back to Italy,in a different place.
Fast forward to middle school,never been good at a single thing except English.My votes were always terrible because I didn't see the point in studying stuff I'll never need in life.During those 3 years I got a fell in love with a girl but got rejected, twice.That hurt ,a lot, but I didn't want to talk about It to anyone ,especially my mother cause we already had enough trouble to go trough(she and her bf broke up,they still are In contact and good friends tho,they just didn't understand each other well).
Middle school ends.My mother worked as a barista at the time and she barley could pay rent ,she wasn't sure if she could pay a highschool for me.To my ""luck"" she eventually hooked up with his asshole that's she could use as a credit card to an extent ,on thing pulls the other and we move in with him.That place sucked ass.Small city,nothing really to do,not even a normal park.Whatever,I basically just stayed in my room all day.

Now it takes a bad turn.
Slowly but surely ,he came out to be a narcissist fuck ,he fucking ruined our life's ,but we couldn't escape cause my mother fell pregnant.My sister was born eventually ,and the fuck just became more and more psycho.He hated me,he always game me bad looks,alywas had some shitty comment to say about me because I never go out(don't have friends there and wasn't gonna get any).

Fast forward a little

Things escalated,he wanted my sister and cut us out.My mother managed to find a lawyer that's Hungarian and he was understanding enough to do the job upfront with payment later on the road.


After some more suffering ,we are free.We went to live in a BNB for 3 ish months ,the fuck gives use 400€ monthly child support.Stayimg at the bnb sucked ,we lived all 3 in one room ,no privacy,no silence,and I was working at the time Aswell.

Thank god ,literally.And acquaintance of my mother knew the cities church caretaker who had an apartment for rent.We moved in ,the place was underwhelming honestly,pretty old,the  guy rented it to bypasses occasionally ,people who would spend a week or so here.It tool a lot of cleaning to make it shine.


Fast forward to the present.
Here I am 21 male,working to maintainy family.

Let's talk about me now;
I work a 7 to 5 ,forklift operator and wearhouse worker.I liked it at the start ,but with months passing I hate it more and more.I don't know why ,I just keep committing little stupid mistakes that make me look like a retarded to my superiors.No matter how hard I try ,there is no one day without either me saying something stupid to my coworker that makes me look like a retard or having trouble with something stupid.

This last week has been really ruff for me mentally.The supervisors always pretent too much,there is always good much work and organized the warehouse is a mess cause the stock amounts make no sense.

I stated to feel a pain inside of me,the fact that I have to live trough life,the mere fact that I exists is giving me a pain in my soul.I snapped twice this week.While in bed I just went blank for a minute and realized that I can't get out of this.I just screamed ,screamed untill it hurt ,then cried.



What do I do?How do I make the pain go away?Why di i have to endure this?
To make it clear,I don't want to kill myself,but I would like to not exist anymore so the pain would stop",2,depression
"I want to provide some context.
When I was 8 I was adopted by my Aunt and uncle (my uncle is my blood, my mother’s brother.) They already had one son which they shared together (let’s call him Teal Blue) and one from my uncle’s previous marriage (let’s call him Rose Red.) 
Rose Red usually split his time between his mother and his dad (my uncle) so Teal Blue and I were raised primarily by my Aunt and Uncle.. Now that you have back story about the family dynamic I want to get to the real point…
So my Aunt has always had body image issues.. she even shared with me that in her early adult years she suffered from anorexia. Ever since I moved in with them at the age of eight I’ve known her to be insecure about her weight and she runs at minimum 5 miles a day.
Even now in her mid 50s she runs sometimes 10 miles in one day. She’s thin and weighs about 120 pounds but still calls me and says “Omg I need to lose weight.” Now this bothers me at times because I’m much heavier than her but that’s not my issue because I’m not insecure about my weight at all.
My issue is that both me and her bio son (Teal Blue) have always been a bit on the heavy side. Again, Rose Red lived with his mom most of the time so he doesn’t struggle as much with weight because he didn’t really eat my Aunt’s cooking. AND SHE COOKED AND GOT FAST FOOD A LOT.
The fact that me and Teal Blue have been overweight and struggled with bad eating habits really bothers me since my Aunt is a health and fitness coach and she herself is thin. (I’ve expressed that to her.)
Once I moved out there was one time that I’d actually become pretty thin because I was eating healthy and running about two miles per day. I’d come home from a college break to visit my Aunt and uncle and my uncle was impressed and called me HOT (in a very normal not weird at all way).. he just wanted to express that he was proud of my weight loss. His wife, my Aunt, responded to him (in front of the kids) “you’ve never called me HOT.” That was almost 9 years ago and it haunts me until this day that she would show jealousy towards a child she raised. 
Now to the REAL point. Anytime I visit them which is very rare these days (mainly on holidays) she always makes me my own “separate batch” of something which I never ask for. I used to think she was just being kind but because of her obvious insecurities I’ve become curious about it. She’ll say to me “I made Mac and cheese but I made you your own separate batch to take home.” When I return home I’ll usually get a text asking if I ate it. Not if I liked it but if I ATE IT. As if she’s making sure I consumed it. This Christmas she offered me coffee and I accepted. She literally asked me five times if I finished it “hey did you finish the coffee?”
… “did you finish your coffee” over and over again she asked and she did not make it herself so it’s not like she’s wondering if I liked it. And not once did she ask if I liked it only if I finished it. Now I’m paranoid because as I said me and her son have always struggled with our weight as kids even though she professionalizes in health and fitness and now that I’m grown and can control my own intake it’s like she forces food down my throat whenever I visit. I know she has this thing where she likes to be the thinnest person in group pictures and I just don’t know how to feel. Maybe she never wanted us to have body image issues and over fed us out of love? How would you feel?",5,paranoia
"Was listening to binaural beats constantly, getting in at least one good session a day. One night I heard a “Bang” so loud it had me frozen. Laid there trying to grasp what happened, my thought was a gunshot with how loud it was. Sounded as loud as it would if you shot it right by your ear. I slept with the lights on that night. This was a couple years or a few ago. I always feel like someone or something is checking up or watching me ever sense this event. Any ideas? One night a car was fucking with me at like 2 or 3 am. Came down a the gravel road that’s private and a one way in one way out type of road. He seemed as if he was dropping off mail. But some how that fucker knew I was peeping at it through the shades. Know way should they been able to notice since they were driving back out. It happened back to back nights so this time I was like wth keeps driving up here at night. I hurried up and shut the tv and light I had on off, there was no back light. Yet that mf stoped fast as hell just sitting there in the middle of the road. I shit you not, then shut the lights off only for a second then turned them back on but left his tail lights off and slowly rolled away but I knew whoever it was wanted me to know they know I was watching them. Pretty sure my neighbor works a gov job in some way cause we had people come to ask us questions like are they good neighbors.. Ik this shit is long and kinda two story’s but they happened close together. Brain explodes one night and weird mf fucking with me the next.

"I’m feeling overwhelmed and fixated on this recent source of anxiety - something a “normal” person would probably not think twice about. 

I’m a pretty low-maintenance friend when it comes to communicating, I’ll provide tons of support and words of affirmation etc but I’m not one that needs to be in contact daily. Me and my best friend have this wonderful setup where we both know we adore each other, yet we can go up to 5 days without responding to each others messages, then when we do, we always do it lovingly (with voice notes and pics of our kids and news and thoughts from the past week). We always understand that not answering immediately is not personal, nor does it impact our relationship negatively. It did take years to build this sort of peace / not feel guilt over not immediately responding. 

Now, I have another lovely friend, whom I have recently gotten closer to (we grew apart after high school but in the last few years we’ve started talking again, I think because we both became moms, and have had some nice points of connection again. She is absolutely lovely and I even got the honor of being the godparent to her third kid.). She’s someone who messages almost daily, and whenever I message her (usually in response to something), she will message right back. I’m having trouble with this since I don’t feel like I have space/energy for daily messaging so I sometimes wait a day, or half a day to answer, and then boom she answers again. 

How do I navigate this? My problem is mainly the guilt I feel when I don’t respond immediately and the slight annoyance I feel for “having to” be in contact daily. My ideal situation would be that we write to each other a couple of times a week with no stress or pressure about response times. I’m a recovering people pleaser and it pains me to not immediately respond, but I want nothing more than a little less contact. Does anyone have any advice? 


For background, back in high school (15 years ago) this same friend had the habit of wanting to talk on the phone in the evenings after school. This was a huge source of anxiety for me, and I hadn’t been in therapy at that point, so I sort of did this combo of trying to please her while also feeling enraged and stressed whenever my phone rang. I have gotten better at setting boundaries now but I think that same “trauma” is now resurfacing and I’m worried I’m going to be in the same situation as before. 

TLDR: old friend and I have been reconnecting but she wants a lot more contact than me, how do I maintain my boundaries without hurting her?",4,anxiety

Since this process is multiple steps, I have wrestled with executive dysfunction to do this each time I get a refill. Often losing. 

I’ve spent nearly a year with this process as a nagging thorn in my side. Weeks of stalling and sighing as I pick up the bottle to read the label knowing I should have done it sooner.

This weekend, stupidly, I did mushrooms. I believed all that talk about expanding drugs, how they can only help you, etc. it was even worse. I felt full on fragmentation, I could only talk in the third person referring to myself. I can’t even say it was myself talking, I truly was other people.

It also confused me even more about time. I’m screaming still whenever I have to think of any temporal concept, time is sideways now. It makes no sense. I can’t function. I feel like I’m not here, time isn’t here, it doesn’t go forward. It’s all jumbled. 
I regret doing this. My brain is broken now forever. Do you feel this time perception with schizophrenia?

"Some neurotypical people say that people with autism don't show empathy, and sometimes seem like disturbing psychopaths. As a person with autism, I think the argument can be understood that neurotypical people don't show empathy and seem like disturbing psychopaths. To be clear, I do not believe this in the slightest and am using a metaphor to better explain how autism does have empathy. Instead, my point is that both arguments are incredibly similar.

I can't speak for other people with autism, but personally, I experience empathy through having an intellectual understanding that someone is feeling an emotion. I think it's rather obvious, but if I don't know someone is feeling an emotion, I can't really feel empathy. It just doesn't make sense, and wouldn't be genuine anyway.  


I've heard some neurotypical people (who I am not suggesting in any way are representative of all neurotypical people, but are a large enough group to bother me) say that people with autism don't have empathy, and are cold in the face of people suffering. Specifically, I've seen the argument made multiple times that people with autism could watch someone suffer and just... not care.

&#x200B;

However, I can easily imagine some people with autism making nearly that exact argument against neurotypical people (which again, is not an argument I support, it just illustrates why the first is bad). The argument goes something like this: neurotypical people only show caring for those whose suffering they can see, and not for anyone else. Specifically, the argument would say that neurotypical people care more about the aesthetics of suffering than anyone's actual pain. There is evidence that could be presented for such a thing too. Check the amount of media coverage, legislative action, and concern whenever a massive, violent event happens and people are hurt or killed. However, anything that doesn't have that violent flair to it is often left forgotten even when it affects many more people. So neurotypical people (so says this hypothetical argument which is WRONG) would condemn people to pain and suffering because of aesthetics outside of these people's control.

&#x200B;

I obviously don't agree with that argument, neurotypical people DO have empathy (obviously), but I thought it would be interesting to share because it illustrates exactly why it's sister argument is wrong too. Autistic people (like me) DO have empathy, we just show and understand it different. It's precisely BEAUSE we care and want people to be happy, that some neurotypical people think we don't.

&#x200B;

In one of my classes at school, we had a discussion about 9/11 which prompted me to feel rather horrified at how important the event is considered, and the rest of the class seemed put off that I suggested it is given too much weight.

"There was a post the other day about a guy who found his BG lower after consuming whiskey. I can’t find it anymore but was super interested to read your responses. Especially the ones about how the liver can only process one thing at a time so therefore when drinking spirits your blood sugar will get lower but obviously you risk other health concerns. 

My question I wanted to ask and didn’t at the time is this. What happens to the sugar I have consumed while I drink a scotch. So let’s say I eat a high glucose item and I have a scotch. My new understanding is that my blood sugar will actually lower because my liver is currently processing the alcohol. But what happens to the sugar? Does it pass through my system and go to waste? Or does it just wait there for my liver to be ready and then go through there?? 

I hope my question makes sense.",0,negative_samples
"Had a appointment today, was told the doctors and nurses at the practice just did a exercise to “live like a diabetic person” They were instructed to record their blood sugar 3 times a day, take their “treatments” (box of raisins) 3 times a day before meals, measure every carbohydrate that they ate and keep prefect record for 2 weeks. 

It was just the tip of the iceberg of what managing diabetes can be like but they all failed into week 2!

Just wanted share, I found it interesting, and thought maybe it was nice they are at least trying to empathise with their patients a little?

"I narrowed down my choices for my upcoming Paris trip to three studios, which are just a little over $105 per night for my dates.

**Context**: I'll be arriving at 9:15 PM at CDG, so I may arrive in the city proper at maybe 1.5 hours after because I'll be renting a sim first and figuring out the train system so I won't get lost.

* I'm also contemplating just suffering a red eye and arrive at 8 AM Paris time, but it would be 14 hours of trying-to-sleep hell

First up is this studio in [Bastille](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10466472?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=f98cefed-c41d-4529-abad-1ae860f4f067).

It's the best one location-wise, but the catch is the check-in is a bit difficult. You have to get the key from a cafe that's approx. 800 meters from the apartment. Not usually bad since I'm a fit guy, but I'll be arriving at night + with a laptop + wheeled luggage and there's a chance it might rain (how rainy is October in W.Europe?). I also talked to the owner re: hard mattress reviews, and she said she fixed it.

The next two are near each other in Batignolles and are maybe 10%-15% cheaper, but seem to offer just as good if not better amenities because they're not as central as the first one.

This [one](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/829477575925096624?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=a9965779-b08a-4d64-a71a-9d577cde2953) has a washer and looks to have bigger space and a better bed. It also allows late check-in because it uses a lockbox than actually meeting you. This [one](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/845737265258588920?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=f8a50bbf-4d75-4cd6-bd7d-3b271a8c09e4) seems to be the most thoughtful in terms of amenities. Check-in is also a little later (just past 11 PM), but the way she worded is she'd meet me in person.

So I am normally suspicious of the motives of other people but not to the point where it is interfering with my life however, I do feel like the potential is there. I recently went out to eat at a restraunt when the food and drinks are served to me a small thought creeps into my head that says ""I wonder if this could be poisoned?"", and the more I think about it the more paranoid that I get to the point where I won't eat the food and want to leave the restraunt. 
I had another incident in which I went to the doctor for a prescription for a sinus infection and as I went to take the medicine I began thinking ""what if they're not trying to help you, they're trying to hurt you"", I do manage to break out of the suspicion and take the medicine but there have been times where I almost avoid taking the medicine.
At night or when I'm alone I always feel as if there is someone watching me and due to this I keep protection near me at night and when im alone.

I work from home, and in the course of a couple weeks had some pretty scary panic attacks, one that made me leave work early to go to my parents house. I also had chest tightness, trouble breathing, and general seasonal allergy symptoms. Our property manager is very accommodating thankfully, and immediately started getting mold inspectors, HVAC guys, the whole deal to see what the issue is. HVAC guy tells me it's the carpet as soon as he walks in. Tells me it smells very strongly of ammonia, which my girlfriend and I never smelled assumedly because we live here. Carpet gets replaced, severe allergies have gone away. However, I still am getting bouts of minor chest tightness, and throat irritation/tightness along with my seasonal symptoms. I know I need to go to an allergist, but it's driving me insane. I take Zyrtec and Flonase everyday, and vacuum regularly. Is there any advice for what I could be missing?

"Hello everyone,

I want to say that I appreciate you taking the time in advance to read this and for giving any feedback.

From birth, I have had severe food allergies, some of which I have developed later in life. I am currently allergic to several of the most common allergies recognized in North America. Navigating these food allergies has presented its unique set of challenges throughout the years, but none of which I have not been able to navigate and overcome. Although, there is one challenge in particular which I have not been able to deal with and it has been progressively consuming more of my daily life.

Over the last several years I have experienced what I would best describe as anxiety attacks, although I have never discussed this with a medical practitioner. The anxiety is perpetuated by an underlying fear of having an allergic reaction but it often lacks any basis for being concerned. Whether eating something new for the first time, sitting on a bench outside, or driving home from work; there is no one trigger which causes the anxiety attack to occur.

To describe the way that I feel during these situations, I will experience a variety of allergy-related symptoms that can be associated with my anaphylaxis. Some of these symptoms which occur either simultaneously or on their own include: irritation or swelling in the throat, swelling in the face, difficulty breathing through the mouth or nose, difficulty swallowing, and swelling in the tongue or irritation in the mouth area. There have been other less common symptoms but are not as associated with anaphylaxis.

Although I experience what I believe to be anaphylactic symptoms, none of these have ever actually happened. Everything which I have felt has been perpetuated through the anxiety of having a reaction and therefore I am made to believe that it is happening at the moment. I have never had an allergic reaction and therefore only understand what the symptoms look and should feel like.

These anxiety attacks have been affecting my ability to focus and live life without an underlying fear embedded in all of my actions. I know that when these scenarios occur that I have nothing to worry about, and am able to recognize that in the moment. Yet, I am unable to control the situation and the only thing that resolves it is a prolonged period of time to pass to indicate there is in fact no issue.

When this occurs it creates an immense amount of fear and stress that I can no longer handle. It has been approximately ten years of getting worse and upon recognizing that this is an issue that I need to address I would like to seek help. I plan to discuss these concerns with a medical practitioner, but until such time, I would like to hear if others have shared a similar experience and how they have navigated this challenge. Any suggestions or comments are appreciated.

Thank you in advance.",4,anxiety

"It all started a year ago with my health. My eczema was the most extreme that it had been and it started spilling into other parts of my health. I ended up getting a lot of eye infections, allergies, immune system related infections. I went to a million doctors but to no avail. 

In december / january, i physically couldnt bring myself to go to work. I basically took 2 months off without telling my family or boyfriend. I was so unmotivated because you need a job to sustain yourself in the future, and i no longer saw a future i needed to sustain. 

Ive slowly noticed the joy disappear from my life and ability to enjoy things diminish. I used to be able to pretend like everything was fine and put on the cheerful front like nothing was wrong. Now when im out and around people, i feel hollow, speaking hollow words. 

I accidentally got pregnant earlier this year, and had the abortion several weeks ago. My boyfriend had been supportive throughout, but recently we got into a huge fight, because he thinks the relationship is extremely one sided. I dont blame him, i know it has been. I realise finally that it is due to my depression that i havent had the capacity to give what he needs, but i dont want to lose him. He told me he needs space and time, but i want him to understand where all of this is coming from from my point of view. 

Ive thought about ending things more times than i can count. Ive even looked up how many sleeping pills it takes. Ive thought about the letters i would write, what my funeral would look like. I cant see a world in which i live past 30 anymore. Everything feels so black. 

I dont expect anyone to respond, i just wanted to get this off my chest.",2,depression
"Lately I've been feeling uneasy, anxious, scared, and full of dread and angst. I'm worried I'm on the verge of a psychotic episode. It feels like I'm on a roller coaster on the slow incline. Being pulled up by the chains. I can see the top and the steep downfall in front of me. The butterflies are going crazy in my stomach. I've been on this roller coaster before so I know how it ends. Its ends with me in the hospital. So should I just jump the gun and self admit myself. I've been in the mental hospital twice. Each time I've experienced really trippy things but it has been like a reset button on my life. 

Up to this point I have been stable for two years. Taking my meds and seeing a psychiatrist and psychotherapist. But I'm coming up on the anniversary of my first episode which was very intense out of body experience. I always have this cycle of stress and anxiety around my anniversary but this year it is pretty strong. I don't really want to go back to the hospital because it felt like a prison and everyone is in a different mental state. Its like a mind circus.

"Hi fellow members of the suffer subreddit,

My grandmother just passed away today and I came here for a little rant. Basically as the title says.

I just spend about one and a half hours crying on the phone, and then some more afterwards. And as if the feeling of mourning someone's sudden death isn't bad enough, crying gives me the WORST migraine. Like the kind that makes you wanna squirm and cry even more because the pain is so unbelievably unbearable.

Like... Can we catch a break? I get migraines from the sun, some types of food, excersizing, lack of sleep... All of which are horrible but understandable.

But I get the absolute worst migraines from crying?? Like I'm clearly already suffering since I'm crying, why do us migrainers need to get punished even more from being sad?? Cmon man. On the bright side, I can't really think right now cause my brain is busy trying to crawl out of my skull or something. 

In case anyone reads this and gets worried, I will be fine. I just get really emotional around this kind of stuff and it takes time to process.",0,negative_samples
"I’ve taken all the pills, been to all the therapists and psychiatrists. I’ve done all the talking, I’ve sought out all the help and I still thinking about killing myself at least 3 times a day.

Sometimes I sit there and just fantasize about killing myself and the only thing that stops me from trying to fulfill one of those fantasies is fear. 

I sit and try and rationalize suicide to myself for hours everyday to try and eliminate that fear but it doesn’t work. My stupid survival instinct is too strong. 

But things will get worse. Eventually things will be so bad that the survival instinct will diminish and I won’t care anymore. Eventually things will be bad enough where I abruptly end it all.

I can’t wait for that day to come.

My life is an endless cycle of sleeping and scrolling through my phone. I rarely leave the house, I have no job (can’t find a decent one), I have very few friends, nothing brings me joy. 

I feel stuck in a suicidal prison where I want nothing more than to die but my brain and body won’t let me. I’m stuck in this limbo for days and weeks on end. Laying in bed motionless just imagining the various ways I could kill myself. 

Nothing helps, inpatient is a scam, therapists don’t care, psychiatrists just want to put me on so many drugs I don’t feel anything anymore.

"
So a few nights ago I had a bit of a headache but thought nothing of it, I get headaches pretty often. All of a sudden thought I had this crushing sensation in my head like it was being squeezed, and then when I went to move my head it felt difficult and I had intense pain shoot behind my eyes unlike any headache pain I’ve had before. It freaked me out and I ended up phoning NHS24 (UK’s 24 hour health hotline) to describe it to them and ask if they thought I should go to the hospital. They told me if the pain subsided after those few seconds and pain relief helped I should be fine, which put my mind at ease a bit. 

The next day I didn’t even think about it whatsoever really, but yesterday I was back to work and halfway through my shift I started getting pain in my chest, struggling to catch my breath, tingling in my limbs and around my lips, feeling faint, nauseous and extremely agitated. My mind instantly jumped to that headache a couple of nights before and I started convincing myself I was gonna die and that I’d had a bad brain bleed and that the symptoms had been delayed. I felt so on edge and looking back irrationally anxious. It was mild as far as I’ve seen panic attacks go, and I might be an anxious person, but I’ve never had a real panic attack hit like that.

I told my parents and they sounded concerned but told me there was nothing physically wrong with me. I phoned the doctor’s today and when I described just the symptoms, without mentioning that I thought it was a panic attack, the receptionist’s immediate response was ‘you need to go to the hospital’. I explained that I thought yesterday was a panic attack rather than physical (although I have no way of knowing this for sure and don’t trust my panicked opinion at the time and so would have loved a doctor’s opinion), and she is instantly changed her tune and told me I’d have to wait a couple of days for an appointment, because if it is anxiety it isn’t urgent enough.

I feel like I’m going insane. Last night I almost had another panic attack cause I’m so hyper aware of my body now and it feels so weird. I know I might be irrational but I’m not worried for nothing here am I? Sure, panic attacks make you have crazy thought loops, but the crazy headache and crushing, followed by chest pain, limb numbness, trouble breathing, etc. a couple of days later with no previous experience of panic attacks is objectively concerning. Like yes, I might not be thinking straight and it’s hard for me to have an unbiased opinion, and it’s probably about a 99% chance that I just had a panic attack, but i don’t like how my symptoms are clearly concerning and seem to just be putting down to a panic attack with little follow up just because I mentioned the anxiety possibility. I already felt like I was going crazy from my panic attack and it doesn’t help that everyone’s acting like I’m unhinged for wanting to take precautions with my health when weird out of character shit starts happening to me.",4,anxiety
"I don’t want to exist anymore. I want to keep living; I mean that I wish I stopped existing to the world. I wish I could pull down a big wall around me and erase myself out of everyone’s thoughts or memories. All I do is keep disappointing and flaking on people who love me. I can’t say anything to explain what’s going on in my life or how I feel, and everyone keeps asking for and expecting things. Every time I try to say no, or let people know things are bad, or ask to stop; I’m ignored. So I try to be selfish when I just ignore those things but you really can’t, and then things are even worse.

I’ve been so busy keeping other people afloat, everyone expects me to just keep on trucking because I always do. I don’t have mental breakdowns or public fallout, so my problems don’t appear that bad to people. my whole family has mental conditions & trauma; but we’re all so great at acting like a social class above ourselves and masking that stuff. the outer world has all these expectations because of the roles we’ve played so long, and it’s like I can’t step off the stage.

"hey guys, i’m new to posting here but i need some reassurance that i’m not thinking clearly and there really is hope for me still. I was majorly depressed from 14-18, (almost 20 now) then things slowly started getting better, i got into a new amazing relationship with someone i loved with my entire heart and soul and and cherished and i was stable for the most part, probably the most stable i’ve ever been. but due to my codependency and attachment issues i had some insecurities but i genuinely loved him more than myself and put those aside as much i possibly could, BUT we recently broke up and my life has gone absolutely downhill from there. there has been so many stresses, i had an attempted si after that, failed that one unfortunately, mental hospital stay, being treated differently by my family, iop, therapy, so many meds and med changes trying to figure out what works best for me, med withdrawals and just so much more. I’m stressed, and i’m tired. I drink and i try to just relax for a moment but instead all the emotions i hold onto come flooding out 10x more intense and while me and my ex partner were trying to work things out and things were both very difficult he just couldn’t handle it anymore; i know he’s doing what he feels is best for him but i can’t help but feel so abandoned, i feel like all my insecurities and fear of abandonment were just validated and it makes me feel hopeless. if the one person who i felt i could understand and who understood and loved me me the most couldn’t deal with my mental health and breakdowns during a rough time, who can? i have nobody else.

"Hey all,

I’ve come to the realization (through relating to every meme I see on Instagram (prob not the best way))that I almost certainly have adhd-I.

I have always been forgetful, at nearly 30 I lose my phone everyday, I forget to eat and am horrible at replying back to texts (but also can’t stand a phone call), the low energy, despite being in good shape, indecisiveness and the general boredom of life finally may have a reason.

I know all this and still procrastinated on calling my doctor until what happened to me recently.

I have been working from home for the last 2 years and recently have been forced to go into the office. I haven’t. I have been using vacation days on my office days. 

When I work from home I usually “watch” (actually just listening as background) YouTube videos. I’m frequently watching bits of a video at a time and switching to another as I get bored. My work gets done very well even while being distracted for periods of doom scrolling for something interesting.

One day I had the idea of simulating an office day by just having access to podcasts and music playlists. No YouTube no insta. 

This was a huge mistake! I managed to work for about three hours before hitting a wall of boredom. I had downloaded 2 podcasts and had some playlists. I think I made it through half one podcast and half of the other. At some point I put my phone down and lost it. I thought it was ok because I had music playing on shuffle but I was wrong. The boredom grew and I started feeling irritable. I kept getting up out of my seat and pacing around. Irate. I felt a huge wave of angry anxiety at the thought and feeling of dread from this boredom. 

I felt as if I was going insane! Like tearing up a tiny bit for some reason.

Im normally a very easy going , shy bc of inattention and pretty chill so this kind of scared me.

I couldn’t/ didn’t want to leave my apartment bc I was expecting a package. When I could finally go out, I took my dog out. I went for a 20 minute walk and still felt very irritable. At that point I had around 2 hours left of work and just stopped working. 

I don’t know how I would survive in an office setting where there is sooo much more that I cannot control. I hated every moment of that anxious irritability and would hate to have people see me.

Definitely need help. Called doctor the same day.

Part of me is always saying it’s not adhd it me being lazy (family’s go to when I would forget chores and appointments)",3,adhd
"So, folks, apparently I'm not just quirked up and eccentric and a little bit bad at knowing when to make a joke. 

I am an 18 year-old man (of the younger variety) who recently took time off from college because of mental health concerns. In the time I've been off from school, I've been doing a great deal of therapy, as well as psychiatric evaluation/screening.

The verdict? I somehow have made it this far in life without any doctors managing to diagnose me with GAD, ADHD, or ASD. It's kind of a lot to have thrown at me. (Not to say that this is, like, a *wildly* late diagnosis. I know I'm not the only person to experience this sort of thing.)

My entire life I've excelled academically (despite being incredibly slow at reading, writing... all that stuff), enough so that I got into a fairly prestigious university. The theory among my current clinicians is that my above-average academic performance offset any concerns of psychiatric disorder.

But here I am, as an adult, learning that I'm not just quirky with it, I in fact have a brain that does not socialize, learn, etc, as do the brains of most people.

Recently I've been feeling more alone than ever, as a result of the realization that the diagnosis makes sense. I'm not simply silly/eccentric when it comes to dynamic social situations, I literally just don't know how to navigate them. I don't have much experience of forming meaningful, long-lasting emotional connections. It's hard to feel like my entire understanding of reality and self has been turned upside-down. 

I don't anticipate this gaining much traction, but for anyone who has read this far, thank you. And for anyone who has read this far *and* can perhaps relate or impart some advice... well, I'd love to hear from you.

Cheers.",1,autism
"I read everyday, but since my late teens/early 20s (I'm in my early 30s now) I've almost always, to some extent, 'powered through' the second half of books in order to get to either a) the next one I know I want to read or b) the opportunity to choose from the vast selection of new books that will interest and the backlog of books I mean to read at some point. 

I've theories as to why this is:

\- the awareness, as we get older, that time is limited. 

\- a greater awareness of the endless books and topics out there I'd like to read.

\- less time to read as an adult with adult responsibilites, thus less patience with texts. 

\- Goodreads's 'Reading Goal', something I've used for about a decade out of habit, but not something I feel too consciously beholden too now (in my mid-20s I do remember keeping an eye on it and planning reading accordingly in November and December). 

This is an excellent example of a luxury problem, but, if possible, I'd like to regain the more relaxed attitude I had to reading as a younger person.",0,negative_samples

Edit: I gave my speech! When I went up there I couldn’t stop shaking (like my legs and arms) but I used the podium to help me stay still.

"I worked in travel a few years ago and I was on an Emirates flight back from Perth to Dubai after returning with a work trip with the Western Australia tourism board and Emirates/Qantas but it was a pretty strange experience. When we boarded there was around 40-50 people on board including the 10 in our group and the crew and it was probably the least amount of people I’ve ever seen on a long haul flight! 

We take off and about 5 minutes from taking off the male flight attendant is looking out of the window from his seat and pointing to the female flight attendant near him. He seemed quite worked up and then the whole crew remained in their take off seats for around 30-45 minutes whilst talking on those phones that they have. 

About 30-45 minutes after take off, we’re told over the loud speaker that we’re expecting turbulence throughout the flight and to keep our seat belts on at all times (the sign literally didn’t turn off). The flight attendants then started to move everyone to the middle/left side of the plane and closed the window blinds on the right side. I asked if anything was wrong and why the male flight attendant seemed worried at the start but was just told that it was turbulence causing the seat belt sign issue and that he was just ‘admiring’ the view from take off (that sentence has always stuck with me). 

After about 11 hours of flying, we reach Dubai and we land at a completely separate part of the airport to the main terminal part. We had to wait for them to get stairs (I kid you not, the type you’d use to get on a Ryan air or EasyJet low cost flight), and arrange for a shuttle bus to pick us up and take us to the terminal. It was a pretty strange experience - We got inside the terminal and were scurried through by an airport rep but enroute they upgraded our entire party to business class for the Dubai to London leg with Qantas (presumably as the previous flight wasn’t a great experience) and no further mention of it was ever made.

I have just been talking to someone about this strange experience today and just wondered if this is protocol if something happens with an engine or an issue with the plane? I wish I’d pushed for more info at the time but it was a bit of a whirlwind experience.",0,negative_samples

"Lately, it seems that the main trigger for my depression is bad sleep, not even sure if it's bad sleep or not.

Lucky me the Physical Therapist I saw has had Ehlers danlos syndrome patients before AND specializes in cancer rehab. She told me things to look out for with respect to me surviving cancer between the chemo and radiation. That no other MD told me before. What the hell y'all 👀 like apparently the specific chemo I got (abvg) is neurotoxic (explains the neuropathy), and can cause potential heart problems 5-10 years down the line after stopping it. Be on the lookout for atrial fibrillation because of it (which means avoid stimulants whenever possible short version, because being diagnosed with AFib can potentially increase the risk of stroke or heart attack).

She also let me know that for ehlers danlos syndrome, it's extremely common for us to have lower blood pressure and slightly higher heart rates (the HR is how we compensate for the slightly lower BP). It's also normal for our hearts to ""flutter"" with the beats per minute about 10-15 (so say between 100-110).

He’s now in the ICU and has a breathing tube in and a hour ago his blood pressure dropped really low and his heart rate skyrocketed. The doctors said he is a very sick man and could not say whether he’ll make it or succumb to it. 
Can someone tell me his chances of him getting though this? 

Sorry if this doesn’t belong here.

Edit: his blood sugar level was 2500

Thanks so much for the support guys my mom said he is a little bit better since he came in. His bp had gotten normal and his heart rate went down.

Apparently he went in for a scan and they think he had a massive stroke so the DKA is basically over with now but it’s “a whole different ballgame now.”",0,negative_samples

Taking the route I always take I got a little spooked by a cat, laughing it off I continued cause the rain seemed to be getting heavier and I was still about 20 minutes from home. The cat had my heart racing just a little bit and the rain mixed with occasional bursts of thunder drowned out the sound of cars and talking people I passed.

"Apparently my grandma had migraines before I was born, but I otherwise didn’t know anyone with chronic migraine before having it myself. Those with episodic pretty much said it was a really bad headache a few times a YEAR. So when I started to have migraines everyday (for years), I had no idea what was happening. 

I was throwing up constantly, so tired, barely able to get out of bed, in sooo much pain, couldn’t stand any sensory input. At first I went to the ER when it didn’t go away for a few days, and they said it was a migraine. But I was like what?? It’s been days and I’ve never had one before and this is a zillion times worse and just so drastically different than a headache? And then the symptoms didn’t stop for years, and I had all sorts of other health problems when the migraines started. I didn’t understand at all I was experiencing chronic migraine and it took doctors way too long to tell me that, by the time I could get referrals and a doctor who listened and rule out other things. I thought I must be having some weird type of seizure or have something like MS or idk, some other rare disorder. Until I had a doctor say these are typical migraines, these are common symptoms, you have chronic migraine, etc, I was CONFUSED. 

Did anyone else not grow up watching people with chronic migraine and had no idea what was happening when it started for you?? Or did you somehow know right away, ‘oh guess you have migraines now’? Did you know from knowing other people with chronic migraine or you were just educated on all migraine can be and that it can be truly chronic before it started for you?

I learned about nihilism from a book i was reading in grade one that i stumbled onto at the library.it made sense, my life sucked then,still sucks, and will continue to stuck in the future. I dont have some grand traumatic event that made me have these thoughts or at least i do think ?. i just kinda put my thoughts in order after reading a book. i was never abused or at least i don't think ? i was neglected by a legal definition sure but i only had one extremely poor parent so its expected - emotionally and physically. before my diagnosis a few years ago i never understood why i was so much slower than most kids as i started to reach the integral ages of 7-11 and began to noticeably slow down brain and intelligence development. i was below average in school and only did good on tests,after age 10 everything became so much harder. i never had friends before or any of that so i was already extremely behind in that regard, along with worsening grades, i just couldn't keep up with normal people and that continues to today. im doing terribly in school due to chronic pain from brain injury and now found genetic condition (CJS) which basically just degrades you quickly as you age, which i guess makes sense in my hilariously pathetic existence. Ive tried jobs and failed, i can barely function as a human my age and i dont see much of a real future. i also don't have a easily obtainable bucket list which includes travel and things like romance but i could take it or leave it tbh. ive kinda resided myself to that those luxury are for normal or rich people. i don't really see a point in my future ? im two grades behind in high-school due to my health issues and now im almost entirely reliant on passing a highschiool early out exam or dropout.my existence has just been a comedic play to someone i bet, reel out that carrot on a stick and give me one positive event only for 99 negative things to happen. i dont really see an end to my mindset either. obviously some parts are confirmation bias to an extent but when your told your entire life is confirmation bias it feels a little stupid. i dont have a long reason or point to life to stay around past 18 ? if anyone's got any ideas id like to hear them. there most likely not obtainable but im a severe maladaptive day dreamer so i could always imagine it. thanks for reading",1,autism

"Hello! I have just recently been diagnosed with ADHD (combined type) after trying for forever, and am on no stimulants but am on zoloft for depression. my apologies for the rambling!!

my psychiatrist just prescribed me abilify to take with my zoloft as my depression isn’t improving as it should be. i just tried wellbutrin but it made me tremor and twitch and super anxious and just terrible 

i know that my depression symptoms are worsening because i don’t have proper medication or care for my adhd and i’m so frustrated over myself because of it. i feel like i can’t do anything, and my mom doesn’t entirely understand so she doesn’t really help. my psychiatrist wants my depression to get better before trying any sort of adhd care but the “always tired, racing thoughts, bored/ can’t hold an interest” and “staying up at night or sleeping in too much” is because i don’t have proper treatment for adhd.

anytime i suggest i might need to try a stimulant she always shuts me down and tells me we have to take care of the depression first, but i just *know* it’ll be better if i have something for my adhd.

One of the tasks is just speaking, you have a person asking you questions about yourself and you have to answer it in 3/4 sentences. 

The thing is, a lot of these questions are really personal or touching on politics and I don’t want to answer honestly,
especially if it inevitably touches on subjects like mental health affecting my day to day functioning, or politics in my country that are quite hostile to me considering I’m lgbt.

"Before my first psychiatrist left the facility where he worked, he concluded that I have ADHD, the inattentive type, based on the problems and struggles that I am personally going through. He first diagnosed me with depression and anxiety, but I told him that most of my struggle still exists on regular days when I have no stressors. I don't know where he went, so I was forced to look for a new psychiatrist since the medication he prescribed didn't seem to work (it worked for a bit, then it didn't).

When I first met my new psychiatrist, I couldn't tell her my story. Whenever I told her my concerns and why we concluded I have ADHD, she said I do not have ADHD since I was not ""properly"" diagnosed because I wasn't given the ADHD diagnosis test. She insisted that all of these problems may have caused my depression. When I told her I was taking Atomoxetine, which worked for a week or two until the effects wore off, she told me my medication is also an anti-depressant.

I won't see her again for the next three weeks since I have stuff going on, but I can't keep living my life anymore, not knowing what's wrong with me because it's already affecting my personal life and relationships.

I'm trying my best to get out of school early because it's so taxing, but all I get when I talk about that is ""what do you want to do when you're done"" and the truth is I don't know what I want to do for the rest of my life, however long it is I can handle all this. I work a ton to get out of the house and away from a toxic manipulative household and I stay out as much as I can but I'm not to be trusted because of some past drug problems and reckless behavior, mostly as a result of trying to feel something at all. I don't want to talk about it to anybody because I can't handle any more people being disappointed in me and seeing me as a failure. I have no interest in anything anymore except getting out of the house, but when I do that it's made to seem as if I hate my family (I do) and I'm ungrateful. Everything bothers me, even people I used to be close to or still am, i'm just really angry at something and I can't figure out exactly what it is because I think it's multiple things or a whole part of my life. Im constantly thinking of what's next, and people tell me I shouldn't be depressed because I have a ""loving family"" and I'm (relatively) financially stable. I go to therapy but I never talk about how I really feel. I keep telling myself I will next time but I just keep being scared to open up for fear of being sent to the psych ward or having to trust one more person. I broke up with my partner because I didn't want to drag them down with me into the hell that is my life. I don't know who I am, I don't know where I'm going, and I don't even know where to start. I don't know who I'd be if I was happy. It's been like this for so long it's just become part of me and if it were missing I don't know what I would do. I push everything down and it all streams out at once in one breakdown, but I have to control it because I can't show it or I'll just be more of a failure and a disappointment to my family and I cant handle having to repeat a year. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I look at everyone else and they have something going for them, somebody loves them and they have a value but I can't say the same for myself. I would kms but I would hurt too many people and I would just become a statistic. And I can't tell anyone that because I'll be in a psych ward so fast I won't even be able to blink. It's fucked up I can't get help with something like this without filtering so I don't get hospitalized. Some things make me laugh in the moment but then i'm back to it. Nothing actually makes me happy except working because I feel like I'm helping someone out and I'm part of something, but I can't just work a minimum wage (basically) job forever and never move forward. I feel like I'm fake for laughing at things and sometimes I wonder if I even find whatever it is funny because I don't know what happiness is anymore.",2,depression

"I was cheated oo and abused in the last relationships by two exes. One was bipolar or borderline and the other was a narcissist.

After the narcissist came my actual girlfriend and so i had no time to deal with my emotions and immediately i was quite distant with her because of my anxiety. But she understood and tried anyway because when i was strange she asked me to explain why and I could do that. 

Now after months we are together and we start living together as well. Now she is far from since 2 weeks for reasons different than us and so we text and we call each other. This though meant that we were very stressed and we fought a lot. Either we were sexting, or talking about stuff or having discussions.

Discussion were started by both of us. The last though was a bit strange on her part and she was a bit aggressive. She didn't insult or anything, just aggressive.

That being aggressive reminded me of my abusive ex and made me go in a fear state.

She recognized almost immediately like an hour after the fight that her ways of communicating was shit (after i said its not okay to be that aggressive when i was trying to give my reasons calmly and she could not understand)

But after that i entered a paranoia state were i had to prove she was or she wasn't borderline.

That has been very stressing and sometimes i wake up at night being anxious and tense about that thinking about scenario were it will get worse and that she's actually BPD and she will abuse me and the more i read about BPD the more i get anxious.",5,paranoia

"I’ve been living on my own for almost a year now— first time, graduated uni last year. I’m in a city far away from family and most friends. I feel so embarrassed at how long it’s taken me to do normal things, like figuring out how to pay my council tax after many tearful phone calls met with automated voice mails. Some days, feeding myself three square meals and showering felt like an epic mission. Still does!!! There were certainly a few months of depression which obviously made everything harder (plus being newly sober), but even now that the weather’s nice and warm, I’ve got a job and a cat and more friends, the simple things are still so difficult. I’m not depressed currently— I’m in pretty good spirits considering how humbled I am at the moment by how debilitating my ADHD is. 

If I put something in the oven, it WILL be burned. If I start running a bath, it WILL nearly overflow. It took me three weeks to complete my last cycle of laundry because it kept getting damp and forgotten. ‘Now’ seems to consistently be a crossroads between several boring things I have to put in order of priority and do: ‘now’ is always needing the toilet, boiling the kettle for the third time, figuring out what to eat, walking in and out of rooms, doing my rubik’s cube just for something to do with my hands. My whole goal for today was to not let my blood sugar drop so low that I feel faint— I’ve succeeded, but that genuinely has been my entire focus. oh shit I’ve just remembered there’s laundry in the machine!!!!!!!

It feels like I’m regressing — but I know that’s not true. I used to put myself in situations that would keep me adrenalised 24/7, with five projects on the go and absolutely no time to second guess anything, since a deadline was never more than a day or two away. I think it took so long for me to be diagnosed because I didn’t relate to the struggle to focus, because I was constantly adrenalised and too busy and spinning plates from the age of 11 to 22!! I get it now. I can’t focus, I can;t remember the thought I just had, I cannot for the life of me decide on anything right now. I spend hours in daydreams, the way I did when I was a child.. I feel like a child! I’m afraid of the supermarket because of how spaced out it makes me feel, and choosing between brands for somethign, deciding it I ‘deserve’ something or can afford something else leaves me in tears. I’m medicated, too. I had hoped the meds would keep working as well as they did in the beginning. And don’t get me wrong, they still help— the way I describe it, they provide a safety net for when I fall off the tightrope— it’s still an inconvenience to fall, uses up time, and embarrasses me but I don’t break my legs. 


I’m sober and I’m trying to be strict about positive self-talk. I’m keeping me and the cat alive, and I havent been arrested yet for not filling out some important form I’ve never heard of. I don’t want to go back to the high-stress, burnout cycle. But right now it’s hard to see how I can manage to do interesting things that excite me without that heightened fast-moving environment. I don’t want to spend my twenties struggling to do laundry. My friends are all doing these amazing graduate jobs and I’m bribing myself to do the washing up. I’m not jealous, and I’m actually proud of myself — slowly but surely, I’m learning, and I’m building a strong relationship with myself. But its such a weird achievement to tell anyone about — it just sounds like im depressed to other people (which I’m not at the moment, and I know what that looks/feels like for me). And it’s not an ‘achievement’ — because it’s a process. Even if I wash the dishes tonight, there’ll be more tomorrow. And I might not be able to do them tomorrow— but i’m working on choosing it now. What a weird life! 

in summary i guess i’m coming to terms with the fact i really do have a disability. it was never going to be sustainable to use stress to force productivity. this is life!! i do love my cat and she’s just as distractable as me.",3,adhd
"So sometimes I’m afraid of my shadow and convinced there are people in my house. I can’t ever find them but sometimes I 100% believe they’re there. This only happens (so far) when I take a little too much of my Abilify. It’s a long story but I take 1-2mg every other day because I have super sensitivities to meds. I told my psych about the people in my house and she said that’s just anxiety. Correct me if I’m wrong but people in my house that are real to me feels like borderline psychosis at least but paranoia at a minimum. I am afraid people will break in. I’m afraid people are in. Not all the time, but for example, right now my light is on because I’m afraid to go to bed and be in the dark—not because of people, but because I’m uneasy and afraid something will come. My heater came on and my first thought was someone is in the house and turned it on. No, I just thought I turned it off when I checked it this evening. If I hear a beep like my refrigerator door beeps when it’s open I immediately think something is very wrong and the world is ending. Beeps send my into apocalypse mode and it’s hard to feel normal after. I know my thoughts are irrational.

"does anybody keep a journal/diary to track their symptoms? if so, how do you go about it and would you say that it’s beneficial?

I have an appointment with a psychotherapist at the end of june and am writing notes so I don’t forget to mention anything important. my doctor has advised I also put together a timeline of any hallucinations/delusions I’ve experienced in the past until now, which sounded like a good idea until I actually sat down to do it. I didn’t realise how upsetting it’d be to write it all out. 

I feel dishonest and guilty – I don’t fully believe my ‘delusions’ are that at all, I’m just using the term because it’s the same medical jargon the doctors use. but it’s confusing because some of the earlier ‘delusions’ I *can* recognise as being ridiculous, even though I was fully convinced they were true at the time. same goes for the hallucinations.

It's like I just fully believe that bugs are in the house, because I'm so terrified that it's true.

Today I opened the front door and a car drove off. 

The neighbor (whose side they park on) has a gigantic fence. So if they were casing their house it would probably just show that the lights were off.

Now I find a video of a realtor showing a 113mil (I think that’s the number) pent house in NY. I watch maybe 6 out of the 10 minutes then theres a video below showing a 220 million dollar island home in Palm Beach. Of course i have to watch it!

Start show again and watch for about 5 minutes before I remember the whole “Billionaire Row” search I never really answered so going back to google.

"I've been having a terrible time with paranoia, with this one really strong, terrifying certainty that everything in my life is connected and someone is doing it on purpose. For example, I'll be online and see the people I follow post a bunch of posts I don't really get, oh well no big deal.

To be clear, I don't think that someone is making these things happen, it's more like they're deliberately moving them into my line of sight, deliberately drawing lines between them, like their making a web by connecting everything in my life.

They said they’d talk to their parents and get back to me which they did a day later and said that it would be ok to do that. So I called up my insurance and told them the situation. At this point, my anxiety really shut off because I won’t have to worry about a mark on my record and paying extra money for insurance for years.

Fast forward to today, they tell me they talked to someone else now they want to go through insurance. I had already called my insurance and told them to cancel the claim after confirming with that person that we were going to settle this on our own. Now they go back on their word and I’ve been trying to convince them otherwise the whole day but they won’t budge.

Now obviously if they want to go through insurance I won’t stop them. But it’s seriously a massive inconvenience to me because instead of paying them $200 to fix a broken headlight and scratched bumper, I’ll instead have to pay probably close to and extra $100 a month on insurance for 3 years until the ticket is off my record. 

So I’ve basically been in and off freaking out with every indecision they make. I’ve spent the week at school and work trying to keep my composure in front of my peers and today I was so stressed, I couldn’t even eat lunch which is usually my main meal of the day. Man, I’ve been saving up for a new car for years now and now I’ll have to wait more because it won’t be worth the extra money insurance is going to scam me out of.

Idk what more I can do to prove I’m trustworthy and that I promise to pay them every cent of the repair. I’ve given them every step they need to take to get a repair quote including a body shop location. I wish they could just open up their heart this one time and let me pay them out of pocket. Even mentioning insurance is like torture to my brain.",4,anxiety

I got one of these plushies and my mom spotted it in the plastic bag and I told her what it was since she asked, and she was like ""another one?!"" and I tried defending myself saying how it's a series I've collected and all she said was ""well you need to save your money!""

I feel like now I always have to hide those particular plushies from my mom because I'm always questioned or feel judge for this particular interest.

"There have been quite a few questions regarding Tourist Visas for Vietnam on this forum lately, so here's an update, including a big change regarding expedited Visas which just changed in the last couple of days.

**1.)** Visa on Arrival (VOA) hasn't existed for ages now so the only option for most tourists is the E-Visa. It's good for 30 days and one entry. That's it. If you want to visit longer then you have to do a Visa run to Laos, Cambodia, etc. and pick up a fresh E-Visa, then reenter Vietnam.

**2.)** [Here is the official government website for the E-Visa application.](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/trang-chu-ttdt) It's a straightforward application that costs $25 USD and usually takes 3 - 5 business days to process, but submit your application with plenty of spare time because sometimes it takes longer and you can't board the aircraft to Vietnam without it. Lastly, don't use 3rd Party Vendors for the application, they offer no advantage over the official website.

**3.)** [Here are the countries that are eligible for the E-Visa.](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/documents/20181/117155/Vietnam-Evisa-nation-list.pdf/21e0f88f-d8a0-48b8-bfdb-a0f82b0853e2) If your country doesn't make the list then you have to apply for a paper Visa from the nearest Embassy, sorry.

**4.)** [Here is the list of airports, land and sea entry points that accept the E-Visa.](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/documents/20181/117155/List-of-evisa-port.pdf/c774e24b-1ab8-4fb6-9ac1-dcdfaccecf8e)

**5.)** Visa Exemption: A few nationalities are afforded the luxury of Visa Exemption. The time period varies from 14 days to 90 days. All you need is proof of onward travel and you're good to go. There are about [25 lucky nationalities with this perk.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Vietnam) (And yes, you can enter on an E-Visa, then leave, then return using your Visa exemption or vice versa.)

**6.)** Expedited Services: Lastly, up until last week it was possible for a poorly prepared traveller to get an expedited E-Visa via some of the excellent 3rd Party Vendors that provide Visa services. [These guys are one of several examples.](http://vietnamvisapro.com/) There has been a new government crackdown on these services and expedited E-Visas by 3rd Party Vendors does NOT exist at this time.

**Bottom line:** Use the official government website and submit your application with plenty of spare time and you'll find that entering Vietnam with an E-Visa is simple and straightforward.

Happy travels.

**UPDATE ON APRIL 14th:** In the last few days some the 3rd Party expediters are back at work again after the government crackdown. So if you're a poorly prepared traveller and didn't apply for your E-Visa in time you can once again pay big bucks to get it rushed through before your flight departs. Good luck.",0,negative_samples
"Yup. I'm just a shadow of the man I used to be.   
I can't find happiness in my life. I just can't. No matter how much I try, my demons will always get me and drag me down. I have a lovely and supportive wife, a small dude - I love my family, but instead of feeling happy, I'm constantly worried about them. About their health and well-being. This constant health axiety  and ovewhelming  saddnes is affecting my family - I can see that, I see my wife even though she is helping me as much as she can, is alredy tired and fed up with my constant worries. It also affects my little dude - he can see that daddy is not happy, and worried, so he starts to show same behaviour as myself - he is also starting to worry about things he shouldn't.   
I am on anti-depressants (lexapro 10mg) and they were working really good, but since last week or so, I feel they completely stopped doing their job - how is this possible?  
  
I left my home country 20 years ago, and I just missed my home, all the stuff I know, love and understand. I am in an English-speaking country, and I can communicate easily, I can have small chats, and so on; but so what, if I can't have a social life - as I don't understand nuances of the language, phrases and jokes? I don't have a social life at all actually. It's just home, work, home, work.    
  
All I do is just exist, I feel empty, like a husk and I am not the same person I was 20-30 years ago - I was full of life, I had friends, I was chatty and happy. Now, it's just white hair, a tired face and bad emotions. Just overwhelming sadness. I need to change it, I know - but I don't even know where to start, how to start.",2,depression

Today was a good day and the worst day at the same time. My sister graduated today and we had a grad party for her. (So proud of her!) I already was dreading the party because it shines the spotlight on college and how I am not currently attending. This means a lot of side eyes and judgement from my family. I had about five or six people ask me what I was doing with my life and it was very obvious what they were doing. I’m already introverted and it was super hard trying to defend myself. I did have to sneakily go into the guest room to let out a few tears because I was so overwhelmed. It’s very clear my family’s love is conditional. It reminds me why I don’t attend family gatherings and why I like being alone. I just have this gut wrenching feeling after every party. I’m just trying my best but clearly that’s not enough.

I can't get myself to talk about this book. I've tried formulating a coherent opinion on this but I won't even bother. I can't. Instead, I'll present you with a few excerpts from this book and let you decide for yourself.

As of April 28, 2023; there are 2,117 people reading this, 92.5k people who want to read this, and 38,772 who have; on Goodreads. I couldn't have been older than fourteen when I first read this book, even then, all I could think about after finishing this is how I will never get back the time I spent on this.

I was so disappointed. This was such a good concept, such wasted potential. The characters are just plot devices, they serve no other purpose than push the plot forward. The sludge must go on. Every single person in this book is just a cardboard cutout, there's no real depth to any of them. All the dialogue is on the nose, the author seems to know no subtlety, except for one particular scene which I admit was actually sort of emotional, but of course it fell apart the minute it started getting somewhere. The author's knowledge on mental illnesses, therapists and psych wards seems to be limited to movies and tv shows.

The protagonist tries so hard to be witty and it's really overdone in the first half, and the second half (I'll get to it later) totally abandons this persona, only vestiges left from this snarky and sarcastic self that he shows in the beginning.

The book features the characters making fun of a girl who had 'snapped' and mocking her for it, the protagonist going as far as asking the doctor if the girl has contracted a virus. This is justified by 'maybe that’s how nutcases handle things like that.'

Jeff has the maturity of a paper straw. Half the time I was reading the book I was wondering if he had actually slit his wrists or if it was someone else's deed. He doesn't seem like a person who tried to take his life. The very next day of attempting suicide, he goes to call his doctor 'cat poop'. He also refers to him by this when discussing sexual assault, another suicide in the ward and his own attempt. In fact, one of the only indications of character growth I could discern was him calling his doctor by his actual name. The term 'cat poop' comes up at least 170 times in the book, I had counted it on an e-book but I can't be arsed to waste any more time on this abomination.

Jeff also remarks how he wasn't really affected by looking the scars and didn't mind the blood-stained carpet. Even Sadie, another character who had previously tried to drown herself says how she feels happy when she looks back at her attempt. I'm sorry, this is just ridiculous. I would imagine someone who had attempted suicide would at least feel sad when remembering the event, while our protagonist seems mildly irritated at best and his friend is straight out happy.

Apart from calling the hospital 'nuthouse', or the patients 'whack-jobs' and 'nutcases', the portrayal of the very thing its supposed to be about - mental health - is.. to put it lightly, inaccurate.

Alright I've said enough, let me show you what I mean. I'll write down some of the most iconic quotes from this masterpiece. Here goes:

>""First you have your generic depressives. They’re a dime a dozen and usually really boring. Then you’ve got the bulimics and the anorexics. They’re slightly more interesting, although usually they’re just girls with nothing better to do. Then you start getting into the good stuff: the arsonists, the schizophrenics, the manic-depressives. You can never quite tell what those will do. And then you’ve got the junkies. They’re completely tragic, because chances are they’re just going to go right back on the stuff when they get out of here.""

Girls with nothing better to do. I'm sorry, girls with nothing to do? Generic depressives? Boring?

Another excerpt similar to this:

>“No, she is. She was all into heroin and stuff. I guess she ODed a couple of times.”  
>  
>“Wow,” Sadie said. “I’m actually kind of impressed. I thought for sure she’d be into something really girly, like cutting herself.”

Something really girly. Like cutting herself. Impressed.

>""Afterward I just lay there watching everyone kiss while I died, thinking how cool it was to be on my bedroom floor bleeding while everyone in America celebrated the end of my life and the idiot hosting the countdown smiled his goofy fake smile on the TV like the Angel of Death doing a toothpaste commercial.""

Cool.

>""Cutting myself felt so good. It was sweet the way the razor opened up the skin and this red line appeared, like I was pulling a piece of thread out of my wrist. The blood came really slowly, not in some spastic blast like I thought it would. It didn’t even really feel like my arm. It was like I was watching someone else’s arm in a movie. I kept thinking how great the camera angle was and wishing I had some popcorn.""  
>  
>""That’s when I did the other wrist, and that was even better because I knew—knew what it would feel like, knew what would happen. Man, did it feel good, like slicing open the ribbon on a Christmas present you’ve been staring at under the tree for a month and been dying to open. Then it’s finally time to open it, and you just kind of hold your breath while you rip off the paper, hoping that what’s inside will be what you want it to be. And for once, it was.""

No comment on this one.

>""I tried to get back to sleep, but I couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes I could feel Rankin touching me, feel his breath on my neck and his skin against mine. Why did I do that with him? Why did I let him stay? I don’t know why. But I did, and now I feel like crap. Dirty.""

Alright alright some context here - this Rankin guy sexually harasses him. When he has to come clean about this with his therapist, this is what he had to say:

>“I meant that you’re certain you didn’t encourage Rankin in any way.”

..

Fine, let's move on. Oh great, the friend with whom he almost had sex with had committed suicide the day prior and his therapist discloses that at this very moment, when talking about sexual assault. I'm gonna admit, this scene was probably the most emotional one. He was in denial and couldn't accept it, but it was a drastic shift from his overly 'witty' persona and he forgets about it in a bit anyway.

What Rankin had done wasn't even seen as sexual assault. In fact, he even comes to the conclusion he's gay because he enjoyed having sex with Rankin.

>""After the stuff with Rankin, and what happened—or didn’t happen—with Sadie, though, I know that I won’t get over it. It’s what I am.""

Worst of all, he is justifying it.

>""I had to think about that one. I mean, Rankin’s the one who’s started it every time we’ve done anything. But it’s not like he’s ever forced me to do it, and until last night I’ve never exactly told him not to do what he’s done.""

I really can't get myself to finish this review, there's so much that's wrong with it. The first half of it was okay, then it falls apart. It feels like a completely different book after the first few chapters. This book has all the humor of a dried lettuce. I was disappointed at having spent so much time on this book and if you deem your time worthwhile, take my advice and don't waste your time on this.

I can only imagine a person suffering from some eating disorder reading the thing about them usually being ""girls with nothing better to do"". The way how self harm was portrayed as a girlish thing, or how suicide was romanticized.

What started off as me trying to be unbiased and rational has fallen apart faster than this book's tone. At least I can rest assured my awful review can't be worse than this wretched book. This guy must've left the hospital more traumatized than he ever was when arriving.

As much as I'd love to get all overcritical and pick out every single thing in this book, I've got to drown my bookshelf now. Besides, I don't want to waste any more time on this book anyway.

"Was talking to my friend on discord the other night and we reached the topic of how messy my room was when she came over a couple weeks ago. A corner in my room had begun becoming a bit of a “depression den”, with trash and boxes piling up that I was too depressed to take care of.

I’ve always kind of considered myself to be functionally depressed, because I can get up and do things for the most part, and I can go to work. But I’m constantly suicidal and depressed. When it gets particularly bad is when I start to stop taking care of myself and my belongings, hence this pile of trash that had built up in my room. 

Somehow we shifted our conversation to this and I apologized she had to see it when it was in its worst state (which wasn’t entirely true, but I didn’t wanna go into detail about the other times my room turned into a trash den). After I said that she told me, “if that was your worst, then you don’t know what true mental illness is”. Honestly, I didn’t know how to respond. I don’t know if she necessarily had bad intentions, but she knows I have depression and anxiety, so hearing that from her honestly just felt like a slap to the face.

She doesn’t know how bad my mental health has been lately. It’s a miracle I’m still alive. Hearing her say that felt so shitty because it almost sounded like, despite the shit I’ve been going through, it’s not enough to be *actually* depressed. It just left a bad fucking taste in my mouth and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it.

"To all readers I understand that I am a shitty person. I am not looking for any sympathy from anyone. I simply need to get some things off of my chest. I apologize for the structure of this post. I am not very good at composing my thoughts into words so this may come across as more of a rambling than anything else.   
  
I’ve been battling with depression all my life. I always thought that once I hit that “big event” my depression would finally go away. Despite hitting several of these “events” during my life my depression has only worsened. A few years ago I finally broke down and reached out to a doctor and was prescribed antidepressants. After a few trial and errors with different drugs I finally found one that worked well for me. They didn’t fix my depression, but they definitely made things more bearable. However, now after a few years they have either stopped working entirely, or are working too well. I’m now completely disassociating with the outside world while facing internal conflict like no other.   
  
My job pays pretty well, but it isn’t exciting work by any means. By nature I am a good worker. I am a bit of a perfectionist whenever it comes to my work, and I will get tasks completed fast and efficiently. I do not however get any sort of fulfillment out of my work. My co-workers act as if they enjoy what they’re doing. Perhaps they are lying to me or themselves about enjoying the work, and they are truly as miserable doing the work as I am. Regardless I am jealous of their fulfillment, or ability to lie to themselves because I simply cannot do this. I know I hate my job, and the thought of doing it for another 30-40 years fills me with a sense of dread. Further, I cannot think of a job on this planet that would give me a sense of fulfillment. I think that no matter what job I have I will eventually come to hate it.   
  
I have always had low self esteem. As a former obese child & teenager I never had anyone show romantic interest in me throughout my teenage years. Because of this I despised the way that I looked and turned to porn for comfort. As I came into adulthood I decided to get a grip on my health and managed to lose a lot of weight, but I still hold onto the body image issues (along with stretchmarks and loose skin) from the weight I once held.   
  
I managed to have two serious relationships in earlier adulthood and then eventually met my now wife. I went into relationships with the intent of marriage from the very start. I was coming from the mindset that if I don’t lock someone down I will never be able to get someone in the future. After the first relationship went south I decided that I would marry my next girlfriend no matter what. That’s when I met my now wife. She was pretty enough and had a good enough personality, but more importantly loved me. While dating I wasn’t convinced that I loved her, but kept forward with my original promise to myself and married her anyway. Fast forward five years and we’re having issues exclusively because of me. Some days I like my wife and her personality. She has a sweet side and knows how to make me smile. Other days a different side of her comes out that I simply cannot stand. On top of this despite an initial attraction, I am no longer physically attracted to her. This has made our sex life basically non-existent and has caused an even greater strain on our relationship all because of me. I know my wife loves me, but I do not think that I love her. I can keep on faking love for a while, but I think it is becoming more and more evident. I do not want to hurt my wife, but I don't know if there is another option besides separation. She deserves to be with someone who loves her.   
  
I have family and a few close friends, but they don’t know this side of me at all. To them I am the guy who always has something funny to say. I am rarely serious around them and try to make sure everyone is laughing and having a good time when I’m around. Despite this the second I am no longer around them I return to my depression, often worse than before.   
  
Sometimes the only thing that gives me comfort during difficult situations is fantasizing about killing myself. I don’t think I will actually ever do the deed, but thinking about it helps me get through whatever shitty situation I am facing in the moment. If I didn’t have anyone in my life that my suicide wouldn’t adversely affect then I would do it, but I cannot bring myself to put someone else through emotional pain no matter how much I hate myself. For the meantime I will continue to numb my pain with weed and alcohol.",2,depression

"As a 24-year-old guy, I'm looking for advice on how to overcome the challenges I faced during my childhood with strict and controlling parents. Growing up, my parents were extremely strict and had a lot of rules that didn't allow me to have any freedom or independence. As a result, I didn't have many friends and felt isolated from my peers. My parents also painted a fake picture of our life to others, always praising me and saying I was a good child who didn't do anything wrong. In reality, I didn't have the social skills or experiences that other kids my age had because my parents saw things like dating and having sex as taboo.

Now that I've moved out of my parents' house and achieved financial freedom, I feel like it's a good time to start working on myself and overcoming the challenges I faced during my childhood. I'm struggling with social situations and have a hard time fitting in because I never learned how to make friends or communicate effectively. I also have trust issues and get paranoid about having people in my life. As a result, my thinking patterns are messed up and I'm struggling to navigate relationships. I feel like I missed out on a lot and I'm not sure how to overcome this and learn the social skills I need to survive in the real world.

"I’m not gonna give a long prefacing ramble, so let’s just get straight to the heart of the issue- I am paranoid that my dad drugs me in my sleep and possibly rapes me while I am drugged. Yes, I know, that’s kind of heavy. These thoughts come and go, but when they stick around I find myself becoming completely lost in them. I find it all so disgusting and terrifying and disturbing. My mind and body instantly become riddled with anxiety. I feel like I am constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown, because of how much this paranoia weighs on me.

I just don’t know what to do. I don’t trust my dad, which is probably why I am paranoid in the first place. What makes it all worse is that I currently live with my parent’s, though I am trying to save up money to move out. I just feel so confused and stressed over this all. It’s like when I start having these thoughts my capacity for rational thinking and reasoning completely disappears, and I feel truly unable to discern reality from what sinister scenarios my mind has conjured up. 

My worst fear is that the drugging my dad is doing to me (supposedly, according to the paranoia) is going to give me permanent brain damage, and eventually my brain will be so damaged that I will be rendered a human vegetable, more or less. And then maybe I will no longer be functional enough to live on my own, and so I will be trapped, forced to live out the rest of my days with my parents while being in a nearly brain-dead stupor. Even writing all of this out right now is giving me massive amounts of anxiety. 

I don’t know where to turn next. I have a therapist, but I am worried that she will think I’m really mentally ill if I tell her these thoughts. I’m a generally competent and functional person in most areas of my life so I feel as if this paranoia is too “out there” and dark to confess to her. But admittedly I also feel at my wit’s end, and I have this sense that if I don’t take action soon, I may end up in an even worse place than I already am. Sigh…I feel so scared.",5,paranoia

Hey guys, I'm not really sure why I'm posting this, but I just wanted to put myself out there for once. I'm a 19-year-old guy, and I'm really struggling with some stuff. I don't even know if anyone will read this, but I figured it couldn't hurt to try.

I've been dealing with some pretty severe depression for a while now. It's hard to describe exactly how I feel, but I just feel really lost and hopeless all the time. I don't really have anyone to talk to about it, and I don't think anyone really notices me or my problems. I actually don't have anyone to talk about anything except my weird confusion and poor self image.

I've been isolated for most of my teenage years and even some of my childhood. I don't really blame anyone for that, it's just the way things worked out. But for the past 5 years, I've been completely alone, and it's really taking a toll on my mental health.

I don't have any goals or anyone to live for, and I just feel like I'm drifting through life with no purpose. I've tried to find things that interest me, but I always seem to lose motivation pretty quickly. I feel like I've failed at just about everything I've tried, and anything good that's happened to me has just been luck.

I know this might sound irrational, but I feel like the only thing that might work for me is finding someone who's going through the same thing. Someone who's just as confused and lost as I am, so we can figure things out together. But I don't want advice or a mentor or anything like that. I just want to connect with someone on an equal level.

Anyway, sorry for rambling on. I don't really expect anything to come of this, but it feels good to at least try to put myself out there. Thanks for reading, whoever you are.",2,depression

They were so toxic and I learned so much about them as people I'm personally reevaluating the friendship. Both my fiance and I experienced physical symptoms of anxiety after 5 days with them. Behavior ranged from Fighting constantly, threats of divorce, meandering from one tourist trap to another while judging me for basic research on good local resturants, refusing to speak the local language, smoking and blowing it in the face of us (nonsmokers), I could go on. 

My fiance in particular regrets the trip in general and he realized he took 3 photos total, almost like he wanted to forget the first time he ever went to Europe.

"Hi there! 

I was suggested this medication by my Endocrinologist a few times, seeing as I have Type 2 and it's supposed to be a great way to manage it - with the added bonus of weight loss, which is a concern for me as well. I haven't been able to go onto it because it's so expensive, but I'm starting school soon so I'm hoping my student benefits would help cover it. 

My question, I guess, is... How do you find it? Have you noticed it helps better or worse than oral medications? 

A few people in my life have mentioned that it's being reccomended by a lot of doctors for a lot of things, so I'm worried it's a situation where they might be getting insentives to do so, so that concerns me a little bit!

EDIT / UPDATE: I've decided NOT to go with this medication due to the sheer numbers of people who have not done well with it. Of course I want my numbers in check and to lose weight, but I don't want to feel sick constantly or deprive my body of food to do it, so I think I will explore other options!

"I was talking to a friend recently, who mentioned some books they read, and that they didn't like some of the books because the first-person narrator was too far from their own selves. It confused me for a bit -- of course a character would be different from you!

But they had assumed first-person was that way because it's meant to be ""you"", and you're supposed to project yourself.

I had assumed first person was like you listening to someone tell you a story, like when you're at a party and you hear a friend tell you about this wild thing that happened. 

I'm sure many stories exist on both ends of the spectrum, but I realized it's probably explains my negative feelings toward some recently first-person books I read: I viewed the main character as a total self-obsessed narcissist, but if it's meant to be \*you\*, then \*you\* are assumed to be justified in your actions, and that's part of the escapist fantasy.

There is literally nothing wrong with any style of reading, so this is not meant as a judgment -- just as a curiosity to see what's in your mind as you read.

"My little brother and his friend went into the creek in our backyard and kidnapped a salamander. Now my parents want to let my loud, obnoxious, irresponsible, little brother keep this thing as a pet.

I *tried* telling them to release it, but they won't listen. They've bought a tank and a bunch of other stuff for it already. So I decided that if I can't get them to release it, then I'll do research to make sure it's at least somewhat happy. Well, i try to tell them *anything,* and they won't listen. They refuse to listen to me at all. This has gone on for almost a week now and im so sick and tired of it. Over and over, they say something about it not eating, or not moving much, and I tell them the reason why that's probably happening, and they get angry at me and don't listen to me.

And when I try to help them with anything, they give all the credit to my little brother. I'm pretty much the only one doing research at all, and they just act like I'm stupid. I cry about this poor salamander every single night, because the poor thing is suffering and there is pretty much nothing I can do to help it.

We just kidnapped this poor thing from its home, I want to make sure it's OK, that's all I want to do.

She has been  putting towels over phones, putting paper over random electronics (e.g. the lights on a ps3 even though I told her there's no camera in it), and  is very suspicious of all strangers I'm unsure if this is the cause of  her medication (she takes plenty of meds for her pain), her lack of friends/social activity (she mostly talks with me and my two siblings), or something else.

I've been very calm and rational with addressing this problem with her, but she has told me that she knows she seems crazy, but at least God understands her. She's very stubborn and gets  angry whenever we have conversations that makes her feel uncomfortable.  When I asked her about how this all will end, she said she'll either end  up arrested or God will ""deliver her"" from this. Idk what she means by  this but she comes off as if she's given up. Her disability has made life very painful for her and she usually just watches TV everyday while  dealing with her pains.

I live about about an hour or two away from her for work and don't have a car  for easy transportation to help her. I'm trying my best to be calm and  supportive but I hate that I can't do much while my mom's mind is deteriorating. My siblings are a double edge sword in all of this since  they're both helpful and toxic for my mother. They're easily frustrated  and emotional whenever my mom gets too overbearing (she can get very  angry and mean when things doesn't turn out her way). My brother helps  sometimes since he lives with her but he is very junky, stubborn, and conceited. My mom likes a clean house and my brother constantly dirties  up the place. My sister on the other hand can be supportive but her  awful relationships and financial troubles causes her to be very toxic. She constantly borrows money from us, manipulates/lies, and can be  downright rude at times.

My sister  and I have been wanting to do an intervention on my mother but my  brother doesn't want to do it. I'm trying to listen and be supportive of  everyone, but I don't know what to do and I'm tired of all this  emotional labor. Action needs to happen but with my brother constantly working and focusing on his own interests while my sister is working and  focusing on relationships/partying/etc, it can't happen. I've been telling my mom I think she should go to counseling/therapy, but I don't think she's going to do it. She only trusts one counselor she went to  years ago, and has told me she would try to find her ""one of these days.""

I feel like this beyond my expertise and want to bring in professional help, but I just don't know  where to start. Thank you for reading this.",5,paranoia
"Hello everyone!

As someone with an Ileostomy, it is very difficult for me to wear pants with a tucked shirt. I always leak, and it can get very embarrassing and cumbersome during my work hours. I recently matched into a residency program in the United States, and part of the dress code, is wearing tucked shirts during outpatient clinic hours. 

I have tried multiple belts and stoma guards, but they are both uncomfortable and cause leaks to routinely happen. 

I am very frustrated, and have no idea how to go about resolving this. I have tried nearly every product under the sun, and nothing works. 

If anyone's had similar issues or advice on how to overcome this, I would love to hear about it!

Thank you.",0,negative_samples
"I’ve been off & on ADHD meds for about 14 years now. First Concerta, then Adderall. I started Adderall again about a year ago when I realized my depression was caused by the constant stress caused by my inability to stay focused & follow things through to completion.

I started at 10mg xr for four months, that was working really well. Decided with my psych to move up to 15mg xr, took that for 8 months. 

Then the lovely shortage started. Around this time my psych & I noticed I could benefit from an increase in dosage. We were aiming for 20mg. With the availability that turned into 20mg one month, 25mg the next, 15mg after that, 15mg XR with a 5mg IR the next. Dextro here, amphetamine here. 

It may not seem like much but the 5-10mg difference from month to month is driving me crazy. I miss the stability of the same dosage each day, each month. I know it’s lucky to get any of an Rx these days but wow it’s hard when my brain feels so many different levels all the time.",3,adhd

"Days are blurring together, I'm not sad, but I'm not happy. I feel fake, like everything I do is premeditated and I have zero-control. I can't even remember what I ate for breakfast, school work has piled up and I'm scared to start trying to catch up. I'm such a burden, nothing I do is ever right. I wish I helped my mom more, I love her, but don't want to be around her. It's gonna hurt so damn bad when she dies, everything is going to go haywire, and she is going downhill. I'm almost 15, all my friends have part-time jobs and know what they are going to be when they grow up, while I'm over here trying my damn best to function. Functioning is probably the hardest part about all of this, I'm able to seem 'okay', but at what cost? Barely taking care of/caring about what I look like, what my room looks like? And my mom hates that I don't care what I look like half the time, but really, would she rather me lay in bed all day and let the dogs and chickens go hungry? UGH I DONT FREAKING KNOW ANYMORE, all that I know is that I HATE feeling like this, this weird, empty and angry feeling with an anxious buzz in the background. My chest feels heavy, but my stomach empty, with this ache that I can't rightly explain. I just want people to see that I am trying, that I'm a person too. Hell, I'm so disconnected from reality that my vision is blurry, I know what I'm seeing and I can describe it to people, but it's also like I'm watching a youtube video. The only reason that I even picked up photography was because I could actually *experience* the pictures. And hell, my mom wanted me when no-one else did, and now she's leaving too. She adopted me when my bio abandoned me, I don't know a thing about the lady, I was barely a year old. I had a brother I never knew and had to ATTEND his funeral. I don't want my mom to leave me like everybody else, sure I've got a sister and family I love and care about, but it's different with her. God I'm just so sick of it all, sometimes I want to comit suicide because then they'll wish they saw the signs but I know thats shitty of me, and other times I wish I could commit but I always shame myself down from it. I just don't want to exist anymore, not if it's always going to be like this. And for anyone even thinking that I should go to therapy, trust me, we have tried to get me in counseling, the places in my area don't take my insurance, and that crap is expensive, and frankly we are not in the best of financial situations right now. Nobody around me would understand if I told them, I've been this disconected since I was around 7, and I genuinely believe I don't deserve help, I deserve to suffer for all the bad shit I've done, and I know nobody agrees with that, but they would if they just knew the half of the crap I've done. In some twisted part of me I just want someone to agree that, ""Yes, I am useless and I deserve everything bad that has happened/will happen to me.''",2,depression
"Back around 2017, I left my job because it was too stressful for me. I was coming home crying. the final straw was I couldn't stop crying long enough to drive to work. work was bullshit. I worked at a deli in a grocery store. this was right around the time of a minimum wage increase in Michigan. people would quit and no one would be rehired, leaving me to the responsibilities of 4 or 5 people. It was so straining that I was sore everyday and had difficulty sleeping. I have bad anxiety so finding a job is extremely difficult. I have gaps in my resume that people hiring always ask about. I never know what to tell them. It adds to interview anxiety, so I didn't look for jobs.

My dad was supporting me completely, paying 10k or more a year for rent and food. I drove my car dry and seized the engine, so my ability of finding a new job was greatly diminished. my only choice was to work another straining minimum wage job near my apartment and that gave me anxiety. I'm not lazy, I just worked the jobs of 4 people for minimum wage and I have trouble asking for help.

Anyway, this starts a cycle of me trying to get help and accumulating more anxiety by being misdiagnosed. I text my dad suicidal texts, I had no plan in acting them out, but I had anxiety and my dad was always threatening me to take my apartment away and force me to live on the streets. I guess I just wanted him to feel sorry for me or something. there was some feeling that I wanted the suffering to end, but I didn't want to die.

He petitioned me, like he should have, and I went to the psych ward. it wasn't my first time, as I had been there in the past when I was overstimulated one time and had to take a break from life. The time I went was 10 years prior, idk what happened but I was stressed out from work (another overworked fast food minimum wage job) and I couldn't go home to sleep because it was turned into a party house by my friends. I went to my dads and I was stressed out and said some things that I forget now but my step-mom ended up calling the hospital and I was voluntarily admitted to the psych ward. I believed I was going through a quarter-life crisis. I had recently dropped out of college because work scheduled me on days I deliberately took off for school and forgot about school (I was 19, just moved out of the house and had bills to pay) and the book store didn't restock a book I needed for a VB class because someone bought it but then dropped the class. couldn't find the book online, so I ended up dropping the class in the middle of the semester, giving me an incomplete. anyway, at the psych ward I was diagnosed with psychosis and let go on some weak antipsychotics. they didnt do anything to help my anxiety and really didn't seem to do anything at all, so I stopped taking them. I don't think the meds were important but I didn't take it seriously and never went to my doctor about anxiety.

back to 2017. I left my job, lost my car and I was in a vicious cycle. I would text my dad suicidal text, get admitted to the psych ward, take the meds find them ineffective with my anxiety, stop taking them, and would sent more suicidal texts to my dad. this cycle led to a total of about 7 psych ward visits, which is a limit before they have to take serious action. in an act of desperation to break the cycle and maybe get a disability claim, I reported some pareidolias as hallucinations. It was a stretch to call them hallucinations. The water running though the pipes sounded like someone whispering my name, and I reported seeing ghosts after my hair got in my eyes and it reminded me of some scary picture I saw on the internet, it was a pareidolia.

They diagnose me with schizophrenia and force me to live at an adult foster care cities away from my apartment. not collecting disability at this point although im now eligible. I'm forced to comply with my ATO and am forced to take meds. The AFC ended up being a good thing in my eyes because I was able to get out and ride my bike almost everyday. nature and exercise do wonders for mental health.

I was moved to another AFC closer to where I was living before and these new caretakers didn't care for us very much. I was lucky if I got dinner. they were supposed to prepare 3 full meals a day, but they didn't and food piled up and they would end up taking it home or throwing it away, even though your taxes are going to this food and for them prepare it for us.

one day in june 2020, fresh in the pandemic, they decide to turn the AC off and make it hot in the house. It was 86 degrees in my room and I told them it was hot. I go to the store and 30 minutes later, still hot in my room. so I break the box covering the thermostat and turn it on, this angered the caretaker so much that she got in my face like I had a problem with her. ""I cook you food, don't I?"" she ironically says. I start formally refusing to take my med (they weren't forcing me to take them anyway) and a couple days later, 3 cop cars show up like I have a gun or something and handcuff me and take me to the hospital to get admitted to the psych ward. I was starting a business and started making about 1k a month, but they put a halt to that. This time at the psych ward, their goal was ""to get me in and out as fast as possible"" and I wasn't provided care that was personalized towards me, rather to someone who was schizophrenic and had anger issues. I may have had a little problem with anger, but nothing a little anger management couldn't solve. In the psych ward, they prescribe me with Haldol and I'm forced to take it in order to leave the psych ward or basically stay there indefinitely. This medication has plenty of severe side effects that can become permanent. I experience absolute drowsiness, I sleep 12 hours a day, get the jitters all the time and it affects my ability to play/enjoy video games, not to mention it causes anhedonia and permanent sexual dysfunction. I am forced to take it according to my ATO.

I sent a letter to my doctor, outlining my concerns and asking me to take me off of haldol, which happened for 3 or 4 months, but out of the blue they call me and want me back for routine injections.

i am trying to find a legal ground to get off this med, but with the added stigma of schizophrenia, its nearly impossible. People with schizophrenia don't believe they have it and refuse to take their meds, so I'm forced to inject haldol even though it's meant for people who absolutely can't control their anger or have debilitating hallucinations, which I don't have. I've tried posting on r/legaladvice but my posts get downvoted and largely ignored 

Now, I am stuck in another loop with this debilitating drug, but they won't take me off of it. If I refuse, I get to have cops come to my door and haul me away from my business and my responsibilities of taking care of my cat all because I had bad anxiety and was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. They can hold me in the hospital for 15 months if I refuse my meds and probably physically force me to take an injection.

personally, I believe I may be schizotypal or have SPD, as I have had delusions that I consider magical thinking, but also some real stuff has happened to me that may seem like a delusion, but I have no problem telling the difference between what is real and what is not. I don't have hallucinations. The only audio hallucinations I have are called auditory afterimages from listening to my 3d printers run all day.

Does anyone know how I get out of this? I've emailed legal aid but they have yet to get back to me. I really need a lawyer or someone to navigate the hasty, unforgiving code of Michigan's Kevin's law. Do I sue myself for defamation? How do I get a copy of my mental health records and court documents and make sure they didn't falsify or exaggerate 

before you downvote this post or say I actually have schizophrenia, know that I have all the telltale signs of a misdiagnosis (reported auditory hallucinations, repeated psych ward visits for suicidal ideation, prominent anxiety) and studies have been produced that prove over 50% of schizophrenia diagnoses are wrong. I have seen many doctors and none of them were native english speakers.",6,schizophrenia

Once, back when I was a kid I had this episode the day before one of my exams. My mind was saying some stuff i.e. I was thinking about things. I was panickimg and telling my mom "" Mom my mind is saying things and not letting me study. I cannot concentrate. It will not let me study"" I was crying vehemently. I was inconsolable and I thought I'd fail. But I passed with flying colours. I WAS NOT HALLUCINATING. I WAS NOT HEARING VOICES IN MY HEAD. This episode shook me to my very core and had instilled in me a fear of exams. For the next few exams I told myself ""this is your own mind speaking to you. You can ask it to quieten down. It will listen because this is your own mind"" 
For more clarity, I would like to tell you I never prepare for my exams beforehand so it could have been stress. But this was just a one time thing. To this day I do not know what had happened to me that night. WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

yesterday i was in the car with my family on my way home from a neighbor's wedding and an ambulance passed by

fast forward to last night and i had a dream where my friends and i were just hanging out where all of a sudden an ambulance went by. not long after that, we heard a death announcement and the name they said was mine (though they pronounced my name wrong). we all looked so confused, and then we saw one of our teachers standing across from us. we then ran towards her and screamed saying how they got the name wrong. she then calls out towards the people announcing... and then i woke up at 4am

idk this all feels sooo weird. i'm not religious at all but looking thru the interpretations according to ibn sirin just fuels my anxiety even more...

Making appointments is rough enough, but imagine they change you over to something else, the Pharmacy doesn't have that either, so you're right back where you started and then have to make ANOTHER appointment to get ANOTHER prescription for ANOTHER medication

"My life is so just slightly not great. I have a job, I live with my mother and my free time is spent however I please.

Whether it be dwelling in the shame of not going to college or wallowing in self pity and lack of a social circle, I always turn around after a lil bit. I usually end up in trains of thought similar to:

""Nope, I'm fine, might as well be happy, cause lingering in any other feeling does me no good.""

And then I just act completely fine and inevitably feel fine. I'm always cracking up my co workers, making them smile and laugh. But I get so sick of it sometimes. I'm the only damn person who's positive. Despite how depressed I feel when I'm not working. It feels like a role that I've adapted to. And I just keep going with it. 

You can only fake it so much before you get exhausted and give up trying. Trying to act like I'm fine, and/or that things will get better. Cause at this pace, it's not. I barely have anyone in my life that I'm real with. The extent of my social circle is really just friends online, which are great dont get me wrong I love each and every one of them.

"One thing I don't see being talked about nearly enough is how ADHD (and ASD too I imagine in a similar way) can isolate you from people.

Just one (personal) example is when you find a brand new thing to be obsessed over, but not a single other person in your life gives a shit about it. Like you can be super into this new video game, read up on all the lore and really have a lot of fun getting stuck in.

But you then look over to your friends and realise they don't care. They're only going to get bored if you rattle off all the fun things you've done or found out.

Your colleagues ask you what you did with your weekend and you reply that you've been enjoying your video game, and they laugh and roll their eyes like 'oh, again?'. 

It's not the type of thing you can find space for in an online community either, as very few people care about the cool kill you got the other day or how you think this thing is cool but it's already been talked to death on the subreddit. 

Then everyone starts to wonder why you're not as social with them all of a sudden, as if you have nothing to talk about anymore, but it's just that you'll end up talking about the Thing again. Shit sucks, man.

People without ADHD/ASD obviously get this sometimes in their lives too, but with me I find this is on a permanent every-few-months-or-so cycle. It's exhausting and so I just wanted to vent about it.

"I went into DKA very unexpectedly in early April. I was in the ICU for 3 days. I was diagnosed Type 2 in March 2921 and my A1C has been around 6.5 for those two years. I was on Invokana for a year because Metformin made me too sick. My numbers were fine leading up to this. A bit higher than I would like but nothing crazy. 
One day I started feeling nauseous and getting reflux all day. The next day I was vomiting and lethargic. In the middle of the night my roommate heard me struggling to breath. (Khussmal breathing) She called 911 and I was admitted to the ICU. I don’t have any recollection of this. I woke up in the ICU late that afternoon but still groggy. The doctors were confused about why this happened. I had euglycemic DKA. Which is rare. DKA of any kind is supposedly rare in Type 2s. 
They did tests that took over a month to get back that confirmed I have LADA. I had suspected that might be the case but the reality of being insulin dependent for the rest of my life is overwhelming. I feel like I’m starting all over again. Adjusting to the insulin, finding the right dose, getting early morning lows that effect me for the rest of the day. It’s been exhausting. 
I also have a long history of anxiety and depression and this isn’t helping matters. 

My real question is how have others felt and dealt with the aftermath of DKA? I feel so emotionally raw, like I could cry at the stop of a hat. This isn’t like me. 

I’m seeing a therapist but it would be nice to here from someone who has had this experience.

"Hello everyone,

I'm looking for help and advices and I apologize for the long message, will add a TL;DR 

Yesterday, as i was walking on a crowded street full of families and people enjoying the Sunny day, I saw a group of 10 young guys suddendly run towards a guy to beat him up (I think it was a targeted revenge thing, but nevertheless very shocking) the guy was still running from the group when I tried to get myself away from the scene (felt really helpless and anxious, how can I, a single woman, handle 10 angry guys?) but 10 seconds later I heard a woman scream her lungs out and two guys starting to run towards the concussion which I hope was to help ? 
A few moments later I saw an ambulance emerge from the street, but I don't know if it was related or not.
 I know nothing happened to me, but this got me on edge all day, squirming at any fast moving people, loud noise or gathering of people and looking out for any potential danger.

It made me feel trapped in a city where there was no way to escape senseless violence that litteraly happens in front of everyone, with nothing we can do, and I know that much more horrible things happen in so many places, which also spiked my anxiety and I even caught myself thinking that I can't wait for this life to be over to not witness such horrible things, as if I had entirely forgotten that life is also about beautiful moments.

I tried to ""make sense out of it"" with my partner and my parents and they basically told me to get over it, and it didn't bring me any comfort
how do you manage to calm yourself, find a reason and see the light in this darkness?

Thanks so much for reading this and for your help!

I was so scared I just gave the man a hug and he proceeded to walk away saying ""message me, really."" 

I immediately turned around and walked towards where I was originally headed, took a glance at the swim stuff, and immediately left. I'm so paranoid, I don't know. I just feel like he did something or put something on me. I took the longest way to where I was headed so I could make sure all the cars behind me completely cycled and nobody was following me.

"Hey guys, I’m writing this as best as I can because I still feel fragmented- like right and left are not connected- in my body or in the world. I don’t use drugs a lot. I guess you could say all the “weed and mushrooms are the new frontier and they will cure everything” talk got to me. A yer ago I tried a very small dose of weed edibles. I had a full on psychedelic experience where I was stuck in a time loop, nothing was real and time stopped making sense. I had what i now realize is a psychotic break. A year later I still wasn’t recovered. 
This weekend, stupidly, I did mushrooms. I believed all that talk about expanding drugs, how they can only help you, etc. it was even worse. I felt full on fragmentation, I could only talk in the third person referring to myself. I can’t even say it was myself talking, I truly was other people. Even now I feel my left and right brain as separate entities. I experiences the worst and deports terror I could possibly imagine, with no way out. No solution. 
It also confused me even more about time. I’m screaming still whenever I have to think of any temporal concept, time is sideways now. It makes no sense. I can’t function. I feel like I’m not here, time isn’t here, it doesn’t go forward. It’s all jumbled. 
I regret doing this. My brain is broken now forever. Do you feel this time perception with schizophrenia? I don’t have schizophrenia but when I was in college even smoking a little bit made me entirely paranoid, which is why I lost interest in drugs for my adult life. Fuck, even typing this the timeline doesn’t make sense of being in college then later then now.",6,schizophrenia
"Been very sick with a vicious GI virus — vomiting or diarrhea non-stop—& unable to take meds for 5 days.

My mother in law died on Sunday. So ya, the timing couldn’t be worse for me, or anyone who needs me right now.

I’ve been awful. Impulsive. Moody. Lonely. I feel like a toddler. I’ve said terrible things to my husband, things I know would never escape my mouth hole if I were in proper shape (medication-wise & health-wise). I’m still not well, even today. The doc says it could take a full week to recover.

It’s been a long time since I’ve gone this long without meds & I’m not exaggerating when I say there is a huge mood component, largely tied to impulsivity. Of course, awful behavior is still awful behavior, and I own that. I just don’t know if it would have gotten this bad if I were not off my meds for so long, on top of being sick. On top of grieving. I guess I wanted to know if anyone else has had this experience.

I’m hard enough on myself. Not really looking for a stern chat, here. I get it. I have behaved despicably. Just looking for the “ya that’s happened to me before” people in the crowd. Thanks, everyone.",3,adhd
"I wake up with agonizing muscle ache listening to the wind whispering to me while giving me a strong feminine grasp. I watch as the world, no, the universe, move around and I only keep watching the gloomy streets while the wind speaks to me. The feeling of warmth is what is desired but only the coldness of the breeze comes to me. Watching my mind slowly but inevitably corrupt itself due to the humanity that surrounds me. Wishing I was unraped mentally and physically in order for my childhood to be full of glee and rather left in isolation and peace with the beautiful roses and daffodils giving me the soft touch that I keep yearning for as the cold wind finally blows the flowers sweet smell. I hold a child's hand as I sit on the rock facing my mother's grave and cry solemnly knowing I'll be there to give her a rose or two a day. For her warm spirit will finally allow me to achieve comfort with the hand of the child that I will raise, safeguarding me from the trauma that I was yielded upon.",2,depression
"Since my diagnosis I often find myself reflecting on my current behavior and circumstances a lot and trying to take it back to see if it's related. I've done loads of things that are really surprising and I'm wondering what the community has as well. 

One of the more surprising things is the link between my glasses and my ADHD. When I was a teenager I had really bad acne (and generally poor hygiene) and went to the dermatologist. I was too ashamed to admit that most mornings I just couldn't wash my face properly with acne creams and so I lied, said they didn't work and was put on a high dose of roaccutane. I was told to use it for a maximum of 6 months and I'm conjunction with the creams. 2 years later I'm still on it and shamefully lying about using the creams and I'm way over the recommended treatment schedule to the point my skin and eyes are now permanently dried out. So dried out I can't use contacts and laser eye surgery is too risky. 

Tl;dr lied about my hygiene and dried out my eyes and now can't wear contacts.

"I am currently in a very deep major depression, . I was okay for a long time but now I am at a point I had already been 15 years ago. I find myself planning how to escape. I know I need help and I was actively trying to, but there are some points that don't work out. I am so tired of trying. I need more meds and I start questioning if a life on meds is worth the struggle.
This morning I already had a panic attack and I cried. And I need to sort my thoughts and give them space so that's why I am here, writing. I did some awareness excercise to calm down amd afterwards I started thinking in circles what a mess this is. It is getting harder to get out of the circling thoughts. And how shall I go for a walk when I can't open the frontdoor to step out? When I try progressive muscle relaxation I find myself all tensed up.
I feel bad for just sitting with a coffee and not being able to do normal stuff, feeling guilty for not being functional. And all I can do is concentrate on breathing. 
And there are the thoughts that everyone around just things I don't want to, not believing that I can't and yes through all this I can't... I additional don't want because it feels exhausting to only think about. I know I can feel better, I know It won't stay like this, I know I have to be patient and accepting and nice to myself, but my whole life experiences work against me and I just want to give up.
Is it okay to just do the absolut minimal things? Is it okay to just sit and stare and cry? 
How do you give yourself a friendly hand, when you hate yourself for being sick? Because all you ever heard is that you are weak not sick. Sometimes it even hurts to breath. I am holding on. But I don't want to. How do others cope with this I can't and I don't want anymore?",2,depression

"these thoughts are consistent and common enough that I don't recognize them as alarming thoughts rly. today's thoughts: 

the government sees everything I do say and think and let me do bad things and ruin my life, because encouraging criminal actions of the undesirables like me ensures the celebration of our execution. I am intrinsically evil, something wrong in my core. despite my resistance and pleading to God I'll eventually become a murderer, rapist or smth. they will wait until I become completely insane, arrest me, and kill me in jail. people will celebrate my death as I was a burden on all of society and did horrible things. this creates the allusion that justice was served.

In reality they know my decay is happening and they know how to help me, but they won't. they want me to become a horrible criminal, they could stop me and save people, save me, but they won't because a local villian distracts the masses from wanting justice of the elites. its all a distraction letting ppl like me fall to the extreme so they can maintain power.

people in my life are in on it. anyone except for like my mom & dad are all fake in a ploy to trick me. all my friends are nice to me to get dhit out of me, get me talking, fill out a file idk maybe it's just a game, laughing at me while I get a panic attack from someone smiling at me. everyone who needs to know knows and acts like they don't to ruin my life, they want to see how far it goes.


why are you talking to me? what do you want? what do you know? why are you being nice?

you want to get close to me to learn more to encourage more to worsen me to drive me closer and closer to the destructive ends.

I know people are gonna say “oh I know guys who are bald and do well with girls” or something like that but those guys are clearly the exception, not the rule. Not everyone looks good bald. Some guys are pale and have weird shaped heads like me and it just sucks. I’ve tried the hair loss meds but they cause a lot of sides. Finasteride is really good at preventing hair loss but it definitely causes major sides, especially sexual sides.

Every day I have to watch more and more hair fall out and feel less and less attractive. And maybe if I was in my 40s or even 30s I wouldn’t care but I’m in my 20s. I know women care. I can’t even use old pictures of myself cause I look so shitty now.

Mine has nothing special about it. It’s pretty plain and there are plenty of prettier houses around. The only person who lived here before is a elderly lady who passed away.

How and you get the perk of still being the laughing stock and a disappointment to everybody that knows you.

Maybe you can manage some higher education ? Are you ready to enter a world of elitist and self centered aholes. I hope you're brain is working properly and you are willing to sacrifice it because that' what you're gonna do. Maybe you are an absolute maniac that can manage something that actually has a point.

I saw the car coming at me, I could have slowed down or gone into the next lane but I just wasn't in the mindset without my meds.

So I'm working from home staring at my email trying to let them know that it will be even longer before I can return to the office. I can't even begin to write this email because I feel like a failure. I'm scared that because I've been out of the office for so long they will be upset with me or something I don't even know what, but I'm always on edge about being fired. I feel awful and haven't been able to get out of bed on time or take care of myself as well. Idk maybe it's just taking me back to my last accident where I actually totaled my car and couldn't get a car for 6 years. I know this isn't my fault... any of it really but I can't shake feeling like a teen again and being scolded for being so stupid or inattentive or whatever they want to think.

I don't remember when I started taking medication. I don't know what it's for and I don't think it does anything other than make my insomnia worse.

These drugs they give people do not help them. They are lies. They are there to make you think it's helpful. But in reality they want you to keep taking it so they can make money off of you.

These sedatives merely hide the issue, rather than solving it.

What does it matter? It's like trying to hide the fact that your legs are broken. You want to ignore it by covering them up. But they are still broken.

I think the media is lying. I think society is lying. I think they're all connected as one. It's all a scheme or something. Not some Illuminati who ha whatnot. But something else.

I suppose I wonder, why did so many Germans do nothing about the Nazis? Why did they comply when they knew it was wrong?

I don't trust that. I don't trust people because of how easily they can be manipulated. We learn nothing. The old generations knew, the new generations didn't. History repeats itself. We can teach the new generations all we want but they won't understand. I come from the newer generation.

I don't understand my own generation. I feel weird. I feel above, yet below. The people around me are not trustworthy. Not just because of my probable paranoia, but also because they are imbeciles. They are so reckless that I am. I don't understand. They care not for their property nor their lives. What is wrong with them?

What is wrong with me? Why am I so different? I am the mentally ill one, yet somehow I am above them. That's not how it's supposed to work. I'm supposed to be below them. Not above them. I don't like that.

I am surrounded by idiots. The older ones are too intimidating. I don't trust anyone. I am a little scared. I am a little anxious.

I am very anxious. I don't even trust the people on this site. You'll probably tell me to see a doctor or take a bunch of drugs to suppress these emotions or feelings.

"I'm going to give context, so it's going to be a little longer. Sorry.

I'm 28 years old, I love photos and movies since I was 10 years old. I learned to edit videos at 12, I started creating videos at the same age. My first YouTube video was in 2006, and the idea of YouTube and exposing it to the world was amazing to me.

I went to film school where I learned to be a filmmaker, while taking all the Journalism classes (photojournalism).

Leaving college, I started working in the field of marketing, since my country doesn't give a damn about national artistic production and the only types of films are the same comedy scripts. I focused mainly on working with brands and companies, to be able to deal with less EGO (dealing with money is easier than with people's egos). I've been working in marketing ever since, and it's had its ups and downs.

But my dream has always been to work with cinema. I love to tell stories, I love to create, and I need to let my imagination go, otherwise I get very depressed.

So in 2018 I decided to move to Germany even though I had never left my country or even spoken another language IRL. I started working hard, doing 16 hours of work every day of the week. I saved enough money to move and I came to Germany in August/2019. I started working here and gently paved my way until covid happened.

Between 2020 and today, a lot has happened: an abusive/manipulative relationship that destroyed my self-image; 2 months in psychiatric hospital; I broke my elbow; ended my relationship; I lost my home;

Since last year things have been more stable. I have a new house, with my pets, I started dating my best friend. I started to find myself again. What I like to do, what I like to wear, what I like to create (things my last relationship took away from me).

And this year I felt it was time to get back to pursuing my dreams and passions in filmmaking.

&#x200B;

**And here we come to the point of this post:**

&#x200B;

I just can't do what I've dreamed of my whole life.

Not for lack of skill or knowledge, but for lack of social ability. I can mask enough to work full time, but I suck at networking.

Like, HORRIBLE HORRIBLE at networking with new people

&#x200B;

And that's 80% of what's needed.

&#x200B;

I reached the point of thinking it would be easier to become famous through the internet. And now I'm 72 days into posting regularly on Instagram and YouTube. Going out, filming, create, plan, posting. For a little recognition and a lot of frustration (algorithms, people hating for no reason, no reach, much shitter content blowing, etc).

You might say it's only 72 days. But for me it's much more than that. It's years. It's a change of continent.

I feel like I'm banging my head against the wall (metaphoric) every day because I can't do a simple networking task. And even doing photo-shoots is very difficult, because the need to interact with new people all the time, giving instructions and being friendly. When I try to do it, I feel so frozen, it's like forgetting everything I know. And this is so frustrating.  


I don't know what do to anymore, because I'm tired and frustrated. I can't go further. But at the same time I don't like to give up. Photo and film are part of myself, my personality, my hobby, my job, my passion. I'm overwhelmed by my feelings, by the situation, without being able to get out of this, to find my way out, and how to overcome. I overthink everything and spend hours and hours trying to find solutions. Meanwhile the only thing that I get is a lower life quality because the constant anxiety crises.

"I was diagnosed with paranoia years ago.  I had extreme episodes during that period, I couldn't even leave my room or use electronic devices.

 I was treated with doctors and therapy, nothing beyond that.  I have, or had at least five years without an episode after the end of my sessions, but it has returned.

 A few days ago, I noticed an opening in my window (which I had not paid attention to before), the curtains do not close completely, it was then that a million possibilities fell on me like a bucket of water;  That someone, one of my neighbors, had seen me in a vulnerable or intimate situation.

 Nowadays, it's easy to record mostly everything, and also everything becomes a ""meme"" quickly and I think this is one of my greatest fears, that people or someone with bad intentions use me as a source of ridicule and be bullied again.

 I feel like I'm falling back. I covered the windows again.  I'm terrified to look out on the balcony and I feel very alert.  Hearing laughter in the environment is my biggest trigger and also makes me feel bad to feel that is about me, because isn’t good be that self centered. 

 It makes me very sad because I don't know how to stop it, I'm not going through a good time financially, I have depression and the stress is added even more by this.  My partner knows that I suffered from this before we met and I worry about him even more, since I don't want to put this burden on him.

 This crisis was triggered most likely the same way as my first time.  But what makes it different from what happened a few years ago is that at that very moment I was able to affirm that I was right with my theory within the crisis and clearly, thanks to that I fell into a spiral.

 I'm not quite sure what to do as everything tends to escalate quickly... Any advice?

Thanks",5,paranoia
"It baffles me how people manage to say “I enjoy doing this thing so I do it”. I know I obviously don’t feel that because of depression, but I even see people with depression talking about how doing their hobbies helps. How do you motivate yourself to do things? 

I can’t even begin to make myself do the things I used to enjoy and haven’t done for years. They are still things I have an interest in and would like to do. I don’t know how to describe it, I just can’t. I just have no drive to even try. I’m 32 and have had a depression diagnosis for 21 years. The last year has been a real drop in being able to do things I used to enjoy though they’ve been had for 3-4 years overall.",2,depression
"I got recently diagnosed with ADHD (I’m 28) with a private psychiatrist and today he prescribed me Concerta. But during the appointment I couldn’t shake off the feeling that this private psychiatrist is a glorified drug dealer I am just a drug-seeker.

I haven’t even gone to the pharmacy yet and I am already thinking about how people will judge me, and that I don’t actually need the medication.

I know everything I just said is completely irrational, but oh boy gotta love it when your brain gets stuck in overthinking mode.

Has anyone here struggled with this?",3,adhd
"I started to had this issues since August of 2022, last year, and I’ve never had this problem in the past. I went to the doctor recently and they check on me and said I was fine with all their testing. They just said I needed to eat and stay hydrated and that I’m only anxious because of the pandemic which doesn’t make sense because this issue that I’m dealing with is recent..? I don’t have social problems but instead my issues is more physically. Whenever I go somewhere especially in more hotter climates, I tend to get heat exhaustions or the urge to vomit and having the feeling of fainting (I’ve never faint before).",4,anxiety

And also you could like tell how much you ''believe'' a certain paranoid thought, which also correlates to how much it bothers you abit?",5,paranoia
"Genuine question. I am at my wits end because I very honestly do not know why people dislike me so much, and I genuinely want to know what the problem is.

Every time I see my therapist I ask him this same exact question and he tells me nothing is wrong with me and I just need to meet new people. I have met plenty of people in my 26 years of life and I am still mostly alone, apart from the LOML, but even he left me for a year during my psychotic episode.

Why were the nurses in the psych hospital so vicious to me? Why do my cousins that I grew up with never text me back but hold it against me if I don’t reach out to them? Why do my boyfriend’s friends treat me like I’m invisible? Why did my only friends during my psychotic episode make fun of me behind my back and right in front of me? Why did my former therapist and my psychiatrist both abandon me in the middle of my psychotic depressive episode when I said I was going to kms? Why did exactly 0 of the 6 mental health professionals I saw over a year suggest treatment for psychosis? What did I do???

As far as I know I am friendly and polite. I do my best every day. 

Any insight is appreciated.",6,schizophrenia

"When I was a child my mom would tell me those stories abt murder cases/serial killers and I think it kinda traumatised me because I was really young and she did this for some years. It was to tell me to be careful but I think I am really TOO careful and I really want to change.
 Since I have ADHD I was wondering if there was a link too..

In middle school I used to go to school with a knife or a fork in my pocket (a fork because I knew carrying a knife could get me into troubles). I did it less often in HS and only sometimes now in uni, when I know I will come back late. This is not bcz I'm less scared but bcz I know how weird I would seem if people saw me with a knife of fork. I sleep with a knife next to my bed at night (again since at least middle school). 

I experience nightmares of being chased extremely often.. Usually I wake up when the person who is chasing me (to kill me) catch me (so I don't experience the killing/pain. It's like when they catch me I die so I'm waking up). Sometimes I know the face/backstory of those killers (which are made up) and sometimes I don't see them at all, I just know they're chasing me. When I turn back I know they're here and I die without seeing their faces. When I'm outside, especially at night, I always get paranoid about killers. Every person (more like every man even if I can get suspicious of women too but it's much more rare) becomes a potential serial killer to me and I hurry home. I can have very short hallucinations of people (mostly killers) because I'm scanning everywhere in alert mode. Those hallucinations are like 1 second long or less so it's not really serious. Specifically, my worst fear is someone/ a serial killer coming to kill me at night in my room. I can become very suspicious at night alone in my room for no reason. I imagine that someone is trying to break in into my room, or is on the roof of the building and will try to come through the window. It gets me in very unpleasant states where I feel almost dizzy, it's like the world suddenly seem so suspicious and scary. Like if my room completely changed, there is a filter that changes it and now every furniture becomes unfamiliar to me, my whole environment becomes threatening and I have this irrational fear that someone is going to come in at any moment to kill me so I can't sleep. 

More than death, I'm afraid of suffering, being tortured or raped. Sometimes I feel so bad I think I want to die already, kill myself because then Im sure I will never experience this and I will stop feeling so scared and anxious. Which makes no sense bcz it means that I'm so afraid of death that I want to die?? (I think the issue is that I'm afraid of someone else killing me, not dying).

 My problem is that I'm nurturing this irrational fear by watching true crime videos. I know I'm harming myself when I do this because I will feel so bad for days, weeks, months afterwards! But I just can't stop.. I always end up watching one again. I think that I watch it because I imagine the situation and it's like  a simulation, what to do if I'm in the same situation.

 Also I'm thinking ""I've been too relaxed lately, I need to remind myself how scary this world is, how there are crazy people"". It's almost like punishing myself for being to carefree/not being paranoid ""like I should"". And I guess those videos can also be oddly entertaining/thrilling and give me very strong feelings I cannot get in my every day life. I want to change but at the same time I don't want to because I feel like it would be a bad thing, that I will be killed and think ""you see? You shouldn't have stopped being cautious. Serves you right.""(more like paranoid..). I have this irrational feeling that one day a serial killer will try to kill me, as if it was my destiny..

 I'm writing this bcz my sister was scolding me saying that I should stop being paranoid abt this, that it will never happen.. because two days ago I read the biography of a very famous serial killer on Wikipedia and I felt very scared. This morning I woke up screaming ""nooo"" because I felt very strong pain in my nightmare and felt this pain while waking up. I went to the toilets to uuuh let it all go and my stomach hurted for 1 hour making weird noises. For the first time in my dream I actually experienced being killed with the killer stabbing me repeatedly in the stomach. It was just a man Shadow, all black and blurry, without a real appearance (like the anti spiral in Gurren Lagann). 

I also feel like this is preventing me from trusting men. I'm 21 almost 22 and never dated, never went on a date, never was close friend with any guy..it's like if deep inside I thought that they're all predators/aggressors/killers when I know rationally that it's false and unfair to think this way..I feel like I will end up alone..And I'm tired of those scary feelings which are almost like torture to me..My psychiatrist for ADHD was like "" it's very Freudian you should sleep with a guy"" when I told him abt my nightmares of being chased/killed and I was like????? If you cite Freud seriously I'm never taking you seriously. I'm afraid that seeing a psy wouldn't change anything' my sister says I should try hypnosis..Do you have any ideas what to do? Sorry I wrote a whole book...I didn't realise si was that crazy until writing all this lol (sorry for my English it's not my 1st language). Props to you if you read the whole thing.",5,paranoia
"I really like reading non-fictional books like Sapiens, Homo Deus and other scientific and philosophical books but it always remains inside of my head that what if I forget some really important ideas or something about what I""m reading also by creating notes I can recall whatever I had read.

And Because of always care about creating notes of what I'm reading, I'm just not being able to read, and because of this perfectionist nature of mine, my notes are too long and take time. I think this is not the correct approach to reading that's why I'm asking here, since I'm not that experienced with reading.

What should be the approach to reading and what about creating notes?

I am recently diagnosed and now I feel like everything I ever had issues with were symptoms and now I have an answer. Now that I have done the research and gathered the info on my own diagnosis it is undeniable that my son also is adhd. He was just fired because he is late a lot. Understandable. But it’s what his boss told him that is bothering me. They said his life is chaotic and it’s effecting the business and he is not mature enough to work there since he comes in late all the time.  All because of lateness. Not an hour or 30 minutes or half the day. A couple of minutes. Never more than 10.  He’s gotten recognition and awards because of the effort he puts in on the job but because of the lateness he lost his job. Part of it is my fault because I am his ride. But what is really bothering me is I was there. My adhd makes me late constantly. He is not immature. He’s an 18 yr old with ADHD. Undiagnosed untreated ADHD. I had no idea until this year that I myself had it and now I see it in him. My “ could you imagine what you could have done had you been diagnosed and treated from the beginning “ is his life rn.  He’s 18 and I’ve made him appointments for therapy to try to get him treated but he forgets and doesn’t go.

"I am struggling to communicate ADHD to my partner

I’ve been struggling with this for a while now but it doesn’t seem like I can do anything at the right quality or speed to help. My gf and I have been together for 5 years and recently moved in together last year. Over the last year my gf and I have had what I consider to be pretty normal disagreements about cleanliness and chores divided. She has much higher standards than I do which I have tried to meet but we have an argument once a month where she says she feels like I’m ignoring chores until she just has to do them. 

Yesterday we talked again and she said that she expected me to improve more than I have in the last year. I keep telling her I will try to change my system to help me achieve what I need to but she told me not to try but to just do it. I feel like all I have every been able to do is try. I feel like I have been taking on half and have been getting better at cleaning to her requirements. (for example: we split dinner prep and cleaning and a year ago I didn’t consider wiping down all the counters and table part of cleaning up after dinner but I do now) I can definitely get the tunnel vision. She has insisted that she doesn’t want to nag me and I don’t want to make extra work for her by her nagging me but I’m struggling to meet this expectation. 

I have tried a few systems to try to clean different parts of the house on a schedule but it doesn’t always work for me because sometimes I run out of time after work or I’m so tired I get distracted in the middle of the chore and it doesn’t get done. She always tells me I should just listen and not make her repeat herself. 

I struggle to communicate that I have been trying. I asked her last night if there was a way that going forward we could discuss these issues positively when I’m obviously trying but not hitting the mark. For example if I sweep but forget to get under the couch, she could say “I appreciate you sweeping but I noticed that you might have forgotten about under the couch.” She said this creates more work for her and she doesn’t want that. I’m struggling to find a system that will work for us and not make me feel like I’m failing until I achieve perfection. 

We have a dog that causes some dirt/dander and I bought a Roomba to compensate but she won’t let me automate the Roomba routine because she works from home and it constantly goes off in the mornings during her meeting when I leave for work. (Trigger based on when I leave the house) I think I struggle a lot with this topic also because I want to move forward with this person in my relationship and I feel that if we were to have kids and the kids were to struggle with adhd the same ways that I do she would be really mean about it. I love my parter but I just feel so stupid for not being able to communicate the difficulties that I have had for the last 2 decades to them.",3,adhd

"Content warning: Mentions VERY sensitive topics like sexual tendencies. Read full story before commenting.

I've always been a pretty anxious person, however, anxiety has started being a bigger problem when I joined university for the first time in 2020. However, life was somewhat good I gotta say, I was on a relationship with someone I liked for a long time (long distance relationship, not relevant in this topic) and I had just joined a SFW roleplay server (not gonna mention which game or name of the server) which I really liked and had made a couple of really good friends on.

But, in 2021, things started to change.
First noticeable thing that happened, is that I joined a very toxic friend group from that same server which also was a bit influential on me. This group was affecting my mental health because of how abusive they were... however, i tried to forget about so, since i liked roleplaying with them. Besides this, I have to mention that this group had tendencies to be very sexual, something that I definitely was NOT at the time - I had barely turned 18.

Second, my relationship ended for a really shitty reason. My ex started ignoring me for days, weeks... eventually I noticed it wasn't working so... I broke it off. Loneliness started to hit, and because of this friend group, and also my natural growth as a human being, so were my sexual tendencies. 

Third, I was on a university course I was not sure I wanted to be in. I had chosen Architecture because I've always seen people choosing hobbies as their jobs and deeply regretting it... so I tried choosing something different... it clearly didn't work.

Well, things weren't going great for me in 2021... and especially after my break up.
I started hanging more with said toxic friend group since the roleplay helped me forget the bad aspects of my life... that also didn't help.
In this group, mainly with people that were 18 or older, there was a younger person (around the age of 15-16). This person was a really good friend of mine and we helped each other in hard times.

After a few months of being friends with said person, I shared my thoughts for the other people in the friend group, saying i didn't think they were good influences and that they'd be better off not talking as much to them.

For some reason, they decided to share this with the other people in the group, and those people said the things I said were very 'groomer-like' and that I was backstabbing them. Sure, I admit to the backstabbing part but... grooming? When? How? What?
On a Monday morning after 3 hours of sleep I get a text from one of those toxic friends saying 'we need to have a talk'.
They added me to a GC on discord where we went through the whole thing and they basically convinced me that I was a groomer.

I felt destroyed. Was I really that bad?
I shared all the screenshots with my real friends, and none of them felt like I had done such thing. They were essentially guilt tripping me.

A few days after this drama happened I was banned from the server... the admins thought I had done actual grooming so I got permanently banned.

This... is when things started getting worse.

As a way to escape the server, I started burying myself in NSFW discord servers, trying desperately to find a way to get some 'fun'... you get what I mean.
Eventually, I started messaging my ex as well, deciding to give her another chance, thinking I had thought of her the wrong way.

Why? You must ask.
Well, she was going through exam season when we broke up. And basically even though I understood all her dedication to studying and everything, she never took 1 minute of her day to message me 'good morning' or anything at all... but maybe I was just too harsh.

Eventually, we broke up again. Because, she was having trust issues with me apparently? Complicated case, so I won't get too much into it.

After breaking up I started burying myself in NSFW servers again. I had some friend that found out about this that got really mad at me because she caught feelings for me...

After all this, I thought it was time to move on from those discord servers and appeal for my ban on the server. I did so, and it got accepted.

Fresh start, I thought.

And indeed it was... I mean not everything was perfect, but i felt a little better.

I got on another relationship with a girl I met on there but it lasted for about... 2 weeks? Essentially she said she had some problems with her ex that she had to take care of and said she needed a break. Obviously as any decent human being, I understood, so I let her go.

After 4 weeks of the break, I found out she was dating someone else. She implied she still liked me but the dude asked her for a chance so she decided to give him one.

Whatever... kinda forgot about her for a while.

During that time, I had finally quit Architecture and decided to work on a local factory - around May / June 2022 (19 y/o) - while I didnt into another course I could finally save some money.

Said girl has been on and off with me ever since... we had a stupid fight during that same summer and stopped talking for a few months, but eventually started talking to each other again. She said she still had interest in me however... at that time I was talking with someone else already.

I know I have a problem.... at least with her. I know I'm being manipulated or something but... how can I not know she's not being fake?

Either way... the other person I was talking with was 2 years and 6 months younger then me (I was 20 and they were 17, almost 18 - this will come in handy later in the story). Eventually we started talking and they said they weren't resdy for a relationship which I totally understood at the time. Relationships are hard.

However, we both had already confessed to each other, and, since I had someone going around on the server saying shit about me and other people (basically any adult dating anyone under 18 - no matter the age gap - gets banned) I thought it would be best to let them know we should probably keep things a secret for a bit at least until they turned 18 or things calmed down in the server.

I was on a good spot on the server... i was part of the Event Team of said server and was an active member overall. However, as you may have guessed, things didn't end so well.

After a while, me and said person had a fight. They were thirsty for attention and I couldn't give them it since I was busy with university and other things of the server (by this time I had already joined Computer Engineering at my local Uni) so they got mad at me. Eventually, I blocked them since I had enough of their stupid comments...

So, essentially what happened was I got banned, again, for the same reason. Do you guys think I groomed them? I mean I never once forced them on a relationship... we just genuinely liked each other but they used this as an opportunity to get me banned.

Since then I started burying myself in NSFW servers again. Apparently a lot of people are spreading shit about me on the server... and even though I still have a lot of friends on there, I've pretty much lost contact with them since I was banned almost 2 months ago.

Besides this, a lot of my game accounts were hacked so I lost a lot of shit...

The other girl that also supposedly still liked me basically doesnt give a shit anymore and I also have no one, and I mean almost no one to talk to on a daily basis so I just feel lonely but can't help but question if there's something wrong with me... i feel anxious everyday and I cant help it since I have no real place to make friends anymore... I am 20 and I feel hopeless, whether we're talking relationships or friendships in general...

Give me your thoughts if you have reached this far.

Edit: forgot to mention. The first person that i supposedly 'groomed' eventually came out to me saying sorry that I shouldn't have gotten banned for that reason since I didnt actually do anything like so .",4,anxiety

"Hello.. It’s my first time using this app to ask for advice because I seriously do not know what to do. I’m a sister (20) who has a little sister (16). My little sister is diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder and was doing therapy session and taking antidepressants. She was doing so well for 2 months after she decided to stop her medication. She stopped it without consulting her therapist. I didn’t realise this until she started withdrawing heavily from it.
She is currently feeling really sad and having mood swings. The thing that triggers her withdrawal symptoms is her being at school.

These past few weeks, she had a difficulty waking up to go to school and my mother gets mad at this. She wouldn’t wake up when my mom is trying to wake her up. She would groan and doesn’t get up. My mom (58) gets pissed because she cares about my sister’s education and feels like she would fail as a mother if she doesn’t have her daughter continue school.
My mother is also diagnosed with depression but takes her medication
however, I don’t think she understands what my sister is going through and can say things that I’m sure she doesn’t mean to.

I’m honestly really scared on what my sister is going to do.

She used to self-harm too but now she is doing it again..
she is also having suicidal thoughts and I’m worried she might take action.

What can I do to make her feel better but still proceed to going to school 
I know that it’s best for someone who has depression and having withdrawals to stay at home and heal better
but it is also an issue if she falls behind in her classes 
The school doesn’t seem to care either about it. I live in the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and mental health is not cared about in high school.
So I genuinely do not know what to do.

The plan so far is that she is booked again to see her therapist but it is next week and idk what i should at the moment.

I work as a ERP consultant/specialist, for just about 8 years now and i hate pretty much everything about it, the thing is i live in a country where that salary covers all my basic needs and if i were to leave i am not sure i could get a more engaging job with a good enough salary, considering i could not study in any university and dont have a degree, (i started at that company just answering phones and making coffee until eventually i learned everything i needed to become a consultant and my boss just started giving me clients). It is a very hard job for me as i need to be very organized and spend hours on repetitive, dull tasks for days/weeks.

I was diagnosed with adhd about a year and a half ago, and since then ive been trying different dosages for my meds, with these meds i have been doing great at work it is just so easy to do things, to sit down and draft a project requirements to send to programmers, or analyzing data, creating reports in SQL, etc, things that could take me weeks to finish just because i could not get started or just left them half finished.

The problem is with my personal life, especially with my girlfriend, we've been together for about 6 years now, but a couple of weeks ago she told me that she would like to take a break as she felt i am not into her as i once was, i am not intimate, fun or as obsessed with her as i was and she felt pushed aside. It is absolutely true, i could feel that I lost that part of myself with the medication, i became more objective focused, less fun, just more robotic in a bunch of ways, no more impulsive hugs, or ""fun time"" in the middle of the day, at night when meds wear off i am just tired and my mind is all muddled up and i cant get existed to do anyhing, i just want to watch something on tv and sleep.


Did anyone experience something like this? I dont know what to do. With the meds, i do great at work and dont hate it as much, but my personal life is falling apart, i just can't win.",3,adhd
"I try to distance myself from everything i consider creepy, for example shadow people I see. But some motherfucker just sent me an image with some weird humanoid creature and something about a tall entity behind me. As you could judge from my previous posts I am not really sane. And now I know that there’s a big black entity behind me. I’m paranoid that it will kill me. I never believed this type of shit, but it hit different this time.

"I’ve suffered from depression most of my life, but growing there was at least always some piece of future optimism I could hold onto. Moments of clarity and ambition.

In the 90s and early 2000s the world seemed optimistic too. Yea it wasn’t perfect, but as a whole society didn’t seem as bleak. Almost like everyone was moving in the same direction. People of different political parties could at least get along somewhat, politicians at least pretended to not be psychopaths…conspiracy theories were seen as fringe. People could genuinely get excited about new technologies. 

I’m in my early 30s now, I have a wife, a good paying job….but Im having a harder and harder time finding any positivity to hold onto anymore.

My many metrics were living in the safest and most prosperous time in human history. The average person has more personal convenience  and luxury than ever before. Wars are less frequent, access to information is universals Al.

But everything feels somehow much darker and bleaker. Social media is dystopian. Political division and corruption feels dystopian. Things like AI advances feel dystopian, sucking up all ambition among artists to be creative. Society almost seems poisoned by disinformation…nobody trusts anybody or any news. Everybody is selfish, and we’re destroying everything on the planet. 

Even things I loved like traveling the world feels ruined by commercialization and homogenization

"So I've always kind of had a fear of the dark as a kid. I think everybody has at some point? Maybe not? I'm not so sure.

But recently, within the last 6months, I've been completely and utterly terrified of the dark.

When I get home from work past midnight, I triple check outside my car, just to make sure nothing is waiting for me to get out.  When I'm home and it's also past midnight, and when my roommate is already asleep, I can barely leave my room to go to the bathroom because the whole house is completely dark. I feel so immensely paranoid that someone has broken in and is waiting to kill me. 

We DO have an alarm system, so I try to remind myself that nothing will happen if it doesn't go off. That it's completely safe because I'm guarded by this very expensive system. And my very kind roommate recently got night lights in the kitchen, living room, office, and even the bathrooms so I don't feel so scared. 

But even then, I still feel like it's not enough. Someone or something is actively tryna to get me. Sometimes I hear shit around the house, like a rustle or someone outside talking and I get so frightened I start triple checking if everything is locked and the system is on. 

I get so paranoid from the dark that I keep my closet closed and my windows covered up completely with tapestries. I lock my bedroom door, and keep the lights on in my bedroom while I sleep. I actually got curtains for my bathroom window (even though it's painted glass and you can barely see anything out of it) and keep it shut at all times. I cannot even stand the idea of having my completely dark with just a tiny night light. Like I need to be able to see every corner of my room. Sometimes when I'm EXTRA paranoid, I keep my laptop at a low volume so i don't hear anything else but a video playing or something. 

I even got a big ol dog to keep me company at night when I feel so paranoid.

It's starting to really affect me. I cannot do anything at night without feeling like someone or something is watching me. I can't even imagine going to late night parties. It mortifies me to say the least. I just CANT do it.

I hope someone can relate to this. Please tell me I'm not going crazy for having this extreme fear/paranoia of the dark.",5,paranoia
"I've got 2 exams for my mortgage and protections qualifications tomorrow and Friday. This is the final hurdle to get qualified and be positioned to start working with my dad to take over his business. 


My dad is terminally ill at 60, and when his cancer returned he asked me if I'd train to take on his business that he has built up over years and years. It was just his brother and himself working there but my uncle retired last year so he is solo and doesn't want it to go to waste once he has to step down. So I took it on and pivoted from my own pursuit of growing my fledgling gardening business to a sudden halt and change of direction to do this both for his legacy and my future prospects. I've studied for months and gained the first part of qualifications with this being the final 2/3rds of it to be able to work in the business. I've come back to the UK after being in Ireland with my wife (we moved there when her own father was terminal to support her mum etc), so I'm here in Scotland for my last few weeks revision and exams. 

Since arriving I've mentally and physically dive-bombed and spiralled. I've not been capable of studying properly or consistently as I planned, I've let my nutrition slip greatly and lost lots of weight that I can't afford to, my insomnia is amplified and colluding with my anxiety, stress and low moods to the point where I'm barely functioning. I've had 2 nights in the last week that I've not slept until about 9am and I am feeling so utterly lost and overwhelmed with the pressure of getting past this exam and all it represents. I'm racing against time against my dad's cancer and I simply have to get this done and begin the transition ASAP before his health fails to the point that he cannot work at all and be there to supervise me as is part of the necessary process to be allowed to run the business (I need 6months supervision once qualified to be eligible to run solo). So there is a very meaningful and powerful rationale for being motivated to study and pass these exams, yet I've failed miserably at giving myself a good chance at doing so. 


I've slipped massively into a bad mental space, I'm not doing anything right for myself, both body and mind, and I'm on a collision course with failure. I've spent much of the last 2 weeks here in bed, avoiding life, my studies and feeling entirely consumed with anxiety and depression. I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen yet it has. I'm away from my wife and pillar of support and main source of external regulation. She believes in me and says I'm dojng great and she's proud of me etc but I feel so much guilt and shame when she does because I know I've fallen so far and am letting everyone down. I tell her that I'm not managing to study and when I do rally to open the books that I cant force myself to stick to it for long before I get saturated and feel like nothing is being learned. I turn a page and don't know what I've just read when I reflect on it. My memory and recall is shot, and I know why and that not only am I not helping myself by practicing self care, drinking water, sleeping well, eating regularly and well, exercising, going outside to get done sun and air etc, but I'm also making it much harder through the neglect of myself and health. The sleep has been a nightmare and constant battle. I'm using melatonin, started to try 5htp this week, and nothing I do can override the presets of my nocturnal mind. I'm so very fucked and really don't know what I'm going to do if I can't find a path back to balance and break above the darkness I'm being shrouded by. 

Thanks. Just needed to vent and get this out my head to alleviate some of the obsession of thoughts since they're just building inside my head all the time.",3,adhd
" 

We  have a friend that always asks questions but never talks about himself.  He is 40 years old. Once I met him after job he asked me: did you go  somewhere in Saturday night? I replied that I went to some coffee shop.  Then he asked me 2 more times if I went to other places. Then he asked  me same questions for Friday. I was at 3 places.  I replied where I was.  Then he asked me if there was some band playing at place 2. I figured  out that he was checking if I am saying truth and I said yes. I figured  out that he will ask me more questions about my life and I decided to  play that game. He asked me if I go to coffee shop on working days, what  do I do at home, what do I do on computer, do I play games on phone.  Later he asked me what is happening on Facebook , how many Facebook  friends do I have, when do I wake up, when do I go to bed. Do I always  go to bed early? Did I ever go to bed at 3 am? Do I always go to beach  at 4PM. Once I told him that it is not good to go to beach before 4PM  because of UV radiation. Where do I go for the walk. Do I go outside at  same time. We know each other in real life. He asked me on chat: were  you outside, where you were, did I met somebody?  ( probably to ask that  person if they met me, to see if I am telling truth. ) I asked him same  questions to test him and he skipped them all. On question he asks new  question, he does not answer. he also asked me if I was drinking, how much, did I vomit  after drinking, do my cats pee on walls. etc. Once he was traveling in  other country and he spent 1 month there. he told nobody that he will  travel there. He spent one month there and he never told what happened  there. I asked him 3-4 questions and he gave me most boring answers.

He  does this to other people too. After he asks you many question, then he  talks about windows 7, Firefox, smart TV and other easy to understand  things about technology, but never about himself.

He  behaves like he is programmed. He walks same streets every day, He goes  outside at same time and goes back to home at same time. He goes to one  of 3 coffee shops every day. he stays at home every Sunday.

I decided to find excuses when he sends me messages, because it is weird. I do not go outside with him anymore. Am I paranoid? Am I bad person because I avoid him?",5,paranoia
"hey, 17m, just want to get some things off my chest. advice is appreciated but not required - even a comment to say you understand is enough.

 ive been depressed for years but rn i feel overwhlemed. im in my final year of school and i have exams in the next months. i'm not very worried about my grades because i can do well, but the homework and study i am required to do is exhausting.

 i have no plans for my future because A) the only hobbies i have is art, english and poetry & B) I haven't sat down with my parents and asked for their help. Every time over the last year i've asked my mother for advice on what to do next year she hasn't given me anything. And any time there was a college/uni open day, or anything, she wouldn't go with me. I feel like my parents don't care about my future. and it's painful because i see my friends and their parents give them guidance on where to go in life, and they are supportive of them and boost their ambition, but with me when i say i want to do a course in english or something my mother doesn't approve because it doesnt give me a qualification. 

my dad is a drunk. he came home an hour ago after using going to church as an excuse for drinking. i would rather my mother just left him and everyone would be happier. he's also depressed but he doesn't talk about it to anyone, and i'm not very close to him either.

i have 2 sisters and 1 brother. my brother is nice but hes small minded. my sister is nice, but only when she wants to be ( when something upsets her she snaps). my other sister (in her 20's)  bullies me constantly. when i used to complain about her fighting with my mother she called me a baby and told be to get a grip. i try not to talk to my other sister if i can because she makes me uncomfortable but she always starts fighting with me over nothing.

also, i haven't gone to a professional barber in about a year. i started cutting my hair myself because my social anxiety got bad, and i didnt feel safe in a men's barbers as a queer man. this has become a constant topic for my famliy to get angry with me about. my mother tells me my hair looks awful and shouts at me to get it cut. it makes me feel bad. my sister also bullies me about this and makes me feel like i'm worth nothing.

i want to either go to college or emigrate the country and live in another european country, but both options would be expensive and i may not be allowed to leave the country by my parents.

i live in a very expensive country in europe and i want to move away from my dysfunctional family but i'm afraid that i won't be able to afford to live independently . also my country is depressing - there is a housing crisis, which means even if i do find somewhere to rend it will be thousands a month. in the cities, there is antisocial behaviour and hate crimes that happen to people daily. our capital city is dirty and is full of teenagers that attack others. this makes me scared for the future.

to be honest i don't even feel like a regular person anymore. i'm not able to do simple tasks that all of my friends are able to do, like keeping a job or socialising. this also worries me, like i'm some kind of freak and im stagnant developmentally.

I feel like sometimes I get overly emotional about some stuff. Like usually I feel indifferent but then something upsets me and I feel like I’m going to have a tantrum. But I also know i shouldn’t be *this* upset about it but I still am. 

For example just now, I showed my mom a drawing I did. She says it looks nice but asked about a part of it, and I said well I was trying to make it in a similar style of a show I watch, and showed her the reference. 

This caused her to believe I ‘copied’ the drawing (Doesn’t help they had a similar hair color and style) and she says ‘so you copied that drawing’ 

this made me irrational angry and upset, I almost want to cry. 

I hate that she always says and assumes I trace and copy my drawings. I hate my drawings being reduced to just ‘a copy’. I worked so hard on it and I feel like it doesn’t matter now because she claims I copied the drawing. 

And I know it’s dumb to be this upset but I am and I wish I wasn’t.  I can’t think about anything else other than this now.",1,autism
"As a father, I lose a job, stay home for almost 3 months. I regret losing my job, start to struggle mentally.  But I am a father.

I feel alone, unloved, not wanted, and most of all my son, my best friend... never tells me how his day is going anymore. We used to have conversations like this but now it is all silence.  I pick him up from work, he doesn't say anything.  We get home, he hides in the basement.  WHAT AM I DOING WRONG!

I love him, sooo much... if I cause so much pain when I'm here or when I am gone. Why am I here when I should be gone. Selfishness is based on not allowing others to help, well, there is no one else.  So when I die, I'm not selfish.",2,depression

"Dear schizophrenics, 

I want to warn you about flat earth. I didn’t really study this stuff much when I was young, and got stuck in it for a year or 2, and had to study my way out of it… I was a slow/lazy researcher, and kept letting it get hold of me, and it would make me delusional.

Please don’t get caught in flat or hollow earth.

Do your best to study.

This stuff can really mess with your mind until you grow enough to understand it. Don’t become delusional with it.

Eratosthenes experiment isn’t the same on a flat earth… don’t let people confuse you about it. Think about what a shadow would look like on a stick at the North Pole, with the sun hitting it from the side, with parallel rays (not mentioning tilt). Hollow earth would have inward pointing shadows due to an opposite curve. Sticks in the ground with shadows really can prove a lot.

South celestial pole is not possible on flat earth.

Moon and sun somehow magically float on flat earth and hollow earth.

The North Star disappears once you go south far enough.

Clocks speed up, and gravity is less at higher altitudes.

Meteors somehow make it through the flat earth dome.

The flat earth excuse for seasons is the sun moving further out on the flat earth map, but that would technically mean a longer day due to the sun doing a bigger circle. And doesn’t explain the analemma properly, and in Australia in summer, the sun actually appears to curve south during sunset, due to the angle and tilt…  

Personally, I still think the moon and mars stuff is dodgy looking… but they aren’t 100% messing with us about the shape of earth… their camera angles do suck tho…

Don’t let yourself start thinking science is stupid, like I basically was… keep trying!",6,schizophrenia
"I have ADD (now ADHD-pi?) related to Neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic disorder known to cause ADHD. 

I've opened and closed and put off this post for the past few days but I've decided I'll sit down and write what I can. I have ADD, I was diagnosed at around 7 years old. Never really thought TOO much about my ADD other than it being the reason I'm a bit unattentive. To be honest, I got this far in my post and already tabbed out.

One major and unique? thing right now is I'm dealing with major memory problems. I thought I had dementia at one point.

But, despite this I was still able to focus on things I enjoyed. At the age of 16 when I left school I spent like 12 hours a day on a video game for over a year. Same game I played after school every day in my adulthood. Whilst I'm not particularly proud of this, it showed that at times I could sorta focus on stuff I was interested in.

17-18, yeah, went to college, could still game and watch TV shows, follow the story of a game. Play pretty advanced games too. To 18-20/1 I was pretty active in an online community for like two years and even when I struggled with memory, I was there.

Let's jump past covid because it wasn't that bad of a time for me personally. In the past year or so, my attention, memory and focus has taken a major hit. Conversations are hard, focusing on anything is so hard. I can't enjoy video games like I used too, I feel like a broken shell of a person. Relationship with friends has taken a hit, my social presence has taken a hit.

Looking through problems associated with ADHD for me is basically like a checklist.

I'm unable to engage with friends, don't think I'm depressed, just feel lost.

Want to restart meds, don't know why but when I was first prescribed ritalin when I was around 7-8, I wanted to stop taking it. Don't think I noticed much change at the time, not sure. Didn't like it maybe. In hindsight, I think maybe it was not strong enough? and the routine of taking it bothered me.

Since my first job, I’ve seen myself develop a pattern where I’ll be able to perform well for a few months and then gradually, as time passes by, my mental/emotional/physical stability begin to erode until I can barely function anymore.

"Hi /r/paranoia,

Lately my stress and paranoia have been spiraling out of control. A few months ago, a paranoid thought popped into my head, and I cannot get over it. No matter how much I try to reason away the thought, it doesn't change the fact that it affects my mood and self-image. This thought is also about a touchy subject which makes me feel ashamed to admit to it.

I woke up one morning, and I had the thought that someone had molested me in my sleep. 

I couldn't remember whether the doors had been locked the previous night, and I couldn't check in the morning, because my roommate (who wakes up before me) would have locked the door after leaving for work. I don't suspect my roommate did anything to me. I'm instead worried that somebody broke into my house at night, and had their way with me while I was sleeping.

I know that if I was actually molested, then I most likely would have woken up during the act. I didn't feel like I was drugged. I also know that the odds that my roommate and I both forgot to lock the doors is very low. I'm also sure that my dog would have barked at any strangers coming in, and that would have woken me up.

Despite the rational side of my brain telling me that nothing probably happened, this thought continues to eat away at me. It's because I can never be 100% certain what happened. There's no way to definitively prove this thought to be false. 

I haven't told anybody about this, not even my therapist. I'm embarrassed by this thought, especially since there are so many people who have gone through real sexual trauma in their lives. It feels like my delusions are spitting in the face of those who have been legitimately molested and assaulted. I'm worried that I'll never be able to have a healthy sexual relationship again. I just feel so violated.

Does anybody have any advice for overcoming thoughts that can't be proven false?

&#x200B;

TLDR: I had a paranoid thought about something that happened, and I can't prove that it didn't happen. Any advice on overcoming this thought?",5,paranoia

"Another astounding space sci-fi thriller by Weir. Surprising that this hasn’t been made into a movie because this is what an action/comedy/thriller space sci-fi needs. This book keeps you hooked for the most part. Why most parts? Well because some parts are just Jasmine “Jazz” Bashara the protagonist prolonging a normal convo. It’s not bad though just my opinion. Really liked how Weir portrays her; a woman who is happy go lucky and doesn’t give a fuck about almost anything and also funny.

This book does contain many space/moon tech technicalities which you have to reread to grasp it. Like “The Martian” (another must read by Weir) this books deals with the cruciality of time. I think this book’s climax could be made into like an Ocean’s Eleven kind of movie replacing the casino scenes with >!Jazz and her team trying to destroy the Sanchez Aluminum.!<

"Hello all,

I hope all’s well. As for me, not so much. 

Earlier this morning as I was went to the grocery store buying some food to last me for a bit, I’ve noticed that strangers keep on looking at me and talking bad about me like a rabid dog. I felt so uncomfortable that I quickly and angrily paid for my items and left. 

Later on in the day, I was making a food delivery for a customer. As soon as I was dropping her food off at her apartment door, I heard her in there saying “OMG, it’s the DoorDash driver dropping off my food. Yeah, it’s her. The one in the paper girl. I don’t know why she’s doing DoorDash because she’s about to get arrested and they’re going to execute her ass!” I swore I heard this word for word. 

Onto the next delivery, I had to go into the store and shop for a customer. As I got out of my car, I saw a boyfriend/girlfriend couple approaching their car that was parked next to mine. The girl rolled her eyes and she whispered to her boyfriend. The boyfriend says “I’m so glad they caught her ass!” Then when I got into the store, I heard a few workers in there saying “Bye!” “Bye! You’re about to leave!” As I was getting the items for the customer, I heard other customers shopping saying “She might go to Texas and get the death penalty and I hope she does!

"So I’m in the psych ward now, I stopped clozapine cold turkey and felt so shit I ended up coming here. Basically it’s been a month and my positive symptoms haven’t come back. The doctors who’ve known me 2 weeks are basically saying I’m just depressed and never was schizo. I know diagnoses aren’t everything but it took me 6 months from when I was first hospitalised while psychotic (4years ago) til I was sane enough to accept I was schizo instead of just psychic and spiritually gifted. Since then it’s all made sense, I’ve had every symptom and I relate so much to every post on here. I just feel like it’s so not fair that doctors that didn’t know me when I was psychotic are telling me I never was . Like I went through hell while psychotic. They’re now refusing to give me meds bc they don’t know what I have , pretty sure they just think I’m depressed.

Question came to me by watching Lilo and Stitch again as an adult. As a kid it was a funny movie about a girl and her pet alien doing wacky hijinks in the face of her annoying older sister and funny aliens, and I remember it was okay.

Watching it again I realised it's a surprisingly heavy movie about a struggling older sister in poverty trying to keep her sister while not having the means to support her.

Also, I realised that the movie has no real villain and all the characters I percieved as ""evil"" as a child were just well meaning adults in a complex situation.


* Nani - was trying to parent a difficult child as a teenager after losing her parents
* The scary social services agent - was just looking to do what's best for Lilo. As a kid I though he was just cruel.
* The scary alien councilwoman - was just trying to capture what she thought was a dangerous terrorist

Closest thing to a villain this movie has are Jumba the scientist and Stitch himself.

"I just realized how bad my depression has gotten, and I’m not even sure that I care. My life has been long and tiring and sad. My mom died when I was 7. My first husband committed suicide when I was 26 (he was 27) on Christmas leaving me with 3 and 1 year old daughters. My second husband abused me, cheated on me, broke me into a million pieces. I eventually got the strength to leave him and start over, but it left me in a terribly financial place. I was laid off last year. I finally have a good job again but I feel like an imposter. 

I don’t think that my kids (now 21 and 19) need me anymore, or particularly want me around. I’m alone most days, with my cats. It’s lonely. 

Due to my layoff, I just had to file bankruptcy. Which, because I was trying to keep my house, meant filing Ch 13. Those payments will leave me with barely enough to pay my utilities. 

I cashed in my entire retirement between leaving the ex and being laid off. I’m flat broke. I will never be able to retire. (I’m in my mid 40s). 

In 3 years, my life insurance through work would pay out enough to leave my kids with a solid nest egg, and my youngest should be through college. I’m just not sure that I can make it that long. 

I’m not even sure why I’m posting. I usually get high when I feel like this, and I’m better for about a week. But then the numbing darkness comes back. I’m sober as a judge and will keep being so since I cannot afford weed anymore. I’m on meds for depression but I’m not sure that they even make a dent. Because if I feel this shitty on them, what would I be like OFF them? 

Thanks for reading. I guess that I just needed to get this out. I have a large family and I cannot talk to any of them about this because I don’t want to disappoint them.

"I decided to read this book blindly after seeing it mentioned in a self improvement type sub. I have not consumed any other material from or about David Goggins. This is an honest and unbiased review.

From the get-go I’m not fond of this books structuring which jumps erratically from point to point with no linear progression.

Three chapters and it’s just a sob story about his difficult upbringing. Nothing about this man’s life is happy so far. Then the crazy starts. Goggins goes off physical punishing himself through over exertion and food restriction. If a women wrote this book she’d be called out for promoting EDs.

Goggins is the definition of a loser so far.  
Failing high school, morbidly obese, in a dead marriage, failing the ASVAB, the “medical dismissal”. David seems to be achieving nothing. Getting himself another medical dismal, 30k in debt and getting his ex-wife pregnant.

The more I read the more insufferable David seems. Running an ultra marathon unprepared then burdening his wife with cleaning his piss & poop. Not once has this guy mentioned anything he’s achieved so far that wasn’t a completely selfish act. 
 
At about chapter 8 David seems to final gain some form of normality. And goes on tour doing charity events.

David is like the one person you know whenever you talk to them something bad has happened. He ends up having a cardiovascular emergency. Then the book skips that and start on more military stories.

David is starting to sound like his old hard ass BUD/S instructors, I guess you become what you hate.
Hoggin is unable to make Delta and fails a WR attempt.

The final chapter has some positivity.
David final breaks the WR and does some self reflection. This stood out to me:

“Hiding all my insecurities and trauma.
It was a lonely journey from there to here. I missed out on so much. I didn’t have a lot of fun. Happiness wasn’t my cocktail of choice. My brain had me on constant blast. I lived in fear and doubt, terrified of being a nobody and contributing nothing. I’d judged myself constantly and I’d judged everyone else around me, too.”

There’s an update on Trunnis Jr who seemingly had a normal white collar life.
Interestingly, there is no mention of David’s first born since the announcement of his ex-wife being pregnant. 

Takeaway:
In the end, I do not find David Goggins story aspirational or healthy. Goggins does not seem to conquer his demons. Goggins, like an addict, abused himself physically to the point he needed surgery and rehabilitation. Call me an angry liberal but Goggins also seemed to have misogynistic tendencies. When he was doing well he regarded himself as “macho” and “alpha” but in moments of failure he’d say stuff like he needed to “hem his vagina”. 
His fortitude may be applicable to achieve short term goals like passing an exam, losing weight, completing a project etc. But I don’t think the mindset depicted in this books is sustainable.",0,negative_samples

emotional downpour

High school junior here.  A false sexual accusation rumour about me spread to my only group of friends.  They all gave me the cold shoulder. Later I find that this girl had essentially assimilated into the friend group I was once in. WTF? The popular guy that she cosied up to as well is showing no restraint and blabbering the rumour to all his friends. 

About the accusation - something did happen but it was all consensual and very minor. However I have gotten into trouble for something similar but more severe, and I am worried that the school will side with the girl no matter what as a result, and that I could get expelled and my life simply ruined.

But I know that it's simply not sexual assault (not willing to share details unless via PM, if you really doubt that I am not an abuser). I've asked my scenario to friends and anonymous online users, making myself sound as horrible as I can with wording, from both perspectives, and yet without fail, every single time, they agree that I am not in the wrong, or at least, that the girl was overreacting. I did manage to win a few friendships from that group back, but things will never be the same :/

The group cut me off at the end of February. The incident happened in early October. She acted like nothing was wrong until the start of 2023. Why did she act like that, so strangely? I feel so betrayed...

Nothing has happened since then, but my loneliness and paranoia can't help but get the best of me - what if I get expelled? What if I never even get to graduate? What the hell is going to happen to me... I'm constantly anxious and jumpy on the inside. I swear, if I even had a semblance of a support group, I'd have gotten over this ages ago. But instead I'm still spreading negativity and have become my own ticking time bomb counting down to my next collapse of despair.

It feels so weird... why does she get to interact with so many of her friends as if nothing happened while I roam this school as a loner, without camaraderie? It's almost like the roles are reversed. As much as I hate it when people call themselves the ""victim""/partake in victim-blaming, I genuinely feel like I'm the victim here more than anyone else in this situation is. Surely I don't deserve whatever situation that has befallen me?

...and no this isn't simply me ""facing the consequences of my own actions."" Read above again. Please be kind and civil, I have already had enough negativity in my life.

------- -- - - hyphen hyphen HH -  -  -- ---- 


Now to get onto the title. The issue is that I've been so stressed by above ^^ that I'm almost incapable of making decisions for the long-term. I used to have many university plans and different programmes, internships, and research projects that I wanted to go for.

But now I can't even think of making it past junior year (we end in November). I can only plan for two weeks ahead at a time to keep myself from internally combusting, collapsing onto myself.

I get a sense of dread whenever people talk about school or exams or education things in general, despite my relatively high GPA in a prestigious high school. I feel like all that could be stripped away from me in a blinding flash, and I'd be reduced to less than mere nothing. I have so much to lose

This has been affecting me by rendering me unable to work on larger projects myself unless given strict deadlines. (Studying for exams, finishing homework assignments/projects, etc.) If it's for my compulsory graduation project that needs to be done before the end of 2023, then good luck to myself meeting the graduation requirements! I have simply lost motivation to work on anything unless motivated by external stressors...

Because, what's the point? These things don't have any meaning if I get expelled anyway. On the other hand, if I have strict upcoming deadlines, I know that it's relatively likely that I won't get expelled within that timeframe and will actually work hard on them, almost (80-90%) normal, back to my old efficiency, speed, and amount of work done.

I also can't make plans for the future at all. I hear my girlfriend talk about her plans for college, the coding projects and paid internships she's been taking up, and I can't help but feel inadequate to her. Everything good in my life is just me riding the old wave of my successes from a previous era in my life, a time when I was less depressed and pathetic. They're not even that much. It's just going for math competitions that I know I won't win, and chemistry competitions I know I  have much to learn.

I haven't done anything noteworthy this year, neither have I worked on anything due further than a few weeks away, nor having done anything optional but helpful for my future, like additional research projects and internships. I have no research projects, internships, or notable extracurriculars. And I can't even bring myself to gun for them. I'm probably going to graduate with the bare minimum if my outlook on my future is so bleak and hopeless. I don't want that to happen. But I still can't stop worrying about myself getting expelled, and all my effort now to be naught. It's irrational. I'm irrational.

I'm falling far, far, behind. Augh...

I haven't even made any additional plans for my second semester. All I planned for was to just do the bare minimum and get through school without any problems or breaking down. All the people around me are so ambitious, I used to be like them, but now I don't think I can. It's not like I couldn't even handle it. Thanks to this great fear of expulsion, I find it a terrible struggle to function anymore.

it's weird. like i have ambition but i don't have drive. yet i have a lot of pent up energy. it's so weird.

"So I met up with my friend who recently got told by their therapist that they probably have ADHD. She said when the therapist told her that, she felt so relieved and like she’d found it easier to accept who she was and the way her life has worked out. I’m really happy for her but when I said I was feeling overwhelmed at the moment because I had a lot on and my own ADHD assessment was coming up which was really playing on my mind, they countered me by saying “A diagnosis isn’t going to change who you are so why worry about that? Just accept you may have ADHD and use it to propel you forward.” I thought it was a nice sentiment but as the conversation continued I started to get the impression that they thought 1) medication wasn’t even something I should consider because it would change me and I was lovely (disregarding how depressed and anxious I currently feel. Almost like “I like you as you are so you don’t need to think or feel differently“) and 2) that they have managed to turn the idea that they may have ADHD into a positive in their life and I can too if I just learnt to. 

I just feel like now there’s a pressure on me. Like, why can’t I just be happy with who I am and use an idea of a diagnosis (rather than a diagnosis itself) to use the thought that I may have ADHD as a superpower? Why’s it so easy for them but I feel like I’m drowning? Have I got swept up in all that talk of ADHD being hard and something to manage when really if I just change my perspective of the issue it’s a gift?

"I get why this book was so contentious when it first came out now. 

Stylistically speaking, it has a lot of passages that read like a novel, not an autobiography. Like, nobody's remembering conversations where they were just shooting the breeze for a bit verbatim after thirty years. At other times, he's using the one-sentence paragraphs for extra impact, which tends to be more common in novels than in nonfiction. 

Of course, most of the controversy stems from how a lot of the details surrounding the court case have never been verified, despite the fact they should have been easily verifiable. A case where someone who used to be a guard at a juvenile detention centre gets murdered by two people who'd been detained there should have been big news; especially when he posthumously gets outed as a pedophile over the course of the trial. 

I feel like with a lot of the people who first started digging into it, what actually set them off was probably the writing style. So much of it just reads like a novel, and so much of Part III came off as something straight out of a revenge fantasy that it just seems a bit off. 

I really wanted to believe this story was true, too. Of course I think abuse happens in juvenile detention centres, and I think it's an issue that's probably massively underreported.

"Hi everyone! I just moved to Atlanta and am looking for a GI doc here. I've had UC since I was 19 (32 now). I don't care about the gender of the doc, mostly I just want a doc who won't prescribe that big nasty jug of awful prep juice (Golytely)! I've had 3 different types of prep: 

1. Mixing miralax powder with gatorade and taking miralax pills. This prep was my fave bc the powder was tasteless and I could easily keep it down. 
2. Suprep bowel prep: this one tasted nasty but it was a smaller amount so this was doable as well. Tasted like grape salty thick water :'( but I was able to keep it down. 
3. Golytely / (Golytely, Nulytely, Moviprep, Plenvu, Gavilyte) - the big massive jug that is the absolute nastiest thing to drink. I really could not keep this down as hard as I tried. 

I did have an appointment already with a doc at Emory but she said she'd only do the Golytely for prep even though I told her I couldn't keep it down last time. I'm wondering if anyone sees a doc near the Atlanta area who is open to other prep options? Thanks in advance!",0,negative_samples

"I’ve been on a BRAT diet for about 4 weeks. I’ve expanded a bit but the only thing I’m *safe* to eat is pasta, rice, potatoes, chicken, fish of any kind, eggs, toast strawberries, grapes, a small bit of zucchini and squash. Anything beyond that is Russian roulette. This diet helps but my symptoms are still there. 

I ate outside of that this week and I PAID for it. I had a work event and was served filet mignon & a burrata salad. I know,  shouldn’t have eaten it. I made it home and had bloody diarrhea for two days. 

Anyways…. I get a colonoscopy and endo 6/12 to officially diagnose something. Background; I have had “IBS” for years, occasional blood in stool, occasional mucus in stool, high CRP, high ERS, low vitamin D and most recently was put in the hospital with colitis. I’ve seen many docs about my stomach and I’ve thought for years I’ve had IBD of some sort. GI always blew me off saying it’s my celiac and IBS they never did scopes. 

Most recently, GI didn’t want to do the scopes immediately because of the inflammation in my colon so they’re making me wait 6 weeks although we’re thinking it’s probably crohns. In the meantime, I live off of Bentyl and Zofran. 

Once I’m on treatment, should I expect my diet to expand beyond what it is now or should I start getting used to eating like this? Any suggestions on what to try?

Edit: also no caffeine, dark sodas, dairy, fried foods, no red meat (learned my lesson), no leafy veggies. This is all per GI until my colonoscopy.",0,negative_samples
"Hello Reddit! It's been a while since I last posted something of significance.  A lot has changed, lately. I don't see the purpose in my life anymore. That sounds far fetched considering I'm a 23 y/o with a fiance, a decent paying job that isn't too strenuous, family that cares about me, etc. But it's true. I feel as though my life is a never ending groundhog day situation th at is inescapable unless I die. I would love to get help, but due to having no health insurance (it costs too much with rent and everything else piled up) I can't get the help I know I need. All I do is work, come home, clean, eat, sleep, repeat. There is nothing in my life that brings me joy anymore. One reason for this is bc I don't have a car. That should be an easy hurdle, but it's not. I feel trapped and miserable with nobody to talk to. I hate myself, and even when I know the feeling of wanting to die is temporary (for the most part) I just can't seem to see the ""bright side"" of any of it. I've never planned my inevitable end, but I've thought about how peaceful it must be to not exist. If you have no consciousness, then I'd have no need to feel in the first place. My life feels like this cruel joke, and it feels like I'm chasing my own tail every time I try to better my life. I want to give up, buy I know if I do I will just disappoint or frustrate anybody left in my life that gives a shit. And any time I try to talk about it with anybody I'm met with ""that's life"" or ""grown up shit"". Fuck. That. This is not part of ""being an adult"" this is dark and empty and there is no white light that guides me to a better future. I'm stuck.. and i don't know if I'll ever get out. The only solace I've found is that through Satanism and even the fulfilled heart I grasp at is fleeting once I put my book down.. and just a fair warning, i don't need the whole ""God has a plan and is waiting for you"" speech. I'm a Satanist by choice, because it's the only thing that brings me satisfaction when I'm at my lowest. I would get more involved, but nobody I know believes in the same stuff as me.

The biggest thing being thinking there's a camera in my room. I kept dismissing the thought. But it was so persistent. It just kept coming back. It was better for my mental health to leave, and live with people I knew I could trust, regardless of fault in this relationship. But I kept going back and forth. Thinking there really was a camera and the roommates really were saying the things I thought they were. And then telling myself that that's a delusion and I need to let it go for my own health. I've been out of the apartment since September but just finished grabbing the very last of my things today. I'm stressed. Sure, I bought a house and there's a lot of things on my mind including other things at work and family things. But as pressed as I've been I've been staying positive or atleast neutral. Today was a stressful day. A lot of things to do and my new roommate was mia for health reasons. Plus I had done a carpet patch and I was worried the roommates would complain about the quality since the color was not an exact match. So maybe it was that. All the stress and worry and anxiety. About finally saying goodbye to them. But then, as I went to finally leave. For the last time. I came up to my roomate sitting on the couch to say goodbye. And I swear. On her phone. She was watching my face. I didn't get a great look and I have trouble recognizing myself in videos and photos. But as I walked out the door. I swear I heard her start to say to her boyfriend ""she saw.."" This is why I have to leave. Real or not it's causing me severe mental distress.

I would say to them that often it will happen that I will forget something they would have said or some appointment, birthday or some chore but that doesn't mean that I don't not respect them or appreciate them and I apologise in advance.

When I met my now gf I told her exactly that, like ""Please don't be upset if I forget something you tell me or where we have been a year ago or what has happened at your mom's lunch or if I forget I have to do something, it's my brain, that doesn't mean that I don't appreciate you or care about you..""

"I don't know why it is-- if there is any kind of determinable ""explanation"" for it that isn't simply a culmination of the infinite variables in my genes/genetic expression and my environment-- but, in my late twenties/early thirties, I've gotten to a point at which my autism feels more pronounced.

Part of it, I'm sure, is confirmation bias due to the fact that I was only diagnosed relatively recently (within the last couple of years), but there are other things, too, including shifting tics that I've developed (I know I've historically had tics, but not noticed them too much as they weren't as intrusive, and also I was too young to understand how to characterize them) and, most of all, the subject of this topic:

Recently, I've noticed that, whenever I try to tell someone anything of any importance, I *start* saying the thing, then have to stop and be like, ""no, wait, I just thought of a bunch of other things and may need to go back and give you more context first,"" leading to me having these awkward pauses and feeling like I look very stupid and disorganized in my thoughts. 

Additionally, I've always had this tendency to say ""I don't know why, but I thought 'X' just now"", when I'm having a conversation with somebody, wherein 'X' is an apparent *non sequitur*, but recently I've been correcting myself to explain that, ""well, actually, I DO know why 'X,' but it was an extremely fast and complicated and stupid association-based process, so I'll explain""

Anyway, the point of this rant is simply to say that I find my thoughts racing SO MUCH these days, and I can't seem to keep up very well in my speech at this point in my life-- a time at which I want to appear more capable, particularly at my job and so forth-- and it is frustrating.",1,autism
"Throw away obviously.    


I've been struggling with my mental health since I could ever remember.  I had anger management issues in elementary school leading to me getting special treatment and very frequent meetings with the school councilor who taught me to ""control"" my emotions (repress them.)  This lead into middle school where they deemed that unnecessary, which happened to coincide with me getting frequent suspensions for my behavior.  This lead into high school where I got into frequent fights for the first two years, mostly due to being bullied. This was to the point where I was on a first name basis with the school resource officer and the social worker.    


That is the point where I learned I'm no longer allowed to be honest about my mental health with anyone for fear of repercussions.  I was honest one time and I was immediately threatened with being hospitalized.  This has stuck with me ever since, I've learned to repress my emotions and the only emotion I really feel these days is a deep overwhelming sadness.  I've tried reaching out multiple times to different therapists and councilors, some of them are completely useless while the only one that was any help that I mildly trusted tried to hospitalize me again.    


I don't understand why I'm not allowed to talk about the fact that living is a constant struggle just not to unalive. I don't understand why I can't talk about how much pain I'm in.  I don't understand why the people who's job it is to help, go out of their way to make their patients not trust them.  I want to talk, I want to be better.  My brain won't let me and people just want to put me into a padded room instead of helping me.

"If you are unaware, there are multiple clips of Shaun circling around online, mainly of scenes of him experiencing meltdowns. These clips are posted with the intent of completely mocking the character, or to be used as an example of ""how not to write an autistic character"".  


I have also seen posts of this nature in this subreddit before, but from a more ""critical"" perspective, basically claiming how Shaun's autism is offensive/unrealistic/horrible representation.  


Yes, it is a doctor show. Yes, there are elements of the show that may be dramatized or ""cringey"". Yes, it is not going to be a 1:1 representation of the real world or whatever.  


But please, please consider before you make fun of this character, remember that MANY autistic people are ACTUALLY like him, or experience things similar to how it is depicted in the show. You can find plenty of people in this subreddit who really relate to this character, and autistic people are coming forward about how this trend is making them feel extremely alienated and disgusted with themselves. 

I know people are going to say ""but non-white-male autism is poorly represented"". Does the media/system favor white males? Yes. Is there a systematic prejudice against women and POC? Of course there is. But autism is autism, and you don't have to be white or male to relate to this character from an autistic perspective. You do not have to be white or male to have uncontrollable meltdowns with speech loops, or to talk the way he talks, or have the social style that he has. Just because he is is a white male does not mean that his autistic traits are made up out of thin air. So when you're claiming that his meltdowns are ""clownish"" and ""a mockery of autistic people"", what does that imply about the people who actually have meltdowns like that? Sure, we could use more diverse representation. But how does that logically condone the bullying of this character? How does that condone saying that his (very autistic) traits are not autistic?   


If you don't relate to him, that's fine. If you don't like the show, that's fine. But please do not mock him simply because you don't relate to him. I don't even really like the show. We need to remember that this is a spectrum condition and there will be people who present differently than you. That does not make you any less autistic, and it doesn't make Shaun's traits any less autistic, it just means you are different people with different symptoms and needs. We are alienating a part of our community by engaging in this bullying of traits. Thank you for coming to my TED talk lmfao.",1,autism

"I (30F) have been on Humira prescribed by my derm for close to three months now for psoriasis, PsA, and HS. It is my first biologic and honestly has been life changing so far. I've had skin, joint, and stomach issues since early childhood. I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy when I was 23 which was negative for IBD and celiac. I don't think any biopsies were taken. I was told I just had really bad IBS-D and some hemorrhoids that they left alone. However, with how bad my symptoms are I've long wondered if the doctors were somehow wrong. Also, none of the medications prescribed, psychotherapy, or diet changes for IBS have been remotely helpful. 

Since starting Humira, this is the FIRST time in my ENTIRE life I have been almost symptom free for any of these 4 conditions. My stomach issues are not totally resolved but they're astronomically better. The amount of times I have to go to the bathroom most days is now once or twice a day, sometimes not at all. I still have bleeding sometimes, but not as bad as before. I'm now even able to tell what foods piss off my stomach the most. Before it didn't matter what I ate.

"Hi everyone,

I've written on this subreddit a few times. I have schizophrenia and my condition has always been very stable. I've always been positive and really my condition has worked out reasonably well, although it took a lot of time (years really) for it to become just a normal part of my life. I once wrote on this subreddit that the voices in my auditory hallucinations are my friends. This has always been true, the slight murmur of these kindly voices has always helped me. They tell me they care, and in some way are my companions. They are not very real just in the background really, but somehow I find them comforting - and certainly my medication helps me manage this constant part of my life (as it can be distracting.. amongst other things it keeps the energy low somehow).

I did not really understand that there could be bad hallucinations until recently. In my experience up until then I thought they (the hallucinations) could be tamed just by talking to them, or saying comforting things - I learned this as a coping strategy for when things seemed a bit surreal. It wasn't always easy with the voices there, certainly not all the time, and I could misunderstand how my feelings were projected by the voices - in a way they just respond to what's happening around me it seems. I have always loved them as a part of my life, it just makes me be me, although there were times I wished I could just be normal. In a way it was just that I was generally stressed at the time (it isn't easy finding out you have schizophrenia) - although now so long as I can find my peace, I just realize that I am normal.

However I did have a bad voice. I now think I did not understand how others felt on this subreddit, although I really did relate on people's situations. The way the bad hallucination spoke to me, I could tell the voice hated me. I don't know why this would have appeared to me, as my medication still works wonders. The voice really tried to torment me and wished every curse and hatred upon me.

I did not ever give up hope, and I knew this hallucination is nothing I personally consider about myself, and it has got better. Just by talking my way through it and staying strong I withstood it. I also distracted myself with plenty of other things to do - and filled my life with all the good things I could (as I try to do anyway). (I really like looking for free activities to do, or just stuff online etc.)

In a way this wasn't the first time a voice like this had occurred, but it had only ever lasted for a few hours - and so infrequently (maybe twice ever), I did not really remember or think of it as a bad symptom. There has been quite a lot of negative stimulus in the media which may have triggered it - and I find any negative stimulus can make my situation a bit worse (but generally I just don't watch TV anyway).

&#x200B;

So I just wanted to reach out to all of you, and say I really feel for you everyone. Keep safe, stay well. Wishing you peace.

&#x200B;

Edit: I should also say that it got a lot better, but it did take some time. I had to rest pretty much for quite a long time. Also I just did small things to keep active.

This hallucination was a new one also - it was very strange. I'm glad it's gone, but I'm going to look up some more techniques for strategies to cope in case something like this could occur again.",6,schizophrenia

"I posted last year. 

I have a meningioma tumor in my head. It’s a benign tumor but has been growing for at least the last 3 years. 

I’ve had operations in 2021 and 2022 to reduce the mass. There is no accepted chemotherapy for this type of tumor. For the last 6 months they’ve put me on an experimental treatment where i take a pill everyday and one injection a month. This was supposed to stop the tumor growth but has failed. I am meeting the chemo doctor this week. I am planning to stop this treatment. What the hell good is a treatment that doesn’t work. The tumor is still growing, I will still die when the tumor starts attacking some part of my brain. It’s located near my optical nerve so a good possibility is that I will go blind soon.

They will not do any more surgeries and radiation is off the table. So what little wine I have left, I will not spend on pointless treatments.",0,negative_samples

"Dear Self,

I've been wanting to tell you what I'm about to say for a very long time, but I could never quite understand it or find the right words. This won't be perfect or everything you need to know,  but this is where I'll begin.

First and foremost, I need to apologize. I'm sorry for the way I've been treating you since you were a little girl. Always being so hard on you. Comparing you to everyone else. Always telling you that you're not good enough. Always questioning every decision you make. Telling you that you're fat and that is the only thing people think when they see you. I'm sorry for telling you that you're lazy and unmotivated.  I'm sorry for leading you into physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive relationships for most of your adult life and telling you to stay in them as nobody else will ever love you. I'm sorry for being your worst enemy and for constantly making you feel like life is harder for you than for the people around you, and making you feel like it's your fault. I'm sorry.

At almost 33 years old, you've been diagnosed with ADHD. Things now seem so clear as to why you went to college 3 separate times and never graduated even though you only needed 3 more credits, why everyone else seems to have it easier than you and why the push and pull in your head never stops.

Guess what... this isn't your fault. You're not lazy. You're not a loser, and most importantly, you're not unloved.

I will tell you though, that this will never go away. It's something that you will need to live with and face every day for the rest of your life. 

There are few people around you who will understand how this has impacted you and how it has changed the way your life has been for so many years.  

You need to know that after years and years of heartache, pain, and tears, you have found yourself in a place of peace. You can now understand why things were the way they were.

I promise, I will now give you more grace and compassion. You are a wonderful mother.  You have a wonderful husband and home, and the people that surround you truly adore you.

Your weight does not define who you are as a person, and ADHD is not who you are. It is a part of you, and you, my dear, are wonderful.

Many people consider this a disability and though it has disabled you from so many things, it has also enabled you. It has enabled you to be where you are in life right now, and you are exactly where you need to be. 

Life is not an easy thing to navigate, but you are strong, smart, and you can do this. Please remember that this world needs you in it, just the way that you are.

I want to check for intruders, but I don't want to knock on the door because it's very late at night and I may wake him if he is in there and I'm anxious about bothering him so late.

"Antipsychotic medications only seems to address the positive symptoms and I'm just anhedonic and bored all day I feel like a husk my life is so fucking boring.

Like even if I were to do meth it wouldn't be because I'm an addict. It'd be because I need a stimulant to counteract negative symptoms that my psychiatrist simply won't prescribe. I'd essentially microdose it and just take the equivalent to a therapeutic dosage of Desoxyn.

I'd rather just have my Dexedrine prescription back. I know it'd obliterate the anhedonia.

Wellbutrin worked for like a month or two then it just made me irritable and clench my jaw a lot. Dexedrine actually remained effective and made everything exciting. This was before I even developed symptoms.

I did eventually abuse it but that's because I was dumb and immature as I was still in highschool and just entering my drug experimentation phase at the time. I'm 19 now and I probably wouldn't abuse stimulants if I got put on them. Fuck I want them back life just isn't worth living with anhedonia.

"Hey there,

I don't even know where to start. My life took a big nosedive ever since 2020 (not because of covid-19).
Reason was that my father, who lived one house further did terrorize me and my mom. He was screaming, hit the windows at like 2:00 or 3:00 AM in the morning and even broke one of our windows and stole some stuff from our house, insulted me and my mom heavily and even damaged both of our cars slightly.
He began drinking again at the end of 2019. Basically this stuff was ongoing for like a year. We did sue him many times and we called the police nearly everyday. But they couldn't do anything because when they came he behaved normally. It's hard to explain the details tbh.
From this point ongoing I was getting even more depressed than I have already been. I performed badly in school, bad at work and all because I had so many sleepless nights without any hope.

Then we moved out of our home where I've grown up at the start of 2021. Surely the situation was getting better because my dad couldn't find us anymore and we had peace. But the more time has passed the more I realized that I didn't heal. 

Before I was a rather emotional kind of person. I could feel empathy for people around me. I could feel fear, sadness, happiness and I were able to listen carefully when people where talking to me and I could remember most things.
Now I think im such a mess. Anything from the above I can't do anymore. It's like I'm another person and rarely it feels scary. But to be honest I don't care anymore about anything in my life. 

I have a girlfriend I am dating nearly 5 years now. The first two years everything went amazing and I truly enjoy my time with her. She helped me alot and I am more than grateful for her. But ever since my trauma starting from 2020 to 2021 I behaved like another person, which she told me aswell. I don't know how to communicate anymore. Everytime she wants to talk about our relationship and how to save it etc. my mind is just blank. I can't think of anything and how to even sort things out. She is mad at me and tells me that she's tired to come to me to sort things out. I should be coming to her now. But I just never know what to say.
I think I even became kind of unable to relate. I don't feel anything like love or attachment anymore. Not only for my gf. Just with nobody (same as my family). So it's hard for me to even figure out how to fight for this relationship.

My life is so meaningless to me everyday I search up for ""quickest"" methods to suicide. But fuck me I seem to be too scared to finally do hang myself or something.
I don't deserve to be here anymore and I'm sure everyone would be happier if I would die already.

If it wasn't enough I am addicted to masturbation and nail biting alot. Especially the part about masturbation fucks me up mentally since I do waste hours on it every other day. And my pervertions go to a level where it isn't considered normal aswell.

Just wanted to write my thoughs out which are killing me inside.
Fuck me. I should really rod in hell.",2,depression
"Before there was Airplane! there was The Big Bus, a good and charming parody of heavy handed disaster dramas. 

Coyote Bus Lines is  set to reveal their newest innovation in Bus travel with the unveiling  of Cyclops, a two story nuclear powered superbus complete with all the  luxuries of a cruise ship and promising a non-stop trip from New York  City to Denver. When an act of industrial espionage takes out the driver  and cp-driver of the inaugural journey, the injured/parking lot  confined Professor Baxter (Harold Gould) enlists his daughter Kitty  (Stockard Channing) to recruit Kitty's former fiancé and once great bus  driver, Dan Torrance (Joseph Bologna), much to Kitty's reluctance. Dan  has had a tough go in recent years due to an incident on Mount Diablo  where 110 passengers were lost to Cannibalism of Dan's co-pilot, but  because he accidentally ate stew made from a foot he carries the stigma.  Dan Agrees to pilot the big bus unaware that saboteurs have insidious  plans to keep it from reaching Denver.  


Released in 1976, The Big  Bus was released at the height of the 70s wave of Disaster films with  Universal's Airport series only on its first sequel and the Charlton  Heston fronted ensemble Earthquake only two years prior. Directed by  noted TV director James Frawley of The Monkees (who would go on to  direct The Muppet Movie) and written and produced by noted TV writers  Lawrence J. Cohen and Fred Freeman of Gilligan's Island, Andy Griffith,  and Bewitched, the movie went mostly ignored at the box office during  its initial run and eventually became overshadowed by the much more  successful Airplane! Four years later. The Big Bus aired infrequently on  TV after its release, not exactly getting a second life but did attract  a minor cult following from those who remember it, and rightly so  because while not as tight or sharp as Airplane it's a very funny farce  that plays up its silliness and camp in fun and inventive ways.  


Watching  The Big Bus it does almost feel like a first draft of Airplane! With  Ted Striker's character in airplane nearly identical to Dan Torrance  with them both being ""great pilots with tragic backstories"" and even  individual gags such as panicking the passengers over the intercom are  done in a near identical fashion here to how'd they be done in Airplane  four years later. This can probably be written off as mere coincidence  since most of these as delivered are funhouse mirror exaggerations of  the tricks and tropes seen in films of the Irwin Allen variety or the  Airport films, but it still is pretty glaring in terms of the  similarity. While The Big Bus doesn't have the extra level of polish  Airplane! Had, I think the movie still makes itself a worthwhile viewing  even outside of its historical curiosity preceding Airplane!.  


Much  like the disaster epics it spoofs, The Big Bus features a veritable  ""who's who?"" of talent with the likes of Joseph Bologna, Stockard  Channing, René Auberjonois, Sally Kellerman, Richard Mulligan, Ned  Beatty, and too many other to mention who all play the collection of  broad eccentrics with gusto fitting well in line with the cartoonish and  anarchic tone set by the film. From Sally Kellerman and Richard  Mulligan's on/off soon to be divorced couple who go from hurling insults  at each other to going just shy of full intercourse on the bus floor,  to Murphy Dunne as lounge piano player Tommy Joyce playing inappropriate  commentary/music at the worst possible times, the movie knows it has a  killer cast and does everything it can to put them in bits of sheer  ridiculousness that'll crack a smile on even the most harsh of viewers.  Everyone brings their ""A"" game treating the ridiculousness and madness  with complete seriousness as if they're actually in an Irwin Allen film.  The one downside would probably be in the film's antagonist, known only  as ""Ironman""(José Ferrer), who's just kind of there. His gimmick is  spending all of his time in an Iron Lung and his exchanges with his  henchman sabotaging the titular bus are unfortunately some of the major  dead spots in the movie that curtail the film's momentum.  


The Big  Bus may not be as well known as Airplane!, but it is an enjoyable  disaster farce that humorously treats its ridiculous nuclear powered bus  with the same reverence and melodrama seen in the Airport films and  turning the tropes on their heads into comic silver (not quite gold, but  on the cusp). It's a shame the movie isn't more widely known because it  runs at a quick clip keeping the sight gags, exchanges, and chaos  coming to mostly successful effect save for the occasional dead spot. If  you enjoyed Airpalne!, you owe it to yourself to see the film that  cleared the way for it.",0,negative_samples

Similar to this I sometimes become extremely scared that I’m being monitored like something out of the Truman Show, or that my life is just a big virtual simulation that everyone in the ‘real’ world can watch. The only way to ‘log out’ is through performing a weird action or death. I also think that I can ‘possess’ or at least force versions of myself in alternate dimensions to mimic whatever I’m doing like a mirror if I think about them and that I’m unintentionally ruining their lives. Or that I’m in a big hallucination, so whenever I get changed or shower I’m actually just getting naked in public, which makes me feel extremely uncomfortable.

"Hi all,

Well, we had some fun and games today that I wanted to share with you in case it helps someone else. So I have a nephrostomy tube and bag to drain off my right kidney as my unwelcome guest was squashing my ureters (drainage tubes from kidneys to bladder). Every week I have the dressing changed and this last time, two days ago, my nurse didn't put a nice padded dressing on top of the regular dressing which holds everything in place, under the sticky sterile plastic covering. Sorry I'm not explaining this very well!

So my tube is a little exposed (not to the air, but I can see it), and today when I got up from a chair, I very lightly knocked where it goes into my back. It hurt a bit at the time but I didn't think much of it. Later when it came time to empty the bag, I was horrified that there was blood in it. I called my local cancer ward (what I'm supposed to do out of hours) and they gave me instructions to take my temperature and monitor it, keep an eye on any bleeding, and to go to the ED if there was still blood in the bag after emptying it a couple more times and they'd pick me up from there to deal with it.

Despite being on blood thinners, the very small amount of blood that had pooled around where the tube comes out of my back had coagulated, and later on, there was no blood in the bag. My temperature was normal.

Talk about a nasty scare though! It's still a little tender but I'm out of the woods for now, with instructions to keep an eye on it and monitor my temperature. I'm still in the 7-14 days post-chemo so at much higher risk of infection. Next week I'll ensure my nurse puts the nice padded dressing on top, before covering it in the sterile plastic covering!",0,negative_samples

"I’ve had depression for years, but the past couple of weeks has been some of the hardest of my entire life.

"So first off; I'm Self-Diagnosed Autistic, and actually diagnosed ADHD.  
I work at a local supermarket chain (I won't say the name of the company or what state I live in) and it prides itself on being an equal opportunity employer; which is certainly the case - been here for 9+ years and I've seen a wide variety of people come, go, move up or just happily stay in one position (I'm the last one) I'm just a bagger - lowest rung on the ladder; although I am treated as a sort of unofficial manager of the parking lot since I've been here so long, I'm reliable, and I'm firm enough and have decent enough social skills to train and keep an eye on the teenagers outside. But I have no real true authority - nor do I want it.  
We have a variety of people with different conditions; ADHD, Downs Syndrom, having a prosthetic leg, autistic, and people of varying ages from 14 year olds to people in there 60's-70's.  


So, I have one particular coworker who's been here for about 5-ish years. He's Autistic and has depression. He's also approximately my age; I'm 32, he's 31. I used to consider him a friend - we never hung outside work. But we have talked often, we share similar interests, and we were both art students at different points in our lives, ect. I honestly get how he thinks for the most part, and I see a lot of myself in him - athough; a younger version of myself. The way he thinks reminds me A LOT of myself when I was in my early to mid 20's in all the wrong ways. Claiming and thinking he's a noble white knight when he's really a hypocrite. Being very socially awkward. Over-correcting other people's behavior (he used to be a talle-tale early on)  
And the most frustrating of all to me; using his Autism diagnosis as a sort of shield when he does something wrong. He constantly late to work. He'll sneak off and hide out on his phone for long periods. He'd take advantage of other people's kindness or oversights. When he's confronted when he does something wrong; first thing out of his mouth is excuses. When he DOES apologize; it's half-hearted because he'll often go right around and do it again. Hell, a few months ago he tried hitting on another coworker who was 19 at the time. (it was a few weeks away from his 31'st birthday at the time) She told me how creeped out she was by that.  


The other frustrating element is that managment seems totally unwilling to do SOMETHING about his behavior. They just don't even bother reprimanding him at all. The Assistant Managers might say something about him being really late, but actual managment won't really do ANYTHING.  
I've tried talking to several of the managers for my department about being firm with him if they actually want him to actually do his job. But many of them behave that because he's Autistic he's TOTALLY incapable of his behavior being corrected. One HEAVILY IMPLIED that he thought he was too dumb to learn. When I KNOW DAMNED WELL that it DOES work because we had a manager 3 years ago who DID do something about his behavior and actually punished him by taking away his phone except when he went on break, and he had to stay in the checkout department; he couldn't work outside in the parking lot for several months. And it WORKED! His performance and attitude did improve back to a respectable level. He was no longer late, he didn't slack off or take the easy way out. And he stayed like this for more almost 2 years.  
But last year his performance and behavior was slipping right back to where he was right before he was at his worst.  
Honestly, I think if this company wasn't so forgiving, he would have been fired A LOOOOONG time ago. And I've even told him that since he told me he's going to be moving out of state later this year, and was going to be forced to live on his own.  


I've vented to other friends of mine; many of them being Neurodivergent in various ways. ADHD, Autism, ect. And they all side with me that my coworker is a spoiled brat in a grown man's body.  
But still, I wonder if I'm just being too harsh and/or that my standards are just too high. That I should just let it go - but it's difficult to do so when I've been working very closely with him for 5+ years. I DID consider him a friend for most of that time, but I had to put my foot down when he made more fake promises that he would do better. To me; it was a breach of trust and faith that he'd just take advantage of me many, MANY TIMES when I've been kind, understanding, forgiving despite me being firm with him when he's fucked up.  


Still, I feel like I'm being a total asshole because I can't/won't let it go. Sometimes I think maybe I'm just not understanding enough. That perhaps I should lighten up. That perhaps that me being only self-diagnosed autistic makes my judgement of his crappy behavior invalid. I don't think I have clinical depression, so maybe I'm just just not understanding him there.  


\*shrug\* I dunno anymore. Maybe you strangers and fellow Autistics on the internet can let me know if I'm just an asshole or not.",1,autism

"Hey everyone! I got diagnosed earlier this month after a quick lil jaunt to the ER from a 570 blood sugar reading, and I’ve managed to get down to an average of 140 over the month, which is cool, but I had an interesting experience I wanted to ask about here.

I was stoked but now it seems like my vision is kind of dulling back down a bit. Has anyone here had a similar experience?

"I started complete life changes after 2 years of chronic stress and anxiety. Symptoms include 24/7 horrible full head/brain fog feeling like pressure without the headache or pain(main and worst symptom), unrested sleep, and involuntary head twitching that started in December 2022. Stayed in my house pretty much for 2 1/2 years with most symptoms.

Everything was better initially when I started in January 2023. Better mood, more energy, sleeping better, good dreams, just all that good stuff. Early on I did get sad, regretful when I started going out again and realizing how life kept going on while I shut myself in. This passed quickly as I continued my recovery. Now about 4 1/2 months in I am getting hit with extreme low mood, sadness, dread, loss of interest, and feeling as if I haven't slept at all despite getting 7 to 8 hours upon waking.

"I'm diagnosed with ADHD-C and  Autism (ASD-1), I've tried every ADHD stimulant currently available starting way back in 2015 up to now and all of them have given me horrible physical/mental side effects that overpowered the benefits. All of their benefits were laser like focus, attention, and motivation, but to such an extreme degree I no longer felt human anymore, I just felt like a robot programmed to complete a task and nothing more. I didn't care about anything else other than the task I was focused on, be it a project, listening to someone talk, learning, daily chores, etc

It's like I'm trading creativity, humor, wit, love, and social interest for alleviating everything that ADHD makes difficult for me. I feel like it's just not worth it.

I have also tried alternatives like Strattera and Guanfacine but those just made me feel ill and tired all the time. I'm also diagnosed with autism, so maybe that's why I'm having such an atypical response to these meds. I'm about to just give up and go back to drinking coffee again. The only thing that sucked about coffee is the afternoon sleepiness and mild anxiety.

Anyone else out there go through a similar experience as me? How have you learned to cope being a poor responder to medication? Is there any hope for people like us?",3,adhd

Yesterday afternoon, the top dogs in my school district sent an email to all faculty that said all small appliances must be removed from our classrooms, and we must use the ones in the teacher’s lounge at the front of the room. My problem with this is two things:

1) Every faculty member in the school (as well as their children) has access to this. I don’t want my life saving medication where everybody can grab it. 

2) if I were to experience a low during class, I would have to either wait until the end of class to go get my correction (at the front of the school, when my classroom is at the back) or leave my students unattended, which is a big no-no according to my district.

The first time I got really high I had a psychotic episode where I thought I was going to kill my family with a knife I had just bought. From this point on I never truly felt ""normal"" again. I went back into highschool and spent my last year thinking I was in touch with entities from different dimensions and ancient, forbidden knowledge. I would move in with many family members and go through a lot of trauma and violence in these years that will forever affect my mental health. I also started using harder drugs like amphetamines and cocaine. I was addicted to amphetamines for a year and then crack cocaine for almost 2 years. My parents are the ones that introduced me to hard drugs and were both addicted to crack when I was born.

I would try many meds and go on and off of them but I could never find one that truly helped. The last time I was medicated I fell into the deepest depression of my life. I had a catatonic weed-induced episode where I couldnt move or speak and I thought I was being attacked by demons. I saw hallucinations of hell and viscious flames. I was hospitalized for this and this was when I was officially diagnosed with schizophrenia and they put me on a new medication. This medication (invega sustenna) was not only ripping away my will to live but I would still get episodes and I couldn't hold down a job. So i quit this medication and about a month or two ago I did psychedelics combined with methamphetamine and had the scariest episode of my entire life. 

The delusions were no longer just in my head they manifested themselves in the real world and I spent nearly 40 hours full on hallucinating. There was like hundreds of phones buzzing all around me and it felt like the friends I were talking to on my phone wanted to kill me. I also thought that there was people outside my house that wanted to kill me and I boarded my windows with cardboard. I thought that there was a plot against me and that my precious friends and family Ive known for years were actors or had been trying to mind control me with drugs. Which honestly I dont even think was a lie because I was hanging around a lot of addicts (including my own mother but I dont want to get into that) who just kept getting me more and more fucked up and they knew I was a diagnosed schizophrenic. 

This ordeal helped me realize that it was the drugs that were not only fucking my brain up and essentially driving me insane but were putting me in bad situations and leading me down a dark path. I was born into really unfortunate circumstances with two addicts for parents and predisposed psychotic symptoms. I am determined to stay sober so I can better manage my symptoms. I have also cut off those toxic addicts in my life and I am in a (relatively) safe environment. I dont think I need meds, except for maybe seroquel which has so far been the only medication to help me without having horrible side effects. Its so sad how there is so many people like me who fell into addiction and started experiencing psychotic symptoms. This shit isnt any joke its like hell on earth you are never truly comfortable or feel safe. I just wanted to share my story and see if maybe any of you could relate or sympathize with me.

"I just had an embarrassing episode a few days ago. I don't wanna explain in detail what happened but I was at a public event where I had a meltdown and burst into tears. An insignificant thing triggered me and I got scared.

Normally I really don't cry that often and it has never been a problem for me to control my emotions in public places and social gatherings. I’m starting to think irrationally and I probably overreact in most situations. It worries me that I have become such a nervous wreck over the last 4-5 months.

Thinking about the episode the other day makes me uncomfortable, and at the same time so disappointed in myself. My dad was also at the event and he thinks it was embarrassing too, so that doesn't help at all. It's not the first time I've embarrassed my family because of my overreactions, but the episode the other day was the worst I've had.

I sometimes struggle differentiating between anxiety, depression, and overwhelm. I have experienced all of them, but I think overwhelm is more common than I thought.

Sometimes when I feel overwhelmed I enter a state where I want to be “off”. I want to disappear or not exist.

Gradually I am accepting my autism and I guess this feeling has always been present, but I am starting to confront it: “this isn’t going to change”.

You know, sometimes you can make changes in your life, sometimes people around you can make changes, you can go on vacation, you can meditate. 

But fundamentally, I am the common denominator and I can’t change that I am autistic. You know how people say “maybe you are the problem”? Well “I am am the problem” from people’s point of view. I don’t think of myself in those terms, but every day I have conflict and misunderstandings and I feel like I don’t belong here. I feel like I don’t belong here. That won’t change.

So of course this makes me feel sad, but I am slowly realizing that the sadness is secondary. I am not sad because my brain has a fundamental chemical imbalance or because I am imagining hardships that don’t exist. These struggles are real and they aren’t going away no matter how hard I try.

When I feel this kind of overwhelmed, any misunderstanding or stress feels like it is inevitable, unavoidable, and deeply personal. Often it’s simply someone saying “why are you doing this?” Which is one step from “why are you like this?” I feel like it’s only a matter of time until I have spent all of my good will and every person will eventually grow tired of all the energy it takes to maintain a relationship and then they will leave. Quite frankly, it happens.

It’s a hard pill to swallow.",1,autism
"26 years old, male. 

Military veteran. College-educated scientist. Definitely been ""gifted"" and ""higher learning ability"" all my life at the cost of severe social and generalized anxiety disorder and major clinical depression.

Bounced between careers. Army, secondary education, laboratories, warehouses. Bounced around multiple states. Don't have many real-life friends anymore. Cost of living has officially spiraled, and probably going to try to live in the car and try to figure out communal places for vets/homeless or something due to rent being this unreal.

Had girlfriends before, but haven't met a woman my age in like 3-4 years. All the apps are infested with bots. Definitely missing intimacy and just flirting in general.

Was a gamer for 24 years since before I could read, write, or talk. Played so many games on so many platforms that it all feels the same. Gaming isn't really fun anymore.

Got into drawing and painting, had fun, but got tired of it real quick.

Body works fine for now albeit unable to eat much or put on any weight and tired of being this skinny or weak but always had stomach problems i.e. nausea, unable to consume large quantities of food.

Feel like I really REALLY messed up somewhere along the way with the majority of my life and goals, and not sure to do, or where I messed up, but I don't find enjoyment from anything I used to, I've tried enough new things for a lifetime, and I don't see stability in my career, financially, and without those - DEFINITELY not in finding a partner or connecting with humans again emotionally.

I can't be the only one.... right?! Oh, please tell me this feeling is normal. Just lie to make me feel better even if it's not LOL!

Not just me thinking I have to hide my wallet in different places in my room because I believe someone is going to go through it.

"I have a younger brother, who I like to describe as the most neurotypical neurotypical that has ever neurotypicaled, and I often get this feeling that he doesn’t respect me. I mean sure, ostensibly there’s some degree of sibling rivalry, and I get that. But on the other hand, he’s generally quite dismissive towards me, which is something that a lot of people have pointed out, including his friends (one of them literally said “stop being so mean to your brother”).

The problem arises when he decides to mock me. Him being NT, he never really gets enthusiastic or talks about things in the same manner I do, which I’m fine with, but at the same time when I do want to talk to him, he can be quite mean at times. There’s this one thing he does where he makes fun of my stims (which I didn’t even realize were stims until relatively recently, because I didn’t know I was autistic), and it hurts that he makes fun of something I can’t control, something that keeps me grounded. The problem is, my parents aren’t that much supportive either, since my mom denies any possibility of me being autistic, so I can’t explain it in relation to that. To them, it seems like I’m being petty or overreacting when bringing it up, which is why I try to hide stimming around them (it sucks). And it’s not that my parents don’t recognize that my brother doesn’t respect me, it’s just that they think that making fun of my stims isn’t a big deal. Well, it kind of is, and it’s one of the things that makes me feel like my feelings aren’t taken seriously (being AMAB doesn’t help either).",1,autism

I’m not a part of this sub, but I’m here because I don’t know what other sub I can talk to about this issue. My mother in law is an amazing woman, I love her, she’s always gone above and beyond for her son, me and our 3 kids. The past couple of years she’s been talking about people watching her from electronic devices. She refuses to share Wi-Fi passwords with people, even us and when we bought her a smart tv, she put it in storage because she swore someone was watching her. She has two phones, an iPhone and a flip phone. She mainly uses the flip phone with a bandaid covering the camera. She leaves her iPhone in the garage most of the time. We figured that it’s probably just her not knowing how electronics work, but today she said something that truly worried me. 

She said that she went out to eat at a restaurant the other day and she usually leaves her purse with her iPhone at the table with her husband while she goes to the bathroom. This time she forgot and took her purse with her. When she noticed she took her purse, she decided to leave it in another stall while she went to another to use the toilet. I told her if she has her phone in her purse no one can see her, she said that they can see through her purse! 

We (my husband, i and her husband) have tried talking to her and explaining that no one is watching her, but she insists that God told her they are. I’m scared of leaving my children with her now. What if she starts to think they are sick and gives them medicine that they shouldn’t have? Which is something she did once.

For context I was diagnosed with anxiety and have been seeing various therapists and psychologists since I was around 12 years old. 

Because I was lucky enough to get some kind of treatment (even if half of them were unhelpful) I have learned strategies to manage my anxiety over time and it does not usually dominate my life. Full blown panic attacks have been very rare for the last 8 years or so.

I used to have severe medical phobia as a kid (throwing up & hyperventilating over something as simple as an x ray) but I became a lot more comfortable as an adult with these strategies, even getting blood tests and such on a regular basis. I discovered I have a high pain tolerance, and that I can go through lot more than I thought possible.

Two years ago however, I had an IUD insertion done as it is a highly recommended birth control. Before the insertion I was told to just take an ibuprofen on the day, but reassured that it wouldn’t be too uncomfortable and no further pain management was necessary. I should have suspected something was up when started panicking while signing off all the waivers in the waiting room… the procedure was very painful but almost nothing compared to the painful side effects that would last almost a year afterwards. Not only did I have trauma from the procedure, but the way I was brushed off, or made to feel like I was over reacting by almost every doctor I saw while trying to fix the damage (and put an end to the constant pain) made me absolutely mental. 

Now I have meltdowns even thinking about having to go in for a physical exam, or Pap smear in the future. I try to control my anxiety but it’s also fuelled by the fact that I’ve experienced how women’s pain is not considered, barely even researched in the medical world. I keep panicking, just thinking about what will happen to me if I need to go in for ANY medical check up or procedure. 

I don’t know how to overcome this medical fear when it feels so realistic. Tonight I accidentally read a post  about colposcopies and I immediately was shaking and crying, couldn’t control my breathing just thinking about how I might need this procedure one day. I’m still in pain but scared to get checked out in case I need a test like this.",4,anxiety

"I hate it when people misunderstand me in conversation and assume the absolute worst. This happens too often on social media, when I'm just trying to discuss something with someone, and maybe I say too much or something, or maybe it's simply the fact I don't completely agree with them idk, but it appears that they assume the worst of my intentions because they either insult me in writing or they block me. 






Today it happened again. There's an autistic content creator I've occasionally watched videos of and I saw a video from her about ""autistic coded"" robots and other non-humans. I tried to discuss it with her. I asked her if she feels that the term ""coded"" implies intent because I feel it kinda does and I am not a huge fan of it because of that because we're not in the creators / artists / writers brain so I don't think we can know their intentions for certain unless they've outright said they intended for a character to have x trait. I didn't attack her for saying it. I asked her whether she feels it implies intention and said why *I* don't like it. I then said that I think in some cases robots / non-humans with autistic traits do come about for the reason she said but also offered another reason I think it happens too - which was coming from experience because I literally write about fictional robots myself. And she blocked me. I was just trying to discuss it with her. I had no bad intentions and definitely didn't want a negative interaction with her. 








Its so frustrating when this shit happens. I just have a lot of thoughts about things and I like to discuss things, and when people actually discuss things I'm interested in with me its awesome.

Sometimes my teeth, cheekbones, and bridge of nose hurt. Olfactory hallucinations 99% of the time, but never bad smells. Almost always food. I get this even without migraine though, just less frequently.

Everything gets 100x worse when I stand, especially if I'm lying down. I'll get up, make it 10-20ft, then get this incredible spike in pain that'll last for a minute or more. Sometimes it brings me to my knees in pain.

Ip Man 4: The Finale is a fitting end to the popular martial arts film series starring Donnie Yen as the legendary Wing Chun master. While the plot may not be as cohesive or compelling as the earlier installments, the movie still delivers plenty of thrilling fight scenes and emotional moments that will satisfy fans of the genre and the franchise.

The biggest theme of Ip Man 4 is the struggle of Chinese immigrants and their descendants to adapt and find acceptance in America during the 1960s, especially in the face of racism and stereotyping. This idea is reflected in various subplots, from Ip Man's relationship with his son who studies in a U.S. school, to the conflicts between the Chinese martial artists and the Western boxing enthusiasts, to the antagonism between Ip Man and a pompous American army officer who undermines Chinese culture.

These topics add depth and resonance to the movie, but they don't always get enough time to develop or converge smoothly, leaving some of the supporting characters or themes underdeveloped. Nonetheless, the action scenes are where Ip Man 4 truly shines, showcasing the Wing Chun style's speed, precision, and adaptability against various other fighting methods. The choreography, cinematography, and sound effects are all top-notch, making every punch, kick, and weapon strike look and sound impactful.

Donnie Yen once again commands the spotlight with his charismatic and dignified portrayal of Ip Man, who remains a role model of honor, compassion, and wisdom despite facing personal and social challenges. The other cast members, including Vanness Wu, Scott Adkins, Chris Collins, and Danny Chan, also deliver solid performances, even if they don't get enough character arcs or motivations.

Overall, Ip Man 4: The Finale may not be as seminal or inventive as the first Ip Man, but it's still a well-crafted and satisfying conclusion to the series, offering a mix of martial arts spectacle, historical insight, and inspirational value. If you're a fan of Asian action movies or Ip Man himself, this movie is worth watching.",0,negative_samples

"Hye everyone. Hope you guys are well.  

I wanted some advice from some mature people. So here is my story:

In 2022 July I completed my graduation and got a job too. So a 20 years long struggle of my mother came to an end. During this time I also went through bad patches(depression and shame). But during the 4 year degree I didn't have time to get depressed since I got so busy in the excessive workload. After 2022 July, I started feeling lonely. Like it was very hard. But few months back I got a new roommate. He is a great company. 

Now out of no where when my brain realized that there is nothing bad in the present, lets bring back the bad memories of the past to ruin the present. Past memories are jumping in again and again which triggers my shame. So the incident(9 years old) which triggers my shame is linked with my mother and sister. The both don't even remember that incident or even if remember it, they are not bothered, neither they ever reminded me. They both love me a lot.But they both don't know that I am still carrying it. Also another thing is the thought that I am gonna die at the end. So why work so hard? 

So currently these two things are killing my motivation to study and do other productive stuff. I have wasted 2 weekends. 2 days ago I went to a therapist and he has prescribed escitalopram(10 mg) to me. However, I don't have any generic anxiety symptoms or suicidal thoughts.

"  
Crippling indecision. Depressed people can be consumed by an overwhelming inability to make decisions. Everything is questioned right down to the granular level. This constant self-questioning and evaluating leaves the person paralysed and unable to function. For instance the depressed person might make a decision to take a shower. What follows next is a tsunami of questions “should I wait to later” “what if I don’t have the energy” “why do I need a shower anyhow I am not going anywhere?” This can literally play out for hours and hours until the sufferer finally says something along the lines of “what’s the point?” Needless to say this self-doubting will be followed by recrimination and more than likely self-hatred for being so weak, which in turn feeds the depression, an almost perfect vicious circle.  
Critical self-judgment. Depressed people don’t really see themselves as ill. They rarely give themselves that good a break. Instead they can very easily view their depression as a personal weakness they could overcome if they just tried hard enough. This train of thought is perpetuated by other people telling them to just snap out of it, or a thousand other platitudes they have heard a million times before. Instead of seeing this nonsense for what it really is they turn it internally and berate themselves for having a character flaw that doesn’t allow them to function like normal people. They don’t need other people to be judgmental as they are expert at doing it to themselves a thousand times worse.  
Interaction is painful. It’s something most people take for granted. Interaction, conversing and relating are things we mostly don’t have to think about. For someone suffering depression this natural ability can become excruciatingly difficult. In most instances we pull on a socially acceptable mask and pretend everything is fine. We are present but not really there if you know what I mean? We can be surrounded by people and feel painfully alone lost in the quicksand of depression. We are experts at hearing but not really listening. We are ninja warriors at the art of avoiding talking about how we are feeling. Everything is great and fine when in reality we are dying inside. While you are talking about how your day went we can be reliving the worst moments of ours and at the same time making sure you don’t see our pain.  
Fear of the future. Ask a depressed person what they think their future looks like and they will more than likely tell you “more of the same or worse” Depending on the severity of the depression a sufferer doesn’t see a future. A future is something other people have not them. Their future is the struggle they are going to have tomorrow morning when they wake up and think to themselves “please, not this again, I don’t think I can go on like this” We think about the future by comparing it to our past. It’s very difficult to imagine a nice future when all the evidence from the past is telling you it isn’t going to happen. For the vast majority of people a future is something they can feel optimistic about. For a depressed person it can feel like something to dread. Something filled with hopelessness and helplessness. Not living in the present is extremely common; it can feel like we are adrift in an ocean of misery and torment stuck in a no man’s land of despair and apathy. Once hope is lost, everything is lost.  
Even the good times can be bad. Imagine not even being happy at the birth of your child or in fact any landmark occasion that marks a supposedly joyous event in our lives. A chronically depressed person doesn’t have to imagine it. For millions of people this is a reality and is something that is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. Guilt and shame which feed the depression are experienced in equal measure. They know on a rational logical level they should be happy, unfortunately they have lost the ability. Their happiness has been replaced by numbness and indifference which they have seemingly no control over. I well remember when I was going through my own depression someone asking me what I would do if I won a million pounds. Without even having to think I said I would probably give it away as no amount of money could ever make me happy again. These are the depths a depressed mind can sink to.  
Observing not participating. There is a song from the movie midnight cowboy sung by Harry Nilsson that I think sums up depression beautifully. Here it is. “Everybody’s talking at me, I don’t hear a word they’re saying only the echoes of my mind”. Severe depression is probably like having an out of body experience. You can see and hear everything happening around you but you are not part of it. It can feel very lonely and isolating to realise that you are a spectator to your own life. Your heart aches to be part of something that will make you feel like a human being again but your depressed mind is constantly telling you that this is for other people to experience, not you. Just like the song you literally do hear what everybody is saying but you are lost in mire of the echoes of your own mind. It can feel like you are living a life where the pause button is permanently pressed. A state of non-existing if you like.  
Dysfunctional relating and relationships. It’s no coincidence that the rate of breakups and divorces amongst people suffering depression is quite high. Relating to another human being requires motivation that is sadly lacking as they struggle with their illness. Maintaining relationships requires effort and energy both of which have been sucked out of them. It’s not that they don’t care it’s because they have lost the ability to care and they feel powerless to do anything about it. When you don’t care if you live or die yourself it can be very difficult to care for someone else. They are trapped inside the prison of their own mind desperately hoping for someone or something to set them free. For a depressed person isolating themselves can be preferable to relating even though they absolutely know this is doing them real harm. A depressed mind doesn’t think rationally it will push away the very thing that could help them. It can see relationships as having very little consequence, even though the opposite is true, such is the contradictory nature of depression.  
Lack of autonomy. The most important thing to every human being on the planet is having a sense of autonomy or control over their lives. When depression comes into a person’s life that sense of control is taken away. Choices start to become very limited and the person’s world can become microscopic. In an effort to fill that emotional void many people turn to food, alcohol, drugs, shopping anything in fact that alleviates, however temporarily, the crushing feeling of being out of control of their own destiny. These strategies can of course bring about bigger problems to add to the depression. A sense of meaning or purpose to their lives is missing and in its place is a gaping hole. This can set some people off on a journey to find that missing piece in the vain hope that it will complete them. They never find that thing that will make them whole again because it doesn’t exist. It is a depression generated wild goose chase that can easily turn into an obsession. Depression holds out the promise that if you could just find that thing outside yourself everything would return to normal and the depression would vanish. Unfortunately as many people have found to their cost, including myself, it’s simply not true. The answer lies internally not externally.  
There are a countless different ways that people can experience depression. There are however quite a few commonalities between the different types. If any of the above resonated with you it’s time to seek professional help. These types of symptoms won’t be exercised away, prayed away, snapped out of or ignored. If left unaddressed they have the ability to devastate your life for a very long period of time.

"He forced her to call me and told her to break up with me while she was drugged. When she resisted, he hit her in the stomach. After that she “broke up with me”.

Of course the next morning we got back together. Because she doesn’t want to leave me. It’s her son that is abusing her, but of course she won’t admit it - he is her son.

"Last night, I lost it. I cut myself in other one place I can feel it. More than a year ago now, I injured my leg badly in a vehicle accident and today, there's some nerve damage that prevents me from feeling that area. 
So last night while I was taking a shower, I heard someone aggressively banging on the door and pulling at the knob and it scared the absolute shit out of me. Believing it was my mom, I unlocked the door and told her the door was unlocked if she needed in, while I hid back in the shower. We do this sort of thing all the time. Being too anxious to finish my shower, I opened my door to ask if everything was okay because I was getting no response from anybody. So I put my clothes on as fast as I could and as I was doing so, I heard my Step Dad say he threw up. Mom was super pissed but kept insisting everything was fine.
I knew better though. This made me so upset last night that after having a long cry session, I tool pit my scalpel and completely hacked up my leg.
Today I didn't get up for work on time, so I had to figure out what I could wear with this huge bandage over my cuts. My head still hurts, I'm sweating like crazy, and I'm not sure how I will be at my toxic job. 
I've been trying to find reasons to live but lately there aren't many. I told myself if I couldn't find help or be happy by September, I'd kill myself via train. I'm so sick of being a burden in my parents home.

I get really scared and I keep thinking that I will mess it up again. I cannot sleep at night. Even if I sleep the moment I wake up the pain in my chest grows bigger. It's like a heavy rope around my chest, it hurts. I cannot talk about it to my family as they are not very keen on my mental health and will tell me that I'm just weak.

"Hello..24 and autistic here, I want to talk about my current workplace and ask how your experiences are in the workplace for the few 'lucky' out there. 

At the moment I work at a special workplace for people who can't work at normal companies and such, however it is by far not the right fit for me. Which is a huge problem here, we have a special job arrangement rule that makes the local government obliged to help people to a job who are not eligible for the normal workfloor, but it has been proved multiple times that this helps very little. And here is the main issue: they don't try at all. 

What they normally do is this: putting you in a place where you can pack stuff, clean or make simple food, no matter your niveau. No matter your obstacles in life. Because they do not want to waste time in this. 

This happened to me..and lucky enough I could move to the administration part of work..or so I thought. They let me do three simple tasks at best(I did a whole study in administration, but couldn't get a diploma due to social issues) and now I spend my hours doing absolutely nothing there..plus the fact that they bringing someone back who is going to fully replace me. Giving me a simple task I will be working maybe one hour on in the week and then back to packing stuff and feeling useless. 

They don't inform me of anything, treat me like a child and simply have nothing to do for me. 

I struggle with a lot besides the main thing, social anxienty, looking like a child, speech impediment, but I am far from dumb and knowing I will probably spend my whole life packing stuff really sucks. I can type and send mails no issue, I can work with excel,  etc. But because work is so focused on the social aspects, I never make a change in life. 

Tldr: At a special workplace where they don't have work for me, can't work elsewhere because of issues.",1,autism

"and have to start all over, that pain hurts.

just a bit of a rant post. i spent the past five years (18-23) building a life i was so proud to have - found a nice enough place to live, a min wage job that i was happy enough in, with colleagues i liked, and a strong passion and determination to become a full time musician - I was singing and busking, lots of friends and saw/interacted with a dozen or so people every day! financially stable and progressing. after a horrible childhood and almost 20 jobs hopping around (bad luck with workplaces etc) i finally started having some kind of stability, staying at a job for almost a year. going to the gym, taking driving lessons to the point i was ready to pass, performing in venues, smiling!! actual mental recovery and health 💪 

then stuff happened in december...this will sound crazy but i'm a stranger on the internet so you don't have to believe me - i fell off my bicycle, hit my head, got psychic abilities and started interacting with ghosts (with freaky accuracy), but then I started having unexplained seizure like body spasms - wound up in hospital three times via ambulance...the third, they didn't know what was going on and i ended up in a psychiatric facility for a few months (i should've kept my mouth and my third eye shut lol). so i lost my job and my place. and a bit of my grip on reality / i started talking about vortexes and dimensions. 

fast forward from nov '22 to today...may '23 - i pushed away all the psychic stuff (ignoring it COMPLETELY) i am back living with my parents (a lot of abuse history with them and i fought so hard to leave that, so winding back here now hurts to my core) now witnessing my dad get loud and angry to my mum/ grandmother is so triggering it aches. i witness my mum living a very depressing life too. i'm financially back to zero. living in a small bedroom which is quite dilapidated and rundown, in the middle of nowhere. insects galore which triggers old OCD habits. all of my things piling in storage containers around me and nowhere to put it so i never bothered unpacking. unemployed and will be seeking yet another min wage job. i haven't been outside for almost a month now. i'm basically hiding just watching stupid tv shows and movies, because everything feels so...lost. no friends in this area and the ones i did have last year have all somehow evaporated except for the odd ""hi"" and basic text.

the only thing that ever made me so happy and gave me purpose was music. but i haven't sang or written in months and i think i've given it up. 

i've tried speaking about what i'm experiencing but i end up in tears. so i've just stayed in bed, and for the first time in my life, i've become everything i always feared and worked so hard to stay away from. i think i am in real depression. 

anyway, i'll probably get another job soon within a few months, but with that salary...i can't help but think, i'm probably stuck here unless i find a small houseshare to move to. last time i was lucky, it was a friend's place's garden house after a series of crappy houseshares - but then i had to hit my head and lose all that. 

to what end? i will get a job that pays maybe £1.3k a month, but that's not enough for my own place. eat, shit, sleep, be a cog in the concrete jungle machine. that's what the future looks like. it seems so sad without any of my passion or love left. 

love. even just if i had a sibling or a pet or a close friend. love would make this easier.

"I just finished reading this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.

This post isn't really about the book in general, but about its vocabulary. I've noticed this same issue in many books I've read, where it feels as though the writer is trying to make a point by using really obscure words, but that point is completely lost on me.

In this case, the story is in first-person, so are we supposed to assume that the narrator is ... stuffy? Learned? Intellectual? Showy?

It's really not clear, because aside from those crazy words, he's not really any of those things. He's a professor of history at a middling university, but in his conversations, he seems like a normal, slightly self-effacing guy. He sort of calls out another character for using words like peripety and climacteric.

But then, the narrative leaves that behind, and hits us with tons of words just like that.

So what's the point? Maybe we're just supposed to think that the author is smart?

I contrast this to books like Lolita, or The Debt to Pleasure (both of which I loved) where the high vocabulary and style is perfectly suited to, and compliments, the character that we're learning about.

Here are some of the words I mean:

Cathexes, strappado, carceral, horripilation, pentimento, sudorific, pelage, pontonier \[EDIT: It was actually ""ponton"" as in: the car was ponton\], capirote, hyemal,  lucubration...

And then there were some that I knew (or kinda knew), but still classify them as difficult words: caudillo, nugatory, gloriole.

Lastly, he used some words in a weird way, so that I looked them up just to see if there was a definition that I was missing. Unfortunately, though I remember one was ""menial,"" I can't remember the context.

Anyone else read this book and felt the way I feel?

"I am desperately looking for help and advice. I am the caregiver for my mother living with schizoaffective disorder. My mom is young at 46 years old, was very active, and very stable on her medications prior to these additional medical issues. 

Winter of 2022, Mom sustained a back injury resulting in 4 rib fractures. These fractures are where the rib meets her spinal cord. She was bending over to tie her ice skates when she felt pops and pain. X-rays confirmed the breaks and the doctors assumed this was a one-off occurrence and told her to take it easy so she could heal. She ended up healing very slowly but the pain remained and increased.

She has been sent to an Endocrinologist, has multiple tests done for bone density/degeneration. Countless X-ray/MRIs. Pain clinics. Nothing came back conclusive and the doctor cannot provide an explanation.

Not getting an answer as to why the ribs broke has caused a spiral.

The past 15 ish months have been horrific. Words cannot express the absolute derailment that has happened. Everything from medical delusions, fears that her medical team is trying to kill her,  psychosis episodes, etc. I have not seen my mom this way since right before her diagnosis. I have been advocating for her, booking appointments, speaking with her doctors, etc.

In April, she broke 3 MORE ribs after bending over to tie her shoe. 1 was a re-break, the others were new fractures. Again, doctor has no answers. She has been checked for signs of self-harm and abuse. There are no bruising or anything indicating that is was self inflicted. SHE IS 46 YEARS OLD! Why is this happening? Her medical care has been severely lacking and I wont get into it on this post but IMHO I believe it is because of her disorder that her concerns have not been taken seriously. I know they have performed tests but that took a year for them to be ordered and over 30+ ER visits and many hours of advocacy. 

I have been doing research this whole time and after speaking with a schizophrenia advocacy group, they told me about a linkage between anti-psychotic medications and breaking bones.

**My main question is - Do any of you know about or have experience with anti-psychotic medications leading to unexplainable bone breaks?**

When I was 15, I was unmedicated and I applied for a job at a fast food chain, I got the job but was so anxious every time I had to go in that I also threw up every morning. Though, once I was there, after half an hour or so I was fine and even began to enjoy myself but the next morning I was back to being anxious. A few days in, I was super anxious one morning and ended up quitting that morning because my mother asked me if I wanted to, so I did. I immediately regretted it and still do. It makes me feel lots of shame just thinking about it.

Now, I haven’t had a job since but I’m wanting to apply for one so I can get some money. But every time I even think about applying, I get scared that the ending is going to be the exact same.

Eventually that love was exhausted. In its place loneliness and longing grew.
The most powerful feeling I've ever known
Eventually I wasn't lonely. Eventually there was no longing.
I was worthless.
And I don't like feeling worthless. So I don't.

It still wasn’t working as it should’ve and my symptoms were already scary enough (I was extremely numb, nauseous all the time, and wouldn’t stop shaking). So not wanting more shit put in me I stopped taking them.

I know that’s usually a bad idea and I should never stop something with such high risk factors cold turkey like that.

"So I'm Kat I'm f21. I go to college but I'm here over the summer with my family.I have a mom and dad and 2 sisters. I've been feeling very stressed here. I'm not sure how to handle it anymore. I have a car but my parents don't allow me to take it to college(pls don't ask idk), but my sister in HS takes it everywhere. And everytime something is diffirent about my car (ex the emergency break is on) she gets mad and tells me to not put it on. 

My parents are stressed all the fucking time and j mean all the time. My family is in a bad mood everything single day 24/7. And rhey get furious over small things (like for example all the spoons being dirty) will throw them over the edge. This is extremely hard to live with. My family fights everyday too about dumb stuff like the dishes or like the creamer being low. Every single day I'm struggling with my mental health bc of them. The other week I asked my dad to move the elliptical out of my room that they put in my room without asking or even telling me for that matter. My dad was screaming at me saying ""this isn't ur house"" ans no one uses the elliptical so I'm confused as to why it has to be in my bedroom. My parents wouldn't budge with it. 

And basically my whole life I've been struggling with mental health and I've told my parents countless times about it. But they tell me I'm faking it. I've had so many panic attacks in front of them and they just don't care. My sister is a junior in HS and SHE IS GETTING THERAPY. Like wtf??",2,depression

"What do you do when nothing matters?   
  
I'm 45, Male. Going through what I'm sure countless others are going through. But it sucks more when it's YOU. This ""story"" will probably jump around a bit. Sorry about that, I'll try to keep it short.   
  
Been married 20 years, no kids. I'd say I have a happy life for the most part, great wife, great dogs, a few good friends. Full time job, as well as a small  
DJ/Entertainment business. Sure, things could always be better, but I'm doing ok. The problem? I've never been more miserable. Why? ... I don't know. It's been getting progressively worse for the last 10 years at least, maybe 15? But why? Is this the beginning of a ""mid-life"" crisis? There are plenty of reasons to be happy. But I am not, & honestly can't remember the last time I was.  
  
I had goals. I have achieved some, and still have some more that might never be realized. I've slowly given up on most of them. We won't get into what they actually are, it doesn't matter. It seems the last twenty years or so, have been spent treading water for the most part. Just getting by. BUT, I'm getting by. That's a good thing. I consider myself kinda smart, I've had many ideas for side hustles etc. Nothing ever sticks. It's probably my OWN fault. Could be undiagnosed ADHD? When I was young, that was never a thing. Point is, I want more. Maybe that's part of the problem, I'm never happy enough. People say be grateful for what you have, and believe me, I am. But...  
  
My wife and I have both dealt with pretty severe health issues for years. Me, diabetic for over 20 years, on insulin. This has led to multiple foot problems. But, thankfully, they all seem fixed. I had 2 foot surgeries last year. Everything seems good now. Other than the diabetes, I'm pretty healthy. Chubby, but healthy. She's doing good too, despite her struggles. These are good things. I should be happy.   
  
I SAY I'm healthy, but AM I? The Docs say ""For the most part, your doing pretty good. Ya need to quit smoking though"". My problem is ME. I don't love how my life has gone. I see friends and acquaintances doing (what looks like) so much better. Thriving small businesses, nice houses, shops, etc. I've been working toward the same thing for years,..and nothing. Also, no real vision of how to get it done. (the shop part at least, credit sucks due to medical bills) My Dad passed away when I was a year old, so none of that cool fatherly advice, or help. This is NOT a pitty party for me, I don't want that. Just pointing out facts. I also had big dreams involving music. None of which came anywhere close to true. I'm a drummer, not in a band currently. I've thought seriously about selling everything. The full DJ trailer, the drums, everything. I'm from a small town, so not much out there anymore. I don't know what I'd do without an outlet for music. But I don't know what to do WITH it either.   
  
But it's not ALL doom and gloom. I have a modest house, and small garage that we own. Also, no credit cards. These are good things.   
  
But, I'm still generally miserable.   
  
I used to be over 350 lbs. and my body has taken a hit because of it. My ankles, knees, feet, back etc. always hurt. I drink a little, nothing too bad. Six or so when I mow the yard etc. pretty normal stuff for any guy really. I've tried the jazz lettuce. I like it. May have to get a medical card, since I can do that here in Ohio. I have a somewhat stressful job. So does the wife, we're both in Management. I work all week, then the weekends are either DJ gigs, or doing work around the house/yard. Currently, the wife is off work due to hip surgery (she's almost better), my truck is broken, lawnmower is broken, house needs some small repairs. Not enough money or time to fix everything. I know it sounds like I'm just bitching, and I am. BUT, back to my original question. What do you do? I know I'm not the only one. 

I used to have dreams. Now I just foresee more of the same until I die. I see NO reason to care, try, or plan for the future. I have no one to talk to about this stuff and no way to make sense of anything. It's not like I'm suicidal, but I've seen enough. I don't care what happens. I wouldn't kill myself, it would be terrible for my wife, mother, even dogs. But then that means I'm just living for them, not me. I'm just so over it, and I don't see any way out. So, I'll go to bed & be pissed that I woke up, again.",2,depression
"I don’t know how to keep on

Hey Guys,
First off all: Sorry for the length and my english grammar (should have went to school more often back then lol).
I’m suffering from a very specific issue for almost 2 years now and it slowly took possession of me. To give u a little background information i was (at least the way I see things) a very bad person in my teenage years. I did awkward things to gain attention from people and to get “cool”. I bullied people, i went out drinking in parks with bad people, i did drugs etc. and just acted so goofy. In this timeline some people from around my town started laughing at me, took pictures from me in the bus without no clear reason and I experienced a lot of very specific issues which, since they happened i’m constantly feared of. After I finished this first phase of anxiety things went quite well till I got encountered again. People I didn’t knew were yelling my name. So I was starting to ask myself again why those people would shout my name, what they may know about all those awkward things I did etc. At this point, I was hyper aware of every person walking by and as soon as I thought people were watching me I felt anxious and started to panic. I even feel people are standing in front of my house in order to wait for me in order to just make my life terrible. I’m not quite sure if this really happens but I’m constantly looking for signs which may were left for me in order to make me feel bad. From this point, I just feel followed everywhere I go, I’m feared that people know me and i didn’t went out with my friends for 1 year. I’m pretty much stuck in my room isolating myself. I went to a therapist who diagnosed me with depression. I tried to take the advice from my therapy but I’m just too feared to do anything. I’m even scared to sit in my own backyard because people could notice where I live and follow me. I just hate myself for what I have done and I can’t get over my old me. Slowly, suicidal thoughts added up. I feel unable to take serious actions against this. I also talked to my friends about this issue but it seems as they don’t really taking me serious plus i don’t want to annoy them every time we see each other. I don’t even eat while the sun is up because I’m feared people could see me through the windows. I was wondering if you guys maybe made similar experiences as I did.",5,paranoia

"I’ve dated, had one-night stands, one friend of with benefits.

No one has ever told me romantically that they love me. Or that I’m beautiful (I have been told what features on my body are unattractive by the men I’ve gone out with.)

I sleep with a guy once and they lose interest, so now I feel like my naked body is vile to look at. I go on a date with a guy once, and never hear from him again, so maybe I’m both ugly AND I have a bad personality.

It’s just crushing me. The unyielding loneliness is always there.

I’m tired of people telling me to love myself before someone else can love me. Bullshit. Insecure people find relationships ALL THE TIME.

They say “put yourself out there”. I have a pretty decent social life and don’t get approached romantically. I’ve been on dating apps for 23 years so it’s not like I haven’t blurred that. I go to bars and the only time a male stranger acknowledges I exist is when they’re interested in whatever friend I’m with.

I’m working so hard to stay alive. Other parts of my life are a disaster right now, but the lack of companionship throughout my entire adult life just hurts the most. I don’t know how much longer I can do this.

EDIT: fuck, man. Being a woman sucks ass so much. We’re not even allowed to be sad on the internet without manipulative, evil men trying to use the opportunity for sex.

If you have something to say, you can comment on this post. I’m at least mentally stable enough to see how fucked up it is that guys see this as a dating ad. I just wanted to be with people that could relate to my pain, not people who see my hurt and go “I can work with this.” Your interest in messaging me is manipulative and gross and only adds to my sadness because your interest in me is LITERALLY founded in what you can take from me.

"I'll try to keep this from being too long-winded.   
  
Something that has plagued me for years, and even now that I'm diagnosed and on medication, is this reoccurring phenomenon wherein I'll get lost in my head hyperfocusing on painful traumatic events from school (sometimes old jobs), while I'm in the middle of doing things I love (or it can even be stuff I don't particularly enjoy such as chores).

&#x200B;

As an example, I am a musician and a game designer, more proficient at the former than the latter since, but I've had a passion for both (or just creating ANYTHING) since I was a child. I also have a deep passion for cooking. So there I'll be, tweaking the rhythm section on a song, working out why the heck I can't get the dang main character to move to the left when he jumps, or simply trying not to make a mess while thickening the roux for the night's meatball and vegetable dinner; the task at hand seems to be done almost robotically, though I am actively thinking about it. It seems though that most of my **conscious** focus will be on reliving a painful moment from school; usually going over what I wish I would've said or wondering why none of my “friends” ever came to my defense too often, wondering why none of the adults around me could catch on to what was happening, wondering why so many adults who couldn't deal with children were left in charge of children etc. All the while I'm actively doing this task. No one observing me would have a clue that I was focusing on anything but that task.  
  
A little background: I (35M) went virtually undiagnosed until *last year*, which is when I finally got on meds. I'm still getting used to the meds, but they are definitely making a difference and have allowed me to accomplish a lot of things I otherwise wouldn't have. YAY! I just wish they didn't feel like they went right through me after only three hours. Boo! (Also I say “virtually undiagnosed”, because I recall at least one failed attempt to get a diagnosis in my *YOUNGER* youth. Came up negative, so then came the “well there's no excuse blah blah blah” song and dance from the adults).   
  
For what it's worth, I went to **14** different schools in my school “career”, not including the few blissful years I was homeschooled. I'm *not* a military brat, in fact the entire duration I was in school, my family **only moved** ***once***. Every other school year though, I was in a new school environment. Sometimes the start of the year where I could kind of start fresh, many times right in the middle of the year where I had to be the new guy. School is a HUGE sore spot for me. I have so much resentment and untreated wounds from those days (some physical). It seems the downside of being recently diagnosed means I'm going back into these memories and making sense of everything and having to relive things that I was trying to put away. Pre-K through second grade were...ok, but not horrific (all the time). When I discovered my appetite in the third grade, began gaining weight and started wearing these big dorky glasses, things just kind of went downhill from there socially. I've got so much to tell and get off my chest but at the risk of writing a huge book here, I'll save it (unless you're interested to hear and wanna compare notes or something).   
  
I've searched around a few times, but never could find if anyone else ever went through a similar thing. Sure, being stuck in traumatic memories is definitely a thing for us, but what about when you're actively trying to focus on something that's supposed to bring you joy? Can anyone else relate? How do you cope? I know medicine isn't a magic cure-all, but it's kind of frustrating that it doesn't shut any of that up.",3,adhd

It's especially bad when I go outside, I feel my heart beating so fast and can barely catch my breath, I am so afraid. I make eye contact with other people, but only for a split second to try and see their intentions. If it looks like they are going to walk too close to me, or worse still brush past me and touch me, I will honestly cross the road. I do this multiple times in every journey, to the point where I think I must look like a lunatic. 

If somebody has to cross my path and walk behind me, I will turn my neck and follow them to make sure they don't come too close. 

Plus, I feel like nearly everyone is watching me. As in, when I walk past another person they will turn their head and look at me, I never know why and it just makes me even more uncomfortable than I already am. It's like they can see into my mind and know how scared I am.

"There isn't a lot of people in my life that I can express this to soo here I am. I've always had a very hard time using words to express what I really want to say. That equals to a lot of stuttering and stammering until I give up and usually get frustrated with myself. Writing helps.

I work a part time job and I get paid ten dollars an hour. This is relevant later. This is my first job out of college and I genuinely love my job. I've been working for about a year and while I enjoy what I do I cant help but feel stagnant. After a year working I still have nothing to show for it.  I still live at home. I don't know how to drive and my parents usually drive me everywhere. Do I hate this? Yes, very much. It's not that I'm not allowed to drive, I just don't have anyone to teach me (different story) or a car to use.

It's gotten to the point that I feel resentment towards my own home. I wake up everyday and I don't want to get out of bed. However, I realized that I completely despise my bed. I hate my room (I share with my sister). I hate all of my stuff that I used to love and collect. I hate all of my clothes and how they fit me. I want to buy more clothes but I cant because I don't make enough to just splurge on myself. I have a car payment (for a car I cant even drive) and I'm currently trying to go back to school for something low-key in the hopes of getting a better job. Everyday I see myself and I hate how I look (I'm very overweight). I sometimes wonder if I'm actually hungry or if its the ED just making me thing that I am. I'm starting to withdraw into myself and my family is noticing. I don't want them to but I also don't have the energy to keep pretending that I'm happy. How do I fix it? Does this shit actually get better or is this just my life now. My family always jokes that I'm very bitter. The thing is, I never saw myself as that. I remember always being happy and excited. I was the girl that used to hype people up. The girl that loved to yell the lyrics to songs in the car. I was the girl that wanted to go out every weekend with friends. To be described as bitter is eye opening. Like..why even try? I'm currently at work right now and all I want to do is go home. I want to sleep and just not wake up. I hate my bed but it's also the only thing that I have. It feels like an itch in my chest. It itches and itches and I want to explode.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. Like I said I don't have many people to have this conversation with and even if I did I am not sure I would be able to express it properly. I realize how all over the place my rant was, sorry. Does anything ever get better?",4,anxiety

so i vacuumed everything (including under my bed which means i have to move my entire mattress and of course there was no nest lmao), I wiped everything down, organised drawers, tidied, took the rubbish out, sleazed up anything that could attract insects in a thick plastic box, basically anything that could be cleaned or organised was. It was very much overkill as i do keep my room pretty tidy. 

to add salt into the wound of my crazy ocd cleaning spree, today i woke up with extreme fatigue and exhaustion and pain all over AND i found another FREAKING COCKROACH….. i’m so tired 😭",4,anxiety
"I need constant reassurance that someone is alive. If I don’t receive that in a timely manner, I will assume they are dead and are currently watching me spiritually.

Has anyone had this kind of paranoia. I remember I went on urban dictionary and decided to search my name for the laugh.

I saw some new posts and it was making fun of someone and saying nasty things and I thought it was about me. 

Then I searched someone’s name and found this profile that was recently created and they posted all these random things and I felt like it was similar to something that happened between me and this person.

This person was from the same country as my ex friend except they said in one of their posts they were from a different town.

"As a forward, I also have epilepsy and Asperger's.

I was at a travel conference in DC a couple weekends ago for a hobby of mine. I had a blast, and low-key ended up becoming minor-leage famous in the industry. Part of the reason for that was helping to organize and host the pre-game party in my friend's suite (so almost all the speakers were there, etc). I don't think I consumed a huge amount of alcohol (3 Pacificos and a shot-sized amount of gin and tonic), but probably more than I'm used to. I believe I had a beer or two the following night, and some wine the day before I went home. And I was rather sleep deprived the whole time. Normally I don't drink too often and when I do it's 1 beer.


Anyway, that was two weekends ago. I came back and I'm literally completely unable to focus on anything. I mean I can look at my monitor and stare blankly at it. I'll go into a directory and forget what I was looking for (which was a problem before, but now it's worse). And I'm working at a snail's pace. 


Granted there's also not a whole lot of work for me to do at the moment. I'm kinda of doing busywork. Maybe subconsciously my brain is trying to extend out the busywork because after that I'll have absolutely nothing to do? I dunno. 


But I definitely don't think the conference was a coincidence in making me feel the way I do. I went to Europe last year and came back feeling the same way for a while, but probably less-so because I actually did gave work to do when I got back, too much work to catch up on.


Anyway, thoughts on what's going on and how I can get out of this state of brain fog?",3,adhd
"Since the end of the school semester my anxiety has been getting worse at night. Probably because I’m less busy and not much is on my mind.

I’m a 20F living in a student living apartment complex and it is a busier street. But the apartment has a deadbolt, my bedroom has a deadbolt, and we put a security door stopper under the front door handle. I know that I’m safe, but I cannot stop the anxiety.

"Advice and also discussion:

I'm convinced that people think I'm bad looking or plain.

Looking at people who look how I want to look makes me feel so sick that it stops me from leaving the house sometimes. When I do go out, I tend to keep my hood up and not wear my glasses so people can't see me and I can't see people.

I've tried to talk about it with my closest friend and my elder sibling but both of them told me that the looks I'm seeing on instagram are 'unattainable' and that 'we can't all be models'. I just felt like they were calling me ugly, or at least, not beautiful. I want people to think I'm beautiful so, so, so badly.

I also do have a therapist but I don't seem to be making progress regarding this source of anxiety. 

I have really bad anxiety about this and it's making it harder to make friends. Every time I think about it too hard I have to spend hours calming myself down to get on with my day.

"This post may be triggering so proceed with caution. I’m going to talk about anxiety and specific fears/ phobias.

I’m not sure whether these are attributed solely to my anxiety or if they could be considered part of PPD and/ or delusions:

- Not wanting to take medicine from my parents as a kid, when I was sick, because I thought they were trying to poison me.

- Being resistant to taking medication in general because I think there’s something wrong with it and I’m going to be drugged.

- Fear of overdosing on medication because I don’t trust myself to remember if I’ve already taken it; this one might be justified with my DID which causes amnesia.

- I’m uncomfortable and try to avoid talking about certain things in the same room as a smartphone because I think it can hear me.

- Similarly uncomfortable with talking about anything personal over text/ messenger, for the same reason. Someone might read it.

- Wary of trying new foods in case I have an allergic reaction and die, even if I’ve read the ingredients. I can’t eat anything that anyone else has prepared for me. Sometimes this transfers to foods I already know are safe.

- Fear of choking (maybe ARFID related). It’s usually manageable but sometimes crops up and makes it extremely difficult for me to eat anything solid for days/ weeks at a time.

- This one is less common, but thinking that there’s something wrong with my body. Like maybe it’s slowly rotting on the inside. It doesn’t help that I have nightmares about things like my teeth falling out.

- Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and have to check every room in my house to make sure nobody’s broken in.

- I refuse to answer the door for anyone who isn’t in uniform and delivering a package, because they might be a criminal.

- I have a lifelong/ reoccurring fear of being falsely convicted of a crime and going to jail.

- I’m convinced that most of my friends secretly dislike me and I imagine them talking behind my back.

- Sometimes I think my partner has turned against me and I’m convinced he’s talking about me behind my back.

- Similarly, I will think my partner is cheating on me (for no reason/ without any evidence). I become fixated on the thought that he’s developed feelings for someone else.

- I tend to expect the worst from people and think they’re against me.

- If someone is late and/ or doesn’t answer their phone, I obsessively worry that they died in a car crash or something.

- I’m wary of every stranger I pass on the street because they might intend to hurt me.

- I rarely walk anywhere alone because I’m afraid of being assaulted or kidnapped.

- When I’m driving I easily become convinced that someone is following me.

- Sometimes I’m afraid that a loved one is going to end up murdering me for no reason.

- If anyone near me is holding a knife, I don’t trust them. No matter who it is.

- If a strange coincidence happens, I easily become convinced that it means something and I start searching for patterns around me

"So I use to live in a Caribbean island where crime isn’t too good. Like you hear wild things. A innocent jewelry man was followed from his job and the robbers blocked the road, told him to leave his car at gun point, robbed him, and murdered him. A girl was driving with a friend when someone tailgated and bumped her car. She came out the car to investigate and she got kidnapped, raped, and dropped off. Imagine women being targets in their CARS. 

These crazy news got me paranoid thinking I’ll get a home invasion. Both of my parents are  in poor health so they can’t defend themselves. 

What makes me fear that I’m a high risk of home invasion is that we live in the rainforest alone with no neighbors and we have no security system. We have a vicious dog that hates strangers so I hope that can deter them. However I cant escape and hide in the bushes because the dog may attack me (The dog doesn’t recognize me since I live in the states). Whenever I hear all my dogs barking outside I get extremely anxious thinking someone is coming to harm us all. I even called the cops once and my mom got mad saying it’s the deer that the dogs are barking at. 

I really wanna visit my family more often but the fear of home invasion makes me not stay as often and only stay for a week.

Is there any advice or support you can give me to not fear of home invasion. I just fear a whole bunch of guys come and held us on gunpoint and I then get raped, and they leave with valuables and possibly our lives",4,anxiety

"So my diagnosis process has been anything but smooth. At first my doctor brushed off my issues as depression and anxiety. Put me on meds for both and they got worse. Way worse. I was almost sent to a psychiatric hospital bad. Then he suspected bipolar. Kept me on the other two meds but added meds for bipolar. I started to hallucinate and get even worse! He got rid of the anxiety meds and the depression got really bad. The anxiety had almost completely gone away. I was unable to stay wake for more than an hour at a time. I failed high school and have to go through the expensive process of getting my GED. After enough complaints from my teachers, parents, family, and myself my doctor took me off my meds and agreed to do a screening for ASD and ADHD. (ADHD runs in my family.) when doing the screening the only things that flagged for ADHD were the lap over ones for ASD. Well now since he prolonged my diagnosis process till after I hit 18. The only place that will do a diagnosis for autism is TWO HOURS out of my city. That isn’t even accounting for the distances in the cities I’d have to go just to get to the exact location. There is a doctor in my city but the oldest people he diagnosed are 17. I’ve been telling my doctor teachers have raised concerns of me being autistic for long before I was 17. My doctor has made things difficult for me from the start with almost everything. Stomach issues, my transition, therapy, and even just simple blood work so I know if I have some of the genetic conditions that run in my family. I’ve got the paperwork for the place outside of my city because I finally want a set in stone answer so I can access the proper accommodations I’ve needed since day one. I’m gonna take them in when I have my next appointment. I’ve already had my local hospital help with my transition (which I find out if I start hormones on Monday or a later date!) I’ve done my research on this and honestly once this is all said and done I want to be a voice for people like me in my city because this situation is so draining and isolating. Please tell me my doctor isn’t the only one? I’m not even self diagnosing the screening said I’m autistic and should do the full diagnosis. Teachers have said I probably autistic. If it weren’t for them I would have never even started the process because I thought I was “normal” compared to my family… sorry if that made no sense at all. I’ve had a busy week last week and I still haven’t fully recovered. 

TLDR: doctor has made my diagnosis process 10x harder by pushing off the actual diagnosis until after I was 18. Now I have to leave my entire city just for one appointment that could have been done here if he had acted 3 years faster.",1,autism
"im 33 and ever since ive left college i feel like i've just been consistently trying to process/deal with feeling overwhelmed by how lonely and isolating adulthood is. Everyone i know is busy enough where i only see my 'friends' once every 3 months(at best). I get it, kids, jobs, im not blaming people. When trying to meet people, its like swimming upstream to find people with any common interests, and even harder finding someone that has chemistry with you. i have chronic digestive problems so i cant really go out to eat or drink, which makes up a majority of how adults socialize from what i can tell. To be entirely honest, i dont like doing that anyways, i find no joy in being surrounded by loud strangers, so while most people are grabbing a drink to feel connected, i only feel isolated. 

 I have a helpful strategy of being paranoid of my depressive thinking patterns, but its not as effective here because while I feel like ive lost my passion for anything i was passionate for, im starting to get paranoid that my depression is either so invasive that its tricking me into believing life is this empty, or (when i think about it logically) being a lonely human all the time is making me depressed and passionless. I spoke to my girlfriend about joining clubs to try to meet people and i literally have zero interest. I hate large groups of people, and meeting new people in this manner. I just get anxiety and i will feel uncomfortable the entire time, and not to be overtly negative, but ive tried it enough times with no success that ive lost my desire to 'get back out there' so to speak, because its always amounted to lost time and stressful experiences, and having a lot of phone numbers i dont want to call.

Anyways, the one thing i miss about my college experience was having a community of people i would see every day that was working on the same goals and could help eachother out, or hangout regularly. Now it just feels like im floating in a sea of nothing, waiting for a random ship to sail by, and im not looking forward to doing this for another 20, 30, or 40 years. This isnt fulfilling.

"I recently realized something about the Incredibles. I interpret it as an allegory for Nice Guy Syndrome. To be clear, I do not think that the writers intended it this way, that is simply how I chose to interpret it. 

Nice guy syndrome is when you feel entitled to romantic affection for simply behaving like a decent person. The flaw in this line of reasoning is two fold. First of all, being kind, treating your fellow human beings with respect and giving them what is rightfully theirs is an expected trait of every human being. If being nice were all that it took to not only get into a relationship, but also make the relationship work, that guy or lady in whom you are interested would already be in a relationship. Second, and more to the point, no one is entitled to a romantic relationship. It is called nice guy syndrome, because most of the people who suffer from it are heterosexual men, but women and gay men can experience it too. 

Nice guys syndrome is scary, as it can lead to such violent attrocities as the mass shooting committed by Elliot Rodger in May of 2014. Elliot Rodger was a now dead YouTuber and famous Incel when he was alive. Incel is short for involuntary celibate and it refers to man who is not sexually active or is not in a relationship, but desperately wants to be. In May of 2014, Elliot stabbed three men in his apartment, went to a sorority at the University of California, Santa Barbara to shot three female students (killing two), drove to a nearby deli to shot and kill a male student inside, speed through Isla Vista to run over several people with his car, had a shoot out with the police where in he recieved a nonfatal shot to the hip and eventually crashed into a parked car. Eventually, he was found by police dead from suicide carried out with his hand gun. Before committing this mass murder, Elliot uploaded a YouTube video titled Elliot Rodger's Retribution, where in he outlined his plan to kill several people, including himself. Here is a link to the Wikipedia page about Elliot:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014\_Isla\_Vista\_killings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Isla_Vista_killings)

Yeah, nice guy syndrome causes stuff like that. 

If you really think about it, Syndrome is like Elliot Rodger. Rodger held resentment toward women who would not date him and at men who got dates instead of him. Rodger felt entitled to a relationship. Young Buddy Pine felt entitled to be Mr. Incredible’s side kick. Just like no one is entitled to a relationship, Buddy was not entitled to be Mr. Incredible’s side kick. If Rodger where interested in a woman and said hypothetical woman decided to exercise her right to spurn his advances, he should have just moved on to a different woman. Similarly, if Buddy wanted to be someone’s side kick and Mr. Incredible decided to exercise his right to work alone if he so pleases, Buddy could have asked a different super for permission to be a side kick. Buddy proved himself to have genius level intellect, inventing weapons more powerful than just about any super power. Buddy could have become a super hero himself. 

When Syndrome monologues about his motivations, Mr. Incredible apologises for the way he treated young Buddy Pine. It is unclear if Mr. Incredible really meant what he said or if he was kissing Syndrome’s butt, because Syndrome was a threat. I really hope it is the latter. The truth is, Mr. Incredible did not mistreat young Buddy pine at all. Mr. Incredible was nice, he stood for photos and signed every scrap of paper Buddy pushed at him. Buddy had a bloated sense of entitlement and crossed a line when he demanded Mr. Incredible accept him (Buddy) as his side kick, entered Mr. Incredible’s car without his permission and refused to take no for an answer. If Mr. Incredible did not want a sidekick, it was Mr. Incredible’s right to work alone. Mr. Incredible is allowed to reject Buddy’s request to be his side kick for any reason, no reason at all or even a made up reason. When Buddy went to go get the police, he had a bomb on him. Mr. Incredible grabbed Buddy and removed the bomb. Buddy yelled at Mr. Incredible for wrecking his flight patterns. For over a decade after the fact, Buddy held resentment toward Mr. Incredible and never realized that Mr. Incredible saved his life. If Mr. Incredible had just let Buddy get blown up, Bomb Voyage wouldn’t have gotten away, the L-train accident wouldn’t have occurred, and neither would the genocide of the super heroes.",0,negative_samples

**I was going to consult dr ruscio institute (I am not sure if its good sounds too good to be true, promotes no testing and cheaper costs??) , or coreperform (dietician in the US, bit too costly) if I chose the online option. In my local area, I am still not sure... bit costly.**

I was told to go on a low fodmap diet, which i didn't because it doesn't really solve anything and kind of implies I have to be on it forever, because if I stop it will come back.

I have IBS- C, bloating, indigestion, etc. many food intolerances, mouth symptoms like ulcers, burning, sourness, bitterness in mouth and white coating on tongue which get worse with some foods,  reflux,

I also have mouth eczema, for around 8 months now

Ive been told it was fibromyalgia, but not anymore. and that I have chronic myofascial pain syndrome, which is not even a useful diagnosis. **And I have benign hypermobility.**

**3. Right now I cope with my symptoms to help using:**

probiotics, aloe vera drink, Traditional chinese medicine

avoiding gluten, dairy, citrus foods (for my mouth eczema), processed foods, sugary foods, fried, spicy, oily I have to avoid, high formal also I try to like garlic and onion makes me mouth peel... and like very dry

I go physio once a month but it seems kinda pointless just manual therapy and the effects last like 1 hr when I start walking and moving it comes back the tension. 

and the physio can’t give me any simpler exercises , it usually makes the tension and compensations worse . I expected exercises that help with my twisted tightens  and posture I feel , and give relief , but did not get that. So idk if I should find someone else or another modality, but honestly bit tired of it I tried lot and hard to find any better ones in Sydney ….  

It has improved a bit, less extreme pain since the first two years of having chronic pain and tension, and also i started getting more body awareness of the positions and how my body was tensing up. But progress seems too slow and maybe worse...  cuz I ended up having mouth eczema and still having bunch of symptoms...

&#x200B;

**4. I honestly don't know what is the main part of my symptoms, should I sort out my gut, or anxiety, or biomechanics? i question if it is due to my anxiety and trauma, because I've heard people heal symptoms of gut issues like through mind body work, based off the theory of dr john sarno's work of TMS (tensomyositis syndrome).**

**Or should I just stick to what I am doing now for symptom relief and get my routine, in order?** I am quite overwhelmed and struggle to stick to routines or time management. also quite anxious already. But I don't think or know what im doing now if its going to heal permanently or just feeling sub par forever,",0,negative_samples
"This past week I started getting itchy bumps all over and we think it’s our laundry detergent because of the timing and where the spots are appearing, like on my arms and bra lines. However, I’m also getting really itchy and dry eyelids, and I’m having trouble imagining much of our laundry coming into contact with my face. Over the past 5-7 years I’ve gradually developed seasonal allergies, and I’m thinking that my eyes being itchy might be due to pollen. But I just haven’t had seasonal allergies that long, so I don’t have like a pattern to compare it to. Would the rash from the laundry detergent affect my immune system to make me more sensitive to the pollen too? Is that a thing? Or should I be looking for some other source that would explain the weird dry eyelids and the rash at the same time?  

We also recently went camping and I initially thought the rash was poison ivy exposure but then the bumps kept popping up elsewhere several days after we were home and all our things had been washed.",0,negative_samples

" 

Back story: I used to work at a small independent grocery store. There was a man Tim (not his real name) who was a regular customer. He was creepy guy, I don’t have anything specific to say why, he just gave me the creeps the way sometimes people do. At some point he applied for a job at the store. After he was passed over for the job, he became somewhat of a nuisance to management. He would regularly visit the store and talk to the owner, or the meat department manager, trying to convince them to hire him. I was also a manager and, one day, I saw a letter he had written to the owner, begging him to give him a chance and hire him. It was in this letter that I learned the reason they wouldn’t hire him. He had a criminal record that involved theft at a former workplace. 

Fast forward, I no longer work at the store. I quit two years ago. The weird thing is that I keep seeing Tim. I see him at the grocery store, walking on the sidewalk as I drive by, in a vehicle that I pass while driving. One of the weirder encounters was when I placed a curbside pick-up order at McDonalds and Tim was the person that brought the order out to my car. I live in a meduim-ish populated town (about 60K people) It feels weird that I keep seeing this guy. Why do you all think?",5,paranoia
"My friends and I are autistic too but our symptoms don't manifest like his. We're all incredibly independent (Even though we all constantly crave guidance) And our friend is so dependent that hes willing to put up with abuse.

So we have a friend who's 25 and mildly autistic. His Mom is a narcissistic psychopath who treats him like a servant. His dad is afraid of his mom but hes too old to do anything. They live in the deep country and he has nobody around him to help. No family. No friends that live nearby, we live states away.

Ever since September we've been flying/driving down and visiting him, but nothing we do can convince him to even spend one night outside of his home. His entire life is under lock and key, he's even afraid of walking away from his parents at the supermarket. He has a breakdown and starts sobbing like a kid every time we ask him to tell his parents to let him spend one night outside of his home. We always feel terrible about asking this, but in the same breath he'll tell us he's unhappy and feels like a prisoner. It's even gotten to the point where hes been lying in manipulating us to try to get us to do things for him because he refuses to stand up to his mom. He told us that his parents were beating him, but then he admitted that that was a lie. He was just trying to think up ways where he could legally justify leaving. But it was always legal, hes just afraid of standing up to the mental abuse. 

He even catfished a girl from another state to fly down and visit him without telling her the way that he was living, and tried to manipulate her into a long distance relationship and sex. She spent $2000 on him during her visit because he was really good at telling her what she wanted to hear over the internet, like a fantasy. She dumped him after he couldnt keep the charrade up any longer. He didn't want to take advantage of her initially, but hes so desperate to have a life outside of his abusive mom he's willing to do anything. His dad really wants him to move out and move on, and not tell his mom. But he keeps telling his mom because he wants her to support him. (I think he tells his mom because he's secretly afraid of growing up, but thats just me) In reality she just wants to use him like a slave until the ""Great Lord"" takes her away. 

Shit's psychotic but we have no idea how to help him. We keep giving him numbers and people who have spare rooms but he refuses all the help. (And then after feeling abandoned he wants the help again) We've driven down for hours (some of us drove for 6 hours) and ask him to come with us but he chickens out at the very last second every single time. But he tries to get us to do it again 6 months later! We're tired dude, we want to help him but we have no idea what to do at this point. He obviously needs therapy but no one will drive him to therapy. He obviously needs support but no one with power will support him and hes too afraid to leave.

"Ever since I learned about ADHD, it’s like a veil has been lifted. I have almost every sign except the big one - getting up from my seat haha - and have had them since I was a kid. I’m 31 now. Everything is making sense, from the hyperfixations to lying in the dark, to my procrastination and the debilitating inability to get out of bed, cook, or clean consistently.

My therapist is very supportive. She and I are working on what would be helpful if I do have ADHD, but she is also trying to be mindful and purposeful in not diagnosing me. We are just working on strategies together. She is also great at just reminding me that I have already lived a life finding ways to navigate the world, and I only need to dive into treatment options if there are things I need support with. For the most part, I have strategies to process, explore, add disclaimers, etc whatever I need to to get through the social aspects (I am very much a talker and “oversharer”), but the executive functioning struggle is super painful.

But idk - I have a fear that I won’t be diagnosed for it (is this ~~RSD~~ um emotional dysregulation lol). I do have a significant trauma background, but I think it’s evident to me now at least that it’s a little bit of a chicken or egg scenario - I had some significant traumatic experiences when I was a young child, but the lower grade, long-term secondary trauma was I think compounded on by ADHD.

"I can’t be completely honest with the people around me but cannot keep bottling this all up, so I’ve resorted to telling strangers on the internet. It’s a long post. 

I struggled with depressive thoughts my whole life. But this has got worse these past few months for one main reason and a couple other reasons that have compounded on top of the main one. I am just so sick and tired of pretending I’m at least a little bit okay to a majority of people other than my mum. Who I can’t even tell everything to. 

Recently, my thoughts have deteriorated to thoughts of suicide, nothing that will be acted upon at this moment. I’m just so sick and tired of feeling this way. I don’t want to die, I just want the pain to end. 

I have moved into a new house since the split and I just feel like an imposter. The three of them get on really well and whenever I get in the vicinity they go quiet and when I try and join in conversation they just disperse and everything ends. Even after I’ve heard them laughing and joking. I pay rent in two places, one is with the girl I love, who isn’t in love with me back, and the other I have bad imposter syndrome in. 

Medications don’t seem to help and fluoxetine actually had nasty side affects that were worse. The closest medication seems to get is making me feel numb, a complete and whole lack of emotion seemed to actually make the thoughts of wanting to die even stronger, if I can’t even feel emotions then what is even the point of bein alive? 

I wrote a very long suicide note and a couple individual ones to certain people, not sure why. Maybe in case I just decide to do it one day. So at least they’re there as back up. 

I have two key reasons to not at this moment. One is my mum told me when I was really bad and she sensed something that if I do anything it’ll probably kill her as well. She’s not very well and I do believe her and if my mum died then my sisters life would crumble as well. Which cannot happen as she has two kids, of which I am in her will as the next of kin. She has a bit of a dangerous brain condition and she wanted to be safe. 

The other reason is that it would probably devastate my ex. Her leaving was what triggered this steep decline, i don’t hold any negative feelings toward her at all, actually the opposite. But it wouldn’t be a stretch for her if she heard that I had actually done it that the steep decline as a result of the breakup led to this, and I wouldn’t want her to feel guilty if I did do anything. To bear the thought of my mum and her hearing about this and their reactions is probably the main reasons I haven’t done anything serious.  

I just needed to tell anyone. I’m seriously losing motivation. The doctors don’t really help and are just trying medications to hope something works. Doesn’t seem like they really care that much. I’m starting to feel like a lost cause. Destined to be alone and depressed. Like I said I don’t want to die, I just want the pain to end. 

I just had to tell anyone that would listen (or read), it’s getting too tiring to hold the thoughts in.",2,depression
"I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia last year but have been suffering with symptoms since 2013. 

I haven't been able to hold down a job for very long on average. However I took up a nightshift job at a supermarket in 2020 and been able to hold that done for 1 and half years before having a major psychosis period that lasted most of 2022. I have since moved on to day shift but have had to take 3 periods off sick because of my symptoms. 

My question is, is how effective are meds supposed to be?

And, one of them tries to plan things without me being there and talks behind my back. Maybe they even have a gc without me in it.

It ruined my mood for the whole day, and thats coming from someone who can go from sad to happy in a minute. Do you think these are signs of paranoia? Or something like it?

Was tweaking like he was on hard drugs we had no choice but to call an ambulance and he continued to be agitated screaming at people etc. I want to do my best to help him. My ideas is to get him on some sort of dopamine detox because I believe losing touch with nature and being so consumed by technology especially since covid has negatively effected us all.

"For the past 5 years my employment has been extremely inconsistent due to a panic disorder. I was first put on medication ( Zoloft w/ xanax for breakthrough anxiety) at 14 (25 now). Got off all meds at 19. Since then, it's been a total rollercoaster of panic attacks one month, depression the next, and so on.  
  
Should I get back on the meds if that was the only thing that helped? Therapy (CBT, EMDR, Hypnosis, Exposure-Response) didn't help. I can't even exercise anymore without having a panic attack from my heart rate increasing. Even getting excited about positive things can throw me into a panic. My digestive system is in shambles from the constant anxiety, and I am at risk of losing my job. I'm a substitute teacher and a uni student and this condition is sucking the life out of me. The way I see it, I can stay off meds and lose it all, or take them as needed and keep my job.

Forgot to mention that SSRIs didn’t do much for my panic attacks. I was constantly having breakthrough anxiety and the only thing that quelled the panic was Xanax. I can manage baseline anxiety just fine, it’s the panic attacks that mess me up. I’ve been fighting getting back on benzodiazepines as I know how addictive they are.

"I was going to try and make this short but it probably needs a bigger explanation. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for 5 years. 5 months ago I had a mental breakdown where I tried to hurt myself (I am not in that position now so don’t worry) 

Anyway I have been off work since then and am due to have a sickness meeting with my manager and HR  to see how they can ‘support me back to work’. My work place has an Occupational Health department who have been very supportive and helpful and have been liaising with my manager instead of me having to do it. 

My manager is new, and from conversations before I have come to realise he doesn’t know what we go through with anxiety and depression, you don’t really know unless you suffer yourself or are a trained profesional. 

So about going back to work, I am worried that I am going to go back whilst in a good phase then drop back to rock bottom and my manager think I am trying to pull something. I often have a good couple of weeks then drop to rock bottom and it takes me a month or so to come out of it and that happens in cycles. 

How do I get my manager and HR to understand this and to understand that just because on was on top of the world one day doesn’t mean I’ll be like that the day after? 

I am scared of going back to work and this happening and then being penalised for something I can’t control.

"TL;DR: Always tired. Don't enjoy things. Want to sleep forever but also feel waking up makes sleep feel special. Just wished I didn't chicken out on my suicide attempts.

I'm always just so damn tired, life just feels like I'm surviving everyday and not truly living. I can't even think back to the last time I felt like I was truly living life. 

I haven't been enjoying any of my hobbies or felt connections in my social life. All of it just feels like nothing to me. No real good feelings or bad are associated with it. I can't even think much on events after they happen, it's just like ""This thing is done now, time to forget the emotions that should be attached to that moment.""

Thus my title, I want to sleep forever. Sleeping is a void where I simply am not conscious. It is concerning that I want this so bad, some of my best moments are when I'm under the influence of something that lessens my consciousness and thus I feel better but sleeping is the ultimate way to get there because well I'm not conscious then. That peaceful moment of nothingness is something I deeply crave and that is concerning, death scares because eternity of nothingness is terrifying if that's what it'll be but the brief moments in sleep are just comforting. I both want that forever but I also feel what makes it special is the fact I wake up and have to suffer being awake and then be rewarded with sleep.

It's sad I know but sure I guess that's why I'm writing this here. Just yeah would be a hell of a lot easier if I didn't chicken out on the suicide attempts I made in the past that's for sure anyway haha.",2,depression

"Bit of backround. Sophmore year of highschool I broke, hit with sever anxiety and depression disorders  that I still struggle with to this day. Dropped out, went in and out of various therapists and programs. Some helped, some didn't. Im sure many here know the story.   


I try my best. I live on my own, pay the bills well. With my disability coverage im reasonably comfortable, the ever crumbling economy not withstanding. But despite it all I never feel like im enough.   


I just..can't handle everything. Not all at once. Something always slips. Maybe I forget to clean the bathtub during my chore list. Or I keep putting off my dentist appointment because the bills scare me so much it stops me from doing anything else. Or just...getting the trash out.   


I always, without fail, can't handle EVERYTHING I need too. Most, but not all. And everyone reminds me of the fact.. What set off my current episode was I called my aunt, the woman who took me in temporarily after my mother died, to wish her a happy mothers day. Barely took her a minute of conversing to remind me im ""Really good at not keeping appointments."" And it just...it hurt so much.   


Apart from my therapist, no one seems to understand that even if I seem to be doing well, every day is a struggle to get done what I can. I always feel like im swimming with my head just barely above the water. Some days I choke and have to stop to cough out. Other days im mostly okay. But it never stops being a fact of im barely swimming as it is, any everyone expects me to handle it, or get stronger to handle it. But no matter what I do or how much progress I make, there's always... more. More appointments, more chores, more things I need to do that I inevitibably fail at in one way or another.   


So now, here I am again. Four trash bags sitting in the corner. Bed half made and falling apart. Clothes strewn about. Carpet needs vacuming, and I haven't eaten a proper meal in about 16 hours.. and im too cold to do anything. Too...empty.   


Why even bother? Nothing I do is enough for anyone, and those few who get it can't help for one reason or another. Im not even feeling like...sad sort of depressed. Or maybe I am? Tears tickle my eyes but I don't...feel anything but cold. Cold and Empty. I don't know anymore.

"I'm a freshie in high school, and I have an IEP. This IEP calls for ""frequent check-ins"" if I remember correctly, and there's a specific teacher that is so brutally condescending towards my friend and I. The worst thing is, since it's on our IEPs, she thinks she's helping us. I have tried being upfront to her about this, but she was dismissive of it and said ""Go to class"" I don't know if she was offended, but people need to stop being so polite about their feelings. If you're going to be offended, TELL me. With that aside, she is pretty much *constantly* in my business during my class with her, and it feels too awkward to talk to her about it after that incident. It's like I'm locked in a stalemate. She always says things along the lines of ""I need you to inventory"" or ""I need you to edit \[A thing she wants me to change\]"" When I'm not prepared for class. You could just be saying ""I see you don't have your notebook out, here's a reminder to take it out"" or something like that but it *always* has to be these implied, childish sounding things that seem just so infuriatingly belittling.

"  

Before I was officially and correctly diagnose with autism a few decades later, I had an inaccurate diagnose speech impediment because I suspect my parents knew something was clearly wrong with me but didn’t want to admit it.

This doesn’t seem never talked about on the internet (as far as I’m aware of), no one seems to be aware that people with autism also talk differently but that depends where they are.

I have a speech therapist (who is a wonderful man) that helped me with my accent ‘problem’, turns out that I spoke in a rhotic pattern (look that up because I am not going to explain it to youse).

You cannot imagine what it was like for me throughout my life, I’ve continually experience accentism, been singled out because I talk different, I mean why people want to know where you are from? It’s none of their f\*cking business where I was from.  People assume I’m from America or Ireland despite I’m an Australian by several generations, I mean do you ask a black guy if he is from Africa? No you don’t because that is rude! 

Shrek: *People judge me before they get to know me*

You shouldn’t single out someone on how they sound, especially the colour of their skin, I learnt that the hard way.

I was constantly singled out because of my speech! Youse have no idea what it feels life to be alienated because been sound different,

Sadly this had made me loath my own fellow aussies because of this, why are people offended because I sound different? 

When I did meet my speech therapist who was rather sympathetic to me, My speech wasn’t the problem despite I pronounced words the way they are literally spelt! Aussies seem to have a problem with things when I pronounced rhotic words with an R (rhotic pattern).

I’m an Australian citizen that has sadly lost part of an identity because aussies are upset by the way I sound, I can now speak with an Australian accent thanks to my speech therapist but I am mostly reserved guy, I NEVER initiate a conversation with a random stranger, I mean NEVER!

I’m a loner by circumstances and this is not to be confused with foreign accent syndrome.",1,autism

I got rejected, with a very cookie cutter rejection, which kind of hurt, but we are still good friends.

I open up my junk drawer tonight and , underneath it all I discovered my old cracked up Samsung phone

I wonder to myself, is this thing really off you know like! Absolutely dead. 

So I press the power button and the screen lights up. You cant see any thing except neon stripes, I'll just throw it in some water and that will do the trick. Right? To my horror the device will not stop despite being underwater with a cracked screen for several minutes.

Okay so Ill just open it up and take the battery out,. I Proceed to it pry it open with a screw driver, glass getting everywhere in my hands and on the floor.

Here comes the fun;.

I pry the battery out with a screwdriver and it fucking catches on fire. It' started glowing bright red so I threw back in the water and it continues to burn and melt the plastic pitcher the water was in so I run a flaming plastic fireball out the back door and plop it on the balcony , shut the door, and get my handy "" organic vapor blocking respirator"" because the smell of the fumes is ridiculously noxious.  Now i know what  lithium ion batteries are how they work, and that they are quite dangerous, so I'm not really that shocked....

What really gets me is , when I scrub the search index for "" removed my cellphone battery and it caught fire"" All I get is some consumer advisory saying, ""it's dangerous to try and replace the battery yourself"", ""No you cant change the battery on your iPhone yourself"" ""it's a way to make sure you have to upgrade"" "" Your better off just to get a new phone"" ""Woman leaves phone on charger and it explodes"" exploding cellphones are dangerous""

Just because the screen is blank, there's no way to know that phone isnt active unless the battery is disconnected and the phone is totally disassembled and destroyed.


What gets me reeling is that I cannot find one single peice of data where someone wanted to simply, disconnect the battery and throw the whole thing in the trash. Why is no else  one questioning all these millions of dead phones  ( The phone doesn't need a screen to do anything,  the screen is merely for humans to interface with)  that nobody seems concerned about. these devices are permanent,  there's a permanent record of me on that thing and I hate because it causes malfunctions, and makes my device harder to use, I have to do  daily maintenance to keep the device working correctly, it causes stress, etc etc etc, its like having a Corvette that only can go 40mph.. it's stupid!!! What a waste of time.... 

Why is it seemingly inconceivable that I wanted to just disconnect the battery and throw the shit away. I don't care at all If I damage or not. I want the thing to turn OFF ;and it won't, I just want security and peace of mind!!  

It tried to kill me!! It tried to burn me and my apartment down to the ground, it cut my hands, and THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE ALL HERE!!! JESUS CHRIST WHAT THE FUCK!!?? THE AUTHORITIES ARE ARE ASKING ME QUESTIONS?!?!?NOW EVERYONE REALLY IS LOOKING AT ME.... I I just wanted to take the battery out of my old discarded phone,  and throw it away,. It's like im in trouble or something

All this does is reinforce the thought system of my extremely paranoid personality,   I want to destroy more phones,  THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY ACTIONS CONFIRM THAT WHAT I AM THINKING IS 100% TRUE

"I was rummaging around my house and found a bunch of different behavior medicines with my name on it. Every since I got my diagnosis 7-8 years ago. My grandma has put me on every medication under the sun. I found out the same thing happened to my mom when she was diagnosed with BPD. She doesn’t talk to her anymore Just makes me feel like crap is all. Now she’s trying to get me into groups with people like me as if that would doing anything. “They’ll relate to you” idgaf. I wish I could leave but she’s telling me there’s no way I can, and that I have no options, I feel alone because she’s a shitty parent.",1,autism
"I apologise if I’m being insensitive to actually people with paranoia but I feel like I might be developing it. My dad has it and my family is full off numb nuts. I’ve been smoking weed from a young age and have stopped for a bit, I feel like everyone has an ulterior motive I can’t trust no one anymore other than family. My friend texted me saying he needed a favour/ my opinion, I asked about what, he started being all cryptic and saying shit like “you’ll have to wait to find out” then when I pressed a little more he said just a little chit chat but I can’t get to sleep, this ain’t the first time little things like this have kept me up just thinking the worst.",5,paranoia
"Eric Hill died in 2014. I haven't done an exact count, but there have been at least 30 books in the Spot series released since his death. Every single book is attributed to him.

[This Penguin Random House page on the series is surreal.](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/DVG/spot?page=1)

I hate that they do it this way, because Hill's Spot books are very cute, but the new ones are miserably soulless. Does this happen a lot? I know they're still churning out Curious Georges and Cat in the Hats, but they attribute those to the new author (or at least don't claim Rey/Seuss wrote them).",0,negative_samples
"For a few weeks now I've felt like the world around me is fake, I don't trust anything and I have anxiety attacks weekly, and I feel like it's getting worse. At certain points, I feel like people or the world around me glitches and I have a vision that the space around me will deteriorate as I wake up from this dream I feel like I'm in. I have anxiety, quite bad anxiety at that, and I've suffered from derealisation and depersonalisation many times before, but this doesn't comfort me one bit since I believe anxiety and all that is a figment of my imagination too, as a part of this fake dream world that I'm in. What do I do, I'm terrified.",4,anxiety

"My mom was diagnosed with extensive Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) in December. She’s been through chemo and radiation and is currently doing immunotherapy. One of her most troublesome symptoms has been these painful spasms that seem to move throughout her body and strike randomly. 

All the doctors she’s seen (oncologists, neurologist, specialists) are completely baffled by this. These are some of the foremost experts in this type of cancer in the country, probably even the world. She’s been tested for paraneoplastic disorders (autoimmune diseases that can occur with lung cancer), nutrient deficiencies, basically anything else possible and come up negative. The strange thing is, the spasms went away when she started chemo. Then they came back after she stopped chemo. 

This problem is really reducing her quality of life and making it difficult to do the things she enjoys. All the pain management team will do is prescribe opiates, which she doesn’t want to take (she wants to be lucid and able to do physical things). I’ve suggested CBD gummies (I have no experience or knowledge in this area, but it seems like something that might work). I think they’re going to try acupuncture as well. They’re also going to look for other opinions since there are a lot of highly renowned cancer centers relatively close by. 

Has anyone had similar experiences or had any success with pain relief through non-opiate means?",0,negative_samples

"Alright, recently Parler was kicked off of the google play store and I believe the Apple App Store, as well as Amazon's store.

I don't use Parler, never even been on it, and from what I've seen I don't agree with the content there. But is nobody concerned about the fact that it got nuked off the face of the earth because big tech companies didn't like it? What happened to ""If you don't like how our platform is run, then make your own""? How can people make their own if anything that goes against the grain is deleted.

Again, this isn't about ""Parler"" per-se, I have no personal stake or anything with the site and I really never had any intent of even using it. But this is just the latest example of a new tech upstart company getting nuked because the ""big dogs"" didn't like it in their yard and I'm getting really worried that companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, etc are essentially dictating every piece of content we see on a daily basis.",5,paranoia

I immediately freeze and she tells me to get ready and walks out. I couldn’t deal with it. earlier today i had a dentist apt. and it was hell, all of the touching and holding down and bad tastes, and then, after i was ready, she tells me to do the dishes. the dishes, for me, have all of the things wrong with them. i legitimately can’t do them for some reason, and by that i mean i have a meltdown every time i do them. anyways, i get overwhelmed and freeze. she yells at me, and the rest of my family starts to do it as well. i get overstimulated, overwhelmed, and surprised all at once, causing a meltdown and me running to my room and locking the door. and guess what? we didn’t go to colorado after all!",1,autism

"Lately, I have been going through moments of intense social anxiety. I’m assuming that it’s because I am anxious about living with my roommate. I feel like I'm constantly being watched and scrutinized for what I do and that people are talking behind my back without me noticing. Like I have this fear that someone sees something embarrassing on my phone/laptop/glasses reflection without me knowing, people are judging me for the clothes I wear/how kept my hair is/how my posture is like, how I blurt out incoherent sentences, how I pretend to know what’s going on when I don’t, how I can’t do my job properly, even me typing out this Reddit post makes me anxious because I’m afraid someone from my school/life will come upon this and identify that I wrote this. When my friends complain about other friends/acquaintances I think they’re trying to subtly hint to me that I need to fix something about myself but I’m simply unable to grasp that that is actually a targeted fact about me that they want to be polite about. I’m also a very forgetful, self deprecating, and overall insecure person and I’m also second guessing all of my paranoia.My brain is a mess and I feel like I’m living under a rock because I keep focusing on these flaws that I can fix rather than hobbies/interests. I keep asking questions to those around me/online to think lately rather than thinking for myself. It’s been like this for a while but it has gotten significantly worse now that I am sharing a living space with another person who is not my family(college roommate).",5,paranoia
"Hi, I am wondering if anyone has any experience of dealing with chronic decision anxiety. I have had it all my life and it gets worse when my overall anxiety is worse. It’s often around dates and times, but can be literally any decision, big or small. It has severely impacted my life and still does, as I procrastinate and leave all important decisions for some future date that never arrives. I feel so stuck and incapable of liberating myself from this issue. Does anyone have any advice?",4,anxiety
"Before I sound too rational and like I am not actually paranoid, I am just basing what I think reality is or should be to most people and seeing that it is not what I experience or am experiencing right now. Also the main purpose of this post is to try and find others like me or a community that deals with this. 

1. I believe my paranoid/pessimistic mental state affects the world and people around me and they start acting different. (without even speaking to them.) 
2. I have seen reasonable evidence that people are quite legitimately against me (or just evil in general) even though they were my friends. 

I will start with number 1. In my current living situation I live alone with my dog and my sister. I take the dog out frequently and today I noticed that people in their cars driving by were staring. One guy even took a photo or video of me when I was looking. He even seemed to slow the car down to do it. Usually I feel like my vision must have been obstructed but this time the window was rolled down and it looked clear as day. 

Also, It feels like when I am in this state that the world changes based on my paranoia. Like having a power that you can't control sort of way. Or one that actively goes against you. I feel like the results I am looking to have will not happen if I look forward to them too much. One example is the stock market. I feel that I should not look at the graph or it will start going against me. That is more of a soft example though. I have also been rejected from many job positions and it feels like the more I wanted it the more that obstructed. I had received an offer at a decent place only for it to be taken away by a literal pandemic. Then the company which seemed to imply they would hire everyone later rejected me over email even after all that I have been through with them (summer program they provided). Whenever I feel too happy about something it will get ripped away. 

For the second point, it seems the more I look the more evil I find. People actively don't give a shit about others. No one in this town cares about covid. 

That is not even the bigger issue to me. When I am in this state I think that it influences other peoples decisions and how they view me. Even though I never talk to them about my delusional thinking I can see it in their faces and actions. It's like they can pick up on my ""energy"" so to speak and they actively either make fun of me or avoid me. 

I am not that bad right now but there was a time I thought my GF was a literal government agent of sorts and that I had evidence to support it. I remember specifically thinking that the evidence was undeniable though I cannot seem to recall any of it.",5,paranoia
"My cognitive decline and anxiety that turns into paranoia has gotten so muc worse over the years it's so hard to keep a job and all the most accessible jobs are the ones where you have to interact with people. 
I've been avoiding going back to drinking to cope because it isn't good for my hypertension, but it just seems impossible to exist with this invisible disease. I don't want to be social. At all. And people take so much offense they try to make my life harder. Did anyone else lose their tolerance for a lot after their last really bad psychotic episode? I had severe psychosis for two years and haven't been the same and have been worse after ""recovering.""",6,schizophrenia

"*The star being : an actor/actress*

*Leader being a director. Team being set of directors and or writer/cinematography.*

*Or lastly what websites aka critics say about a movie - or the general public.*

&#x200B;

For me, its typically the movie star, but that is why in my headline I put in ""typically"". Because sometimes its not always that. I've seen just about everyone of the following 4 stars movies but that doesn't cross out negative reception I may have for their films. Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, Angelina Jolie, Sigourney Weaver.

&#x200B;

I find that in 2023 more and more are going out and seeing hated movie stars films firstly out of curiosity, but sometimes and more often because of a score given - and how widely accepted their friends/family think of it. Those things are the least of my concern - so there it goes my question.

"How am I supposed to continue if I despise everything I do. What’s the point if everything degrades into meaningless drivel or another mistake for the pile. Where’s the sense in struggling if there‘s nothing to be gained from it but endlessly recurring disappointment. When moments cease to exist and blur together to form a mass of drab bodies of experiences, all categorized, defused, stale. Where every escape leads back to the inevitable confrontation with the real infused with new anxieties and struggles.  When success is shallow and the only real emotion is exasperation in face of illusory ideals. The only thing keeping me going is the anxiety of possibility reflected in the future, which is dispelled by the inability to escape myself.",2,depression
I'm 17 but I'm left alone for extended periods of time in the house. I now am scared quite a lot. If you have seen analog horror on YouTube then I basically feel like that is around every corner.

Does anybody else feel like this or am I doomed to be scared alone?,5,paranoia

"Hi! I’m new to the channel and just wanted to share what I’m going through. 
See if I’m alone and if anyone can help? I feel like it’s pretty common and I know I can’t be the only one who feels like this. 

I’m a cisgender, female who has been in a committed relationship since summer 2019 and I still feel like he’s cheating on me. I have literally no basis for this and each time I ask he is open and transparent, offers his phone, leaves it around all the time, answers any time I call, I’m active in his family life, like at this point if he’s stepping out it’s on him not me. Yet, I still feel sometimes (and less often every day, this post is a step for me towards not feeling trapped like this) that he’s seeing someone. And the type of trist I’m thinking of is totally out of character, he’s never been a one night stand or a cheater. He did confess to being an emotional cheater long ago and in another life and again, we’ve talked AT LENGTH about how we are both different people as I used to be a cheater too. Either way, I know I’m with my partner and my person. And I know they feel the same by their actions and words. So why do I still get panic attacks when I see a girl we both know at the same event or do I go on a days long trip out when he mentions he texts this girl that used to be a good friend of his. He has very healthy friendships who are in committed relationships so I’m not worried about his friends and they spend time together weekly. 

I’m at a point in my journey now where I know the following: I need to give him his time and space and respect just like he gives me, I need to reflect when I feel these senses of panic and find out where they coming from, and I need to ask myself what I can do to control or deny this feeling either by staying busy or by not over analyzing every little thing. But I’m wondering what are some good habits or things you do to get out of this hole? Any music or books that helped you along the way? Any type of friendships I should lean on? 

Hope this finds y’all well and if you have any advice I’m happy to hear. Even if you feel the same, you’re not alone in that feeling and you’re not crazy either.",5,paranoia
"I'm just a terrible husband for her, and I tried her into thinking I wasn't our whole dating life by saying and doing all the right things to put on a facade of someone who was bound for success and being the caring person she needed. But it was all because I was so afraid of being alone again, I was willing to do anything and pretend to be anyone to be loved. 

But I am not that person, I fail at everything I do, and past the facade I am a weak, insecure and self-absorbed person who can barely care for himself, let alone a marriage. She never makes mistakes, and I'm always the reason something is wrong or that she has a problem in life.

Hey only mistake was being tricked into loving me, but I can't undo it now. It's been too long, and I've wasted too much of her time. She wants kids and doesn't want to be too old to avoid issues, so it would betray her greatest goal in life for me to admit that we should separate, because she's already 30, and it might be too late now to start all over with else, someone better for her.

But since I'm so awful, it's such a terrible idea for me to have children. Even if they aren't genetically fucked in the head like I must be, then having me as a father will certainly hurt them for their entire lives. I will fail as a father and I know it, but I can't bring myself to just end this whole thing before it starts because I don't want to hurt her even more.

I've been going over it, and it just feels like the best option would for me to have an accident, something fatal that makes it all end. I have a very large life insurance policy, so while it won't make up for the time I've wasted, maybe it will help her live comfortably, and find someone who will be better for her. Then outside of the initial heartbreak of my death, I won't be able to hurt her anymore, and she'll be happier overall when she finds someone who can be the person she needs them to be, and hopefully forget I was ever in her life.

Edit: I think I should clarify that I've never been abusive to her or cheated on her. Im just an awful husband who can't be who she needs me to be, and tricked her into thinking I could be because I'm entirely selfish. I am so self-focused that I think I'll never do a good thing for another person in my life, so the best thing I can do is be removed from life.",2,depression
"I do not really mean a specific genre.It can be drama / slices of life romance - I like movies like that.  
However, it can be any other genre as well - just to be a good, interesting one. Would be nice if it will be a bit 'smarter' than typical action films - requiring a bit thought and focus.

I really enjoyed Gran Torino, In the Name of the Father, Gifted, The Proof, Wonder, Gattaca,  Three Billboards Outside....

"tldr: i’m paranoid about an evil entity that is stalking me and waiting to be able to take over my body even though it has nothing to do with my trauma (rape and emotional abuse) 

the TLDR says it for itself. but i had my first psychotic episode october 29 2020. i thought something was watching me. i sat at the foot of my bed watching TV and puking for what felt like 10 minutes but when i looked at the time nearly 3 hours had gone by. 

beyond that point i was a wreck. i was crippled by my own mind. everyday and night i thought there was something watching me. i was constantly burning incense, yelling at things that weren’t there to go away and that they weren’t welcome around me.

some months go by, i get put on 20mg of paxil and .5 of clonazepam. it worked for a while. after a few months i could tell it was wearing off. for the first few months i had zero paranoia. now i do. i see shadows that other people don’t see and i assume i’m the only one who can see it for a reason and it’s because it’s targeting me. billboards are sending me secret messages, typos on my phone are sending me secret messages and all of them are that i’m in danger. 

i asked my psychiatrist if this could SOMEHOW be related to my trauma and she said yes, although i show more severe signs of paranoia than other patients with ptsd she has treated, and if it gets worse she’s going to look into what antipsychotic is best for me. 

my question is how the fuck do i have this level of paranoia from sexual assault? it doesn’t make sense? there’s no correlation? does anybody else have this type of paranoia? if so, do you know what caused it? 

mine seems to have come out of nowhere. other than watching horror movies? but i’ve been doing that since i was a child. i don’t know. i’m frustrated that the medication isn’t working anymore and i’m at a loss.",5,paranoia
"I wish I could understand what keeps people going. I mean, there's absolutely zero meaning to life for me, I know most people do think life has a meaning and I respect that, but if you think about it, it doesn't matter if life was terrible or perfect, it all ends someday, even if you leave something for people to remember you, it does not matter as you won't be there to see it.

I used to be happy when I was a kid, but as I grew older everything started to seem so pointless. I started hating everything and everyone. Now I'm not so hateful like then, but the deep sadness is still with me. I used to be afraid of death, but now it's what I think about the most, my own death.

Me and my family changed states, we live closer to our relatives, I have a job close to my home, I now have a dog that I love, my first dog ever. I do love my family and we get along. But I can't ever feel satisfied, I'm on medication for anxiety and depression, which in the start of treatment they helped, but now after a bit more than a year I feel like I'm not on meds at all.

I'm always thinking that I should try exercising, studying something to maybe get a better job in the future, but I can never bring myself to make these changes, it's just so pointless. I struggle with suicide thoughts almost everyday, if something goes wrong at work or at home I feel terrible and just give up for the day.

I've been wanting to give up on this job for a long time now (I've been working there for 3 years), but I know that I won't find a better job still close to home and with an OK pay like I have now, I only finished high school and did a few short term courses so I could start working, and my bosses have been very patient with me, even though I'm as slow as a slug, I wish they would fire me already but I don't think they will. I work with heavy machinery, and I have already hurt myself on purpose once there, but what I actually want is to just crush my head in that machine for once and never have to wake up again.

You know, I just wish I could endure life, because in the future my parents and my brother who is disabled may need my help. But after they're gone, after I've served my purpose on this planet, I will finally have the guts to kill myself and truly rest. The only thing keeping me from ending it now is my family.

"Hello, I wanted to see if I can get some support on here. Let me summarize quickly. 11 days ago I saw that i had fiberglass on all my stuff that was underneath my bed. I was very scared and anxious to discover this because everything I’ve read/seen about it. That whole week I spent my time cleaning everything with tack cloth and a Hepa filter vacuum. I even bought an air purifier with a hepa filter. It was exhausting and sad to throw my things. My sister did help me with the clean up which I appreciate it. Now I thought I got everything but today I saw that my closet had fiberglass on my clothes in there. Now I am devastated.

"I am here because I genuinely don't know what to do.

I have been discharged from my psychiatrist as far as I'm aware and the wait list is 1-2 years long and I can't get a doctor's appointment (the UK is bad for this).

I've tried 20mg up to 50mg of elvanse and it wasn't helping so I just came off. That's when I saw the lawsuit/conspiracy trending about Vyvanse/Elvanse not working for so many of us around the time it just stopped working for me (around Feb/March 2023)

"\[tw: mentions of suicide\]

i'm 18 now, turning 19 in a month. i don't feel like an adult, let alone a functioning one

im currently in university, but it's horribly overwhelming. everytime i'm on campus i end up getting overwhelmed and having to go to the bathroom to cry or have a meltdown. i need to bring my sweater and headphones with me otherwise i start bawling and become non-functional when im outside. i regularly get overwhelmed in public and end up just crying for no reason

i don't know how to cook. or clean. or even sweep the floor. going out of my room is a struggle. even making a sandwich is too much for me sometimes. one time when i did manage to make one, the butter i'd put on it tasted wrong and i had a breakdown. i know this makes me sound extremely privileged, but i grew up with a domestic helper doing everything for me so essentially ive never lived independently.

showering is also near impossible for me, i can only force myself to after weeks when my hair gets horribly greasy and gives me awful sensory overload. i dont think ive brushed my teeth in two or three years either because of the way it feels on my gums

i don't mask well. everytime i talk to nt people, im just dead silent with a poker face. i can talk to people like waiters or cashiers but even then my speech is incredibly stilted and awkward. talking itself also feels physically painful sometimes idk hwo to describe it. the only thing i can focus on are my special interests. everything else feels impossible. it's cliche but i really cannot even begin to understand how im ""supposed"" to act. i can be quiet and not stim in public but that's it. and half the time i do stim at home i end up injuring myself out of my control

and whenever i think about living on my own i start breaking down. i don't think i can do it. i'm convinced im either going to die in my parents' house or end up committing suicide in some way

whenever i hear about autistic adults who can function independently and just require a little structure  in their lives or something i get really envious. i know it's not a competition but i feel like im mentally 12 years old at all times and i don't know how to take care of myself or do anything by myself; even my younger brother has told me i act ""so autistic"" and he ends up taking care of me a lot of the time",1,autism
"Hi, all! Long time lurker here. I was formally diagnosed with anxiety 6 years ago. Had it through high school, college, and my previous jobs. Currently, I'm on my third job at a bank and it has been the best employment I ever had so far. The pay, benefits, and workmates are all great. It has been 6 months since I started, but I have been failing and experiencing a lot of small mishaps due to my anxiety.

Everytime I have a bit of inconvenience, I have a small outburst of frustration, anxious during my daily tasks, and just on the verge of having a mental breakdown at my desk. Having my manager sit beside me does not help either, and I get berated over the smallest mistakes. I took a sick leave today for my mental health, and all I got was a bombardment of questions from my boss regarding the reports I submitted and got even told that we would have a 1-on1 talk tomorrow, so my mental health day off wasn't utilized properly enough.

I am starting to doubt myself if I can keep this up or whether I have to transfer to a different job with a fitting environment for my mental condition and forte. That is all. Thank you for taking the time to read my venting out.",4,anxiety

2. waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. the fear kicks in when i am walking back to my room. i feel like someone/ something is either watching me or i’m going to see something at the corner of my eye… i usually have to RUN back to my room because my anxiety is too much.

3. being in a public bathroom ALONE. i have this fear that someone is standing on one of the toilets and is waiting for me to sit/ start going to the bathroom & they crawl underneath the stalls to grab my leg and steal my purse/ money. 

3.5 flushing toilets in public restrooms scare me too because ITS SO LOUD & I CAMT HEAR MY SURROUNDINGS 

some context to explain further:

my reflexes i feel are not the best. i also feel like if i was ever placed in a situation like this i would have not a single clue as to what to do (even tho i think about it damn near everyday) . i use to carry pepper spray and knives but i can guarantee you that my first reaction/ instinct would not be to use those said items. i would honestly prolly forget that i have them on me because of how shook i’d be.",5,paranoia
"So I can’t really talk to my friends and family about this and I’m not sure where else to turn. 

I can’t trust people. It’s basically impossible for me. Every person I need I’m hit with crazy paranoia that they’re using me for something or they pity me. This goes for family and irl friends too. People I’ve known for years I find myself second guessing their intentions constantly and every good moment is immediately followed with intrusive thoughts. “they keep you around out of pity” “they don’t really love you” “they’re using you for something” things like that. It goes as far as to happen with my family as well, who never really gave me any issues or reason to have that thought process. “They keep you around because they have to” “they’d turn on you and leave you if they could”. 

Usually, I’d be able to push them aside and go on with everyday life and take the good moments as they come. But recently it’s been getting worse and worse to where it’s manifesting into a tangible fear. My hands shake, I get headaches (worse than usual, I get occasional chronic migraines), and I start hyperventilating if I don’t distract myself right away. It’s starting to worry me but I’m not sure if I’m overreacting and this is just typical young adult anxiety, or if this is something I should see someone about. Any advice is welcome.

"I guess that in God's infinite plan for you, everything that is happening to you, he's already seen all the possible outcomes of it and he knows how it all ends.

I wonder if free will really exists then.

Of course, being the good Christian that I am, the first voices immediately felt like demonic possession,...

Even after I was led to believe that I was born with a defective brain...

Even after They hooked me on meds that strangely and shockingly numbed down the voices ..

I still believe they were demons...

I mean how could I not?

Oh how scared I was ...

How many Ave Marias I recited...

How crazy I became...

After the first few shots, after the voices disappeared, the trauma I was left in forced me to not even trust my own thoughts...

Imagine believing that you're not alone in your head, only to then be really alone...which is scary? The former opens doors to a world you never thought possible and the latter leaves you in utter confusion. You live in terror which is then replaced by fear of the unknown.

I don't know if I am starting to sound cryptic but you have to experience it to understand.

It has been years and I am still taking the shots. Why? On the off chance I was really born with a defective brain, why not take them?

As for the demons, well I'm no saint, I guess it was bound to happen somehow, not really a good Christian and I know for a fact that God never cared about me in the first place.

I'm just tired of trying to make sense of things that I don't understand...

I feel like no matter how much I try to live a better life, I always hit a wall...I guess that with how unpredictable nature is, even when I ve got somethings figured out, I'll keep hitting a wall until I reach the real hell to be tormented by the same demons for all eternity.

"Hi all, I’m going to try and keep this as brief as possible. I’m stuck and looking for any ideas / thoughts people might have. 

I’m 38/F, I’ve been having mystery upper airway constriction for about 1.5 years. It started after prolonged exposure to bushfire / wildfire smoke. Basically I can feel my upper airways are swelling / constricted, my throat feels constricted and if I breathe through my nose it feels like the airway is constricted and I can’t get enough air in. If I breathe though my mouth it’s slightly better but still feels like my throat is constricted and I struggle to get a good breath. 

There’s no congestion, watery eyes, sneezing etc. Also no itchy tongue or lips. 

It waxes and wanes but when it’s bad I’m panting / struggling to get a good breathe, and it can feel like an emergency. When I’m in a flare I feel really unwell and exhausted.


The only thing that helps really knock it out is prednisone - I’ve been on 6-7 courses of prednisone in the last year. My family Dr initially had me on steroid inhalers until I could get in to see specialists, she assumed it was asthma. I’ve also tried montelukast, I had a bad psychological reaction but I tried it for three weeks and didn’t notice any improvement. 

Tests I’ve done - 
- spirometry / lung function testing to rule out asthma. My lung function is always fine, when I do peak flow lung testing at home it’s fine. 
- mannitol challenge test to further rule out asthma. That was also negative, so it doesn’t seem to be asthma. 
- I saw an allergist last year and got skin prick testing done for environmental allergies. Positive for some grasses and dogs but the allergist was unsure if it was causing these issues. 
- I saw a respiratory specialist a few months ago who thinks it’s not asthma, but a sort of severe allergic rhinitis, and thinks my upper airways are having a chronic allergic reaction and getting swollen / constricted. He prescribed dymista which has helped a lot but I’m having a flare at the moment and dymista isn’t controlling it. I’m also taking symbicort at the moment on the advice of my family Dr while I’m in a flare, which helps a bit. 
- checked for reflux / GERD and tried medication just in case, but no improvement.
- the respiratory specialist also did a scope where he looked in my throat and nose etc with a camera - he ruled out vocal chord dysfunction. 

I live rurally on a farm surrounded by pasture fields, but I don’t have cats or dogs or any indoor animals and I don’t deal directly with the cattle around us. No carpet or drapes in the house, everything is kept very clean / minimal dust, no mould issues. I run air purifiers in the house to help minimise airborne allergens while I figure this out. I take a daily antihistamine. 

The respiratory specialist ran pretty extensive bloodwork to check for auto immune diseases etc but that was all clear. I’m a bit stumped and don’t want to keep taking prednisone. Wondering if anyone has any ideas / thoughts.",0,negative_samples
"I have been severely depressed since I was a child. I have survived several suicide attempts over the course of my life and I honestly don't understand why everyone around me is always surprised when my depression completely takes over.

I suffered at the hands of an alcoholic and abusive father as I grew up. I spent most of my childhood alone and afraid that I would be berated or beaten for the tiniest bit of non-compliance. I didn't even have any real friends until midway through elementary school. I even tried to talk to my parents about how lonely I felt and how I struggled to make friends, but that was met with ""What the fuck is wrong with you? How do you not understand how to make friends? This is normal kid shit. Get the fuck out of my face before I throw something at you.""

Even when I did make friends, my father would go out of his way to embarrass me in front of any friends I had. From forcing my friends to help me perform chores while they came to visit my home, to screaming at me for not doing something as simple as picking up our family dog's poop when my dad wanted to cut the grass, to even saying that my friends are not welcome in the house if they wouldn't help prepare a meal. My friends just stopped coming over and I spent more and more time out of my house. Honestly, my best friend's parents were closer to me throughout childhood and high school than my own family. But it never fixed the gaping hole within my spirit. I always felt so broken and alone.

I was also ruthlessly bullied in elementary and high school. People around me would see me getting punched, kicked, choked, and one time even literally having my bully stomp on my throat in the school cafeteria. No one would ever step up and help, even teachers looked the other way. I'd show up at home with bruises and a couple times with a broken nose, only to have my parents ignore the obvious signs of bullying and abuse. I eventually stopped trying to defend myself. It only made things worse.

My mother was too afraid to challenge my dad as well. They both drank for years until my mother realized how miserable my dad was making her and she decided to stop drinking so much and start exercising.

Things only got worse as I got to post-secondary school. In my first year, my father was so controlling that I got so depressed that I stopped going to my classes altogether. I tried to date to help me find some value in myself, but I began gaining weight so quickly as soon as I stopped playing sports. I gained between 35-50 Lbs in my freshman year and the self-loathing only increased. I was completely unsuccessful in finding a partner, and rejection after rejection only deepened the black hole that is my soul. I tried to off myself again that year for the 5th time in my life, my first time being hospitalized for a suicide attempt.

My father seemed to finally understand how much pressure and damage he had done to me while he saw me lying in a hospital bed, barely clinging to life, but it didn't actually flip a switch in his brain to realize that he needed to change anything. After my required time in a psych ward to ensure that I wouldn't try to kill myself again, I went home, only for my dad to immediately revert to his old, shitty ways.

I continued to try to finish my schooling, switching subjects several times, but I was too depressed to succeed. Any time I started failing tests or assignments, I dropped my class. Three and a half years of this did not result in a degree, infuriating my father to no end. My father refused to hear me when I told him that I was lost and none of my majors interested me. I mentioned that the only solace I had in life was video games, as they were the only things I felt like I excelled in, but that was not a valid option to my father. I tried to take programming courses, but was so depressed that I kept failing out of them, and my father was fed up with paying for my schooling. The only thing left to do was drop out completely, as I did not have the funds to continue going to school.

My parents were also on the brink of divorce at this point. I moved home from school and started to work a minimum wage, dead-end job, which seemed fitting for a pathetic loser like myself.

My father tried with all of his might to pressure me to go back to school, and once he realized that I wouldn't go and I was depressed beyond measure, he tried to force me to go to a psych ward because he was so ashamed of me. I tried to kill myself for the 6th time, and was hospitalized again. That seemned to have put the nail in the coffin for my parents' marriage, as my mother and I completely blamed my father for pushing me straight to the edge of my rope. ""Apologetically"", he offered to take me to a mental health clinic in the city that he worked in, trying to claim that he only wanted the best for me. Sadly, I overheard the truth behind his actions while at his job. He was deeply ashamed of his pathetic excuse of a son. He figured that this was the only way that he would ever be able to get me out of his house and potentially able to work for a living.

I spent multiple more years languishing, literally praying that I would develop cancer and would finally be able to die without any guilt, but I would have no such luck.

I am still alive a decade after my last suicide attempt, and after cutting my father off for a period of time, I was finally able to cobble some form of a life together, going back to school, graduating, and getting a decent job, but the depression has never left and is now back in full force.

The older that I have gotten, the more broken I feel. I've been trapped in a never-ending pit of despair and loneliness, unable to properly connect with all of the wonderful people that have come into my life. I've dated a couple people over the past decade, but never to a point where I could honestly say that I have ever loved my partner, even if they told me that they loved me. If anything, my partners telling me that they loved me immediately scared me and made me push them away. I literally could not understand how they felt or even how they were attracted to me in the first place. Every single one of those relationships ended when my partner eventually got tired of trying to connect with me or they would meet someone better (which to me would be 99.99% of the population). I am now convinced that I am too broken to actually feel love, let alone any form of intimacy, even though it's the thing I want most in the world. I simply don't deserve a partner. I have nothing positive to offer.

I hate myself beyond all measure. I literally feel like I am worth more as an organ donor than a human being. I am tired of existing. I am tired of the constant fucking pain, suffering, loneliness, and the abject nature of my life. I feel like a poison in everyone's lives around me, dragging everyone down, making this world a darker place every day.

I will likely be required to be on medication for the rest of my life in order to be a barely functioning member of society. I am a leech of my region's socialized healthcare system, requiring inordinate amounts of funding to barely hang on. There are so many more worthy people than me. Beyond all of the refugees across the world, there has to be someone who could easily and happily replace me.

All I want is a painless death. My country is contemplating legalizing euthanasia for people whose sole detriment is mental health. If the law is passed, I feel like I will have no other means of escape other than to sign myself up on day one.

My family and the few friends I have are aware of this desire, but the only respond they have had is to tell me some bullshit, placating me, with empty promises of a brighter future. That, or a guilt trip.

So, again, I ask... what's the point of trying to continue when life feels empty and meaningless?",2,depression
"I danced ballet for 13 years, since the age of 3, and though I was always picked on (I was quite clumsy and uncoordinated), I loved it. One day, our teacher asked us to ""walk normally"" across the room, though I don't remember why. When it was my turn, I walked up on my toes the entire length of the room. My strict teacher scolded me and made me try again, which made me very embarrassed, as I didn't know what I was doing wrong. The second time, I went toe-ball-heel across, which made her scold me again. Finally, she demonstrated heel-ball-toe, and I went slowly across the room doing so, as it felt so strange to me.

This can be related to contamination and such, but in this instance a few deaths have a happened around me in life the past few weeks.

"Hello,

I am curious about what I am experiencing. I have been diagnosed with PTSD but I question this diagnosis, as I do not experience flashbacks, intrusive memories, etc. What I do experience, periodically, is high sensitivity under certain states.

This could mean that yes, fireworks, loud vehicles and so on alarm me.

"She loves her family but also is fearful of conflict with her parents. So as much as she loves them, and is willing to do what they ask, she will go out of her way to ensure they are not angered.

This ""going out of her way"" has entered our relationship.

We started dating at 24, and now were 29.

When we started dating and still to now she needs to ask to use her parents vehicle because she still has not got one yet due to focusing on school and not work.

She has a curfew living at home, and she follows it very closely. She has never slept over at my house and any time she has been like 30 mins to an hour late her dad will blow up her phone, and yell at her for disobeying his house rules... despite her age. This has affected us because she has slept over maybe 5 times in the years together, but she has to lie and say she slept over at a friends house.

She and I lived together for 3 years during college. She made me agree to never tell her parents that we lived together and so any time I speak to them about college I had to lie. She was paranoid and worried that they would disown her because she was living in sin (catholic) since we were not married. So for 3 years, anytime they came to visit I had to move all of my stuff out, and further continue to lie.

One time her dad mentioned that I should lose weight because I look unhealthy. I shrugged it off, but what annoyed me more was that she didnt stand up for me since she was at dinner and heard that be said. Her siblings told him to cut it out and such but she didnt. She just apologized for her father and said ""thats how he is.""

She and I have sex, and she is very worried they will find out, not just like caught in the action find out, but even birth control wise. Her sister was on birth control for period pains and her mom found out and forced her to get off of it. So in the years together she and I do NO form of PDA in front of her parents.

She got a tattoo and has to wear make up to hide it for fear her parents will yell at her.

Finally, this has been a huge mental struggle of mine. I have been in therapy because of this. But she got an abortion, our contraception failed. Her fears of her parents finding out came up and she felt depressed, numb, and even suicidal. She didnt want them to find out about being pregnant out of marriage, and so she went ahead with it. She was very much against the idea but her fear of her parents outweighed her wants.

Further and sadly, she blamed me for her abortion months later. I talked with my therapist and they mentioned how she is projecting her wishes to keep our baby and since we weren't married, she blames me, despite her clear reasons being her parents.

I understand the red flags here. I do. 

But I want to understand what is going on with her. I wish she didnt have so much paranoia and didnt let her parents affect her decisions so much. 

She doesn't see how unhealthy her fear of her parents is, I brought it up once around when we had an abortion and she almost left me because it was as if she couldn't face the truth.

"First poster here. I’m just wondering if any one here also experiences some kind of annual depressive moods - I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety 3 years ago and this time three years ago I was severely depressed. I’ll spare the details but I’m a lot better mentally these days. Although some days are harder than others, but for the most part, I have healed and there has been a overwhelmingly huge amount of self discovery and growth. To which I’m very grateful, but it seems ever since I’ve gone through my depression, the main bout of it anyways, this time of year, late April, early May I’m more prone to get back in that mind-set and the same feelings and emotions I felt when I was in the thick-of-it always return. It’s like something is in the air for me and never fails to trigger my depression, and it’s super easy for me to fall back into bad habits. 

I’m OK and I’m safe, have a good support system, a councillor and coping mechanisms, I’m just curious is all and wondering if this isn’t just a me thing, how do you folks cope or prepare if you know a time of year will trigger you, etc., much love and good energy ❤️",2,depression

"Hello everyone, sorry if this kind of post isn't allowed but I'm not sure where else to turn.


I inherited a very large book collection from my grandmother. I loved reading through her library and just simply looking at all the titles when I was younger so there's a huge portion of the collection I want to keep for my own shelves.


However, there's a sizeable portion of the books I will probably never read. (Mostly Danielle Steel book and old Gothic romance titles.) I don't want to throw these books away and most of the little libraries I've found hold nothing but kids books and I don't think Danielle Steel would be appropriate in most cases. What would you do with almost 150 books that are in good condition with no markings?",0,negative_samples
"After months of job searching I finally have a job, and a decent paying one for an entry-level position in my field. Only thing is now at work I am plagued with intense paranoia and anxiety about how my coworkers perceive me. It gets to where I have a really hard time concentrating on what I'm doing and then I screw up, which then adds more fuel to the fire because ""oh, now they saw me mess up and are probably gonna talk about how stupid and incompetent I am"".

At my previous job the people were great, I felt very safe, comfortable, and just appreciated there. It was such a nurturing environment to be in and I really took that for granted.

The last person in my position was very well loved by everyone there and I feel like since I am not her and I am very shy that at least some of the people there already dislike me. Like yesterday I said good morning to the receptionist and she looked me dead in the eyes, saying nothing back. It was quiet and I spoke clearly. I know she heard me. I just hate it, because I always have felt negatively toward/about myself and to have that mirrored by others just multiplies that self-hate, self-criticism tenfold. Back when I saw a therapist, he commented that I have rejection sensitive dysphoria which means that anything I even perceive as rejection I can't help but fixate on.

This is a solid position for me to start out at and gain experience with so I don't want to leave, but I just wish I could let go and stop caring. But I can't. I have never, ever been able to just not care what other people think about me.",5,paranoia

I know how and it is within my abilities to do so, it will probably keep me alive. But even though my mind says I must survive, I don't feel it in my heart. I don't want to rush to make a family, throw my self into responsibility of a family man. I can't ever see myself waking up to other people and not being self aware that i get exhausted around other people.

"So, I have this friend. And as far as I can tell, he is a genuinely kind person who has been *exceedingly* (I'd go as far as to say entirely too) kind to me and genuinely enjoys my presence... And I feel like a complete jerk for it but I can't shake the feeling that he secretly thinks I'm a loser which is probably just projection because *I* think I'm a loser because I *am* a loser and he is more or less a normal person with a job and a life and other friends and I haven't been able to maintain any other friendships so why would a nice normal person *want* to be friends with me? Not to mention I've already ghosted him twice during a depressive episode and he's been patient and gentle with me through it which just makes me feel worse and through no fault of his own makes me feel more like the dumb little mentally ill pet that he says nice things to in order to placate me so I don't do anything stupid.

We're both writers (not published or anything, mostly as a hobby) and even that is a constant source of unwarranted paranoia on my part. I regularly show him drafts of things I'm working on for feedback and he always tells me that it's good and that I'm talented. So naturally my awful gremlin brain latches onto the idea that either 1. he's just complimenting my abilities so much to humor me because I'm his sad loser friend who doesn't have the attention span to do anything *but* write and he pities me (bolstered by the fact that he tends to not actually have any criticisms of my work despite them constantly being contrived, formulaic and absolutely *riddled* with typos) or 2. if it's so good then one day he'll steal my ideas and put them forth as his own because he actually has a body of work posted that people like and expect more of and he wants to keep up with demand (I've been too much of a coward to share my work with anyone but him thus far). I have no reason to believe either of these, especially not the second one. The first one maybe, I can definitely see him being the type to be too nice to accurately call me out on my BS especially now that he knows I'm depressed but there is *literally* no evidence of him stealing other people's work and even if he did, his stuff's already good, he wouldn't need to market my trash ideas as his own, and he's just a good-hearted, talented and (I pray) honest person who doesn't deserve to be suspected of something so underhanded.

I feel awful because he's great and absolutely deserves a friend who isn't an obsessive paranoid little freak and he's always telling me how much he likes talking to me and it just puts me more on edge cuz I'm always anticipating the day that he no longer likes talking to me and this is why it's easier to just not have friends, as sad as I am when I'm alone >\_\_\_>

Even when we're just speaking about random stuff, I always get the feeling that I'm asking too many questions or misunderstanding too many things or just plain being an idiot and he always reassures me that I'm not and I'm fine but *of course* he'd say that if he didn't want to hurt my feelings by being upfront about what an awkward weirdo I am >\_\_\_\_\_\_>

"Saw my therapist today. I was diagnosed with a pretty severe case of ADHD predominantly inattentive type around age 21. I'm 29 now.

"I work at goodwill and have told them about my disability (paranoid schizoaffective with Bipolar and BPD) and they work around my income and hour restrictions and abilities(even though the job is all i can handle getting 12 hours a week), anyhow… Yesterday I had a hallucination that I was about to be fired and just left before they fired me, so i thought at the time. It was at the end of the day. So I cut out 10 minutes early. I felt like I was on fire, or suffocating. Figuratively speaking, mostly. 

I was criticized slightly and everyone was tense as it was busy. I felt so scatter brained and hopeless, I just had to get outta there. I’m going back and thought it over. I feel okay about it now and thought it over, and just am taking the attitude that when I go in next it’ll be a new day. I was convinced I’d get a call, and somebody would call me or find me to tell me I’m being let go. But as with many of these cases with me, I calm down and find no true evidence of these delusions being true. 

I really like this job, believe it or not. They have been supportive. Although, I do think I get some resentment because my days are shorter, like I said before it really is as much as I could handle but coworkers don’t understand that I’d kill to have a clear mind again, and go back to the grind and make decent full time money without the the help of social security. 

They are still a job so they have policies and it sets a bad example for other employees, yet, I really do have a hard time staying focused, fighting voices, delusions, hallucinations, etc.

"For some context I was a pretty normal kid growing up until my parents got divorced when I was around 10. I felt like I needed to grow up for my mother who always had a hard time finding good men so I kind of acted like an adult sometimes even when I was young, and I think that cut off some of my childhood. When I was around 9 my dad got remarried to someone who seemed really nice but she is a selfish prick I learned as I continued to grow up in the house. My mom ended up getting into drugs pretty bad and I couldn’t see her for a few years in college. But I managed to graduate Highschool with a degree and almost a valedictorian, but not quite

So here’s where the story is. I just got back from college and suffice it to say that I messed up pretty bad my first year. I failed a bunch of classes because I ended up getting really sick in the second semester and once I got back to being able to go to classes I felt so far behind that I didn’t think I could keep going to classes. When I started to stop going I beat myself up for it because I felt like a disappointment to my parents. I finally got back from college a few days ago and I told my parents that I needed a gap semester for myself to figure out what I really want to do so I’m not just going to college to go to college. When I talked to them I talked about wanting to maybe explore the world a little bit while I’m still young and able to and my dad interjected “that’s not how the world works” and that hit pretty hard because I’ve always just taken everything that they say to me because every time I’ve interjected I’ve been grounded Or berated for expressing myself or an opinion. What my stepmom said to me was far worse in my opinion as she said “you know we co-signed that loan with you so if you don’t pay it we are the ones who get hosed” which really told me where her priorities with me were. My mom has been pretty supportive to me about this and she understands what I’m going through. I recently decided to move in with my mother because I don’t know if I can keep dealing with them. A little of a side note but my dad is basically telling me I have to get some 40 hr a week job by the end of the week, and I think that’s a little bit unfair because I’m still young, I want to hang out with my friends while I’m still young but they insist that I get a job, almost like they think I’m going to be a bum, as they would say

For the depression part is I think I have depression but I don’t want to just say that because I’ve grown up in a household that isn’t really good with emotional sharing and while I was in college I had thoughts of suicide but I didn’t want people to deal with the gruesomeness of my corpse and I didn’t want to upset my mom.

I get these weird feelings that feel like I need to have a bowel movement or even have flatulence but the rectal cavity feels “hot”. Like I just drank a glass of wine or ate a hot pepper and it went straight to the receptors down there and when I know I haven’t had spice, it triggers me to believe there’s inflammation..

Everything came back normal or negative and Calprotectin was at a 7. I know that’s well within normal range but when I get that ‘hot sensation’ it worries that stomach acid or something is causing stuff to be undigested.

I typically defecate once a day in the morning and have actually had 3 days in the last 8 where I didn’t go. (I’m overly scared of going multiple times a day thinking I have some sort of infection). My GI has stated there is truly no need for a colonoscopy at all unless I do want to check for colitis but I feel like I’d have other hallmark symptoms?

"TL;DR- can’t make friends, tried one last time and it didn’t work no matter what I did. Maybe too nice for my own good.

ETA: Also, the friend is NB, hence the they/them/their pronouns.

I don’t even know if this even belongs on this sub but I like to think I’m not alone here…

 
Like a lot of people on the spectrum, I have a very hard time with friends. Not just making them, but keeping in touch or keeping them in general. I’ll be too weird, too insecure, too standoffish, etc. I try to make the effort, but my words get misunderstood when I’m trying to make jokes or try to join in on a conversation, and something happens and all of a sudden I’m out of the friend group or at least marginalized. I’ve tried many ways to approach people but it never got much better. I’m used to it by now (I’m 38), but today I have decided to stop trying. 

I was set to give up a few years ago (pandemic/quarantine kind of made it obvious), but I went back to work and I met a new coworker. We hit it off, but they left a few months later. I decided then that I would give one last push to make a genuine friend that will help make life worth living again, instead of just surviving. It worked! We started hanging out after going back and forth online, and it was easily one of the best times of my life. This time, I thought, will be good. They started dating someone new, no problem, I’ll stay supportive. They break up, I’d lend a shoulder. We’d just relax and watch YouTube videos to pass the time (we could only be so social before it exhausts us both- another great reason to keep the friendship alive). 

Then the one thing I feared happened…they were moving to another state for work. Obviously I was happy for them. But I knew that it would lead to me slowly but surely losing touch with them and I would be missing that one bit of light in my world. But I supported them and sent them off with a smile. But! This seemingly wonderful human insisted we stay in touch and offered to fly me over to visit the first chance they get. 

And it actually happened. We would get together every other month or so to go to a concert or see some sights or simply just watch a movie. The times we aren’t physically together we coordinate a watch party and watch random shows together online. It was working. I was eventually declared their best friend, and it felt nice. I was happier and lively, according to my coworkers (I don’t really notice it on my own). 

About a year goes by like this and suddenly my friend got let go. It was devastating for them and I immediately decided to take off work and go comfort them. I’m not the richest in the world, but I pooled all my funds and went, but something was off. They pretty much expected me to help clean up and I accidentally made a mess with a plate and it broke. They went ballistic. I apologized immediately and said I would reimburse them for the damage. I then started to clean up, and this is where my anxiety kicks in, because I already made a wrong move and i don’t want to make another. But they kept on and on how they can’t replace it (it was an inherited gift apparently) and takes the broom from me and cleans up. I said again that I was sorry and that I’m trying to help them feel better and they just said “well, this isn’t helping me, is it??” I made a point that I dropped everything to lend a hand because they have lost their job and is having a hard time (their words), and the one phrase I hate hearing from people was uttered. 

“I didn’t ask you to do that!” 

In my mind, friends (especially ones who call YOU their “best friend”) are there at the first sign of trouble. I will do almost anything if I can physically do it. Now, I truly understand boundaries (I’m a rare one and actually like hugs, but I’ll refrain from hugging those who don’t want them), but I didn’t think I was overstepping. I didn’t just surprise them by showing up on their doorstep; in fact, they were so grateful to have company as they live alone. They could have said no if they wanted to be alone or with someone else. So that phrase took me aback. All I said was “okay, guess I’ll leave you alone all depressed instead like a BEST FRIEND should, right?” Trying to make them see that i was trying to be a friend. The next phrase all but broke me. 

“You did it for yourself.” 

I don’t know what they meant, but I took it as “you’re selfish”. I was so stunned I couldn’t reply. I don’t see how I was selfish except me trying to keep this friendship alive. I thought we both were. I packed my stuff and left the next morning. 

It’s been almost a month since and we’ve been occasionally texting as if nothing had happened. But for me I don’t see how I can continue. I would try confronting them about how their words hurt but I’m guessing they’ll have another argument that will just guilt me into submission. Just the thought of seeing them either in person or on video makes me feel ill. I tried as hard as I could to be kind and loyal and friendly all around, and it took one mistake to mess it up. I kept sidestepping to avoid being too clingy or too intrusive, but none of it mattered. Maybe I’m just bad with words and communication. Maybe I have shitty judgment and make the wrong friends, I don’t know. 

I’ll just try to keep going by just doing what I must and saying as little as I can. It seems to be the best chance for a decent outcome for me. In hindsight I was probably just a convenient person to walk on, and I mistook it for someone who genuinely accepts me for me. At least I got to be truly myself for a little while, so that’s something, right?",1,autism
"A little context before we start: I am 20, and suffer ADHD (likely turned bipolar but have no official diagnosis), and depression. My mood swings and behaviour makes me believe its no longer ADHD but bipolar disorder instead. Please note that I am currently jobless, so while I don't pay rent, I do cook and clean, and generally make sure my younger sisters don't do anything stupid. Anything I do use up, I replace it if possible using my own savings. 

My dad and I have not gotten along since I was 13. At first it was just typical teenage rebellion stuff. While my mum and I have always had a close relationship. She was the person I could go to and talk to about my problems. She understood me, and she was my rock. My dad however...due to how he was raised he is not like my mum. He has no empathy (sympathy in case I'm getting these mixed up again) for anyone, doesn't understand what to say and when, and does not seem to understand that his blatant comments are hurtful to me. Sometimes I feel like he's being intentionally hurtful. Our personalities clash violently, so when we get in an agrument we tend to say really hurtful stuff we don't actually mean. We know when the other doesn't mean it because we don't say that same thing again later, its always something different. 

I know he favours my younger sister (15). She's like him in every way. No empathy (or sympathy), loves trucks, wants to be a diesel mechanic and drive machinery etc. He lets her get away with almost everything and this is admittedly the source of a lot of our fights. While he lets her get away with everything, he's constantly on my back about stuff I did, stuff I didn't do, stuff I need to do and what I shouldn't do. From age 14, he has treated me like the source of his problems, but never outright hurt me, laid his hands on me or said the worst stuff, he just acted like I could do no right. 

Recently, we have had more arguments than normal. I recently finished a contract to study a Cert III in Business, and currently have no job but I am actively looking for work, I actually have an interview next week so it is not like I'm sitting around doing nothing. I clean each morning: empty the dishwasher, tidy off the bench and clean it, and even vacuum the floors of dirt and kitty litter, and anything else. Sometimes when I'd get home from work I'd do the cooking but that wasn't often. Now, unless my parents have something else in mind I'm cooking almost every night. He comes home to a tidy house, a hot meal, and still often complains or has an attitude with me. 

Every single fight we have now, he has picked up the tendency to tell me: ""if you don't like how I run this house you can move out'. He was telling me this before I finished my work. Keeping in mind I wasn't earning a lot. I was making 25K annually as a trainee, so even if I'd gone for a Cert 4 and stayed in the job I still would not have been able to move out and stay out. But even after i finished work he still tells me to move out if I don't like it,  he knows I can'tleave otherwise Id be homelessand he doesn't care. I feel unwanted in my own home. Every time he tells me these words I cry myself to sleep. Sure we argue but I still love that man. I always worry for him, I always love him even if he treats me like a 2nd class citizen and favours my sister over me. I feel unwelcome in my own home and I am constantly reminded by him and my sister that: I have no friends, I don't have a job, and I'm single. I am constantly made to feel like I don't matter and I'm getting so exhausted that death sounds good right about now. 

I've been considering death for a while now, thinking about how I'd do it, when, how long it would take. And then I'd ponder: would they miss me? Would they even care? My mother does not call him out when he makes these comments and it makes me feel like I can't trust her to have my back. They don't seem to realise my lashing out is a cry for help, and even now as I'm typing this I'm crying after being told earlier tonight to move out. If he wants me out I'll go, but I know if I go he won't help with the house. He won't keep my sisters in check, they wont pass inspections because he can't even wash a dish and I know mum will divorce him when it becomes too much for her. I don't want to leave my mum alone to them but I don't want to keep enduring this. I can't take it any longer! My sister expects me to take her out places, buy her nice things but doesn't want to be nice to me in return, and my dad wants me to contribute around the house but cant even see the effort I'm putting in now. I've put in so much that my hair is falling out, I can't sleep, and while my appetite is still in tact, I know if this goes on that'll die too. 

Every time he says these awful words I die a little more inside and I'm exhausted.....I just want it all to stop. I feel alone, I just want someone to hold me and tell me its going to be ok. But I don't even want to go to my mum this time, as I worry she's going to get mad or tell me I'm being dramatic.....

Reading this book was like having a friend commiting suicide in front of you in slow motion. There are some scenes and passages that still haunt me around despite having finished reading the book a couple of weeks ago.

I have never regretted reading a book until now. I wish I could just erase it from my memory. And yet... despite the fantastical elements, this is something that happened to a lot of people.

I can not remember what i had for dinner last night, I can't remember what anyone has said to me yesterday and Every single thought I have in my head is about how long do I have to suffer living like this. I used to have the greatest memory in the world. I could walk into a room and know if something was moved and now I can't even remember why I left my register keys in the register. Even tho I never needed the injection they forced me to get injected for 2 years Every month. The cops brought me to nicolet psychiatric for no reason at all and tried to make me sign documents saying i was schizophrenic. I refused to sign these papers so they kept me there and i could not leave until i signed them. Everyday they would take me to an office to sign the papers and i refused everyday for 16 days. After 16 days of saying no i didnt want to be there anymore so i signed the paper and got to go home. If i ever missed an injection they send the police to my house and arrest me. This actually happened to me. I was arrested and they tied me down and injected me. The only reason I was able to get off it us because they changed my case worker and the new case worker saw that I was not crazy. My first case worker hated me cause I didn't listen to him when he tried to tell me the injection was gona help me. He definitely knew I was not schizophrenic cause I told him I work 50 hours a week cause im an assistant manager at my store and i have been working there for 6 years I don't have time to be schizophrenic. On top of that they ordered me to go to court to get off it and my first case worker always recommended I stay on it for no reason. After I got my case worker changed I got off it cause my new case worker saw that I was not crazy and i explained to him I didn't have time to be schizophrenic. I have been off it for a year now but this experience has made me miserable cause being injected with this haldol for 2 years really changes everything in your mind.

"Hey guys, I think i'm mostly looking for reassurance that i'm not a horrible person, but for the past few months, my tolerance to noise has gone way down the drain. My doctor and I decided to taper off vyvanse (which I have been on for 2-ish years), and I still think this decision is for the best, but for the life of me it pisses me off how much noise the general public makes. 

The neighborhood kids surrounding my apartment love to scream for hours on end outside, and it seems like when *that* is not happening, some other neighbor leaves their poor dog outside to yelp and scream and make noises no dog should make. It makes me sad that the sound of kids playing gets to  me this much, and i can literally feel it igniting my nervous system and I'll try so hard to just work through it but the anger always comes in so quick and fiery if yk that feeling. 

I know it's not the kids' or dog's fault, but I just feel so frustrated bc it seems like these adults give absolutely no consideration to the echo chamber of concrete walls that surround the area.

This is the second time I score high at a test for paranoia. But I dont think im like really paranoid. I think its just because of trauma? And like a symptom of ptsd but not like full blown paranoia and it makes me scared ppl think I do have it. What do you think?

Why does she think I am paranoid/ May be psychotic
Is because I think ppl are talking about me when I sit in my garden. I know its probably not true but its real to me at that moment and I will go inside because of the fear and anger.
When I am outside and walk along houses I feel like I am on a catwalk of shame. Like everybody thinks I suck ( i always have had the thoughts of ppl disliking me but not to this extend, this has been going on for 2 years or something)
I get anxiety when walking by ppl because the May think I am ugly or crazy or whatever.. or they will judge me on how I walk because if my physical problems.
I sometimes see mouses when I have insomnia or hear people talking but that's just because of the lack of sleep.
I think my friends secretly hate me, like im some kind of punishment to them that they have to entertain.
I can't relax when im in lot of physical pain in my house cause im afraid someone will find me lazy 
I haven't told my therapists but I also have this thing when ppl go down stairs I see them falling and crying and hurt in my mind

But a lot of it is trauma related I guess.. and I think its more anxiety/ptsd than paranoia/ psychoses? But it makes me afraid.  I do have most of theese symptoms for over 2 years. So it can be psychoses cause that doesn't last so long I guess?

And then when you find any provider that is accepting new patients, they're hard to reach. One NP I tried to contact had two numbers, one for new patients and one for current with automated messages that prompted you to call the other number. I've emailed others with no response. I even tried an online psych service and they didn't have a single ADHD provider in my state. I'm also really anxious about what treatment would look like once I even find a provider with how hellish it seems to get meds with this whole shortage shenanigans the DEA is creating. 

I'm afraid I'll only get treatment if I end up in a psych ward. I'm afraid my ADHD won't be taken seriously. Idk what I even need right now, I think I just needed to vent.",3,adhd

I have 2 health insurances. I recently got insurance through the Union(UPS) while having insurance through my main full time job. 

I tried canceling my main insurance and they won't let me(Union backdated insurance because I was eligible before I actually got it)

The GI office made my new Union health insurance primary AND they sent a message to the people in charge of pre-authorizing medicines/mri/other stuff.. anyways, the stupid SOB's still started pre-auth for Remicade on the wrong insurance. I even called the GI office to make sure they were using my Union insurance..

"So, earlier today I decided to go for a little walk in the local park with my camera. I just bought Photoshop software today, and I wanted some pictures to play around with.

I had my camera in a strap hanging around my neck, and a macro lense in my jacket pocket. As I approached the entrance to the park (this little windy path through some trees) a couple came up from the path to the park, a man and a woman. I cast a glance at them, but I was busy changing the lense on my camera as I walked by them. 

I got maybe 20-25 steps down the path when I heard a sound that caused me to look over my shoulder, and there was the same guy (no girl). I thought ""that's weird, I wonder if he wants to talk to me."" He did, as it turns out. He called out ""Hey!"" I turn around and face him. He then asks ""Are you taking pictures with that camera?"" Up until he asked this, I was thinking the most likely thing he wanted was either directions or perhaps some loose change (these are the things I've been approached by strangers for the most in my life). I was puzzled by his question, so I just answered ""Yes. That's generally what one uses a camera for."" He was wearing a mask, but apparently was not worried about social distancing, because he came right up close and personal and then asked ""Are you taking pictures of me?"" Again puzzled by his question I simply told the truth. ""No."" I said. Then he asked ""Are you sure?"" And finally I understood what was going on. This guy was paranoid about being photographed. I told him ""Yeah, I'm sure. I take pictures of birds and trees and stuff like that."" He then just stood there for a good 5-10 seconds looking me straight in the eye. Then he said ""Good. I wouldn't recommend you do that (photograph him) either."" And then he turned and walked away again. As he was walking I just said ""Alright, sure, nothing to worry about there."" 

I was a bit exhausted in my mind, so I didn't come up with any snarky remarks on the spot, but I thought about a few during the rest of my walk. Something along the lines of ""Don't worry, you are not pretty enough to be in my scrapbook anyway."" Probably for the best anyway. I'm sure such a remark would have just set him off. He seemed the type that possibly was very insecure about his manhood, and would possibly compensate by beating witty strangers down.

Anyway, I had a good few laughs thinking about the absurdity of the situation during the day. How paranoid must you be, to think some random stranger is photographing you in secret? I don't know whether he was high, selling drugs or possibly both, but what the hell? 😆",5,paranoia

"Hi. I really only have a history of OAS. I have an older brother with a severe nut allergy. All my life, my mother grilled it into me that I could also develop this allergy, and largely kept me away from nuts. 

Last year, I ate a dish with basil pesto and had a panic attack, falsely believing my throat felt sick and my arm “itched.” There was no allergic reaction but the panic attack, and my parents’ reaction toward my ridiculousness, really stuck with me. I did go to therapy but my therapist…really tried to pin the cause on factors I knew not to be true. 

I went through a phase of being afraid of EVERYTHING, but reintroduced eggs, dairy and fruits, avocado, etc. I’m still stuck on nuts (I swear pistachios did once make my lips tingle, maybe OAS), and fish because I’d read it can develop in adulthood. I haven’t really eaten either in a year (nuts) to eight months (fish). **I’m scared I’ve actually built up an intolerance because of how long I’ve avoided these foods. Can this be true?**

"When I took my exam to get my driver's license (early 90s), they were using computers for the first time so software and graphics were primitive. The passing score was 18 out of 24 and after every question, the system would tell you if you answered correctly or not.

Question 1, good answer. Question 2, good answer, Question 3... 4... 5... 10... 15... Question 17, good answer, all good answers. I come to question 18 and I know if I get this one right, I'm home free. I answer, hit enter, good answer!

As it was programmed with proper manners, the system would inform me that I have enough correct answers and that the test was done. Congratulations, you passed.

I go to the counter, get the paper copy of my results :

**Result : 18/24 - PASS**

I went back to the counter arguing that this was wrong. That I did not get 18/24, I got 18/18 and the paper should reflect that. ""Why do you care? You passed. It doesn't matter"". ""It DOES matter because 18/18 means I absolutely nailed the exam because I was prepared. 18/24 means I barely passed and one more wrong answer and I would have failed. There is a HUGE difference"".

They couldn't change the paper of course, and my parents never believed me when I told them the computer stopped at 18 because I had a perfect score up to that point.

So if you were a programmer in the late 80s, early 90s and you programmed the software for driver tests in Quebec at the SAAQ, know that your shitty code changed the course of my life.

My life I always been failing, been screwing up my whole life, and now I have alot of regrets, I can't have what I wanted and it's all because I didn't do the work. That's the thing adhd makes the grinding and work so much more harder. You want to be better, you want to do good, you want to be more but always fall short, in all aspects of my life I have been failing and continuing to fail. Having adhd makes it so much harder for us, we are constantly trying,  trying to do good and just messing up. We been like this our whole life's. My family can't depend on me, my friends think I'm a bad friend, I not successful in my academics or my love life, I just been failing and failing struggling up a hill to move a Boulder up the hill and adhd is like having both my shoe laces tied together with glue and metal and welded together. I have been struggling and struggling my whole life to be better and I always fail short. Failure is common in everyone but let's just say that having adhd is encountering more failure. This failure is made it so sad. You see yourself trying and working at it but your not progressing like your peers. Your friends are able to be good friends and your family are able to depend on each other. But me, i just am messing up. Always 1 stop forward and 2 steps back. 

This failure is too much some times, but that is the thing. If you can master and get over this failure. If you can take all this struggle and pain amd just keep moving forward you can win. You can be better. You can do what you want to do and make your dreams come true. You can be a better person, friend, partner, brother, sister, mom, dad and you cam achieve your goals. You have to see this failure and say fuck this failure I want to win I'm tired of losing, tired of never getting things to go my way, tired of always being picked last and always been slept on by my friends and peers. You have to be persistent you have to be resilient, have to take all that pain and struggle and just keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. Thats how winning is done! So everyone whatvever failure you have, whateve stuggle and problem you have and you seen to cant get over your obstacle or been stuck, i wish you the best of luck, you cant give up, you cant quit, and when you achieve it you can be even more proud amd happy knwoimg that you acheive it with all the struggles and problem had along the way. ,",3,adhd

(It has been said the jab can cause this temporarily in women so I didn't feel like it was anything to be concerned about, and nothing has come of it since so I'm in the clear). But later I started feeling like my heart was beating irregularly and kept wearing my fitbit everywhere, checking my heartrate constantly. I told everybody how I thought I was really ill and needed to see a doctor but the doctor wouldn't see me. Over time, I kind of forgot about this process of thought after my fitbit ran out of charge and I lost the charger. I stopped checking my heart so often and subsequently, I stop feeling it beating 'irregularly'.

This past week I've been sick with the flu and tonsillitis. I've never experienced the flu before although I have experienced tonsillitis, kind of expected it to be like it's been before, but it was so much worse. I was concerned when I was so dizzy I almost couldn't make it to the bathroom. I started experiencing a high pitched sound in my ear, which has now radiated to both my ears and never stops. My headache was bad when I first got ill then as I've gotten better I felt like I was getting over the worst, but my head is now pounding again in such a way I had to look up brain aneurism to make sure I wasn't just about to die. My neck and head hurt so much, but I know logically lying in bed for three days will cause a stiff neck. I just keep thinking there's something really wrong, then rationally knowing I'm probably fine, but with a sneaky voice saying ""but what if you're not?"" It's really annoying. 

I'm not even afraid of death. I die in my dreams all the time, it's even kinda fun (I lucid dream a lot, so most of the time I know I'm actually not dying). I guess I am afraid of dying suddenly and not having a chance to say how I feel to my family and friends, I am very bad at not knowing. I just don't know why this train of thought has kicked off all of a sudden, and how to reign it in. I've been isolated from my colleagues for a good 6 days now I guess, and I work pretty consistently, work is a part of my identity at this point which may be why I feel a bit disconnected right now. On the other hand, I've enjoyed being away from work and if I was well, I would have been delighted with this time off, a chance to get my University work done and talk with online friends. 

In contrast to other paranoid thoughts I've had in the past, I'd say these are relatively harmless and don't drastically change my lifestyle, but I would like to try and do something about them in case they get out of control. Any suggestions? I don't have any diagnosis of mental health conditions other than Anxiety, Depression and ADHD. I'm 25, Female.",5,paranoia

I can barely eat or drink because I feel like someone will put drugs in my food or are doing something to punish me for something bad I did in the past. My lights turned on when I was sleeping and this only happens when I sleep. This has happened so many times and it only happens at night when I'm asleep.

"Okay so, I’ve been looking for a place to live, I used different apps like spare room zoopla Rightmove etc and on one of the apps, I gave a landlord my number so he could send me videos of the property (because you can’t send videos over chat, and id done this with loads of different properties so I didn’t think giving my number was a big deal) He then messaged me on WhatsApp saying the room is gone. 2 weeks later he sends me a unsolicited unprovoked dick pic saying it’s ‘consolation’ for the room being gone. I really panicked and just felt gross and disgusted and confused cause why are you doing this, so I screenshotted the messages and sent it to a friend asking what I should do like shall I go off on his ass or just block or report or what (this has never happened before to me) - she was going off and got so angry cause it’s technically sexual harassment, she messaged the guy ( his number was in the screenshot) a screenshot of the conversation I sent her (the one with his dick pic) and said something along the lines of “this is disgusting do you have no respect for women and for yourself” and called him pretending to be interested in the property then called him a perv etc etc. Now baring in mine I blocked him after the photo (panic block lol) and now upon further looking at his account on the housing app, he works for the government. I suffer with anxiety and paranoia and I’ve somehow convinced myself he’s going to use my number & picture which was on the profile to find out where I live and stalk and kill me or he’s going to press revenge porn charges or get me fired or something???

"I never post anything like this or even use Reddit but anyways. I’m 24, I’m a recovering drug addict I have a year sober and clean. I’m posting this because of the empty void and the intense anxiety I experience that progressively gets worse. I take care of my grandma with Alzheimer’s, my best friend past away a few years back, and I left my girl of 3 years that I loved because she was no good for me. All these misfortunes and others that I haven’t named replay in my mind on top of not knowing my direction in life. I used to be extremely extraverted now I’m the opposite, it’s hard for me to answer people back, I don’t like going out anymore, even though I want companionship and I do want to be how I was but I’m just lost. I’ve had a crazy life so far and I know I have alot more in store but I’m scared and I get sinister thoughts that start to take over me and a big part of it is not knowing my purpose or forgetting what my purpose is. I have two things in my life that I’ve always loved and that I’m passionate about, but they’re not lucrative unfortunately.. those two things are watching movies/writing movie scripts and bodybuilding and dieting. I been working dead end jobs and end up leaving one to another from lazy and incompetent employees. I haven’t had a job within the past 2 months which doesn’t help with what I’m going through. but anyways, I’ve always got vanity in my mind motivating me, getting an attractive girl, a nice car, keep improving my body, still have drug fantasies even though I will never go back to that life. I’m an attractive guy so I’m not always worried about not getting another girlfriend but I do get very lonely. I believe in god but my heart isn’t fully there at times and I know that’s a life long journey and my take is the reason why I feel like this is not having faith at all times and not knowing my purpose which creates constant lows and highs. I get so anxious sometimes that my brain feels like a carbonated drink and I feel like I’m about to pass out and my heart races through the roof. I used to not get like this often but now it happens regularly.

"I've been battling depression comorbid with anxiety for 5 years now. It has taken everything away from me, i'm a single 26 year old unexpirienced man with a severe case of loneliness. 

There is not a chance in hell that I will find a partner in this condition. I mostly just lay flat on my bed and cry (sudden outbursts of crying).As of now it's getting worse with anger and irritability. My memory is shot as well, and most of the time it shows at the 22% part-time store job I have. Which is the only time I interact with someone. 

I have lost my early twenties, and will probably lose my late twenties as well to this psychological demon that is depression.

"Hey people, I hurt the person I loved the most, we decided to breakup because her family was not accepting me because I am from a different religion. We didnot break up because of any of our problems. But its not easy right.. i kept going back and she was with me too. But it was never like how it was before. She never texted once upfront after the breakup i texted more than 100 times and she never showed that she needed me when I clearly needed her.  
  
I wanted to marry her, how can I just let her go like that, I know i should accept it but it isnt easy. It was getting harder and harder for me everyday. she might be feeling the same too but she never communicated. I kept pouring my heart even after the breakup and she kept sliding it just like that. we were fighting frequently, but i never let her go said sorry for everything thats not even my mistake and tried to make her smile whenever possible.  
  
But it was getting heavier and heavier the girl who used to text me every hour, now doesnt even text me for days together even if i keep texting. I was not even able to spend time in my home whenever i visit home. It was getting harder to breathe. My head was aching very bad and one day when i was at my worst, i texted her a big paragrah stating my love and how miserable i am right now and i needed a little love and support for just a little while, I dont know how but she picked up a fight, and I had hit rock bottom and I lost it, I said bad things and made her feel bad. I said things that I didnot mean but was angry.. It was suffocating that I was not able to get out of it.  
  
And now she blames that I destroyed our relationship saying all those things.

"I try as hard as I can to not speak in public or around other people that I am not familar with in general.

Not because I'm trying to be rude, but I am just afraid of speaking around other people, even being alone too, and talking to my significant other on the phone... I just feel like there is someone listening to me, watching me, somewhere, and I don't like that.. it feels like I have no privacy even though I am very quite, keep to myself a lot, and alone more than I'm not. Along with that I am intensely paranoid about thinking or saying certain things too.

Heck, I get scared of changing in front of my pets bc I think they might be robots or their eyes are connected to a screen and someone has footage of my naked body. I’m so paranoid about using public bathrooms because I’m scared there are cameras behind the mirrors or in those flood lights or whatever. I’ve been paranoid about that since I was around 4. My dad’s family used to have a restaurant and I asked him about the flood lights and I think he jokingly said it was a camera. Ever since, I’ve never been comfortable if one is in the bathroom. I’m also paranoid about going to my both of my sisters homes and scared there are cameras behind their mirrors. I also can’t sleep easily bc I’m constantly checking over my shoulder bc I feel watched. I’m also scared everyone talks behind my back and I feel like everyone thinks I’m a horrible person. I don’t know what to do and who to talk to. I don’t know how to reach out for help bc this is so draining living like this.

Edit: I also wanted to mention that I trust almost no one. I love my family and friends so much but I never let my guard down bc I feel like they’re gonna switch one day.

"I'm attending university and while I am on the road to a top grade, it doesn't feel like I've done much to deserve it, it does not feel like it is genuine. I keep worrying that if I leave the university, it will tell its students and staff to track me down and watch me, so I think their grade system has been altered to fit my pace. A few days ago, they announced an extension for an activity that I have been vocally but privately discussingwith someone. I am sure that I am being watched and monitored by my university and friends right now. I was told to download a software for my course and I can't disable it. My university has a hidden reputation and I worry that they will use it to their advantage to intimidate me into submission or notify my friends and family of my whereabouts in the event that I move someplace else. This would lead to me being tracked down for life and I have been aware of this since I was young. I need to ask for forgiveness but I don't know how. I was dismissive at the time that I didn't think about it. Three days ago, there was an RSPCA van but it wasn't genuine because the logo was smaller and did not look real, and upon looking at the side window, it drove away immediately. The person inside had a GPS . A day before that, a lady was walking by my house with what looked to be her friend, and she was looking down at the ground, the way that she was walking was unusual and I think it was something that I was supposed to understand, but in that time, I didn't understand, so I never got if she was helping me or not which I feel really distressed about even now. I have only taken a photo of the van but I can't share it. In my walls, I heard tapping (not heating) around 4pm yesterday, I knocked at the wall and nothing knocked back, but the knocking continued every time I diverted my attention from it. I looked at my laptop while still focusing on my walls and nothing happened, so patterns are taken into consideration. This is recent so I don't know what this is pertaining towards, but I remember that I had a dream about my wallpaper being red paisley which was a sign (not from God), but I didn't want it, it's a bad sign which I have gathered. I worry that people can read my thoughts when they touch me or are talking to me. I had a very uncomfortable thought while someone was talking to me and I felt sick, they asked if I was okay which I attributed to them knowing I was uncomfortable due to the thought. Now I'm worried that my lecturers have seen my thoughts but I don't remember if I have had awful thoughts during lectures so I am panicking badly about this. I can't eat and I feel sick every time I try to, and attending lectures makes me feel extremely nervous, but I can't turn to God because I have no knowledge of whether I had been dismissive, so I have no good reason to. I've been looking at pictures on my Pinterest to stay on board as I store my good pictures there, and have been hanging hamsa in my room to divert the bad pictures. Bad pictures usually come from bad numbers, sounds and rarely music. I can't stop crying and feeling sick and I have to go under my covers when I do but I keep worrying that cameras are being poked through the fabric and my neck. Every time something doesn't feel right or go my way, I get overwhelmed immediately and it's affecting my relationships. My best friend could be a part of this which is horrifying to me as I have told him a lot of things. How do I ask for forgiveness? I'm really worried but more messages and signs keep coming through, I'm really frustrated that I can't understand all of them",5,paranoia

"I have been the victim of several instances of children / teenage boys seeing me and accusing me of racism. The first instance I was out at about 8 or 9 pm, sitting in a chair outside eating a burrito. A group of boys came out of a shop nearby and immediately one of them yelled “what is he doing out? Doesn’t he know it’s too late for him to be out?” He then took out his phone and started yelling for his other friends to come over while saying “this guy attacked me!” They came out and asked what I did (I was about 20 feet away and never saw the boy or said anything to him before in my life). He responds “I don’t know, haha, just who he is I guess! They’re kind isn’t supposed to be outside this late!” 

I was sitting looking at my burrito and glancing back at the boy as he yelled. I didn’t say anything or move. Eventually they left me alone but the incident startled me.

Last week at Whole Foods, I was looking at pizza. Out of the corner of my eye I looked over and a five year old girl was holding up her hand like an imaginary gun shooting at me. 

Today I was at the park walking my dog. I was going to throw a bag of dog poop away and two boys were on the bench nearby. One of them had a skateboard and he loudly popped it against the ground. Startled and beaten down from months of threats and intimidation, I looked down at the ground. Then I heard him say “yeah!” He was staring right at me with hatred in his eyes. I felt like he was purposely threatening me. Trying not to give in to fear, I looked back up at him and threw the dog poop away. Then I walked off with my pup. My dog walks slow and makes lots of potty breaks so as he did one I turned around to see the boy with the skateboard taking pictures of me. He then started to complain to his friend how “they will say he’s just walking his dog.” And how “hard it is to get this guy”. 

I am very afraid that the younger generation is learning to weaponize their phone against anyone they don’t like. All they have to do is threaten or insult the person, then whip out their phone and film the anger. It’s so easy to make anyone look like the bad guy, and you have no proof that they insulted you or threatened you for no reason. 

Why don’t I take out my own phone? Is it fear that holds me back from filming them in response? Stupidity? My PTSD silences me. In the moment I cannot speak, which is probably why I am still alive and free. But I am afraid they will come for me soon. 

I’m making this statement now, trying to raise awareness. If anyone is out there, be careful around children who may be entrapping you by inciting anger or rage in you. They want you mad, they want to film it happening, and they want to pretend that they didn’t do anything wrong so that you take all the blame. 

At this point, I feel that I am a victim of serious abuse. I am suffering regular mental breakdowns and fear for my life. I just want to be left alone. I just want peace and quiet. I don’t know what caused all this rage and anger, and I don’t know why I’m the target of it, but at this point it doesn’t seem to matter.",5,paranoia
"Last Feb before my bday, I was rushed to ER due to difficulty in breathing and vomiting. My blood sugar by the time I was hospitalized was at 500+mg/dL, HBA1C is at 11.0%. Almost died in the ICU if not IJ for potassium drip since my potassium dipped down to 1.2 (dangerous) as a byproduct of insulin drips to treat my DKA.

Three months of balanced diet, exercise (mainly walking 1-2km every morning and 20mins of cardio every day), and insulin shots that went from 38 units glargine in the morning + 6 units apidra every meal to only 20 units glargine in the morning if I'm above 80mg/dL after 1 month. Being asian, I still eat rice (it's hard to give up), red rice every lunch and dinner. More on fish, chicken and veggies. Then my breakfast and snack is always tuna sandwich with TLC and fried egg.

Today I had my first lab test for **HBA1C**, result was **5.1%**, though FBS is a bit low at **63mg/dL** (may be the reason why c-peptide is also low at **0.37ng/dL**). Other tests were also okay aside from Uric Acid which was a bit higher than normal. Still waiting for GAD results to verify which type it really is. My endo's looking at 1.5 for now but I'm initially diagnosed as T2.

Also had my eyes checked earlier to check for diabetic retinopathy, thankfully the doctor didn't see any problems, eyes were still a bit blurry by the time if this writing due to dilation.

Will have my results checked by my endo by Monday to see if I did a good job managing my sugar levels.

Can't help but share this achievement in this sub-reddit since I feel proud of what I accomplished so far. Managing diabetes while living alone in a big city is scary as it is.

My first reflex is to scream, and she snaps like there's no reason to.

 My grandma (who I hate and sincerely hope dies soon but that's another can of worms) keeps touching my legs for whatever reason. I feel sexualized and dehumanized, not to mention the awful sensory overload.

	After being in college for two years I have been asked out three times. In the past since I was asked out over text I would sort of avoid the question and change the topic, but most recently I was asked out by someone I see very frequently as we are both in a relatively small major and typically have lots of classes together.

	Him and I have literally never held a conversation and I really don’t know what to do. He’s sweet but not really my type, but more importantly I have absolutely no interest in dating, and hanging out with people one-on-one is a literal nightmare for me. I don’t think I have ever hung out alone with a guy in my entire life. I don’t talk to people often in class and I never hang out with people outside. I’m basically a shut in…

	He has texted me every day for the past week and I had been able to put off agreeing to hang out with him because of legitimate reasons, but now it’s just getting too much, and I’m running out of excuses. In the past when I guess I essentially ghosted people, I always felt like shit because I know if I were In their position I would be really upset. 

	I know the easiest thing would be to just say I’m not interested but the fear of awkwardness of seeing him every day for the rest of my time in college is overwhelming. When I asked my friends (who don’t know about my anxiety issues) for advice they said I should just hang out with him once so he’ll stop asking. But I just know I’ll be awkward and probably end up having a panic attack when I come home. Plus what if he ends up asking again? My friends think it’s stupid that this is even a concern of mine and I can’t really turn to them anymore for help because I’m worried they think I’m trying to boast or something 

	Sorry this post is a bit of a mess but every time I think about the situation ship I feel like I’m five seconds from a panic attack. And sorry if this seems like a stupid worry, I guess that’s sort of the point though",4,anxiety
Hi so I've noticed for a while now that whenever there's any sudden noises my head jerks forward. This happens often already whenever I'm extremely anxious about something underlying (which is always). But now instead of it just being a reaction to my anxiety it's started to happen with any noise. Like I'm at school right now in my art class and someone just dropped their paper which made a noise (it's Bristol paper so pretty thick paper) and my head jerked forward. This happens all the time but also not? Like it picks and chooses. I don't know if this is normal. Does anyone else experience this? Is this something I should mention to my therapist?,4,anxiety
"Trigger Warning: SA 

This book was SO good. Probably one of the rare times I prefer the sequel to tue first book. Firstly (and big old spoiler warning) Fuck Uncle Marc. All my homes hate Uncle Marc. What a conniving, back stabbing little piece of shit he turned out to be. Maybe it's because I have a young kid but I was so SO angry that he kept her child from her and all for himself because he couldn't admit the people he was with were a bunch of animals. What a self righteous piece if shit. ""I guess I just wasn't ready to share you with anyone"". I hope he suffers. I wish bad and painful things on him. The author absolutely NAILS Zealots as a group of monsters who see themselves as good people akd it makes me furious and scared at tue same time. I truly loved how introducing her daughter as someone READING the journal were given a more objective view of the main character. And I sort of agree with her daughter, Olaminas main goal should've always been to go after her daughter and Olamina IS a manipulator who uses her super empathy to better get inside people's heads. In an interesting way, the MC doesn't see anything wrong with what's she's doing. And I guess she never uses this power for evil but she is absolutely using it to control and enthrall people. She's dangerous. In an interesting way, I don't think she ever sees anything of her own absolute faith that she's doing the right thing (cause it's for the destiny) reflected back at her by her Christian captors, or even Marc. The ending was bittersweet, but overall hopeful which was nice! Overall 9/10, it's worth it to read the first one just to get to the second one.

Quick edit to say that I also loved how she never used the word Teacher for her captors, always ""Teacher"" with quotes. Like she never gives them the satisfaction of the title.",0,negative_samples

"Had a nasal drip for over 3 months now and it's driving me absolutely insane. Initially had a really sore throat for 3 days from what I assume was a viral infection which cleared, then had a nasal drip which I figured would've cleared after a week or so like the previous colds I've had however 12+ weeks later it's still as strong as ever. It's disrupting my sleep as I'm continually sleeping with my mouth open and wake up with an incredibly dry mouth and crusty lips so I'm continually tired or under the weather.

So far I've had two repeats of anti-biotics, oregano oil capsules, d3, vitamin c, nasal sprays, salt water, steam inhalation aside from some short term relief, nothing has done much. I'm typically very allergy free and healthy, aside from the occasional hay fever and I've certainly never had anything last this long and I'm at a loss as to what's causing it. Have booked in to see an ENT specialist though that is still a few months off.

My diet probably isn't the best right now and I'm a little overweight but certainly excessively, that probably isn't helping but I can't see that it would be a major issue that would be causing it to be chronic. I typically have recovered from illness pretty quickly and fortunately have very rarely get sick.

"Hi! I made a post about it yesterday but I deleted it because of my anxiety.


So, I'm 19 [F] and the day before yesterday I saw someone on the train taking pictures of me (at least that's what it looked like -i wasn't wearing something weird or have dyed hair or piercings or anything like that) and now I'm extremely paranoid that people are watching and following me waiting for the right moment to kidnap me. Im already scared that people are stalking my house and will try to break in and now I'm even more afraid something bad will happen to me.


 The thing is, everytime I try to calm myself down I think that I am just being extremely observant or that the universe is sending me messages so that I can be ready when the right time comes. Basically it tries to protect me by making me paranoid and scared all the time. I know this probably sounds kind of crazy but I can't stop thinking that way.


I'm seeing a psychiatrist and I've been taking antipsychotics for some months now (I currently take 3 kinds of antipsychotics every day) but that doesn't seem to help me at all. How can I stop this madness? I can't live like that. I'm so tired. Do my thought make any sense? What did the person who took photos of me want? I think I'm going insane.

1. Always occurred about semi-annually (twice a year on average) 

2. Always occur out of sleep. Seemingly always have vivid dream / nightmare as precursor.

3. Mid vivid dream, not fully asleep, then aura suddenly occurs - never any indication before aura or in days before headaches. 

4. Always have an aura first. Aura is extremely debilitating, and painful. Like a full shaking of the head and almost feels like a semi shock.

5. Following about 5 second aura is insaneee shock to the head occurring for about 5 seconds, following aura and massive shock vomiting almost always occurs. 

6. After 5-10 minutes of vomiting no pain but extreme sensitivity to noise and light that will induce another aura and shock and vomitting cycle. 

7. Almost always last 1-2 weeks (7-15 days) of complete incapacity, debilitating sensories, auras and shocks + vomitting.

8. No medicines ever prevented or stopped them. Tried a lot, suppositories because of vomiting, sumatriptan injections, triptan medications, all the way to nasal lidocaine sprays to numb receptors.

"Idk if this is considered paranoia but I needed somewhere to put this. Today I (M) was at my girls house and everything was good as per usual and I left, as usual now bear in mind I’ve walked this way home around 50 -60 times and never experienced anything like this it’s about a 1.5 mile walk takes me around 30 minutes. As I’m walking out of my girlfriends block of houses I start to hear like a quite deep sobbing sound almost of that of a middle age woman. I shrug it off and continue walking, as I’m walking by the school near her house I then start to hear the sobbing again, this time  much higher pitched also this time I actually heard it as if I could pinpoint where it was coming from whereas last time I could only pinpoint a general direction. While I’m hearing this a man comes out and starts walking his dog and continues paying no attention at all to what I’m hearing. I continue walking but now I start doubting myself so I start videoing and cannot hear it in the video I took. As I’m walking I’m growing more and more scared so I phone my friend and at which point I now hear the voice again this time it was humming some sort of tune in a lower tone it was humming the song of one of those old music boxes. So I kept walking and at this point I start running in attempt to lose this voice but when I stopped running (about half a mile from where I’d first heard it) I started hearing the sobbing again and I was getting really freaked out and felt like this thing was following me. I continued running and got to about (a mile from where I’d first heard it) and thought I’d lost it. I then heard the sobbing again from a garden near me and sprinted again right up into a housing estate where I could no longer hear the noise. I then got to me house (1.5 miles away from where I first heard the noise) and while I was waiting on my little brother to answer the door I heard it for one more time before entering my house I don’t know what to think of this do I need peoples opinion on what I should do.",5,paranoia

"I'm sorry this will be kinda long and might be hard to read, I'll try to break it up as much as possible.

Ive tried in the past to bring up the possibility of ADHD to a few people. My therapist and APRN both told me that my case is too complex for them to be able to come up with a definitive answer on their own (I also have severe anxiety and they said it would be hard for them to be able to decipher what symptoms came from what). And my parents don't believe there's anything wrong with me besides anxiety. But there also pretty uneducated when it comes to mental health stuff. 

About two weeks ago I had an appointment with someone who is supposed to specialize in testing and evaluations. He wasn't specifically testing for ADHD but it was something I had brought up and he said he would help look into. I filled out general forms that covered multiple disorders, but the only thing he gave me that was specifically ADHD related was one screening test. 

I don't remember what it was called, but it was a test that asked questions about when I was ages 5-12 with a scale of like never to very often. 

The only things I answered ""never"" for were questions about disobeying adults (which I never did because I'm scared of confrontation and I used to be terrified of not listening to authority like teachers) and things like ""did you feel like you were driven by a motor"" or ""did you get up out of your seat when you weren't supposed to (I'm believe I would most likely have innattentive type anyway). And there were only a couple questions like that. 

He then said that, based on that one test about when I was in elementary school and the fact that nobody noticed anything when I was a child, (he hasn't finished going through the general forms) that IF I do have ADHD, it would be ""more on the mild side"" and I could probably leave it alone until I got a proper job and had more responsibilities (I'm unable to work and still live with my family) unless I'm saying ""I can't get up, I can't read a book, I can't start anything..."" To which I went ""well..."" But he kinda just kept talking. 

I really regret not speaking up more because I do have those problems and thats part of the reason I'm trying to find someone who will assess me. Like if I don't have it that's fine. I'm not trying to root for it or whatever. I just want a fair, cohesive test so that just that if I do have it, I know I have options available to me. Not ""maybe but if you do then it's fine.""

I literally had a day a day or so after I saw him where I was trying to get up to go do something, and it literally took me 20 minutes just to get myself to reach out my hand and grab my water bottle because my throat was dry. Like literally 20 minutes of me going ""reach your arm out, just grab the bottle, all you have to do is move your arm a little bit, just grab it."" I read a little bit of a book the other day too, and when I first started I had to read over every paragraph twice because the first time I was only taking in about half of what I was reading. It got better as I got a few pages in, but still. 

And I mean maybe that's related to anxiety or something else idk. But I'm just really tired of hearing ""IF you have it"" and like ""that MAYBE could be related to ADHD"". Like I just want answers and I thought this guy was gonna be a big step towards that. But instead I just got more ""maybes"" and ""ifs"" and it's really frustrating.",3,adhd

Even the final season of Game of Thrones did it.


Was Black Panther the very first case/inventor of this type of project, or were there other movies that did this before? I thought of 2016 Suicide Squad, but I've checked, and it's just a compilation of songs that existed beforehand and weren't made for the movie.

I wish that my fucking brain could regulate attention like a normally person!!

If you got this far through I hope you are currently hyperfixation free (/hj) and enjoy your day!",3,adhd
"Today I went to see a car I'm thinking of buying, so I see the car and test drive it, the salesman tells me to turn it off and to take the keys so I can give it to him. As I go to do this he left to find me a new battery for the car, I put them in my pocket and head to the office. We talk shop for 15 minutes and settle on a price we both agree on. He offers me a ride to the nearest train station. AFTER I get back home I'm emptying my pockets and I see the car key, initiate panic, self hate, self blame Mode. Here in Germany he could easily call the police because we last left the car in the street and he could even report them as stolen. luckily he was quite nice and told me that he has spare keys so all is good now.",3,adhd
"I’ve gotten to the lowest point in my depression, I take the meds, I see the counselor. I do all of that. But nothing helps the fact that I’m 26, I live with my mom, I don’t have a job, I’m too crippling depressed to work, my car just broke and I have a 7 year old daughter. There’s no light. I’ve begun self harming in the form of hitting myself so hard I bruise and welt. My mom hates me here, I understand though. My daughter is the only reason I’m still here. And it makes me so mad that I can’t just end my suffering because I know how badly that would hurt her and she doesn’t have another parent. I feel so hopeless and I can’t even kill myself. I’ve taken all the steps to try and fix me but nothing is working. I just want to normal, functional. I haven’t always been like this , I had a job for 8 years, my own place, my own childcare, and I either want me back or for this to all end. I truly want this pain and suffering to end and I’ve done everything to no avail. I’ve never posted in here before. Not sure why I even am now.

"I miss the time were i felt alive. I was just a kid living the best of life. Everything looked so colorful and tasted good. I remember feeling the sweetest scent ever, and it made me think of that gorgeous girl, i had a crush so hard for her. I loved to just talk to her again, so i could look deep into those beatiful eyes. I would go to my best friend's house, play dozens of games and joke around like idiots. Or get all my buddies and go watch a movie.
Well... i'm trying to say that life was really nice. I could enjoy every little thing. I didn't have to think about the future, because i was living every moment to the fullest. I was happy.

But my depression screwed it all. Now i'm just a empty shell of the person i used to be. Trapped in my own body, unable to feel something. Life has lost all meaning and joy. Sometimes it feels like food has no taste, there's no scent in the air, i swear even the light of the day feels diferent, more grey. I'm lonely so badly that even in my dreams my friends ask me why i left them. But i can't send a message, because i honestly believe their friend is long dead. They have better friends. Real people to talk to.

I'm tired of pretending i'm fine, while i'm obviously slowly dying. But what's the point of looking for help? People can't possibly understand, they'll laugh and treat me as a weirdo. Or pity me. Or send me to a psych ward and throw me away. And they can pretend i'm important to them as much as they want, but in the end of the day, i'll be alone in my suffering. I may speak about my darkness, but only i can see it. Eveyone get back to their houses and enjoy life, while i pretend to be human.",2,depression
"I go to concerts a lot because I love live music, but I find that I often feel awful the next day. For a long time I thought it was just “post-concert depression” but the most recent time it happened I realized that the amount of negative thoughts and feelings I have afterward must be from the large fluctuations in dopamine that happen in such a short period of time. I just saw a few posts about this made in the past that helped me out a term to what it is I experience.

It just bums me out a lot because what is supposed to be a wonderful experience to think about is soured because my brain doesn’t have the super awesome dose of dopamine it received the day before. Instead, I’m just sad and disinterested in things that could be mentally stimulating/beneficial for me. I guess I’m just wondering what other people’s experiences might be with this kind of dopamine crash and what y’all do to cope or work around it.",3,adhd
"I am 24f and had what I think are migraines develop only about 6 months ago. I’ve never had issues with headaches until one day where I got one and it lasted for 8 days before going to the ER. I didn’t have a problem again for a few months but then it happened again. Now, I have them every couple days and on the days I don’t I still feel like I have pressure in my head/ behind eyes and pain at the back of my head. I also will get floaters in my eyes. I have a neck injury from about a year and a half ago that never had headaches accompany the neck pain but I’m also not sure now if they’re related. I’m still also unsure if I actually have migraines or something else is causing this pain. I am seeing a neurologist and we did scans and they were clear but now he is doing another one since some of my symptoms are atypical (I don’t usually get light or sound sensitivity or nausea and laying down can help get rid of the pain). I’ve read about Csf leaks and I’m wondering if that’s maybe why my migraines are progressing so quickly is because they’re not actually just migraines at all. Anyways, I’m just wondering if anyone else has had similar symptoms/issues that just ended up being migraines that developed later in life ?",0,negative_samples

"This is the beginning of a 3+ month trip to SEA. I was apprehensive as I haven't done any long overseas trips but so far it's been super easy and smooth! So if you're on the fence, just do it! Thailand is very easy to navigate for English speakers and with smart phones now it's dead smooth to get around and find accommodations, etc. 

Photo 1: China Town. Stayed on a river front little hotel for $20/night and wandered the markets. Ate soo much good food. Favorite was grandma Noi's duck noodles, 70 baht a bowl!

Photo 2: Inside Wat Pho

Photo 3: Party boats going down the Cha Phraya River with a Wat in the background. 

Photo 4: Prawns at a night market

Photo 5: A Buddha head grown over by a bodhi tree. Blanking on the name of the Wat but it's in Ayutthaya.

Photo 6-15: Various temples in and around Ayutthaya. We took a train up here from Bangkok, 2 hours, 15 baht each. Stayed at a guest house on the river for 650baht/night. Ate a ton of street food from the vendors at the various markets. My favorite were the boat noodles, seafood omlettes, and rotti. 

One thing that made me apprehensive was a lot of the negative things I read online in researching Thailand. I haven't found any of the negative things listed in reviews to be bothersome. I think it's all about expectations. For example our first hotel, it was $20/night and lots of complaints online, like sure, it's not amazing and it's run down but you're paying $20/night! Don't expect a 5 star resort for that price.

The canals will be smelly, there will be traffic, there will be trash, there are stray dogs, yes it is hot. But that's just part of the experience. We've had an incredible time.

All this is to say don't let what you read online turn you off! This has been some of the smoothest and most enjoyable traveling I've ever done. The thai people are so kind! Just learning to say Sawati krap and kap kun krap goes a long way.

We've just been winging it as we go. Using Google and agoda to find places to stay. Grab app to get places if it's far but mostly walking around if it's under 3km. Discovered a ton of really cool alleyways and local spots that way. Point to the food you want. Lots of vendors speak a little English too.

We found the best food just walking around at the street markets and seeing what was popular with the locals. Our worst meals have been in the more expensive(relatively) touristy restaurants. 

As far as budget goes I was a bit worried about thailand being more expensive now but every room we've booked so far has been under $20, all private rooms non hostels with A/C. Food has been $10-20 a day just eating everything we want from street vendors. Walking around a lot saves money on transportation. The most expensive thing so far has been bjj and muay thai training. Got our asses kicked at a gym in Ayuttha, training in 100 degree thailand heat is something else!!",0,negative_samples
"I'm currently a senior in high school, with very little friends and depression because I don't know how to talk to people normally, and I often embarass myself. So I basically spend most of my time inside my house because of that. I just went to the doctor yesterday, and they told me that according to my bmi I'm fucking obese.

"Im going to try to keep this as comprehensive and to the point as possible. I dont feel loved by anyone, and i oftentimes question why i continue to live. It has costed me several jobs and my sanity when i came to realize the most important aspect to life is about love, and even though i had my heart completely broken by someone who i thought loved me but actually betrayed me, i still have the innate desire to find someone who completes me. i know that love must come from within before you can love another, i just feel so distraught because my partner who i was smitten with betrayed me, then spreaded gossip about me to further shame me and my reputation. that alone id think would drive anyone crazy, but on top of that, my own family has been mentally abusing me for years, and im just starting to understand why i am the way i am. they told me I was being abusive, when in reality i was gaslit, and now i feel so depressed and alone. my brother is a piece of shit addict who keeps lying, stealing, and backstabbing me, but i try to continue to help him in spite of that because i love him so much. at this point i realized that if i stayed, it will only drag me down more, but inside, i know that if i left or my family left, hed be dead within a few weeks, which compels me to stay to help at the cost of my mental well-being.  


tl;dr: I grew up in a dysfunctional and hostile household. non-biological grandfather was an abusive alcoholic who manipulated people for a living, and did so to my grandmother, who in my mind, was the most selfless and beautiful person i met, because she made me feel like she actually loved and cared for me(unlike my own mother), but she got cancer, and i watched her die in the worst way possible. after her death, said grandfather basically stole my familys inheritance, and my mom, brother and i were left with very little even though it wasnt his right to take. my house was financed by my actual biological grandfather, who by comparison, was highly intelligent and caring. he died of cancer at age 32, so my grandmother being in a vulnerable state, made the mistake of marrying that piece of shit... he ended up dying not too long ago, a couple years after my grandmothers death. after that background, i was very likely cheated on, and used by the woman i thought loved me. my brother overdosed 2 times, and i saved his life both times while he continues to steal from me and berate me. my family betrayed me by not being there for me to show emotional support or love, and theres a specific incident in mind that id rather not share online, but it did happen, and basically my mother refused to tell people the truth of what happened because she was selfishly afraid, so instead of telling  people the truth, she pretended she didnt know what i was talking about, and i made myself look crazy and stupid. my fathers been dead since i was 11, and i still remember the cryptic and depressing things he said before he died. my uncle is probably the only person who shows love, but even then i feel like he thinks im some kinda joke since im not independent yet, even though im on the cusp of it. theres many other examples of emotional trauma that i went through but it would be pages long. in short, it feels like no one in my life truly loves or cares about me, and it makes me question the point of living in itself. I know that i deserved some of the bad things that happened to me, because i realized how toxic i was BEFORE, but that doesnt mean that i am NOW. i learned. not saying im suicidal, im just saying that the pain my past and current situation has created has been overwhelming, and im just expected to ""man up""... WHATS THE FUCKING POINT IF I HAVE NO ONE TO LOVE OR LOVE ME?! seems like society is mentally abusing the fuck out of men, because apparently women are never wrong in america, and if youre failing at life, then the whole world will ruthlessly scorn, judge and shame you over things that you feel like are outside your realm of control.",2,depression

"I (F22) was diagnosed at 10 with ASD (they called it Asperger's syndrome when I was diagnosed.) I'm now questioning my diagnosis. Something very very traumatic happened to me as a child and since then I have had trouble socializing with others and making friends. I'm not progressing the way my peers are, even my autistic peers. It's like my brain has been numb for the past 15-16 years. I'm not ""gifted"" nor am I ""intelligent"" I never had trouble socializing before what happened to me. I didn't have sensory issues before that either. I can't stop thinking about my childhood. How I wish I would've just fucking stood up to the piece of shit, who was my abuser. I feel disliked by everyone, even other autistic people. I haven't contributed anything to this world, all I am is what happened to me. I have nightmares every single fucking night.

I know that even having someone around all the time won't fix it, it's just part of the bad hamd I've been delt. No one can be around all the time and it's unfair to put that on someone, everyone has their own life and they can't just give it up just to make sure you're ok.

"I typically never feel the urge to post about my negative feelings but this instance really left me broken. Today, my parent kept “jokingly” referring to me and a bum, as I graduated a semester early and don’t work (I guess tutoring doesn’t count…) or drive. Taking a difficult course load with depression last year and the first of last year really exhausted me and I needed this semester for a mental break. My cognitive difficulties make learning news things very difficult and I have a very difficult time processing most things, so the smallest tasks feel like a difficult struggle. Because these tasks feel so difficult, I fall into a vicious cycle of fear and avoidance. 

However, my parent referring to me as a bum today really hurt, as they have done this before in the past but I shrugged it off.  This really hurt, because the smallest task feels so difficult, and I would do anything to get rid of my cognitive difficulties and lead a productive life, buts it’s not so simple. Being called a bum reminds me of how much of a loser I really am and makes me want to give up on life. Maybe I’m not good enough and will never be able to do well in university. I feel so broken right now and feel like there’s no hope for the future if I have trouble understanding the smallest things. Maybe I am just a bum, and objectively they would be right. I have no job, can’t drive, and absolutely no friends. If I were to die, very few people would care…I don’t  know why I’m especially sensitive today, but this really hurt because I’m trying my best (working hard on a driving course and preparing for several musical competitions) but don’t see any progress…

"Hello.

21M

I've been having constant flareups for over a year now. I've been diagnosed with multiple things by multiple doctors, but all of the medication they gave me got my flareups even worse.

By own experience - I cant eat: dairy, gluten, anything raw, red meat, high in fiber foods, fried, spicy, salty, sweet, extremely intolerant to nuts and almonds...

My symptoms during flareups are:

- strong pain in lower left abdomen (concentrated), maybe lower-center or lower-right (above appendicitis) and basically nowhere else;

- extremely strong bloating;

- tiredness;

- constant constipation.

I did colonoscopy, I had literall cuts in my large intestine (2 spots) that were still bleeding and looked like cat scratched the walls.

I also got diagnosed with dysbiosis (disbalance of gut bacteria) and with bile reflux (gallbladder juice going up in the stomach). Most recently, with IBS. even tho they were diagnosed by analysis, the medication got me worse with the flareups symptoms.

My everyday diet consists of only: Boiled chicken breast (without salt), boiled buckwheat, boiled carrots and potatos, banana or grated apple (without skin). oat breads.
I drink 3 litres of water minimum and am physically active. (only now I feel better from symptoms, with this strict diet)

Pain in the lower left abdomen first started when i was relaxing in silence. as soon as i would relax my abdomen, pain would emerge with bloating and would not stop for hours.

I am really out of choices and confused. I dont know what to do to live my life again. Anything you think I could use, I would be glad to hear.
I dont even know what I have.
IBD community is my last hope.

When the base of skull/neck pain starts, it *will* eventually turn into a horrible migraine and basically feels like someone is stabbing an icepick from the base of my skull to the adjoining eye like [this](https://imgur.com/Y7rdcQf). To describe the *type* of pain more clearly, it can feel like a piercing, shocking, and/or throbbing pain. The migraines also cause the typical sensitivity to light and sound, and I get some relief from heat but hardly any prevention.

&#x200B;

Please help. I already deal with enough stuff as is and wish at the very least, this one thing can be something I can avoid or fix.

Edit: This was my first time trying to cross post aaand i'm apparently bad at it seeing as how my added comment somehow wasn't posted along with it LOL. Anywho, this was first posted in another sub and I just wanted to clarify that I am **NOT** asking for medical advice on this sub nor am I using this sub as a replacement for professional medical care. Quite the opposite actually. I have **already** visited my family Dr about my migraines and he just suggested to try OTC meds and hot/cold compress.  

No one else I have talked to before this had shared the same migraine experiences and, now after talking to a few of you, has finally helped me feel less alone! I'm also glad I was able to get some suggestions for what type of specialist(s) to seek out because I honestly had no idea and my Dr didn't suggest any during the visit. I was a lot more ignorant about migraines than I initially thought. So I really appreciate all of the awesome insight and suggestions on how to make them a bit easier to deal with, as well as how/where I can go to get proper medical help for my migraines!",0,negative_samples
"It wasn't supposed to, but it's kind of a rant.

 I've just been feeling kinda..weird, lately. If I'm not actively crying\\having an almost anxiety attack\\feeling an overwhelming sense of uselessness, I can't say for sure what I'm feeling. 

I'm in college since 2021; since i started I've felt useless\\incompetent\\stupid in at least one subject. That's fine, i guess; I assume everyone deals with something like this. But this semester is especially bad. Even in subjects that I supposedly already have some knowledge on, I just fuck something up and can't keep the assignments on time. And even before I fuck something up or even star something, I just think, ""let's see how long this lasts until it derails completely"". I don't feel like doing anything other than lay in my  bed or watch something random on youtube, thus making everything harder for myself.

In general, I have some difficulty taking showers (I like being clean, but the whole process of taking a shower really tires me out), but it's never been as hard as it was these last few weeks. Doing anything,  washing the dishes or cooking an egg, made me feel like crying. I have\\had group assignments where I'm not doing much, I know that, I've apologized to my friends that are doing them with me, but most of the time I just can't **make myself do it.** Since being diagnosed and getting on meds (Ritalin), I've been ok at forcing myself to do things, but it just hasn't been working lately.

I just have this sense of failing in every aspect of my life (college, living alone, managing relationships, having any ability to get a job, even as trainee...) and it's tiring, for me and for the people around me. My boyfriend thinks I'm depressed; i disagree. I think it's me being generally bad at being a member of society, mixed with having a period that usually messes deeply with my mood (it's supposed to come this week, that's why I'm wondering if the last shitshow week could be a result of it, but it's usually not that bad). 

Some things in my personal life also messed with my emotional, so yeah, it's been...a month. I'm just wondering if it's deppression, my innability to do things, hormones, a mix of some, a mix of all.... Tired, that's something I know I feel most of the time.

Next month I'll look for a therapist that my ensurance covers. I'm not doing it for me though; if I waited until I felt like going to a therapist for me, I just wouldn't go. I don't like the ideia of just talking about personal things to a stranger (yes, i realise the irony of posting something like this online, but I can't see you, you can't see me, so it's easier and less likely for me to get embarassed and shut down), it doesn't exactly makes sense the whole process of it, to me. Even more so after i tried therapy before, and the therapist complained to my parents I wasn't opening up fast enough after six months. 

So I'll do it for my parents, for my boyfriend and friends; for the people I fear hurting because of the way I feel about myself. 

English is not my first language and sorry for the rant. Hope your week has been good.",3,adhd
"It’s happened very fast and I don’t know how to feel as I’ve never had any problems or symptoms before hand only some joint pain and fatigue

I first got symptoms near the beginning of March this year and it came on very suddenly. I was fine one morning and the same evening I was having extreme stomach pain ,diarrhoea and a lot of blood loss.

I went to the hospital and they found I have very serve inflammation of my bowel and since then I have been on high dose of steroids as everytime I’ve gone down lower than 25 mg on the steroids it flares back up again and I’ve had to go back into hospital each time and I’m now going on Adalimumab next week as a long term solution to help keep it from flaring back up.

It’s just all happening so quickly I haven’t had time to process it and it’s all so new to me and I’m not sure what to expect with the biologics or how’s it’s going to be as I’m already having side effects from the steroids. 

Does anyone have any advice going on the biologics ? Or any ways I can help myself during a flare up especially with the constant joint pain and fatigue I’m having?",0,negative_samples
"Hey, so my girlfriend recently went to a mental health hospital for PTSD. She's been having flashbacks and panic attacks for a couple days related to a trigger - she's sick and I won't get into it but obviously she has trauma related to that sort of thing. I'm just feeling absolutely sick with worry. We're long distance, she's from Michigan USA. She told me she was voluntarily going and they're likely going to take her phone, which they have. She wasn't self harming, suicidal, or a danger to anyone around her either btw..I just have no contact with her or anyone around her.. And so, my question is, how long may they keep her for? I keep seeing stuff about 72 hours. It's been 24 hours since she went. Any constructive information is very much so appreciated.

"I just want to preface that my parents are in no way abusive or bad people and they try their best as parents like any parent does, however I’ve come to realize they don’t understand certain parts of my autism and even though I try to explain the things I do they don’t seem to understand.

I am a diagnosed autistic and I have been in services like special education and ABA therapy since I was young, however my parents didn’t really do any research outside of what professionals have told them and the basics and I’ve had to teach them about meltdowns, stimming, masking etc and it’s exhausting. I am no way insinuating my parents are stupid but it’s low key kind of exhausting teaching them about things they honestly should’ve already known about. I’m convinced they think autism is just little quirkiness with your brain but otherwise your like everyone else, which is not true. 

They think things like meltdowns are like toddlers having a tantrum and deny I have sensory issues at places like school and church and that I need to grow up and deal with responsibility. I get overwhelmed quite easily and I can meltdown and start crying and when I start I can’t stop and it takes me a while to calm down. They act like I’m a toddler who needs to control my emotions but I’m not and it’s incredibly hurtful.

I need to get this out there because I’m tired of being their teacher and I’d wish they would understand more.",1,autism
"(Sorry this is a long post ahead, not exactly ADHD friendly)

I'm in my early 20s and recently got diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression and I honestly relate a lot to the Asperger's community. I've known that I was dealing with these things for a long time but avoided addressing it until now because I am in an intense burnout cycle that has left me feeling decapitated. My family's response is that none of this is real and I just need to stop being lazy and to get it together. They don't want me to take medication because apparently living life depending on a pill is worse than a dysfunctional life without joy (I'm aware medication isn't necessary for everyone and some people thrive on other sorts of treatment, but I want to at least try it). They even wanted me to not tell my professors about what's going on to save face and my mom thinks they're talking about how terrible my work ethic is behind my back. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't now also paranoid about this. For context, I'm currently struggling through an undergrad degree that is really difficult. I once had a strong passion for the topic but it is slowly burning out along with my will to live. It's especially awful because my parents are paying so much money for this and I struggle intensely with guilt for my lack of willpower in daily life. I feel guilty for using accommodations in school and still barely pulling through and my parents make me feel 10x worse.

I honestly don't have memories of being happy for an extended period of time. I've always been intensely emotional and had anger issues as a child, but I quickly learned how to conceal this because I grew up the only child of super religious parents who care about appearances more than my feelings. I'm afraid of them and try to do as much as I can to avoid upsetting them. My mother in particular has been a helicopter over me my entire life and has very explosive anger such that I'm constantly telling white lies out of fear I might say something that'll make her blow up. Needless to say, I got yelled at when she tried to help me with math homework. I could talk about a lot of negative experiences from my childhood, but that would take all day. My privacy was constantly violated and I was punished for ""lying"" whenever I bottled up my feelings, even though I did this because those feelings have been dismissed every single time, or worse the feelings were considered offensive.

I've also struggled socially my entire life and its only gotten worse as I've gotten older. I have a couple of good friends, but for the most part I live my life completely disconnected from society. Every day, I wake up and walk through life as if it were a simulator. It's like I'm in some sort of bubble where time is distorted. I rarely have anything to look forward to and when I do I can hardly enjoy it either because I'm 1) feeling guilty about something that I haven't done or 2) get bored and/or tired incredibly easily. It feels like I have no escape from this hell. There are some people who listen, but I've never felt like I've been heard by anyone besides a therapist I see every two-three weeks for free through my school and I'll be going home for break soon. Nothing is appealing to me in life except for my bed and my ability to get lost in my imagination. My executive function is so poor right now and it's added so much to the shame. I feel like things are never going to get better. I hate being at school and I hate being at home. I hate thinking about the future and the past is painful. What do I even do? I've never cried so much in my life.",3,adhd

"I went grocery shopping last night and forgot all the groceries in my car overnight. I bought some amazing steaks and chicken which I was excited about cooking, but now I have to throw them away. Not to mention that they weren’t cheap. They were prime 1 steaks 😕. 

I’ve made the change to cook every meal at home, but clearly that’s not an option with ADHD. This disease makes me hate myself and feel like a piece of shit. Like who tf goes grocery shopping and then leaves everything in their car. That means I parked my car, walked inside with nothing in my hands, and had no recollection of what I just did for the last hour. 

I’m only 22 and understand that there’s no way I can go the rest of my life with this level of incompetence. I live on my own and can’t afford to waste $80 worth of groceries, especially with the inflation my government has caused these last couple years.

"Some hurtful words from someone I love.
The comparisons from a partner who's father and brother have ADHD both spent time medicated or not and have achieved so much more.

Their father apparently suffered such severe symptoms and yet managed to change careers and complete degrees unmedicated and remember all the sweet gift moments and ideas.

Their brother who deeply loves their wife, only periodically takes medication and does elaborate planning, successful job and house life.

And here I feel like a shambled wreck of failure, only recently diagnosed thanks to their help to realise that maybe the anxiety, discalcula, depression, risk taking behaviour and apparently death wish of poke dangerous things for a reaction who never finished school, couldn't get into uni, has failed degrees and barely had successful traditional careers aside from one I fell into for 7 years.

I want to remember sweet things, now medicated and getting the therapy I need some things are easier...like if I had all this as a teen I'd probably match their expectations.

It just hurts to hear ""But they have it worse and do more, if you cared you would remember or try harder"". I'm giving it my all and drowning just trying to keep up with what is normal for everyone else.

"Hi I’m 22 I’m an immigrant and a lonely child. I came to canada at 8 years old, grew up with my mother and my dad came 5 years after. I saw how hysterical my mom was. Being the only parent to take care of a child can be hard. My father was supposed to make everything easier. It did in a way and make it harder in another way. Basically, they were fighting with each other. Growing up with a violent family was hard. The thing is I new it will be hard but i didn’t know I will breakdown sooner then expected. At 17 I snapped and became depressed due to the father being really violent at me for a little comment I made about not caring on a object he wanted me to care about. I run away for 3 days, came back and they never cared about how I felt. I moved at 20 and cut contact but they found me and we talk to each other time time but now I am the one being very agressive. I was the calm guy all my life, quiet talking to no one. I stopped going to school because I was having suicidal thought. And I don’t even care anymore. I could be on the street right now and I would be careless. I’m just writing this in hope In 2 years i will feel better and look back to this text I made.

"I think my dad has tried to poison my younger sister and I. He bought two packs of gum (different flavors), and gave us each one, but what was weird was that he insisted we mix them to each get some of each. I got a weird feeling and wondered if he did something to one of the packs, although I knew I was most likely being paranoid. I decided not to have any anyway. My sister chews a lot of gum; she had 3-4 pieces by the end of the day. The next day she gets violently sick in a parking lot and about six more times in plastic bags on the way home. I didn’t make the connection at first because I was thinking about something and not able to focus on anything else. The weird thing was after that she was completely fine. She didn’t have any more symptoms after throwing up a few times. He kept trying to blame it on the breakfast she ate (French toast) even though we all ate the same batch and she was the only one that got sick. 

I went for some gum today, and I noticed the wrappers smelled weird, somewhat like a perfume, but more like floor polish. Only one flavor, though (remember they're mixed, half watermelon half wintergreen. The wintergreen ones smelled.) I couldn't put one in my mouth because I was convinced at that point he had tampered with them somehow. I'm having a hard time convincing myself these things aren't connected.

I never see anyone mention him, and wonder if people actually know of him, or if he's one of those guys that never really took off. I see the first couple of books of the 6-book series in 2nd hand bookstores all the time, but rarely do I see the others.

*A magical kingdom is threatened with ruin unless a long lost prince sold into slavery years before - can return to claim his throne. Four soldiers embark on an epic journey to find the prince and save the realm. They are joined by Teal, a young bondservant who has a hidden destiny.*

There's magic rings with powers, a unifying destiny, and the very definition of sword-and-sorcery magic. I feel he's very underrated and underappreciated, and would like to share some love. 

I love the fact it's like Lord of the Rings if you remove a good 70% of the descriptions and throw in some Zorro-like shenanigans. It's 1st person, but it's one of the few I can stand, so he does it right.

He's also written the Living Towers Trilogy, which is darker but not as good, I never seem to be able to finish it, it's 3rd person and a lot more jarring. But Circle of Light is gold!",0,negative_samples
"No friends, no job, no hobbies besides gaming occasionally. Days have just blended together and I only go outside for groceries. Last job I had was last year for 3 months, got fired without an explanation. That was the longest job I had since graduating high school in 2013. Back then I found it hard to get jobs because of my social anxiety, now that I'm older my anxiety has lessened a lot and I've learned ways to manage it, but now my depression just makes me not want to do anything. Even though I was never given a reason why I was fired, I'm pretty sure it was my attendance. I called out a lot and came in late, because I hated that job.

"This post might get taken down, but I don't care. This has to be said and I didn't hear crap about it from anyone.

Last few years or so I was in a pretty low place for a while. I've always slept bad for as long as I could remember, but I also became quick to anger and get irritated. I had a cynical look on life and had a depressive mood at least once a day. I always just thought that it was because I slept bad, maybe cause of stress, perhaps I just think too negative.

I was thinking of stopping meds, but only because I didn't like that I was dependent on them to function well. Then I had an interview and drank some coffee. I just felt sedated doing the interview, couldn't form any good sentences, had major brainfog. I started thinking that I'd literally be better of without meds and I had to stop because this simply isn't me. I could probably focus better without them.

I happend to have a lighter dose of meds in my closet (ironically because I've been procrastinating on returning them to the pharmacist) and took them to see if the dose was too high, and wow. Now the meds actually do benefit me. I've never felt so sharp before, my depressive moods are gone, I barely feel irritated anymore, and i'm just happy all the time - the way I remember myself.

I've had some feelings of greef, thinking about all the things that couldve been different if I noticed this before. My dose is too high for 1.5 years!! Imagine all the things I didn't do or miss out on because I was too tired or depressed. It might've even contributed to a recent breakup.

If you experience things like:

-Insomnia

-Feeling Passive

-More irritated than usual

-Depressive moods

-Feelings of sedation

-Changes in character

Then check in with your doctor and try a lighter dose or other types of meds. Just because your heart doesn't go bonkers on a certain dose doesn't mean it's the right dose.

TL;DR: Watch out for a dose of meds that might be too high. It's not as obvious as you would think and the symptoms of a dose that's too high aren't obvious and are almost never talked about.",3,adhd
Idk if this is because of the adhd or just something else I deal with but it's like being overly sympathetic adds to my anxiety (I work in healthcare) and it puts me in people pleaser mode also. But to protect myself I just become irritable and stop caring about others and I don't want to be that person. I enjoy being positive and helping others and idk how to find middle ground on being sympathetic but also getting myself to set emotional boundaries so I don't exhaust myself.,3,adhd

"I'm halfway through 12 rounds of chemo. I have an oncologist at the clinic I go to where I live and I see another as a 2nd opinion via telehealth.

I had an MRI about a month ago and met with my oncologist in town a week later. I had PET, MRI, and CT scans from 5 months ago to compare too. They reported that the tumor on my liver was shrinking, and gave measurements to show by how much. We never saw the scans or were told anything else just that its shrinking and it means chemo is working and to continue.

Now today, 3 werks later, we had a telehealth visit with our 2nd opinion oncologist. They pulled up the scans that were sent over. They tell us, and we can visibly see between scans, that the tumor had grown.

How could this possibly be? My wife and I can literally see the difference between the scans and they LOOK bigger. How is it my oncologist and radiologist in town that read the scans determined my tumors were shrinking WITH MEASUREMENTS. 

My Dr here said chemo is working and should continue, now our telehealth Dr says it's not and I need a new regime. Our telehealth visit he compared my recent MRI with a past CT scan and PET scan but for some reason didn't have a past MRI scan to pull up. Our telehealth Dr is very personable and shows us all my scans and goes over them with us. My Dr here is not personable and just walks in and tells us the results and that's it.",0,negative_samples

"Hey reddit.  
  
I've never made a post on reddit before, but I've read alot of post lately because I'm going through some sh\*t and it makes me happy to see a community support eachother, so I thought I maybe give it a shot.  
  
I'm M 24 and I live at a university dorm. Some weeks ago we had a easter party with my dorm kitchen and our neighbour kitchen. When I arrived at the party I saw a girl I havn't seen before and she just moved in a few days ago. I remember looking at her and the thought of her was amazing, but that would never happen. Fast forward a couple of hours and we're making out in the kitchen and after the party we hooked up.  
  
After the party everything just felt right. She's so nice and pretty and I definitely liked her. We found a day where I could help her find some stuff for her dorm room and after that we just sat and chatted in her room for hours. I found out that she was really drunk at the easter party, I was also a little drunk, but I didn't remember her being that drunk. So I started questioning myself if she actually liked me at the party or if she was just drunk. But after that day I just liked her even more cause we have so much in common and I really enjoy being around her.  
  
Fast forward to last saturday (may 6th). We had another party, this time with alot of other kitchens. I hoped that at this party I could figure out what me and this girl had, if it was something or if it was something I just made up. I wanted to be around her all the time, but I didn't want to feel clingy, so I gave her some space and enjoyed the party. After some hours i noticed that she has been talking alot with this guy from my dorm kitchen and I was starting to get at bit jealous. At some point they were in his room, with the door open so I guess they didn't do anything, but my thoughts were all over the place, I decided I had to talk with her about us. So I did that and yeahhh.... She didn't like me back, but would still like to be friends and I told her I was okay with that, I'm not btw, but it was better than it being awkward between us.  
  
Fast forward to now. I've thought alot about everything. I've never had succes with finding someone i really liked like me back, so it's not like this is new to me, but it's just like eveything felt so right this time and I really had my hopes up, but after alot of unsuccessful atempts at finding someone who likes me back I'm starting to lose hope. I get attached to people so quick and I hate myself for it. If I just didn't get attached to her so quick, then this wouldn't be so difficult. I mean, I've known her for maybe a month and that I feel so much for her already irritates me. I'm realy starting to lose hope and hating myself alot for making things so difficult. I'm seeing her again this monday, just to hangout. A part of me wants to keep being around her and try to become friends instead and another part wants to forget about her and just move on even though it would be hard cause we live like 3 dorm rooms between eachother.  
  
I don't actually know what I want to get from posting about this. Maybe it's a cry for help, maybe I want some guidance or maybe I just want to know that I'm not alone in this and that everything is going to be alright. I've just not talked to anyone about this, I've actually not talked to anyone in person for the last 6 days. I just keep to myself cause I'm scared to have a breakdown infront of someone and show them what a mess I am. I feel so hopeless all the time and so alone. I have nothing to look forward to. Every day is just a day I have to get through and I just don't feel like I have anything to enjoy anymore. I sleep most of the day because I enjoy the few seconds when I wake up before I realise what a mess my life is. I'm not thinking about ending it all, I could never do that to my family, but it's starting to worry me that it's actually just my family that's stopping me from doing it. I just feel so depressed all the time and I don't have any motivation to do something with my life.  
  
I'm sorry for grammar mistakes, english is not my first language, but I hope it's readable. Thanks if you've made it this far and if you feel like you could have written some of this then I'm sorry and I want to believe that everything is going to be alright for us.

"Some time ago I’ve been forced to change my psychiatrist and she works in some kind of clinic and the appointment system is just terrible. In order to make an appointment you need to pay them in advance for the meeting and there is a deadline so you can’t pay too late because your visit will get terminated. What is more is that they send you a message with a link to the pay site, you can’t access it otherwise. Next time you know you get another message because it’s the last day for the payment and you get one last message that your appointment has been terminated. One good thing is that you can call them after you’ve missed the deadline and ask if you can still pay for it, but calling a stranger is not particularly easy when you’ve got anxiety. It’s the least ADHD friendly system I’ve seen.",3,adhd
"It's been about eight months since I had chemotherapy and radiation. Despite no evidence of disease at this point (although I'm awaiting results of a recent biopsy and have some concerning symptoms), I'm struggling to overcome the overwhelming urge to remain socially isolated. Has anyone else experienced this after treatment? How did you cope?

Before my diagnosis, I experienced many years of unexplained chronic illness. My symptoms became so severe that I lost my consulting business and spent most days in bed. I couldn't walk through my yard. A few times, my husband had to carry me back into the house because I just collapsed onto the lawn. I didn't have health insurance, but in prior years, every doctor I saw was pretty useless. I gave up hope.

Getting a diagnosis was a bit of a relief, but my cancer was stage IIIC at that point. Treatment hit me extremely hard. I was in a wheelchair for months, often couldn't lift my head, and sometimes could not speak. Nausea was horrible and unresponsive to medications. My worst memory is spending hours on the floor violently dry heaving then lying awake all night afraid to move my eyeballs because the nausea would get worse. One week, a surgery damaged my throat, and I had to use an app to speak to my husband. 

I thought getting rid of the tumor would signal the beginning of a new life, but I've been in a decent amount of pain since then. I can walk again, but my legs hurt, and the fatigue is crippling. I feel almost the same way I did before the diagnosis. Not quite as bad, but still disabling. I have never felt so broken, mentally and physically.

Anyway, the mere thought of interacting with people is painful. I've struggled to respond consistently to texts from the few acquaintances who reached out. I have one long-distance friend, no local friends or family. 

I have always been an introvert, and I enjoy solitude, but I also experience loneliness. The loneliness along with lasting effects of treatment (and the looming possibility of recurrence) is making it difficult to remain hopeful much less rebuild my life much less socialize. Trying to connect with people feels like a pipe dream. 

On the one hand, I want to escape social isolation or at least respond to people in a timely manner. On the other, the thought of participating in even fleeting social interactions feels like putting my nerves into a meat grinder. I'm not just exhausted--I have some sort of block, almost like a trauma response, to possibilities of social interaction. Any thoughts?

Side note: I have no health insurance, a negative bank account balance, and no income. I received care for cancer through a charity and they cannot help me even with issues related to the cancer (like tinnitus from the Cisplatin or severe hot flashes from the radiation). I cannot afford to see a therapist. I'm just looking for insights from fellow patients or caregivers who have experienced/witnessed the same thing.",0,negative_samples

"I always seem to have these intense thoughts of people dying. 

When I was 10, I was SURE I wouldn't make it till age 11.
When my brother was 6, I was certain he would die before 7 because that just didn't sound right on him (and I feel HORRIBLE for even thinking that, I know it's awful).
We're both still here.

In November, I was driving with my family somewhere and I could not shake the feeling someone was going to die the whole trip (3 days) - I was sure it was going to be one of us but then I thought it would be my best friend's mom. I don't know why I even thought that about her specifically, maybe because she had been a little ill in hospital but not enough to die - she was literally due to get back home that weekend. My friend told me on the third day that her mum had died... on the same day I first got that feeling. 

And now, I'm moving away for college with my dad, leaving my mum and brother behind and I'm SCARED that something's going to happen to him and I wont see little brother again. Probably because I'm generally an awful sister who doesn't interact with him ever, and I feel like by the time I miss him and realise how much I need him, he's going to be gone and I'll have to live my whole life with regret. 

There's also another thing, I'm constantly scared that there's secretly someone, an evil spirit, murderer, whatever you wanna call it, in our house or hiding in my room. Did I used to watch a lot of horror movies at night? Yes, but even then I've never been scared for longer than just one night, if that. 

Even now, I had to curl under my duvet because I'm sure if I carried on typing this out of it, the thing or whatever would get me (it's night). Last night, as I was sleeping at about 5am, it seemed like something was shaking my bed - we don't get earthquakes and there's no feasible way for anyone to actually do that to my bed because it's massive, so I spent that time scared there was something with me. It's happened one or two times before too. I'm constantly expecting to see something in the mirror at night or just anything anywhere, and there are times I've fully convinced myself that there's something behind me in the mirror and that I saw it,
and I really don't like staying in my house alone if I could have a choice.

"**Not sure if this is something that belongs here, but please do not go apeshit on me for it.**

**I do not have autism.**

**Everytime I look back on these moments, I feel strong flashes of annoyance and anger.**

This is a fighting game. I will not list the name of said fighting game.

One person was using a censored version of ""autistic"" in a derogatory fashion. I told them that was ableist. They then proceeded to contradict me in a way by comparing them using ""autistic"" to black people being used the n word. I proceeded to ask them a question in order to argue back. They said that I didn't answer their question first, therefore I was in no place to ask questions of my own.

I argued with them for a while. They mocked me by saying that I have a psyche degree, that I was a keyboard warrior, and stuff. Then their friend came up to me and said that they were going to ""give me some advice."" They then proceeded to attack me (this was a fighting game) and told me to ""shut the fuck up.""

Wow.

I fought back a little, but I didn't really want to waste all my energy on fighting against mulish, ignorant people. The original person I was arguing with stood there, watched, and proceeded to say ""You should use that psyche degree to fight better. It's not even that hard of a 1v1.""

I replied by saying that having a psyche degree and being good at a fighting game are two different things. Which is undeniably true.

I wasn't trying too hard to win against the person throwing me around, and I told them that.

""HAHAHAHA. THE 'I WASN'T TRYING' CARD. HAHAHAHAHA.""

**Really now?**

The person that was throwing me around told me that they didn't really care about the argument, they were just throwing me around and mocking me to ""get a reaction out of me.""

**Why waste your time and energy on something like that if you didn't care about it in the first place? Why do all that just to ""get a reaction out of me?"" Because you're bored and wanted to back up your ableist, passive aggressive friend?**

I told the original person I was arguing with I wasn't even acting aggressive towards them.

""Oh, but I wasn't even acting aggressive either...""

&#x200B;

**Oh honey. There's something called ""passive aggressive,"" you know.**

**Don't you agree with me that this is just passive aggressiveness at it's peak????**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This is the aftermath.

At school, I started asking multiple people, including fellow classmates and teenagers, if using ""autistic"" in a derogatory manner counted as a slur. This was my own personal survey.

All of the students said no, but all of the teachers said yes.

**Conclusion: Majority of the people that use slurs like these are ignorant adolescents, or just ignorant people in general. Not really surprised.**

Some weeks later, two boys (I'll call them Adrian and Jack) were goofing around. They were punching each other's laptops for shits and giggles. Jack's laptop was more fragile, so it was completely busted after Adrian punched it (the screen was all glitched and funky and everything).

Jack was pissed.

""DO YOU HAVE MENTAL DISORDERS OR SOMETHING? DO YOU HAVE AUTISM OR SOME SHIT?""

**Let me ask you a question. Do you need to touch some grass and get some brain cells for once?**

The teacher witnessed all this and told them to calm down.

I told the teacher (lets call him Mr. Roberts) that Jack shouldn't have used ""autistic"" and ""mental disorders"" in that kind of fashion.

The teacher agreed with me wholeheartedly.

Thanks, Mr. Roberts! At the very least, some people like you exist in this world.",1,autism

"I (24F) called my mom (50F) today since it's mother's day, and at one point the conversation turned to talking about whether or not I was still taking ""the medicine"" as my parents call it. They don't outright acknowledge that it's adhd medication for my adhd, which I've been taking less than a year.


I told them no, since I'm on break from school, and they asked how i felt without it. I told them that I felt like my brain was always fuzzy feeling without it. My dad said that ""that's just because yiur brain got used to taking it and it likes it"". My mom then said ""I think you should get evaluated by a specialist, maybe they misdiagnosed you.""


For reference, i went through my university's accessibility center and talked to a specialist there and also a doctor at the student health center, and did all the interviews, questionnaires and such for the dx process. It's not like i just went to google and did a five minute ""do i have adhd quiz"".


Everytime my parents bring up adhd, they never mention it by name, as if acknowledging makes it something demonic or something. It's always ""are you still taking ""the medicine"".""


You would think that my parents would be happy that I've been doing better in school since starting meds and therapy, and that several of the issues I have had in the past 10 years or so have been able to be managed as a result of managing previously undiagnosed adhd.


Instead I'm being told that it's not real and that it's all in my head abd that I'm doing this for attention.


I'm not very open about my adhd, but a few of my friends here at uni have said that they noticed a positive change between me now and me last year, and i feel so much better than then.
I'm at the happiest I've been in a long time, and a big part of that has been learning how to manage adhd. I don't want to go through the emotions of the past several years again. 


It just hurts so much that the two people whonare supposed to care about me the most are being so dismissive of something that had unknowingly been causing so many problems for so long, and now that I'm learning to take care of myself, it's like they don't care.


I know I'm an adult, and that others opinion's shouldn't matter, but it really hurts when it comes from your own parents. I try so hard to do well in school and at work, but it feels like nothing is good enough for them.

Hello. I'm not sure if this is the correct place to put this, but I (24f) need some advice for a situation with my brother. TLDR at the bottom. 

For the past 10 years, he has had a very rocky relationship with my parents and members of my family due to differences in beliefs and values, mainly on smoking weed. This resulted in him moving out about 4 years ago. However, he began talking and repairing the relationship with them, and over the past year, it has slowly gotten better. This is the case, until last month when he started making 2 accusations about our family. The first is accusing relatives as well as our dad of putting spyware on his phone and computer about 8 years ago and tracking his every move, and the second is that he was caught at a family function smoking weed and family members laughed and mocked him for it. Both of these events never happened, nor anything similar to it. This has also been confirmed with many family members as well. However, my brother refuses to believe it, and believes that we are all lying to him. He will also continue to call/text my parents, myself and other members of my extended family questioning us, and trying to get us to admit to both of the events. We continually try and call him and check up on him, and visit him in person, however he only wants to talk about the accusations and refuses to discuss anything else. He also continually comes up with more and more ""memories"" about the situations each conversation we have, and is becoming more aggressive each time.

After some researching and talking to some mental health professionals, we believe that my brother is experiencing a psychosis and is dealing with paranoia. We have a ""diagnostic"" virtual family therapy session this Friday which we got my brother to join (Basically, the therapist can learn more about the situation and assess my brother and then refer him to further psychological therapy, and us to family therapy if that makes sense). However he texted me this evening stating that he was expecting us to admit to him what the family did before or during the session or else he will never speak to anyone in our family again.

I honestly do not know how to talk to him anymore, since he believes that we are trying to harm him. Through my research online, I have read that we shouldn't argue about the paranoias the person is facing because it will agitate them even more, nor should we agree to their delusions. because of this, I'm at a loss on how to communicate with him, and am very worried that the therapy session won't meet his needs and then he will stop communicating with the family and we won't be able to get him help and resolve the root issue. If anyone who has been in this situation or knows someone in this situation, or is a mental health professional, can please give me advice on what to do in this situation and how to communicate with my brother, and also how to approach this therapy session, or even how to calm my anxiety before the session it will be very appreciated.

TLDR: Brother is most likely experiencing psychosis and is accusing members of the family of harming him years ago. We have a family therapy session this Friday and he says that he will cut us off completely unless we admit to the accusations at the therapy session.",5,paranoia

We are looking for a beach holiday ,so we want warm water, and not as much tourism all though we would see the Mayan temples in Mexico.

"I understand this is a small community. But I feel the need to type this out. Recently. About a few hours ago, I had a nervous fear craving to draw and write in my journal. 

""Oct 19th. I had the dream that has kept me up at night for several nights in a row. I barely get sleep. As I write this, the front door light is on and I'm scared of looking through the window. Their antlers pierced the moon. They know I'm aware. They stalk. They tap against the glass, they test the wood of the home. I don't know if the deer are after me.

I cannot fathom dreaming of them again.
Revalations 1;18: I am the living one, I was dead, and now look, I am Alive for ever and ever!  I hold the keys to death and hades""

Those are the first two pages.
The third
""The web is a trap. A site is a desecration. Being lost is a mutilation""


The fourth page.  Before this. I open my gallery, select a random image and it's a picture of my saturn light. In all of it's aesthetic glory. Then I realize. 
""Aug 14th, that was the closest saturn was to earth this year""
The next page
I picked a random photo again. This time of a tree in fog I took nearly a year ago. I sketch it out. It looks like a branched antler. I panic.
Next page
""July 29, 21.""
This time, I recall pulling up a video I had took on that same date, tonight I realize it's all coming together. Are the deer protecting me?

The next page 
""The windows are to stay locked. Shut. Locked. All lights on. Keep a gun close. Shut all doors. Lock them. Pray often.""
The next page. A drawing that came from one line. A sunset over hills through a window, next to a door. The perspective is as if I'm standing down a hall. The door is to my right,  it would possibly open outwards. The window is facing the hills. The door is facing against the wall adjacent the window. 
I scrawled ""fall into the sky"" next to it. Followed by a crude scribble armature. I can't pick out any details other than it looking humanoid.  
Next page. An eye I drew. Trying to avoid the thoughts
The page after that. A disturbing scrawl. It's ss if someone had no face, with a beak or some pyramid replacing all details. The neck is inhuman. Stretched. 
The next two pages are just recreations of the last two, in reverse.
I ended the journal journey with a mind boggling reminder 

""You found me!"" Then a little stick man with a thumbs up.

I can't tell if I'm losing my mind. If I'm letting my thoughts envelope my dreams, or maybe I'm taking the form of a blessing into the form of a threat? I've looked up the meaning of it.

Glowing white deer. One spoke to me. I can't remember what it said. I think it said ""come child, it will all be okay"" I heard a shuffle to my right. Eyes, shot open. I can't look away from my phone as I type. Fear in my heart. I can't help it. I just need to be heard. To not be forgotten. My story seems made up, but this truly did happen. I don't know if I'm losing my mind but I'm scared. The fear is engrossing. Wrapping around my heart like a venomous serpent.

I'm sorry to those who have read this -- I don't mean to increase your own fears. Worries and desperations. The world will think we're crazy. Maybe we are. Or maybe we're right. That's what it's all about. Paranoia is a gut feeling, a primal need to be scared, at a more advanced level. A conception made by man to make it seem wrong to not be worried about the unknown. What you don't know, you can't fight back.

"Like whenever friends would flake on me all the time, ghost me, not invite me to friend group hangouts, I would always be devastated. This keeps happening to me all the time, and due to being bullied and made fun of for being ""weird"" growing up, it hit really hard.


I recently found out one friend group I'm in, where I thought everyone was hella tight knit and close to eachother... was actually very casual and not close at all. And I realized that a lot of people I thought I was close friends with viewed me as acquaintances. When I go into friendships I look for people I can have really deep connections with, and it has never dawned on me that other people just want someone to have fun with. 

This is so weird to me, but that doesn't mean that it's not normal. It's just different from what I want. They aren't villains, and I'm not an underdog, we just want different things. Still weird to me how people will talk about their deeply traumatic childhood to people they only wanna go bar hopping with, but then again, alcohol can make people spill these things out.


Anyhow, I mention all this in here bc apparently it's a thing with a lot of people on the spectrum; we want an almost soul bounding connection, not just with a romantic partner, but with our friends. And those not on the spectrum seem cool with spending a lot of their time with people they don't really care about all that much. Weird to me, but who am I to judge?

Honestly, knowing this is making my life a lot easier. Now I don't perseverate over why I wasn't invited to the pool party, if I'm a horrible person, or if they are evil and untrustworthy. I just move on.

"Hello all, thank you for happening upon my post this evening,

I just wanted to write a quick message, not feeling particularly great but need to finish some tasks today so can't spend too long with an elaborate post

I do experience irrational paranoia inside the house when i am severely in a confused state (which is intertwined with my condition), as when you get confused as i do (and maybe you do) its easy to work yourself up and essentially become frightened of anything as nothing quite makes sense

However whenever i am out, especially when alone and away from concentrated civilisation, i have shear fear that puts me in an unnecessary hyperaware state. I feel this fear because of my state of vulnerability with my conditions, which are quite debilitating.

Recently, i was in a place where there were civilisation around but not inside. I happened upon a man, not sure if he knew i was there but he was overweight, and had full-cuffed earphones on, he may even have been singing. If i had hostile intentions, lets just say nobody else was around. It stuck with me because i have no idea how one achieves that level of ignorance

My rational brain assumes its because as most of his experience outside has been positive, or perhaps he hasn't had anything happen once, what reason does he have? Ignorance is bliss. Neglect to mention though, as long as the mind was iron-willed, he could easily defend himself if aggressively approached in some way, or atleast not be defenseless

But i don't have that ability to be ignorant, and personally i think it'd be fine if i could rationally ensure there is no threat, and just be aware of my surroundings, but this fear is irrational. I can visually discern a threat but i don't feel at ease after verifying there is no threat. My medical conditions (Which are not all confirmed and some are still being investigated) puts me in a severely vulnerable state. I'm talking sensitivity to heat (basically heat= painful itching (sometimes) & worsening symptoms, e.g cognitive problems worsened), trouble balancing, slow processing and thinking, forgetfulness (So i'll have to often rescan my environment anyway as i forget it so often) fatigue and tiredness on the daily, etc. So this isn't a normal situation to begin with

This fear has probably come up because i know there are bad people in the world, but also i have pretty uncommon problems, even with speaking, listening and remembering, so i guess i also discern someone speaking to me as a threat because how i'm belittled and how i feel speaking to people that don't understand my health problems, which has been most.

I'm doing my best to shake this feeling, i'm trying to go out everyday and hope repeated exposure will do something, i have hopes it'll improve but was wondering what advice this community may have? I think i can understand the reasoning behind much of my behaviour, but unfortunately it is my health conditions cure-dependent, and there's not much i can do about that right now, so my ears are wide open for alternative ideas

This probably isn't a typical case around here, i appreciate that. But any advice you could think of to help out would be much appreciated, thank you!",5,paranoia

Nobody knows me. I have only two friends. One thinks I'm Iron Man and that I'm an unstoppable force domineering life. He's never met the raging, on/off drug addict, borderline abusive me. He doesn't know me. My other friend is better than me in every way. He's smarter, stronger, more talented, funnier, more charismatic and more respected than me and never lets me forget it. He treats me like shit. Mocking everything I say and do, never letting me finish a sentence, rubbing in my failures, making sure I know how much better he is than me. I never thought I'd say it about a friend this close but I fucking hate him.

I give and give and get nothing in return from any of my friends I've made over the years. They all just abandon me at their earliest convenience. The friends I actually do like don't like me and the ones I hate stick around forever.

Most of all, I want love. I didn't like the only girlfriend I've had, she was too quiet and even more reserved and awkward than I was. We were very cold and distant from each other. While the girls I did like were indifferent to me and sometimes seemed to hate me. One in particular that I worked with a year ago sticks out to me. She was my idea of perfect, she was so beautiful, sweet (even to me), intelligent and made me happy. I wanted to tell her how I felt, I wanted hold her and love her or at the very least ask her out and get to know her even better. But fear of rejection got the better of me and before I knew it, she moved three states away.

The only pleasure I get now is escaping into fantasy and imagining what life could have been like if I actually gave a shit. I know I'm young (20) but I'm so ill-equipped for this world that it would inevitably chew me up and spit me out. I already flunked out of college and got fired from my last job.

Hey, well this is something that I haven't told to my therapist and I don't know if, as I said in the title, it counts as abuse so I just want opinions, is okay if it isn't, in just genuinely curious if it has something to do with my depression or anything 

So, when I was really little I used to eat very slowly so I had to stay in the table for a long time, until I finished my food, and while I was staring at my food or eating or just seating there my dad (his desk was in front of the dining table) watched like erotic videos; it could be girls dancing sensually or, I think, even straight up porn. I think he touched himself sometime but I can't be sure bc my memory is really bad, and even if he did it wasn't like recurrent or anything. 

I remember one time I was fake sleeping at my grandma's house, I was face down with one of legs up ( I'm sorry I don't know how to explain ) so my ass was like flexxed ig idrk and he entered the room and said like 'damn'. I also remember one time I had a sexual dream with him and I felt really guilty after but not disgusted.

Also I've watched porn and known about sex since I was really small, fantasizing about having relationships and everything. When I was growing up (rn I'm 16) I've watched and listened my parents having sex without them knowing.

There is an AI edited version and the orginal everwhere version read 1 (or both I guess)
AI EDIT
Do you ever feel like you're stuck in a situation where you have to do things you don't enjoy? I often find myself likening it to being a little kid at the dinner table who has to finish their veggies before having dessert. You know that if you don't eat them quickly enough, you'll be left with no dessert at all. But here's the thing: staring at the veggies, playing with them, putting them in your mouth, or even waiting them out won't make them disappear magically.

Now, as an adult, I find that this analogy still holds true in my life. I always try to tackle the tasks I dislike first, thinking it's the responsible thing to do. However, more often than not, I end up getting stuck or suffering along the way. One minor example, It's like going to the store and buying a variety of drinks but having to drink the ones I dislike first, only to end up with a limited selection of the ones I actually enjoy because everyone else ends up drinking them. Super annoying.

More importantly, whether it's working on a project or just daily chores, I find myself laying out the steps in my head, and it always comes down to feeling like I have to do the thing I dislike the most first. It feels like being a child again, being told to stay at the table until I finish my vegetables. Childern being told to stay at the table is akin to being held at gun point, however,  since I'm not actually held at gunpoint as an adult, I often find myself procrastinating when faced with that one dreaded task. 

Can anyone relate to this struggle? How do you approach tackling tasks you don't enjoy? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences!


My OG Version
So I ofen think or explain I feel like when it comes to doing things I don't like that I need to do I feel like a lil kid at the table that has to eat their veggies first before having desert and if you don't eat it quicly enough you have to eat it with no desert. Staring at the veggies don't make them disappear, playing with the veggies don't make them disappear, putting veggies in your mouth don't make them disappear, waiting the veggies out don't make them disappear. 

As a child being told to stay at the table is equivalent to being held at gunpoint as an adult. Since I'm not held by gun point I get stuck procrastinating when there is that one thing I really dread doing. As an adult, I feel like I always try to do the things I don't like first and often get stuck or suffer. Buy a variety pack from the store... drink what I don't like first then forced to split all the good ones...annoying but not a big deal. Even worse...When I want to work on a project or have something fun to do ... I lay the steps out in my head and it comes down to I need to do the thing that I don't like the most first. Then I do nothing.  

I be feeling lost, its pervasive, I rarely get things done, and I waste so much time (especially when the dreaded thing takes no time or ends up being easy).

What do you all think? Advice?",3,adhd
"Hey everyone 👋 

I’m 34 and was recently diagnosed with stage 3 oesophageal/stomach cancer. 

I am half way through a course of chemo/radiation before heading towards a total oesophagectomy.

I am somewhat fortunate that my adenocarcinoma narrowed my gastroesophageal junction to the extent where I was unable to swallow. I was initially diagnosed with achalasia before biopsies said otherwise. 

I now have a nasogastric tube but because my oesophagus is so narrow I cannot swallow my own saliva so constantly spit/vomit saliva (making talking near impossible). 

I have 2 little kids and a really supportive wife and family. It’s an absolute nightmare at the moment but I am confident in my treating team and staying positive about beating this shit.

I would love to hear some other stories/experiences out there :)",0,negative_samples
"Hello all,

I am 34M and I'm looking for some suggestions from the community. I have been battling depression my whole life, but when my dad passed 7 years ago it ramped up to a whole new level. I've been having depressive episodes on and off some worse than others. I'm just coming out of a really bad one, worst one since 2020 tho, but I'm really sick of struggling each day just to get by. A lot of my energy goes to just functioning. I've tried wellbutrin before back in 2020 for 8 months and came off it because it wasn't working plus it made me very sort fused. I am in therapy and have been using medical cannabis to help. Which it does, the downside is I can't be high at work which is a good chunk of my day. I think I want to try medication again, I just don't know what to try and am worried about the side effects. I do have a Dr apt this Thursday morning with my PCP to see about getting an Rx for something.  Any advice, insights or suggestions are welcome.

Thank you.",2,depression

My mom who is suffering with delusional disorder has been getting increasingly more delusional over the weeks and I have not managed to convince her to go see a doctor. I’m not sure what exactly to do and I’m now officially scared. When we where our driving yesterday she claimed that a bomb had been placed in the trunk of her car by a BMW technician or something. As I’ve already stated in a previous post I personally believe that the situation is sadly hopeless and I will eventually end up homeless because I should’ve done things like learn how to drive and get a job even before I started going to college. Regardless here are some of the photos. Do you guys have any tips at all on how to get her to see someone I’m very worried and my anxiety is through the roof all the time sometimes I even feel like passing out.,6,schizophrenia
"Just got an email from my boss for a performance review meeting tomorrow when I start work to discuss my performance, role expectations and ongoing employment.
Problem is, I’ve already had my quarterly review. I’ve been late a lot and made mistakes, but I feel like I’ve been improving slowly. I think being late was really a big one. The train I would normally take was replaced by buses for a while and I just couldn’t adjust to the new schedule. I struggle so much with time management and fucking admin. It’s supposed to be easy but it’s not for me. I had the same issue last year with another admin job I had. 
I just wish someone could tell me what I’m supposed to do. What job can I even do and be successful at

Edit: So, I did get fired. I’m strangely at peace with it having had so much time to think about it. I didn’t really get a chance to mention my ADHD because they essentially started with the termination part. 
I know it was the logical decision to let me go. I wasn’t improving and I’ve been struggling emotionally lately. We parted on good terms and they offered a counselling service and an Uber home. 
I’ve no reason to hold a grudge, this was just another lesson for me. I’ve got a friend/former co-worker who works as an animal attendant and he’s mentioned his workplace is hiring so I might apply there.

But now it's getting bad, I'm doing it every single day and it hurts so much. The obsessive and repeating thoughts are literally getting to be too much, and the only way to stop the intrusive thoughts is to hurt myself there. My psych told me that if I need a hospital stay then we can certainly talk about it, because on top of the intrusive thoughts the voices are so overwhelming and keep telling me to cut. I want to finish my rTMS and hold off until I see him in two weeks to talk about a hospital stay, but I honestly dont know how much longer I can keep going on with hurting myself multiple times a day in an area that is so sensitive.

"I have a persistent belief that my neighbors are spying on me with hidden cameras in my living room and maybe other places in the house. Rationally I have tried to believe that they had some sort of device in their house that can make out images of the inside of my house. I read that this belief is extremely common with people that suffer from Schizophrenia. However, the other day something that I believe happened to me concerning my neighbors has left me as confused as ever. 

For many years when I masturbate, I do it as if I am a woman. This means that I act as if I am a woman. I do not cross-dress but I do act as if I am Demi Moore from Striptease, Elizabeth Berkeley from Showgirls. When I see an attractive woman on television like Faith Hill during her NBC NFL opening, I like to act as if I am a woman, that I have the body of a woman and that usually allows me to ejaculate. This started probably when I was a teenager when I was admiring my butt in the mirror. I even use to joke to the few friends that I had growing up that I was a lesbian trapped in a man’s body. 

The problem that I have with my neighbors is that when I do the things, they appear to have a way of arriving and leaving from their house in strange 10 minute, 20 minute, Hour rituals. So let us say I ejaculate at 5:13pm. Say someone is at home at his or her house. At 5:23pm, a neighbor 10 minutes later will arrive or a neighbor already inside the house will leave 10 minutes later! Overtime this same thing has occurred 20 minutes later, A full hour later, 5 minutes later (this also appears to happen a lot when someone is about to arrive at our house they will show up five minutes before they arrived). 

Strangely, when this happens lately I have noticed what appears to be police sirens going off in the same matter. Therefore, it has caused me not to masturbate even when I should. I believe that it is not all legit and that these same neighbors along with other people routinely seen in my neighborhood could very well be involved. 

I need to know if this is all real or imagined and why I’m feeling this way.",5,paranoia

"hey i have this problem for a while now i get up and every time i get out of bed i have no motivation to do anything that day. Let's say it's the day before and I say I'll do it etc and then the next day I don't do it anyway. 
I'll start by saying that a year ago my boyfriend proposed to me to do OF and at first it was going well and then at the beginning of the new year I made big progress upwards with OF. That year I really enjoyed taking pictures on instagram and OF and generally staying in and doing something to develop it. Now, in February, my grandfather suddenly passed away and it really upset me because I didn't expect it at all and I was left with just my uncle and my grandmother, who has had 2 strokes and is very forgetful, which makes me very sick of her because she is really annoying a lot of the time. After this death I started to have some strange depressing moments more and more often. My boyfriend was very supportive of me in these moments and even came to the funeral. Since the funeral I have been in a very bad mood at home, complaining about everything all the time, worrying that without my grandfather's pension we won't be able to make a living and arguing with my uncle much more often. He has often threatened to punch me in the face, to throw me out of the house even though I am still a student. I am still studying, but I am finishing school in June and I am going to move to my boyfriend's town (he is studying 300 kilometres away from my town). Since I've been in such a gloomy mood at home, I can see for myself that I'm constantly depressed and generally don't want to spend time at home, because it's really hard to cope with my family since the death. In March I was in a better mood after I had done a lot better in the OF and it gave me a real chance to go far in it and my boyfriend and I were very happy with these achievements. In April I did not do so well in the OF and then I started to fight more often with my boyfriend, among other things when he wanted to take me on a bike and I had forgotten how to ride because it had been a long time since I had ridden a bike. Out of stress I didn't even want to go on the bike anymore and I stayed in the room alone while he went rollerblading. Later he told me a lot that he was disappointed in me because, as he said, 'you don't forget to ride a bike'. He also told me that I was restricting him a lot with the bike. Then my mental state started to deteriorate. I had more thoughts about everything and was generally depressed. Now I still have the OF, but my boyfriend helps me less and I have no motivation, my family is still depressing, I feel unwell at home, I have no motivation to do anything useful, I have no one to whom I can talk about my problems, I hear from my boyfriend that if I go to the gym, etc., it will make me feel better, but I know that it will not.
I wish I had the enthusiasm to do things I enjoyed doing again like I used to and not spend all day crying in bed and wondering about the meaning of my existence. I feel like my boyfriend is cutting and rude to me. I would like to be motivated and get up and do something on social media on OF etc because I want to develop myself but I feel sucked out of any desire to do so. I don't know how to help myself anymore.",2,depression
"I remember being upset at the playground whenever someone left the swing swinging after they got off it. I needed it to sit still otherwise I was anxious.

If my mom ran over the cord when vacuuming, I would scream and cry. This was terrifying to me. I still feel like vacuuming is uncomfortable for me today and I hate when the cord is in danger of becoming caught or rolled over.

My older brother had a computer game that taught you about the human body - what a skeleton was, what hands were, what an eye was. When it showed an eye opening, it made this creaky opening sound effect that caused so much terror in me that I had to run to the other side of the house and close my ears. My brother would sometimes repeat it to mess with me. 

I guess I'm saying this because I don't really understand where these fears come from. Or what they might indicate about me. I often don't remember these small terrors I used to have and I'm sweaty typing about them. 

Today I live with an ever present feeling of wrongness in the pit of my stomach and hypervigilance of my surroundings. My eyes scan things quickly and I find myself becoming quickly fatigued when they dart around back and forth too quickly. I find that I'm very good at competitive games where awareness and reactivity are a strong suit. I'm excellent at my career and fast on a computer, but it is a double edged sword as my brain overheats (sometimes physically, it feels like) as it takes too much information in.

I was playing the new Zelda game, and while those games are generally enjoyable to me, walking through vast environments with numerous paths and options available to me at once is incredibly exhausting. I need to walk through every nook and cranny and find every collectible before I can move further, and my eyes are constantly scanning and looking for hidden things. It's incredibly fatiguing. On top of this, there's a voice telling me I need to be doing something else, but I can never figure out what that is. I can't just sit down and enjoy something. 

So yeah, I think I just needed to say some of this stuff. I don't really know why any of this is the way it is for me, but sometimes I forget the reasons *why* I'm anxious and it's all just a confusing abstract jumble. So I turned my thoughts into words this time.",4,anxiety
"I’ve been depressed for the past 11 years, and I’ve had many people (mostly schoolmates) point out that I looked angry/miserable. Yet, no one in my family has ever asked if I’m ok. If I attached a quick selfie of myself to this post to show my general facial expression, all of you would agree that it’s obvious. In fact, it’s so obvious that I’m actually incredibly self conscious about it. I cannot leave the house or be around other people without worrying incessantly about how I’m coming across to people. 

I suppose it’s maybe my fault for not bringing up my issues often, but then again it isn’t because I’ve talked about it a few times in the past without success. Most of what I say gets undermined. I already have a very difficult time asking for help (regardless for what), it takes A LOT of courage for me to make myself vulnerable to people in person. It’s part of the reason why I ventilate on Reddit so often. If the only place I feel comfortable doing so. 

I’m going through one of the most stressful moments in my entire 11 year history with depression right now. No one seems to give a damn. I’m literally on my own here. I get that people are busy with their own problems, so not many people would want to hear me ventilate. But the fact that everyone around me refuses to address the elephant in the room and pretend that everything is fine annoys me. I look miserable, but that’s fine I guess because “that’s just the way that I am”. I don’t ever even hear a “you good bro?” A lot of my depression comes from having a low self esteem. I already feel like I don’t mean shit to anyone. Not being asked if I’m ok, when I’m clearly not only validates that feeling. Why ask for help, when people clearly don’t care to make themselves available. Maybe I’m just overreacting or asking for too much. Idk.",2,depression

"Trigger warnings: True crime mention

For background, I've had anxiety since I was a child that manifested itself into a very bad anxiety disorder due to childhood trauma and chronic pain/health issues. 
Before, when I wasn't working on my anxiety and my issues, I was able to do a lot of stuff without worries. Watch scary movies, go on the big rollercoasters, drink more than one glass, listen to true crime, etc. But after finally going through and processing my trauma and opening up and working on my mental issues I have become way more sensitive. I have always been sensitive and emotional, I wear my heart on my sleeve, but now I am extra sensitive to everything bad/sad/scary. 
For example, if I watch a documentary on a serial killer I worry and fear that one day I am going to ""snap"" and become a killer and I obsess over the possibility of this happening to me. 
Because of this I don't make certain decisions that I feel like are affecting my life too much. Another example: I watched a video of a mom that went into postpartum psychosis and killed her baby, and now I am never gonna have kids out of fear. 

I do see a therapist and I have been taking medication for 12+ years, I just wanted to see if anyone feels the same way I feel and what tips and tricks they do to help.

My wife worries that it’s an ulcer and I’m going to lose a toe. I worry that too, but I’m not going to tell her that to freak her out. Just keeping it clean and wearing shoes around the house and when we go out. Trying to keep pressure off it until I can get it looked at.

"Hi all, I have a coworker that started wearing a perfume that really stinks (the best way I can describe it is that it smells like burnt plastic to me, like the inside of a factory that produces/uses plastic) but apparently I am the only one that perceive it this way, the other coworker I talked about it told me that she loves his perfume.

Luckily in the office I sit far away from his desk but somehow the perfume still finds a way to get to my nose.

Maybe it's like for cilantro that some people think it is delicious and others think it tastes like soap (I am team soap).

I wish I knew the fragrance component that triggers the ""stink factor"" for me. Maybe I should ask him the name of the perfume so that I know what to avoid 🤣",0,negative_samples
"Hi, everyone, last Thursday i went to a psychiatrist after a long period of struggle and he diagnosed me with depression. I got prescribed fluoxetine and i just started 3 days ago. 

My whole ordeal started with health anxiety and after a ton of tests I decided to see a psychiatrist who said that, if everything else is ruled out we have to consider depression.

I have to be onest, i am very afraid of the possibility of a misdiagnosis. I feel so weak and tired every day. I used to run almost every day and now i can bearly do it at all. I feel light headed 24/7. I feel like I'm wasting away day by day. Can depression really do that? I am afraid my doctors missed something...

"Okay so, I was diagnosed with ADHD in like 2012, but only recently diagnosed with Autism as well in 2021 so I've been doing some research. I found the term masking a lot for Autism, and while it felt similar it didn't feel completely right. Just now however, I read an article about ADHD masking, and identified with 95% of what was listed.

So, now I'm crying. I'm not entirely sure why, maybe. I mean, I'm pretty sure it because I identified with nearly the whole list of very much self destructive tendencies, but ya know. 

So yeah, apparently I'm ADHD masking, which I didn't know I was doing, and this stupid article is like yeah this'll lead to depression (check), anxiety (check), and substance abuse (no check, hopefully not ever). But also it said that it leads to a diminished sense of self like the person masking might do it so well that they can no longer find their true selfves from hurried under scripted responses and faked emotions. And now I'm like, fuck, I honestly don't fucking know who the fuck I am or what I actually feel lost fo the time, just what I'm supposed to and now I'm just scared and upset and my stupid eyes won't stop leaking so yeah.

It does make me avoid certain situations and situations I’d like to do. Is there any medication or things to do to help stop this?

"I'm wondering if anyone has had issues with schools wanting their own documents filled out rather than what the endocrinologist and pediatrician send over for T1D documentation. My son is finishing Kindergarten and I had issues with trying to be proactive before he started last year with a 504 and providing documents but was basically blown off by the principal and staff. They also lost the documents that I sent over for him during the summer because they changed head nurses and made me jump through hoops to get it to them not only the first week of school but throughout the year (they asked for proof of diagnosis after the first month of school and more documentation from the dr for why he has so many sick days).

Fast forward to the last week of school and they want his medication forms filled out again now, which I feel like they'll just lose during the summer, and his endocrinologist didn't listen when I asked for them to fill out the school provided form that I had provided. I'm really just looking for a polite and firm way to tell the school this is what you get, I'm an exhausted single mom taking care of a T1D, leave me alone.

TL:DR School wants me to fill out forms constantly that they provide, not what the Endo types up, constantly loses forms and needs to verify every little thing about his T1D.",0,negative_samples

"Hi, so, Im not going to go into detail, and I am going to talk to my doctor like, ASAP. But sometimes they dismiss these things so I want to know what you think. 

Again if I go into it it'll become a whole vent, I already wrote one out and deleted it. But I seem to have a lot of risk factors for schizophrenia. I already experience psychosis, paranoia and negative symptoms. But I don't think it's fully developed. 

But I show so many early signs of schizophrenia, I have extreme fear about unlikely things, I have a lot of the risk factors for it including high stress, and my dad had schizophrenia, and died from it. Unfortunately we are very similar. Since he died I've been going in the same direction he did, it's quite scary. 

I'm terrified of developing this, because I'm extremely scared, of fear. And I feel a lot of it. I wouldn't be able to handle it. I already have no grip on reality. I already can't tell between reality and imagination. 

I just want to know what I can do now to prevent this from developing. I'm already on antipsychotic medication and it keeps me alive but it doesn't stop all of it. I'm on a low dose but any higher and the side effects just about kill me. 

What can I do? I know I may need to make medication changes but please, other than that? I'm going to ask my doctor but do you know how I can prevent this?",6,schizophrenia

"Fitting that it’s mental health month cause mine is going down the drain… 

28 yo female. I have a lot going for me. I have a healthy relationship, a chill dog, I just finished my second semester of college (better late than never, right?) but I’m really really struggling. 

I’m fortunate in that I don’t go through every day feeling sad. I’ll have episodes of sadness but they’re short-lived. I don’t feel overwhelming happy but content, I guess. My main issue is just a lack of motivation particularly when it comes to work. I need to find a new job because every time I get a job, I don’t want to go into work. I think of those 8 hours and what else I could be doing like sitting on my ass watching tv or smoking weed so I’ll choose to do that stuff instead of working so I’m not making any money and I just don’t care. Someone on Reddit mentioned this could be a depression symptom. Anybody else experience this?

I love my partner but he does not understand mental health so while he feels bad for me, he does not offer productive advice and I just end up keeping everything to myself.

This month sucks. I had finals, I have to find a new job, I’m going on a 5 day trip where my social meter is going to be at capacity and I have to leave my dog.

"So as long as I can remember there's always been a hint of melancholy below the surface. A single blue flower in a field of sunflowers. Some days the blue would spread to the other petals, others they'd be the natural yellow, and it was a balance that, although challenging, I thought I'd learned to live with. Well, I'm 18 now and something must have evolved because the whole field has decayed.

Depression runs in my family quite strongly, I think I've got it. I thought it was just situational depression (it's not been an easy time) but even after escaping all of it, it's still there, screaming instead of whispering now. I can't picture a future, I can't see myself in this world as anything other than a mistake or a cosmic joke. I feel like I'm simply just not meant for this world. If dying wasn't painful, I think I might have done it by now. I tested those waters fairly recently and I'm too ashamed to tell people close to me about it.

Doctors and therapists tell me all the coping mechanisms but for some reason they never bloody stick, they just slide off my brain the second they land, or they work once or twice but never always. I'm at a really precarious point mentally. I think I'm getting out but I'm still researching the least painful ways to die. I know that logically I don't want to die and that I just want this feeling to end, but if this feeling is clinical and festering inside me forever then isn't it the same difference? Everyone tells me I'll learn to live with it, but I don't want a life where the slightest inconvenience causes some reaction that makes oceans roar in my chest. The past week has been spent crying on the floor, sobbing in the street, collapsing in front of my friends - it's so pathetic. Is life going to be a pendulum swinging between emptiness and drowning in uncontrollable sadness?

"I got a sample CGM to understand more how my sugars are affected by the food I eat. I eat carbs, but I do a pretty good job of eating complex carbs where I can. I brought my A1C from 13 to 6.3 in five months, lost almost 25 pounds, cut a massive amount of carbs and reworked my entire diet and lifestyle, and take the max amount of allowable Metformin. But I still spike from things I wouldn’t expect to spike from. And maybe it’s normal, as it comes down eventually (for bad spikes it can be 4-5 hours), but it does. 

This was supposed to help inform both my food and what treatment to take on next, if any. Given my A1C was so good, I didn’t expect these spikes to be such an occurrence - all after meal ones. Am I beating myself over nothing? What’s a normal spike vs. a dangerous one? I’m starting to think using this CGM was more of a curse than a helper - it was much easier when I just tested two hours after I ate instead of watching the spikes immediately after my meal (i do confirm highs with a stick and it matches).

I don’t even know what to tell my doctor - my diabetes diagnosis has gone back and forth given I have LADA that was caught very early on. They’ll be looking at all my numbers and notes but I don’t even know if it’s me, am I really still eating bad, is it my treatment, and do I need a type 2 drug or do I need insulin?

I don’t know if anyone has gone through similar experiences and has some insight, otherwise this may just end up being a rant.

"This is really one of the few only communities i feel comfortable posting this in; I've been suffering a lot, I've sacrificed my own mental health for these past few years to be a genuinely good person. I helped local homeless people by giving them a safe place to stay, do laundry, eat food, give them a contact for applying, etc and i've begun to realize the help ive done is negligible, none of them have I substantially changed their lives for the better, and in rare cases there are people that take advantage of my kindness and charity. I have taken in local feral kittens as a foster parent, but it hasnt reduced the overpopulation of cats, and the people who feed them. I have helped run a political organization, i networked and made other contacts, i wrote theory and did commissions so our org would get sponsers, only for it all to fall in on itself as other leadership fell into dogma and ideological division. I have made a nice community of friends online, but I have made even more enemies because of my convictions, untop of that as cool as internet friends are, by all intense and purposes, irl i am a hermit, i have no real friends near me, and it has made me feel emotionally isolated. My mental health doesnt get better whether im online or offline, and psychiatrists have betrayed my trust, choosing to target the voices i hear, even though they helped my mental health, rather than targeting my anxiety, anger issues, depression, insomnia, and nihilistic thoughts. Everything in my life has also just gotten worse, I'm extremely poor, and even worse now as my food stamps dropped. I have neurological conditions that are progressively getting worse, which has led me to applying for disability. My phone is going to shit, and i dont find happiness in the hobbies i used to find happiness in, and instead they cause me misery and stress. Also the enemies i have developed, were all once longstanding friends i used to have, who built trust up overtime, which id difficult with my bpd and other prior betrayals of trust, but many still betrayed me to stand with my former abusers, because they didnt like my backlash to him. They also have gaslighted me, minimized my issues as being online too much, even though im the only person in the community who has repeatedly left the internet for extended periods of time. Also many have started lying about me, and calling into question the validity of my neurodivergency, my past traumas, my grandfather being anishinaabe, my disabilities, and even my queer identity. And to top it all off, because of my constant excommunication from leftist communities, and my low economic standing, theyve been able to do more for others than i have, even though i put more of my energy into it, which its good, except because of that, theyve been holding that over my head as well. They have done a lot to stain my image, and have made this a constant topic, simply to use me as a lolcow.

"Alright i will start by giving you a little bit of background info, and as much info as i can so you can fully understand. I'll try to make it as short and to the point as i can. I am 33 yrs old now and from 22 to like 25 i was addicted to heroin, i got clean from heroin but then started doing a lot of coke and crack. I then got clean and straightened out my life. once i got clean i had terrible anxiety to the point where my face would turn red and my pupils would get huge and i would have this look of fear or paranoia on my face and i could tell cuz when other ppl looked at me it made them uncomfortable or have anxiety themselves. my heart would b racing and i would sometimes shake like my hands would shake. i then went to my doc and told him everything that was going on and from like 26 to now 33 i have tried damn near everything out there to try and help my anxiety. i got on suboxone to get off heroin and while on it my anxiety was gone but once i got off subs ive tried sertraline, trintellex, venlafaxine, buspirone, propranolol, atenolol, citalopram, xanax, clonazepam, mirtazapine, fluoxetine. The benzo's worked great for my anxiety but i don't wanna have to take that forever or a long time nor should anyone since there not a long term treatment. 

My anxiety has gotten better over the years, like my face doesn't turn red anymore, but i still feel like i am missing out on life. i also never had anxiety before my drug use. In highschool i played sports and was constantly go go go. I had no problems in social situations, everything was good. I now don't like to do anything except have sex, masturbate or do, extremely fun or adrenaline fueled things like driving dirt bikes, atv's, motorcycles and snowmobiles. I don't like to go anywhere out of fear or im scared i guess i dont really know y. I don't like talking with ppl because it's usually about dumb shit i don't care about, the only time i usually don't mind talking is when its about something im genuinely interested in. Im basically a hermit and it really bothers me cuz i never use to b like this and im missing out on life. 

In the past i have dated some very attractive women and the women in my life that i have dated have been a big part of what motivates me in various ways. Now that im not in a relationship or have a woman in my life i find it very difficult and to b motivated to do things for me. I currently take Buspirone, Trintellex, Seroquel for sleep and 25mg during the day to help with anxiety, and adderall which i don't always take cuz it can make my anxiety worse sometimes and i might have my dosage reduced or stop it all together. I don't notice any changes or improvement from taking the Buspirone and Trintellex 20mg and the seroquel 25mg during the day kinda helps. At a random time in the day usually at evening, my brain or body like releases a chemical that makes me feel really anxious, like my pupils get big and its hard for me to look ppl in the eyes. Thats the best way i know how to explain it, i don't really know what's going on or why it does that. At work i usually start walking around or start doing something like cleaning up while my boss is talking to me, cuz i dont want to look him in the eyes or stand still and have a face to face conversation with him. I do Carpentry/Remodeling BTW. 

Im writing this because i don't know what to do anymore and wanted to see if other ppl have gone thru similar situations and what worked for them as far as anxiety or how i can get my life back. I want to want to do things even if there little things or enjoy the little things, i want to fall in love again and share memories and experiences with someone, i want to enjoy life and not just feel like im going thru the motions everyday, like go to work come home eat go to bed and repeat. My life use to b the complete opposite of what it is now and i know im the only one that can change that and there is 1 thing ive been struggling to do or get motivated to do is working out and going to the gym which i think will help a lot. When i look at my life from the past i was extremely active, played soccer so i ran alot, i also played other sports. I was just all together physically active. Working out cuz i wanted my body to look good for my partner and myself. When you look good you feel good or at least thats how i felt. And please do not judge me on my drug use im not proud of that section of my life and it is behind me, im ashamed of myself cuz thats not who i ever was i was raised better than that.

"I'm depressed and I've been so for a long time (in fact, it has been about 7 years...), I've been sooo god damn close to killing myself, multible times...

I'm guessing you are heading to the comments suggesting that I go see a therapist or talk to parents, friends and or other family members about it, but I wont. You see, therapi is a scam (I can't even afford to go, even if I wanted) and I don't believe that it would help me, it might help for some, but i doubt it would for me... The therapist prob would just give me some anti depression medicine and throw me out to the world again. Therapi useually just makes you get a view from other angles, it can't solve problems with the world which makes me depressed... You can't trust the therapist either, he/she doesn't actually care about you in an emotional way, the therapist just cares about you working in the societiy and not killing yourself, heck they even sometimes be sending you to psych wards, that sh\*t would just make me more depressed. Meanwhile, when it comes to friends/family, I feel as it none of them could relate to my problems and once my feelings are all in the open, it would just make it more awkward to be around them, they be scared do anything wrong. I don't want it to be that way, it's better if I just put on my fake act of being happy, all tho it's painful for me...

I wont go too much into my depressive issues, cuz there is way too much wrong, and I have accepted that there is no way be happy nowa days (other than anti depressive meds, but I don't wanna have fake happiness).

We have two dogs, and there is a gate in front of the entrance to the living room to keep them out. Just that one room, because there paws get muddy and their breath smells bad and their licking sounds gross. But my mom keeps leaving the gate open! Because she feels bad for the dogs. But she doesn't care how I feel or how I'm affected by it. She has more sympathy for them than she does for me. It sends me into sensory overload when I have to be close to them for extended periods of time, but she thinks I'm being dramatic. They bark so suddenly at absolutely nothing right in front of where I'm sitting and it hurts my ears, but it doesn't bother her, so I must be lying when I say it bothers me. I had very few friends and have a lot of difficulty making new ones. I can't keep a conversation going. I stim and fidget almost constantly. 

I have had to learn to mask my sensory overload and negative emotions because she always says I'm being dramatic or overreacting when I don't suppress them. I've been burnt out for almost a years since I graduated high school last year, and haven't recovered yet. It's been hard for me to learn the skills for a new job because of being burnt out and my mom just thinks I'm lazy. It's just like what happened at school. I'm trying my hardest, trying my best, but my best isn't good enough. She always says I'm capable of more as if it's supposed to be encouraging, but it just makes me feel guilty and misunderstood. She thinks it's a bad thing to be autistic, and I'm not saying it's all sunshine and rainbows, but it's not all clouds and rain either. I like who I am, I just wish the world, and my mom, would understand and accept us better. Does any one else have parents who refuse to acknowledge their autistic struggles? I feel alone right now.",1,autism
"everytime I go to school i'm filled with dread about how maybe they moved and they'll see me and tell everyone.

My last breakdown was so bad that i didn't go to school for weeks this was during my mom important medical therpy sessions and she couldn't go because she had to look after me. because of this i feel like my mother and father hate me and they may tell me they love but their lying just so they can kick me out when i'm 18. I've tried to ask them about it and they wont give me a straight answer my mother told me she wasn't happy, that of course i could never hate you, but then also said how else do you expect me to feel? so i feel like she must hate me.",5,paranoia

"Hey all, idk if I'm paranoid because when I'm in the middle of my thoughts I'm telling myself I'm being paranoid. Idk if being able to call myself out for being irrational or *sounding* irrational negates anything about it, but I thought I'd share anyways

Let me start this out by saying I have a history of religion related issues. Most recently, I think I'm a mistake from God or that God wants me back in some way; I nearly died all throughout my infancy and my birth(c-section) was very traumatic and near fatal for both my mom and I. I met someone today who, within the first hour of talking to them, told me that demi-gods live among us and the church is trying to hide that. They told me God loves me and that the stones I wear as a necklace are masculinizing my face through magic.
I fully do not believe God loves me. I think God wants me to fuckin kill myself since he couldn't take me out as a child.
Anyways I can't really get what they said out of my head.

Also, today my manager told me he full on had people watching him with cameras and shit. Took pictures of these people and everything. They had recording devices and told me how they pretending to park in a neighbor's driveway to watch him through binoculars. He said they were trying to watch him to look for evidence of insurance fraud since he had gotten severely injured that required surgery and they were looking for evidence that he was lying.
That also freaked me out because I often feel like I'm being followed or watched in public. I start noticing things, little slip ups. Seemingly completely different parties whispering to each other as they swiftly walk by, then clearing their throats around me like some sort of code. People staring at me in public, slowing down in their cars as they pass me on the sidewalk, and other little things I don't remember off the top of my head now.

"Coming to America turns 35 this year. This is considered one of the best Eddie Murphy films. I think it has aged well with time which is surprising because rom-coms have a mixed track record.

The film has a slow, sweet pace where character interactions lead the story. It has the usual romantic comedy cliches till the last moment. But the execution was good. I think the casting was brilliant and the film does have abundant comedic scenes. Loved the dudes at the barbershop having a good time.

The casting was really well done with John Amos as Cleo McDowell & James Earl Jones as the King being standouts.

It was interesting to see the lack of music in many places. Sometimes the movie felt awkward due to the lack of score and slightly weak editing. But overall the direction gets it home.

My rating: 7/10.

"Today, a girl seated in front of me in class keep shooting glances at me every so often. It made me very anxious and scared but I tried my best to ignore it. Until the teacher came down and asked the girl next to her if she was being too chatty, she replied “No, I’m depressed”, then quickly corrected herself to “I don’t talk much” and glanced at me again. She was talking about me. It took everything for me to not start crying right then and there.

"At least I hope it's just a feeling, every time I look somewhere my brain has decided is hiding a camera I find nothing, yet in my head it's still there. Cameras hidden in the vents, in the little corners I can't easily see, microphones hidden in my walls and spyware on my computers. Whenever I go outside people stare at me and security cameras keep track of everything I do. I keep a journal but whenever I write in it I can't help but think that someone has seen everything and knows what I'm thinking. It's encrypted and on an old laptop that almost never connects to the internet that I've searched for spyware countless times but somehow someone is reading it.

When I try and think things through and I hit the point where I ask myself ""why would anyone want to spy on me?"", the answer my brain jumps to is ""I don't know"" and I just get more scared and it all feels more real. I don't have anything of value, I'm not an interesting person, I'm not special, so why would someone be doing this to me? I'm never going to get an answer.

"Yesterday I had a constant high level of anxiety that was so crippling I thought I was losing control and lost my mind and losing my life. I also had poor stomach health, and felt so nauseous, weak and sick. 

I’m on meds for stomach (IBS) etc so I thought it was the meds that gave me anxiety and that it was just my stomach displeased with the foods I ate. I sleep it off and I’m ok, had a pleasant day. 

At night after decorating cakes my narcissist grandma hurls some passive aggressive insults that sent me spiraling. It hurt me so bad, and then I felt nauseous as hell and I kept feeling light headed, dizzy, faint conscious and like puking. I’m sure she knew what she was doing.

Then I recalled an art TikTok where the commenters were bashing a beginner artist with things like “are u 8 drawing like that” and I clicked on their profiles and I laughed thinking THEY WERE THE 8 Y/OS, with their appearance being literal children and felt so bad thinking they must be parroting awful things they’ve heard from people and when my grandma said this I was haha. So there’s where those children are coming from.

I’m usually able to withstand the bullshit she is pulling. But I really couldn’t today.

"Just like the title says, my anxiety and depression is affecting every aspect of my life. Let me start with a little backstory for context of where my anxiety and depression started, if there is indeed even a start point.

Growing up, we were poor. Not just poor, but very poor. Some weeks we couldn't even afford food, so I had to steal food from the Safeway down the road just to eat. Imagine being a 10 year old kid, stuffing all sorts of things down super baggy jeans you wore specifically for that purpose. Hot dogs, macaroni and cheese, basically anything that is ready to eat or easy to cook. When we had money for food, it was $1 12 packs of ramen noodles. 25 cent boxes of macaroni and cheese. 2 dollar boxes of instant mashed potatoes. That was my diet for the first 12 years of life.

Mother was always either married temporarily, or having promiscuous sexual encounters with many many different men weekly. Sometimes both, which is why I put temporarily married, because she's been married 4 times at this point. She's also always abused many kinds of illicit drugs and always been a drunk, I can't remember more than 3 occasions in my entire life where she was sober longer than a week or 2. We never had a car, I walked or rode a bike everywhere I went. 2 hour walk to my first job literally every day. She wouldn't have been able to drive anyway because she spent most waking moments drunk or high on meth (that was always the preferred drug but she would always take what she could get).

Biological father was never around. He was court ordered to pay a grand total of $7.31 a week in child support to help support me and my mother raising me as a single mother my whole life. That's about 30 bucks a month, which covered above stated crappy diet. Mom spent most of our money on the bills we could barely afford on waitress pay, a whopping $2.33/hr (she's only ever been wait staff literally my entire life, never had any other profession besides a short time working for Quiznos as assistant manager but that's a tale for another day).

I spent a lot of time as a kid emulating her behavior. I smoked weed, tried other drugs, and drank a lot. Dropped out of high school junior year to get a full time job to help pay bills. Even with my job, we were still barely making it because the more we had, the more she spent on drugs. It got bad enough at one point she was spending over half our money every month on drugs. Just enough for the crappy diet to continue and bills paid. It was horrible and there's a lot more to it, so if you'd like further information on my childhood, I can get to it in the comments but this post is already getting long as is so I'll leave my childhood where it's at.

Fast forward to the summer of 2008. I was 19 and I was trying to get away from my life slumming it on people's couches and smoking weed until I felt nothing, and drinking until I forgot everything. I needed a change. I had met a girl on Facebook and she sent me money to move. This is a long story as well, so let's suffice to say I thought I was in love with her so I moved to California to be with her (from Wyoming where most of what happened above took place). Long story short, things did not go as planned and we went our separate ways. Except that I didn't have anywhere to go because I was broke in the middle of California with no job and nowhere to live. I ended up joining a weird almost culty Christian sober living program and ended up in a household with 5 other people who used to be drunks and drug addicts. I was going nowhere with this as well, so I did the most sensible thing I could (that's what I thought at the time) and joined the Marines. 

My time in the military can be summarized in one statement of two facts: I was drunk and lonely. I spent most of my time working obviously, but every spare second I wasn't working I was drunk. I got admitted to a rehab program the Navy offered at the time and was booted out of the Marines literally a couple days before my End of Active Service date, because I failed the program. Someone brought in vodka in a water bottle and I was busted with them. I ended up losing the promotion I was about to receive to NCO, and because it was a general under honorable conditions separation, it's still considered an honorable discharge but I lost my benefits, mainly the one that could've helped me. My college benefits under the Post 9/11 GI Bill. 

So I went back to Wyoming and continued crashing on couches for a while until an old childhood friend, who also joined the military but different branch, offered to let me move up to live with him and get on my feet in a different state. Time for another change, this one ended differently though. I moved in with him, got a job, and actually started improving. Met my wonderful wife at that point and we've now been married for almost 10 years, so there's a silver lining. Problem is, I've been through lots of life threatening situations, I've been through lots of drugs and drinking. My brain at best feels like it's incomplete. I'm constantly worried about health problems but also worried about the money it would take to get looked at by a doctor. I'm also worried because I don't feel good enough for my wife and most aspects of our lives together have been affected. Sex life, mental health (we both have anxiety and depression, I also think I still have ADHD that I was diagnosed with as a kid and never ""grew out of"") and financial wellness. Again, I won't go into detail, as this post is long already and we have the comments to discuss. 

I guess this is just to vent, but I honestly don't know what to do because I'm constantly irritated by everything and always angry. Constantly depressed and worried about things. Also not good at communication. Get mad or irritated with the stupidest little things. I'm trying to be a better husband but also have almost zero motivation to even get up and move around let alone go do something for her as a gesture to show her how much I love her. Any advice for someone who is having a hard time understanding life at this point?",4,anxiety

"I had a friend that meant a lot to me. I loved and trusted him a lot, he was among the first people I told when I was diagnosed with ADHD over a year ago. He told me he would support me no matter what, and I believed him. We had a bad falling out 6 months ago and he ended our friendship. I've been grieving and trying to move on, and honestly I've been making progress.  

But a couple days ago I remembered some things he said to me, like ""You require so much reassurance"". He also said things to me like, ""Are you stupid?"",  ""You're trying to manipulate me."", and ""After all I've done for you. After all the accommodations I've made for you"".

I know depression can come in many forms, but there are few times in my life when I wasn't able to pull myself out of being unhappy. 

So what do I call this, just a general dissatisfaction with my life, or would it be categorized as minor depression. 

Just not sure.",2,depression
"Bare with me, this is going to be looong!

My background:  I grew up in a dysfunctional family. My parents always fought growing up. I think I saw them once or twice as a child being nice to each other. 99% of the time they were fighting and being loud. Idk why but that used to scare me, & I would go hide somewhere. I used to hate myself for wanting them to get a divorce. I never understood why they were together. Also, my mom is very manipulative. She used to feed me lies about everyone close to me, even my dad. She would tell me he doesn’t want me, and he wants other kids.

Anyways, I’ve been married for over a year now ( I had known him a year prior to that). Our honeymoon was a disaster. We fought all the time. It used to bother me that he would check out other women ( I told him I don’t care if you do it, as long as you don’t do it when I’m around). He said I’m disrespecting him and he does not checking out women 🙄).

It all started when he asked me why I’m still friends with some of my old exs, & he said he’s not in contact with his exs, and that he deleted all their contacts. I was like are you sure? And asked to check his phone. At the time I only knew of one ex. He tried to trick me by pretending he left his phone in the other room (gave himself time to change her name). When I confronted him, he still had her pictures on his phone, he said he freaked out and just didn’t know what to do. 
3 weeks later, I found out her younger sister called him. My husband is a Doc, and the ex is a PA. Apparently, the sis called to ask my husband about a “sick a relative”. And he asked the sis about how his ex is doing, and what she’s up to now. (He said i thought it was the nice thing to do). He claims he told the sis he’s married now. Eventually, I told him this has affected my trust, and asked him to consider couples therapy. I really hate being lied to. 

Shortly before we start therapy, I told him it’s important for me that you delete pictures of your ex-romantic partners. He was against this idea; “these are memories I want to keep, to look back at”. Through the therapist, he was somewhat convinced that it’s a good idea to delete pics of his exs. 

A month goes by, and I had a mini surgery. He was taking care of me over there weekend, since I was heavily medicated. I felt he was acting odd. Few days later I asked him what was going on, he tells me he felt resentment towards me because he had to lie to me🤔. It makes no sense!
Also, turns out, that Saturday! he created a “Trash” folder on his laptop, with all their pictures. But he never deleted it. I felt really sick. Because a week prior to that he said he deleted everything. Another lie. I felt the need to leave the house, and ended up staying in a hotel that night. I thought maybe I was being overly dramatic, so I went back home & realized he wasn’t home. (At that point he knew why I left). 

I came back the next day, and we talked it out. I asked him where he had been that night, he said I was home all night. 3 days goes by, I kept telling him I know you weren’t home. On the the third day I explained to him that I came back so I know he’s lying. He suddenly remembered he had to go back to the hospital.( it’s something he has never done before, nor after).

He told me many times that he has no feelings for her. He told me he actually broke up with her, because his friends told him if you don’t see a future with her you should let her go, and not use her. Her claims there were no emotional feelings towards her, it was just the physical part for him. However, as I glimpsed over their messages I read that he sent her “...this was very hard on me...”. Also, he had dated others after her.

I just knew I couldn’t trust him, so I purchased a tracking device. To see if I can catch him going somewhere, up until now, I haven’t caught him going anywhere crazy.

Also,  I recently found out, this whole year, we had been driving by his Ex’s house (same PA ex) almost every weekend on our way home. He claims it’s a “shortcut”. I noticed he would look into that house ALL the time! & if the car windows are down, he would shut it as we drive by. (Before researching the house, I had asked him if he used to live there, or if he knew someone that lived there, he said “NO”). Continued to drive by until I confronted him with my findings. He claims he doesn’t know if she still lives there or not. And that I was making a big deal out of nothing.

He deleted all his messages has his phone set up to delete messages every 30 days now. I still feel my trust has been shattered. I don’t truly believe him, I just pretend that I do as to not fight. 

When we are not intimate for more than a week, I always assume he’s cheating on me.I’ve this fear that he’s cheating on me, and I’m just dumb and can’t see it. There were two instances where I found hair strands that weren’t mine. I just really don’t know if I’m actually going crazy, and over exaggerating this whole thing...or if I should be worried.

I feel really guilty about this but socialising with my friends doesn’t feel as rewarding anymore. I kind of feel like I’m being a glass wall most of the time so it does make it harder to interact/feel present.

It goes up and down through the day but it’s been worse on average, affecting everyday life, and it might be that I’m not getting enough sleep.

At home, I also sometimes feel that someone is inside my house who shouldn’t be (nobody specific, but it’s humanoid and doesn’t have a face), I don’t see hallucinations but I get the feeling that they’re there and watching me and I sometimes get images in my head that they’re in my room watching me lay in bed.

It's just me who's putting all these conscious efforts to keep myself sane and happy and it's tiring. It was never like this before, happiness was natural and quick to come and never felt like a chore. The more I delve deep into myself and my life the more I realise that life is indeed pointless and I struggle to find meaning in any of the stuff I try to work towards. Logic seems to fail when I'm overpowered by my emotions. I've got a life ahead of me but these feelings of hopelessness haunt me.

"My husband and I are spending 3 weeks in Spain this October (flying in and out of Barcelona) and we have no idea where to start with our itinerary. We are both quiet, introverts that enjoy nature, walking/hiking, beaches, cafes, pastries and other good food. We don't party or drink. We are looking for beautiful, mid-sized cities that have a quiet and relaxed vibe instead of being crawling with tourists traps and crowds. We don't want to be in total rural areas but will definitely be avoiding Madrid and probably won't be sticking around Barcelona too long once we get in. When we went to Italy last year I had a severe panic attack while we tried to navigate the crushing crowds of Rome which nearly paralyzed me in fear for the rest of the trip. On the other hand, the Amalfi coast was a dream (even though it was still touristy) it was beautiful and laid back enough for us to fully enjoy ourselves.   
We are also open to spending some time in Portugal or southern France as part of the trip. Cities that we've looked at so far are: Costa Brava area, Valencia, Alicante, Granada, San Sebastian, Porto.   
We are open to using transit/trains, catching some short extra flights, or renting a car for a road trip for part of the trip (hubby loves to drive).

"I have had depression and anxiety all my life. In my teens and twenties there was enough going on (classes, new jobs etc) that kept me on my toes and too tired to think about how depressing things were. I spent my twenties coming to an empty apartment and sleeping on a comforter on the floor by myself.  Now at 40 I am more depressed than I ever was. I cannot believe that only half my life has passed and I still potentially have another 40 Years of this bullshit. Atleast when I was younger it seemed like it could be a phase or something that will get better... now it's clear it's only gotten worse. I have been on meds and therapy for 10 years and still don't have the drive to want to live another day.

All day I haven’t been in a mood. I’m at an all time low with being depressed and I really don’t feel like being around anyone. I went out last night with a friend and he met this girl. I’m really happy for him. But it sucks when no one wants anything to do with me. I sat there alone in the middle of this bar for at least a half hour. I’ve asked people to hangout in the past and I’ve been shrugged off by everyone. He was the only person I hangout with now. And I heard today they’re hitting it off great. Again I’m happy for him. But I’m tired of the pressure of everyone asking me about a girlfriend. Every time we go out to eat my mother always embarrasses me in front of the waitresses. It’s getting old.

"For the sake of some background info, I'm a 21 year old female who just graduated with an associates degree in Graphic Design and Computer Information Systems. I'm currently working full time as a waitress/manager at a little diner in a truck stop. I'm currently on 50mg of vyvanse, which I take once in the morning. 

Now, the reason I wish I never started meds is because I genuinely struggle so hard on the days I decided not to take them. It's like before I ever went to the doctor, yeah, my adhd made things difficult, but I could function most days and eventually got shit done. But now it's impossible to do anything unless I take the vyvanse. I don't want to take it every day because it can be really difficult to fall asleep while on them. It's also hard because, It's not just that I'm productive on my meds, I'm also happier, my appetite is low(so I don't binge eat) and I just feel like I'm physically in less pain, like it's easier to get up and move. I just get so depressed and tired, hungry, and emotional on those sober days... nothing like how I was before the prescription.

"I feel this consistent heaviness in my chest. It’s worse during Spring/Summer (reverse SAD), but it never goes away, though I do feel a noticeably better in the Fall/Winter when there’s less sunlight. 

I’m not motivated to do anything but there’s so much I NEED to do. I’m mourning the loss of my sister and as of last week, I’m mourning the loss of one of my dogs. Work stresses me out so that makes things worse and I dread Mondays…I dread every weekday, really. The only day the pressure in my chest lets up a bit is Saturday…but once Sunday hits it comes right back. 

My mood only lifts slightly if I drink because that’s also the only way I can sleep. 

Why is life like this? Why must we endure hardship and heartache? Why isn’t there a button we can push that allows us to opt out? It’s not like we consented to being born anyway. And an opt-out button wouldn’t hurt anyone or be anything sad, it’d just be like, “Have you seen Jane lately?” “No, she opted out a few weeks ago.” “Oh well good for her!” But we don’t have that option. There’s no do-overs, quitting…we just have to press onward. It’s terrible.

"(For those checking my post history, I either randomize or conceal gender to avoid identification and bias.  Sometimes it's hard to write genderless.)

Sorry if this doesn't belong on this forum but I really need to get this out there because it's tearing at me.

A few nights ago my wife was 100% convinced that our 5 year old daughter was sexually assaulted by an intruder in the middle of the night.  There was no evidence of an intruder and the idea that there has been an intruder coming in just about every night has persisted for a long time now and I'm making no progress trying to convince my wife that it isn't happening.

Eventually my wife managed to convince me to take our daughter in to the hospital for an examination, but she wouldn't take her in herself -- like some secret part of herself knows she's mentally unwell and is trying to keep it a secret, and knows that the doctors will think she's got issues but *somehow* if **I** take our daughter in they'll take it seriously.

They did a urine test and a superficial examination and said they found no evidence of abuse or drugging.  They advised me not to go for the more invasive examination, feeling it would be an *actual* trauma to my daughter just to be *extra* sure that trauma hadn't occurred, so I didn't go for it.

The doctor's word and the lab results didn't change my wife's mind.  The assault 100% happened and they were just careful to use a drug that hospitals don't test for and careful not to do any damage.  Just like they can avoid all the cameras (or edit footage) and get in and out without leaving any sign.

"As i've grown older I've became more happy in my own company I have got rid of friends that I felt didn't treat me the way I treated them and I felt happy with these decisions but with this then gradually spent a lot more time on my own.

With this I've then also noticed i'm now unable to keep a job for any longer than a few month before I lose/leave it.

It's hard to explain but whenever I start a job I go into it with the set plan of i'm going to just do the job professionally like I'm a robot, Limit my interactions with others to nothing more than small talk and everyday will run like clockwork same rules/structure/plans etc and this is how I am able to keep my mind happy.... I thrive on structure/plans and organised.

However this can itself lead to paranoia as I start to feel others might find me boring/cold etc.... but I dont mind too much as this is when I do the job best but also I know there is no way I could have said or done anything to have offended anyone or be judged on as i've limited my interactions to the bare minimum and I always do my work on time/correctly.

I purposely try to behave this way because I know if I let it slip that I can be very chatty/goofy and an oversharer and with these qualities might say/do something to offend someone or lose respect from others.

What I mean by this is my natural personality is very chatty/weird/kind and goofy and over time when people get to know me they begin to take liberties with me as something about my personality screams "" we can take the mickey out of them and they will be cool with it "" and also when I let it slip my paranoia begins to kick in as i'm constantly analyzing all my interaction I've had that day combing for anything I could have said that may have offended someone or given them reason to think less of me/mock me or talk about me to others.

I dont seem to have a middle ground... 

I'm either Robocop - Super serious, controlled, work is done on time and very well organised with zero chance of having said or done anything to offend anyone and i leave work fairly happy only worrying people think I'm a dick for not interacting but fear nothing more.

Or

I let my guard down and then begin to slip into goofy mode... work turns to crap and i become a paranoid weirdo that overshares and regrets every interaction I make and then spends the rest of the day worrying I've said or done something wrong to someone and it starts to spiral.......

At this point is when I end up leaving my job.. I can't seem to keep the charade up.

"I generally feel like my family talks about me behind my back a lot. This bit isn't paranoia because I've walked in on them many times and I've often heard them say things about me (after an argument)  that kind of stung - my mom told my brother that she doesn't care about the things I get for her as long as she's got him and when he mentioned that I can hear her, she said that she "" doesn't give a shit"".  After that I was expected to let it go because she was angry. I mention this because it kind of traumatized me and my relationship with my mother was essentially over after that even though we're still living in the same house.

In the time since then, I exchanged exactly one look with another person. My mother, she and I were there, and we were talking about charity and my mother turned it around to how everything at home is sorted and we have everything we need. It was just a second but for my part it was very, very judgemental but the other person and her have a very good relationship and I often catch snippets that sound less than appealing to me. It's none of my business though so I stay out of it.

The thing now is that I tend to get very paranoid about them talk about me and based on basically everything I've heard my mother ever say in my entire life, I feel like I'm anticipating the worst. Even ridiculous things. One day, for example, there was a small earth tremor and the second it hit I recognized the sound with the vibration and I started counting the number seconds it lasted as I went to my safe place in my bedroom. My mother and I have both experienced earthquakes before then (her in the 60s me in 2018)  and I didn't recognize it the first time and I slept right through it (this was in Japan where some major quakes have hit not long before I was there so they were experiencing aftershocks). It scared the hell out of me that I didn't recognize it  so I read tons of accounts about what people hear and spoke to people who were there to try and figure out what I might expect. When the tremor hit where I am now, I heard a crack before I felt the shake and I immediately figured that this was it. Anyway, I told my brother (who didn't feel it at all) and mother that I heard it (tons of people did and tons didn't) and they gave one another ""the look""  now I am trying to figure out how this can  be used in one of their gab sessions to make me look bad. To me it feels like this would be consistent with everything I've experienced with them but it still feels so dangerous - like anything I say can and will be used against me, even something as ubiquitous as hearing an earthquake!",5,paranoia

i feel like someone's threatening me and watching me while i'm at home, reading my mind. whatever i like, they'll think of the same thing albeit in negative emotions. when i like something they'll think ""oh i don't. you're stupid and cringe and edgy, you know that, right?""

i'm unsure if this is even paranoia. just a whole other level of feeling threatened, scared, worried, anxious, and paranoid but in another way.

does anyone have a problem relating to this? because i really need someone i can talk to about this. at least someone who'll comprehend and care.

mother won't care; nor will sister or brother. my mother would say ""oh, it's because you're setting your mindset to that kind of thing"" when it's not me. my father will say ""you're weird"" because he probably assumes i'm a normal, cis child who is innocent and non-suicidal. non-mentally unstable.

sometimes, when i try perceiving on what's happening to the person watching me, i feel as if they're some person/demon who looks identical to me. but more annoying and creepy.

i feel like i can read what they're saying in my mind; albeit what would they really be saying? ""oh you're a wonderful person"" no they wouldn't say that. they'd say something more opposite; like ""oh you're an idiot, you just fake your depression you ugly emo brat. i'm now threatening you because i don't care"" and i feel like nobody can help me. nobody, in the whole entire fricking g\*d-damn world.

like people would just say ""no you're just setting your mindset to that"" ""nobody can watch you, you're 'safe'"" ""the only person who can read your thoughts... well, is you"" (according to my therapist). i can't get proper help because nobody will understand me well.

the person watching me might as well be an old imaginary friend; who now despises me. or might be some person i hate irl watching me through technology. even if theres no such thing as cameras around my house, i feel as if they're watching me some other way.

i'm unsure about whats happening. i need desperate help.

summary/brief explanation: basically i'm saying that i feel like some person is watching me and threatening me in some weird strange way (not by using cameras) and i can't get any help or remove this stuff from my stupid brain.

i just want to harm myself; how would that go with the person watching me? or should i say demon?

"tldr or smthg : scared i might have tbi/brain damage due to concussive state in year 9, minor incidents in year 5 and year 10. high results all round, never really study too much.

&#x200B;

**Experiences**

When I was in YEar 2 - Year 4 I was very bright, smart child and commended by my parents, teachers and other specialists. In year 5, I got in a fight and someone hit me in the back of the head with small fists around the back of my head (the area where hair usually ends after a fresh cut), and the area had swollen parts to it for a while that hurt to touch. I don't remember having bad symptoms or any head aches necessarily, but remember crying and having enough capacity to tell teacher and stuff. 

After than incident I have done still really well in schooling with scholarships everything etc and NAPLAN up until Year 9, where I fell hitting the topish of my head, I think i got a minor concussion as my walking was very fuzzy and weak, I still remember everything that happened clearly on that day and even remarking to my friend about it, also I had bad headache that day that went away. stupidly, i didn't tell others in my recollection and didnt get help, just slept it out.  After that incident, I still did very well in school, but had a study slump where I had bad mental health etc that could've impacted it but i thugged it out, and got really high grades that matched my previous performance and even better in the circumstances. 

Fast forward to Year 10, my brow bone where my eyebrows are got hit by cricket ball with helment, that didn't do anything as it hit up rather than straight at my head, and this unlucky happened 6 times over two months, but it definitely wasn't forceful hits just stung. The last two hits led me to feel little tired but nothing out the normal, i definitely think that it was just my mind making it up as i was worried about it.  

Tbh after these incidents my year 10 is of to very strong start with math and science, so idk.

**Reaasoning**

TO these events, Im scared something could've impacted my intelligence and cognitive ability. reasonig for this is that i feel my memory decreased, it could be attributed to my constant fatigue sometimes, mental health sadness and that i've stopped reading. 

Also, i don't have proper reasoning for my iq reducing as my scores are high and my school results are constantly competitive with top 3 at shcool but i did completely flunk NAPLAN which i didn't try and was late to as I got high Band 9 for math, and some band 10s for english when in year 5 i got decently higher (yr 7 skipped due to covid). However, like im not sure with my worry and anxiety over this i started picking up when I forget things, and its worrying.

If worse comes to worse, Ill thug it out, it gets better eventually.

&#x200B;

**Background context etc**

Ive done IQ tests including Italian one that had large sample data, MENSA norway i think and the psychometrics test by WASIQ i think it was, and I got 133, 118 (very tired on that day and distracted and under stress pressure), 135 respectively. Im not sure if it really has been impacted however.

For some reason, in maths I always find myself performing bad on NAPALN and stuff as such for some reason but do very very well in other tests with minimal practice.

I procrastinate a lot in my studies but still manage to memorise when it matters and do pretty welll (A - A+), sometimes i start studying 5 days into a two topic test for example.

I struggle with mental health, dont have any bad thoughts but when i do struggle i thug it out, shi but thugging it means i get brain fog and just fatigue with the sadness.

Im 15, year 10.

I have a lot of test anxiety and make silly mistakes that take away marks and never that I don;t understand a topic in tests.

I am studying to be a doctor, im afraid this could impact my ucat.

"I'm in art school, art was something I used to love doing, but in the past years i began losing my focus. I do less and less every day, be it school work or just personal art for my own enjoyment. Right now, finals for my 2nd year in uni are _weeks_ away and I have absolutely zero drive to work on anything. All I do is fixate on very short-lived obsessions for that dopamine rush, like certain games or movies. I dont have any aspirations. I have a burning need in me to _know_ things, to learn and experience and DO stuff. But i just... can't.

Recently, I began to realize some things are not actually in my control, and out of a last attempt at finding _why_ i couldn't escape from this hole I've dug myself into, I went to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with ADHD. I will start medication in a month, which _is_ progress and will most likely help in gaining some control and drive in my life... yet I cant help but overthink everything. The second i feel that terror and discomfort creep in, I dont even try doing any work. And due to toxic relationships in my life, and due to my previously undiagnosed ADHD, i have little to no trust in my own mind.

Here is where i feel i need an outside opinion. Whenever I'm in a conundrum, I start spiraling and end up with nothing but mush in my brain. Am I stopped by my condition, or am I letting myself be stopped? Do i have the power, actually, but its just very uncomfortable to overcome this struggle, or is this thinking the same one used by the toxic people in my life, to belittle my struggles and blurr my limits? Am I, by not trusting myself, reinforcing my insecurities, or blocking out the response I learned to throw _at_ myself as a punishment?

Am i pushing myself in this corner or just accepting ive been pushed here by other factors?

TLDR: I'm overthinking my every choice/ avoidance _of_ choice, cant tell if its more my fault or out of my control and I need an outside opinion in hopes that i can figure out what to do.

It kind of happened a few times in minor ways but I would always isolate myself first before I could be isolated, then I would reunite with her when I felt the threat of being replaced was gone. We've visited each other several times in person and spent a week or so at a time at each other's homes. I would consider her my best friend and that my fear of being replaced just gets in the way of me embracing that fully.

"I made this anonymous account to get this stuff off my chest but idek what I’m doing or if it’ll help, I don’t even use Reddit. Anyway I genuinely don’t know if I can take it anymore it’s just becoming too much. I’m a fucking failure and I can’t keep dealing with it, I keep trying to tell myself “oh you know god has a plan for you and it’s gonna all be worth it, all the pain and suffering will pay off” but it hasn’t and it’s just been years of constant pain. I’m still young but when I have more suffering than happiness my youth feels like it’s eternal. The first time I tried to “make the pain go away” I was probably like 8 or 9 years old and I sometimes wonder if it would have been better if it worked out.

I hate myself. I’ve failed at everything I’ve ever attempted, I was a horrible student, I joined the military only to leave while in BMT, I can’t restore a car I’ve worked on for 3 years, I cant even experience the same things other people my age are, I tried shrooms because they’re kinda big right now, I don’t do any drugs or even really drink, and the one time I try it I ended up having a really bad trip and wrecking a car into a tree at 65+mph which resulted in me losing my license and my job at the time.

"So I guess to celebrate the return of the series this summer they started a theatrical rerelease of the original transformers (at least here in Korea) and I am more sure than I ever have been that this movie is GOOD

1) I know people don't like shia's character here but personally I love it. He's in the 11th grade and tasked with both saving the world and getting the girl as a nerd. Of course he's gonna be stuttering, swearing, and whining his way thru...but he has some nice character moments like telling off the sector 7 guy, killing megatron, and just generally standing up for the autobots. I also find his gags funny, sorry not sorry

2) McKayla is also pretty cool. No doubt bay super sexualizes her (the car scene...what a classic) but she also has a great amount of agency and ""badass"" moments like saving sam at the factory, her and bumblees contribution to the final assault, etc.

3) Some of the cinematography is very...in era...with lens flares up the ass and a general blue tint but no one can deny there are some crazy sexy vibes in this movie. The military troupe wandering the desert with the sun setting behind them? AMAZING. megatron on the top of the tower before transforming to a jet and going crazy? BEAUTIFUL. Those long shots of optimus and megatron going at it? 

4) The effects still hold up. While the way the transformers actually look has definitely contributed to the way the action got harder to follow the deeper the series went, the CGI of the transformers themselves still looks incredibly good and the actual explosions are still perfect (its michael bay so they better be)

Now I am not saying that its a masterpiece or anything close to the sort, but I really love this movie and I think that it has been maligned due to the reputation of the following movies. Probably the dumbest things in this one are the masturbation joke and the piss gag but they're over in seconds and otherwise the movie is just plain fun.

"I've been a receptionist for a vet clinic for a few months, burnt out, then got hospitalized when my support system dissolved (my cat of 17yrs died and my parents were out of town). I lost my job because my doctor was convinced that forcing me to go back to work was a good idea. I had a meltdown and was forced to quit or be fired. It took me 5 months to get another job-- same role as before but at a different hospital. I started a couple weeks ago. I'm close to quitting because I cannot handle the abuse anymore.


 Some people are monsters and I am forced to just take their abuse because saying or doing anything to defend myself is not ok. The managers that are supposed to handle the difficult people won't deal with them. I can't handle being mocked and told that I am a ""fucking idiot"" and that I ""clearly don't give a shit"" about their pet. I can't handle being yelled at for shit out of my control or blamed for someone else's mistakes. I'm tired of being the scapegoat and punching bag for anyone who gets frustrated about things not going the way they want it. My coworkers have been doing their best to help me, but they can't stop the clients from absolutely bullying me. 


Idk what to do. I feel like I need to quit. Again. I feel hopeless about being one of those ""meaningful and productive members of society,"" and I doubt I will be able to get financial support from the government bc I'm (apparently) not disabled enough and haven't worked enough hours or something? But the issue is that I cannot work reliably. I cannot keep a job. I'm incapable of this. I'll end up trying to kill myself bc what's the point in trying anymore when I am not allowed to thrive? 


In the end, my dad's gf was right. I'm not ever going to make it if I tried to become a vet. I might not even survive just existing.",1,autism
"Ok so I don’t know if have paranoia or not so here are the symptoms that haunt me everyday and was wondering if it’s normal or paranoia?

Firstly, I’m terrified that people can read my mind. I know it’s impossible but I still feel super guilty every time I think of someone cuz I feel like they can hear what I’m thinking etc

I’m scared people can see me even though no one’s around. Kinda like the mind reading but this time that they can actually see me. Or that I’m just hallucinating and thinking that I’m alone when in fact there are other people in the room with me (I’m afraid that I might do this, I know I don’t but what if yk)

This might be more like OCD but I always have to check my phone multiple times before bed cuz I’m scared I accidentally sent something or posted something on any of my social media and I have to check every app and every account like 3-10 times to be sure.

I tried to keep it short, Thank you in advance if you respond! :))",5,paranoia

"This may because I have the bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder, but I remember being so obsessive over one person and I kept stopping myself from bothering them because I knew something was off. I have 3 books I filled writing about them. 
It didn't stop me from making an ass of myself. I couldn't stand to see them again. They probably knew I was sick because everyone around that time were trying to help me. 
I fought for control because something felt wrong. I kept thinking they were communicating to me, but I logically understood that this didn't match their behavior in person. 
I started looking for answers and remembered my disgnosis again. When I finally got back on medication. My interest in them dissolved completely. I'm thankful that I didn't harass them. I was like that for over almost two years. I'm sure they're great, but I may have been attracted to the narrative I created around them. I should also mention that I'm a lesbian and I'm not even attracted to men. I've never even had a boyfriend. I think my heavily religious homophobic background had a part to play in that.

You just don’t GET IT. Vocal stims are EVERYTHING to me.

My vocal stims release the autismic hormone and it’s SO GOOD. They can judge all they want. Call me all the ableist slurs they want. Make all the “autistic kid for no reason when” memes they want. THEYRE NOT TAKING AWAY MY VOCAL STIMS!!! GRRR!!!

It’s their loss. They don’t understand how AWESOME it feels. Imagine being stressed or bored and NOT having a noise or repetitive movement you can do to put yourself at ease? That sounds so sad.

"I work a retail job as a parking lot attendant. I had gotten my work done, so I stood by one of the entrances. A customer was in the road calling over to me. I didn’t understand him so I asked what he said, he held up his cigarette and I thought he said “is this alright” as in “is it okay if I smoke out here” to which I said yes. He started walking towards me and I realized he actually said “you got a light” asking if I had a lighter. I asked him if that was what he said, and he said yes. I apologized and told him I misunderstood him and I didn’t have a lighter. He said “you trying to play me out?” I asked what he meant and he said “you said you had a lighter and you don’t”. I told him it was a misunderstanding, but since I’ve never had a confrontation like this at work, “i thought you said is this alright” came out as “I thought you asked if I was alright” which makes no sense. 

He walked away and I stood there for a few more minutes. I didn’t feel safe anymore so I went into the building and walked around a little bit. I went back to working thinking he was just passing by, but he was still outside the store. I passed him again and apologized to him again and walked away. 

I walked back into the store and passed by the entrance I was standing by and saw that he was standing there on the phone. I don’t know what he was saying, but I thought he was talking about me and I thought I heard the word “shoot.” I walked around a little more and he wasn’t at the doors anymore. I lingered for a minute and watched him walk into the store like he was waiting for me.

"You know it's not somthing people really think about much but everyone has their own story some people have happy stories and some people have sad stories  or painful ones. I happen to have a painful and sad story lucky me am I right lol 
Honestly I feel like my life is a bad Shakespeare script  written just to be cruel instead of to teach a lesson or some interspection on life itself. 
My starts just like a lot of people born to two parents that weren't at all compatible, nore where they ready to have a kid how do I know that you ask? Simple my parents fought a lot when I was a baby and kid right up until I was about 5 at some point my father hit my mother or so she claims I don't know the facts and they divorced soon after which you know fair enough no one should stay together if that's the relationship no I have no problem with that. 
What I have a problem with is that instead of ether of them taking me and raising me they both just dumped me with my grandparents and said have fun. Mind you my mother would go on to steal my childsupport as long as it was coming in I never saw a dime and funny how that's the less fucked up part the real fucked up part is the fact she left me with my grandparents.
Which your probably thinking whats so bad about that? Well what's wrong with that is she knew my grandmother was an abusive fucking monster it's why she got amansipated at 16 at left the house.
Like bitch jumped ship herself but left her 5 year old son to fend for himself. 
So predictably as anyone could guess the abuse started after that. But twist I didn't start in the way you might imagine. At first it just started with trying to make me into the perfect little child oh all the adults would love me 💌 they would all say what a well behaved kid oh he's so smart this that and the other. Little did they know I was so damn perfect because if I wasn't I should get my ass beat screamed at and anything else you could imagine I was just my grandmothers little living trophy.
I was dragged all around to adult party's with nothing to do but sit around and be presentable I could talk with adults because it was an adult conversation I couldn't watch TV because it was rude to do that as someone's place or around guests I couldn't play games because that was disrespectful to others mind you I was a kid not a teen a kid. 
Oh also did I forget to mention she constantly didn'tni allow me to have friends I was totally isolated from  kids my own age so that as I grew older I had no idea how to interact with kids my own age for the longest time until I was in high school in fact and even then I needed her seal of approval. But i am getting ahead of myself here.
So my childhood keeps going on and I get sent to one of the worst school in the whole of the United States its has been in the national news multiple times for gang fights. As you might imagine awkward nerdy kid with no social skills makes for an easy target for kids to try and bully what you might not have expected was that nerdy kid was taught to fight by his grandfather to protect myself and encourged to do so infact. So I ended up getting in a lot of fights and I do mean a lot. Now what you might not have expected even more then that though was that fact that my evil bitch grandmother would in fact not take my side for defending myself and would in fact both blame me and punish me for doing so.
So needless to say I grew to resent and hate her for both the physical abuse when she hit me the verbal abuse when she called me things like demon child and the mental abuse of telling me one thing but when I actully did it getting punished for it. And when she wasn't beating me or yelling at me what she would do was lock me in my room no books no TV no games no cards nothing just empty room. And to be fair when school was in, it was fine but when it was off on break. Man did it fucking suck I would just go days or weeks without human interactions except for them which as you might imagine a kid doesn't want to interact with his abuser very much so I just didn't interact with anyone except sometimes my grandfather when he wasn't to tired from work. 
And that went on for years until I was in highschool and then suddenly my grandmother this evil woman I hated suddenly got and man let me tell you what a complicated set of emotions that was because I might of hated this woman for all the abuse but at least she raised me which was just a tad more then I could say about my own parents. So I ended up taking time off my senor year of highschool taking care of her just barely being in school enough to graduate. Great am I right? Finally out of that hell hole? Nope because now comes the real mental anguish. My grandfather who never asked me for most anything asked me to take care of my grandmother so that we could save money so she could get treatments and he could go to work. 
As you might imagine I wasn't exactly happy about that arrangement but I agreed to it because he's one of the few people who treated me like I mattered in my family. So I waste a few years of my life taking care of her she gets better at time and then suddenly takes a turn for the worse and I experience all the horrors cancer and cancer treatment do to a person from the throwing up, hair loss  agonizing pain, and anything else you can imagine only to have her die anyways. Now me being the stupid stupid bastard I am manged to get ahold of my mother because I thought she deserved to be their before her mother died worst fucking mistake of my life. Now you might be asking how's that the worst mistake that's simple I had compassion for another person who was hurting at lose because even though my mother and my grandmother couldn't be in the same room without fighting I knew they loved each other. So I make the hospital let her in to see her on her death bed my wishes where honored. she used this as an opportunity to manipulate me into feeling pity for me now fast forward a few years into the future and I invite her to live with me in my grandmother and grandfather's house because he was moving out because it was to painful for him to live here but he didn't want to kick me out so he left me to pay for the house instead. So I figure win win I get my mom to live with me and we can try repairing are relationship and all she has to do is pay real cheap rent and her and my brothers all get a nice house to live in. 

SEE THIS THIS RIGHT HERE ⬆️ THIS IS WHERE I FUCKED MYSELF THE HARDEST

So she and my brothers move in the first thing that starts happening is they all start trashing the house they refuse to clean up after themselves they eat my food mind you I have a fridge in my own room so they had to break in and take my stuff knowingly, and she also refuses to correct my younger siblings behavior because she let's them do whatever they want and doesn't want me to do anything about it ether mind you again this is my house. So it gets so bad that I have to kick her out but mind you it's to late they have trashed my house and I now have a roach problem she broke one of the bedroom doors and door handles changed the lock and handle on another one aboned one of my siblings at my house and refuses to come get him and cps won't do shit. But at least she's out mind you while this happens my current gf who was just a friend at the time saw all this happening and felt bad for me and loved me even if I was to stupid to see it at the time. So time goes on with me struggling then I lose my job get super depressed end up in some amount of debt and I want to die. But she doesn't give up on me and she shows me she loves me in a way that even someone as stupid as me can understand. She supports me and gets me back on my feet enough so I can get a job again and all the while I don't notice she's putting herself in debt to help me. So finally realizing she loves me clearly and doesn't just want somthing from me I asked her out we start dating and I ask her to live in my house ya it still has problems but I say we can try to mange it together we can't because she has put herself in debt trying to help me and so we just try working on getting are stuff together but stuff keeps going wrong. For starters as soon as she moves in the well water pump brakes so we have to fix that then after this on my way to work a guy T-bones me totals my car I use a decent portion of the money to try catching back up on some of the house payments I missed and I hold on to the rest to try to get us through stuff because I stupidly think she has a car we can share not realizing what a burden I am putting on her. Because now we have to make are schedules always work for each other. So I have now placed this girl multiple times under distress because she loves me worthless ass. Mind you she is putting up with roaches we can't seem to get rid of no matter how hard I try or how clean we keep the house. And now she's left to her mother's house rightfully so because she can't take living here anymore I was forced to buy a car with no money saved for one with credit that hasn't recovered yet so that I can keep working so I can try to keep my house feed myself and not be homeless all while trying to deal with the houses problems and trying to not lose my gf because I have made her life harder just by loving me. So now I have negative 147$ in my bank 5$ on my credit card left a 600$ payment for my car coming up no money for food no family to turn to crippling anxiety crippling depression and an intense desire to kill myself all while knowing I won't kill myself. I don't have an idea of how to evan start helping myself and if I am honest with myself I know I can do nothing for myself here I just have to be forced to watch as the little bit of life I have tryed to carve out for myself crumbles like ash in my mouth leaving nothing but a bitter taste in my mouth.

This is my life story or at least a large part of it I suppose. I don't know why I wrote this I don't know if anyone will care probably not. Not many have before. Honestly this just might be my last dying gasps for help but I am not even sure I want help as much as I just want all my hurt to go away to be able to be loved and love someone else without so much going wrong. To be able just just live......... but I probably won't get even that wish. Life real is just a sick cruel joke.

"For some time now I've been experiencing the paranoid delusion that there is something of a war being fought over my consciousness. Some people/entities are good and fight to preserve my sense of self, others are awful and attempt to dissolve my ego. 

I've more or less trained myself over the years to not have any issue regarding maintaining a normal life despite mental health issues but there is significant persuasive techniques being used to make me feel as though none of the aforementioned is my doing and that I'm propped up by some team of people who aren't me.

So infantile of a thought.

Hey, Reddit community!  
  
I'm reaching out today because I'm facing a significant hurdle in my life—ADHD. It has become a constant roadblock, preventing me from fully capitalizing on the opportunities that come my way. I'm tired of being unfocused, constantly changing my plans and goals, and feeling the frustration it causes in my business and personal relationships.

"I am 32(f) and got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia two weeks back and I am still unable to come to terms with it. I am terrified.

So all the things my friends/ex boyfriends did to hurt/insult/taunt me was all in my head- this thought that I can’t trust myself or my judgement anymore is crippling. What does it mean for me now? How do I come to terms with this new information that I have.",6,schizophrenia
"Hi❤️ I’m a F23 with two troubled parents, I have BPD, my mom has ADHD and my dad was just diagnosed w schizophrenia today, he is 42 years old and has always been depressed and dissociative ever since I can remember. He begun having manic / psychotic behaviour beginning 2018. 

He is highly intelligent and sensitive, loves movies, music, video games and the cosmos. 

I want to be there for my dad. I want to know how it has been for those of u who are diagnosed to have ur condition and what to be mindful of. I also do have a few friends who are sc and I want to be as mindful as possible of what I can do to help when they are very triggered. I always make sure to ask them myself what they need too ofc in a soft manner.

I just got the «news» of his final diagnosis today, though he started experiencing drug induced (Ritalin / Amfethamine / Weed ) psychosis in 2018 and ever since then was he ever the same.

Up until now I thought he might be autistic with isolated incidents of drug induced psychosis’ that turned to the psychosis lingering for years after.

In his very intense episodes he mostly sees demons and wants to fulfill some sort of prophecy, and / or he thinks he’s being followed and is suspicious of everyone but me and my grandma.

I remember him as being calm, witty, sensitive and smart my whole childhood / young adulthood leading to 2018. Though, apparantly whenever he was ill I would stay at my grandma’s house and she would tell me he had a fever or stomach bug instead.. 

Since 2018 he has been aggressive, accusive, he breaks things (electronics, his windows and walls). He was recently forced to sell his apartment because he’s been screaming a lot, and broke things constantly and I guess my worry now is will he with his diagnosis and finally getting the right medication be able to lead a good life again?

I don’t want to be insensitive to my dad but I really miss the way he used to be so much, we were best friends and talked every day pre 2018, and I guess I thought there was a possibility that he would go back to his «normal» self again but I now understand that he has actually always been like this and I actually just never knew. He has been in a good psychiatric hospital for half a year now and after careful observation they finally diagnosed him 

I am curious to hear from those of you who have been diagnosed with sc yourselves in your later years and how it affected you. Also those who have sc parents and how it has been for u.❤️",6,schizophrenia

I don't want to do it, but our families kind of know each other so I'm not sure how to get out of it. I don't want to come off as a jerk, but I also want to protect my boundaries.

"I can pinpoint exactly when my paranoia started or at least became bad enough to affect my day to day life, and how i go out into the world

but since the original inciting incident things that have nothing to do with it have been setting me off, I put it down to my anxiety ( I'm diagnosed and medicated for it) but over the last 10 ish years I've just spiraled and spiraled...

and now after an incident where I was arrested and kept in custody for over 8-hours (i have no prior history with law enforcement) caused my once manageable paranoia to become completely unhinged, I'm worrying about things that have no physical way of happening, or going over and over the same scenarios in my head and working myself into almost psychotic states of mind.

it's getting so bad that I'm starting to see things moving in the sides of my vision, feel things crawling on me, and having almost daily panic attacks // my mother has paranoid schizophrenia as well as a few other mental health issues, and according to her, I'm showing the same signs that she did at my age ( early 20s )

I just feel so sure that I'm being watched or followed, or something, and now with the 'hallucinations' I'm worried that I should be looking at going to the doctors

"Thursday I bumped my head, basically on a scale of 1 to 10 maybe a 3. 
I had a terrible headache the next day and I ended up at urgent care, they did a head ct all clear. Ended up feeling ok by Sunday had some wine and got to enjoy a concert. 
I've had a lingering headache on and off since and some pain in my neck. Im a bit anxious about a slow bleed. The dr wasn't super worried but of course she said there can be a slow bleed that we wouldn't know about until symptoms show up. Im unfortunately on a blood thinner so that made them initially worried to do the scan and just being on these pills have given me anxiety. Id love to get an idea when I can relax a bit more. I've been pretty nauseous since and I had a few moments of dizziness.  No one could give me a solid answer on when i could potentially be in the clear and and i keep questioning if i I need to go back and get yet another scan and im constsntly checking for symptoms and every headache or bout of nausea freaks me out.  Im now worried about too many scans and wasting my life in a hospital. I have camping trips this summer and I just know this anxiety from stuff like this will ruin it. Anytime im too far from a hospital I instantly get panicky. How do you guys manage that? Im in therapy but doesn't work overnight. Sorry for the rant, needed to vent.

"Hey everyone. 

I've been diagnosed with adhd for 2 years, type one diabetes for 24 and coeliac (severe gluten auto immune response) for 20. I also suspect I struggle a lot with autism socially. 

I'm struggling to tolerate side effects of both stimulants and atomoxetine so can only tolerate a small dose of dexamphetamine every other day.  

Basically, I have ways to sort of get by and cope about half of the time but the pmdd side of things throws me out of whack and I stop being able to function (unable to work, so irritated by every little noise/find it so difficult to be kind to myself because of the amount of pressure I have to do things because of my health, intensified rejection sensitivity, feeling and thinking irrationally).

Due to the unpredictable and demanding nature of type 1 and of how difficult is it to avoid cross contamination for gluten I'm nearly always unwell (especially with adhd making it hard to remember to do things/to eat/hard to process things at the necessary speed to keep up with my health). 

I live in the UK and I'm very lucky that we have the NHS I doubt I'd survive without it. However, I don't know I can help myself, not sure if I'd like comfort or solutions maybe both? But I'm experiencing a lot of suicidal ideation (no planning just the feeling) the last few days, particularly from the effects of when I accidentally ingest gluten (malnourishment, brain fog on top of the adhd kind, migraines, double fatigue). 

Is there anything anyone has found helps them cope or lessens their number of meltdowns? I know this was a long winded one so thank you if you're reading. I have a pip assessment coming up which is a battle in itself, I know that support would go a long way if it goes well (ongoing for 5 years).",3,adhd

"I was wondering if anyone had any advice or guidance on how to handle and deal with career indecision? I was recently laid off from my first job out of college, working in the professional world, in which I had worked for about 2 and half years. I felt that the role I had was not a good fit for many reasons and mainly tolerated it because of good pay and benefits. I did not like my experience overall and felt really burnt out in the end. I have been trying to figure out for the past couple of months on what to do next and have been feeling very overwhelmed by how tough the job market is and the overall job searching process. I also feel all over the place and can't seem to make a decision on which career path/job I should be targeting. I had the same struggle back in college when trying to decide on a major, my indecision made it hard for me to pick something and I ended up graduating a year later.

  
At this point, I'm open to any kind of job whether contract or part time for entry level positions that don't require a lot of experience. I've been told that I lack clarity and direction and don't seem to know what I want which makes me feel even worse as many people don't understand that this is a part of my ADHD symptoms. I have no idea what to do and would really appreciate any suggestions or if anyone has experienced indecision about their careers or any other major life decision, how to handle it and move forward?

After a while i realized that everyone very well could be out to get me and i started treating every interaction online like they were trying to get information out of me or social engineer me, obviously not healthy for a young lad

Anyways, this became the norm, i started having anxiety attacks when someone was trying to social engineer me and i found out and instantly assumed they had gotten access to other parts of my life, so eventually i tried to erase my online identity multiple times

I think me specializing in social engineering made me more paranoid about being social engineered 

Around the age of 16 i started having small psychotic episodes and started developing what my doctors described as early onset schizophrenia, which didnt help, 

Im on meds for it, but i am coming off for personal reasons, and im realizing that that paranoia is seeping into the real world, if i talk to someone new i instantly assume the worst and try and flip the script and try and get information from them and look for inconsistencies in their story to see if its a persona, 

As you can guess this has lead to social issues 

A friend invited me to church on sunday to meet some more people since i dont have many friends since highschool and im worried about my ability to be social

"I have so many allergies. Not any food allergies that I know of, but all just stuff you can breath in or that can get on your skin like all the dust, pollen, dander, bugs, etc. Well, I solved the mystery of my itchy, hivey neck rash I had over the summer. I reapplied sunscreen around my neck again for the first time since last summer, and the rash came back. It's probably a good thing cause I'd been planning to upgrade my sunscreen to a more eco friendly reef safe sunscreen anyway. I learned that metal based sunscreen with absolute bare minimum ingredients are the most hypoallergenic on the skin. I may also start wearing a buff or bandana or something for my neck.

One thing I find especially awful about this rash is the type of itch is causes. I get this red hivey rash, but the itch is like a phantom itch that I can't quite pinpoint, and scratching brings no relief. Very strange. I don't have any remedies for it.

"About six months ago I was just a normal human being. Careless, and did not worry about anything. I’ll admit, I’ve always been a hypochondriac throughout my 23 years of life but it never impeded me from doing anything I wanted to do. I worked, traveled, worked out, hung out with my friends and always had a great time. No anxiety at all. Six months ago, just out of nowhere my brain decided to ruin my life. I had a horrible panic attack that literally came from nowhere. I wasn’t even anxious at all. Never dealt with GAD. I obviously got very scared and ran to the ER because my heart wouldn’t slow down. I thought I was going to die if it didn’t slow down. After many tests everything turned out to be just a panic attack. Well, I thought that was it but little did I know that panic attack would change my life. Now, I can’t even exercise, walk far, travel or even hangout with my friends. I struggle to even be anxious free at work. Here is the most devastating thing: the girl I always wanted to be with, my dream girl, who did not know I had feelings for, wanted to hangout with me on two different occasions. I had to literally make up excuses to not go because of this agoraphobia and anxiety I’m dealing with. Now she’s dating someone else. Why did this happen to me? I never did drugs, drank or did anything stupid to cause my life to be the way it is now. I can’t even take my mom out for a Mother’s Day dinner without having too many second thoughts.

"This is my note of a book called ""The Pathless Path"" by Paul Millerd. It was talked about by Ali Abdaal.

\- interesting quotes make us rethink the traditional path  
\- “The ease of having an ambition is that it can be explained to others; the very disease of ambition is that it can be so easily explained to others.” – David Whyte  
\- “With so many options it can be tempting to pick a path that offers certainty rather than doing the harder work of figuring out what we really want” – Paul Millerd  
\- “The desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same things” – Alan Watts, Zen Philosopher  
\- “Instead of thinking about what you want to do with your life, you default to the options most admired by your peers.” – Paul Millerd  
\- “The educated, hardworking masses are still doing what they’re told, but they’re no longer getting what they deserve.” – Seth Godin  
\- “Many people will override their own desires to meet the perceived expectations of others.” – Paul Millerd  
\- “For example, in Taipei, people in the previous generation were able to purchase property with only a couple of years of savings from an average job. Now Taipei is home to one of the highest price‑to‑rent ratios in the world, and this same goal can take more than twenty years and for many, it is simply impossible. While the economic situation has changed radically, many young people orient their lives towards this same goal.” – Paul Millerd  
\- Your intuition is wrong! 97% of people think “A person is successful if they have followed their interests and talents to become the best they can be at what they care about most.” according to research.  
\- Having previous impressive credentials can open doors, BUT it hasn’t translated into a high income for the author, especially, with some of the more creative things he’s done like writing or online courses.  
\- Targeting a mass audience is the traditional(default) path of thinking.  
\- Riding a ladder the pathless path means accepting that you might not know what you are doing and you might look like a fool.  
\- What to do  
\- Figure out what you have to offer. Ask a few close friends “When have you seen me at my best self?”  
\- Disconnect yourself from traditional work for a bit like 1 month.  
\- Be patient.

Then they changed it to bipolar with schizoaffective features. I have been in the hospital three times because of psychosis. But this last time, I met someone. He is amazing And my best friend. We fell in love really quickly in the hospital, and it is only escalated now that we are out in the real world. However, his psychosis doesn’t seem to have gone away yet. And his parents are saying that he isn’t on the right medication. He is out of work right now, and I understand that. The first time I had psychosis, I had to stop working for over a year. So there’s no judgment here. If he decided to go on disability, and not work, that’s ok with me too. But the issue is that I’m very high functioning, and I have a really good job. He also drinks and smokes a lot of weed. So his delusions become really bad when he is drunk. I love him so much, but the drinking is only making his schizoaffective disorder worse. I get a lot of mixed reviews of my relationship with him. Some people say that it’s really romantic that we met in the hospital and fell in love in a hopeless place. Others say that our relationship is doomed to fail. A lot of people say that I deserve to be with someone who is Nuro typical because I am so high functioning. But I have never felt so excepted and loved in my entire life. It’s just really difficult for me to see how sick my boyfriend is. Has anyone else dated someone who also has schizophrenia?",6,schizophrenia
"I'm in need of support/advice. I (f24) am a social work student in the UK. I'm supposed to finish my degree in the next month but I very likley could fail my final placement. The reason for my failing will be lack of professionalism (i.e. not responding to emails in a timely manner, failure to arrange meetings with my supervisors, and a few absences that I did not tell my supervisor about beforehand). I was already on thin ice and now, because of a simple mistake where I sent an email to one person instead of two, I probably don't have any chances left.

I feel so stupid because the things that may have caused me to fail were *really* avoidable. I understand that I am probably not meant for social work due to not being very professionally responsible, and I plan to pursue something else after my degree, but the fact that I might have thrown three years down the drain with nothing to show for it sickens me. If I do fail this close to the end, I'll feel like the biggest disappointment/embarrassment and I have no clue how I'd tell my family.

I'm already super behind for a 24 year old. I've always struggled in the work place (especially because I have dyspraxia too). Plus, I've already dropped out of a degree when I was 18 (although that was more to do with physical/mental health problems than incompetencey). I have no idea where to go from here and I'm afraid. 

I have a supervision with my practice educator tomorrow (who sounds like she is at her wits end with me). If anyone has any advice concerning getting through the last bit of my degree somehow, I'd appreciate it. Or if there's any advice on what to do if I *do* fail and have to come to terms with the fact that I wasted three years, I'd also appreciate it.",3,adhd

"Hey.

So, I've always had OCD, but ever since my first panic attack last year, I've had this issue that during high anxiety moments, I start 'hearing voices'. The thing is-... I know it's in my mind. I have a lot of trauma, and generally, the voices tend to be of the people that have caused me that trauma-.. for example, them yelling at me in my mind, et cetera. I can't tell if it's an intrusive thought because of that trauma, or if I am really hallucinating? Something important to add here is that my OCD bases itself around my fear of losing my identity / going insane / losing control of my mind. 

Last night there was a completely new problem with that, too. I'm usually at home a lot and can relax and take the day for myself. I don't have many classes this semester so I'm pretty chill most of the time. Yesterday, I had a 12h seminar that went from the morning to the evening, and my OCD exploded a little in the early hours of the seminar. It calmed down after I chilled out, though, and then I managed the rest of the day-... until the night. In the evening, we went to check a theater play (an opera) and it went completely fine! I really liked it, et cetera. My health anxiety spiked a little because I got dizzy, but other than that I was fine. I took a bus, walked the way back home, and immediately laid down into bed. 

That's where everything went wrong. Out of nowhere, I was not falling asleep. Adrenaline was rushing up into my body each time I was about to nod off, and it kept me awake. I was falling asleep multiple times, but waking up with nightmares relatively swiftly, and that's when I noticed I was also hearing things again. I was hearing the singers of the opera in my mind, and I also heard some weird brushing noise. The brushing noise, admittingly, sounded very real and could have been a real noise (my apartment complex can be very noisy), but because I was already scared I thought I was finally going insane. I did, eventually, fall asleep, but I didn't get much sleep before I woke up. I am a lot more relaxed today, but I am still extremely hyperaware about all my bodily sensations, and a little on edge.",4,anxiety

But speed ahead , I’ve learned to hide it better, feared nobody liked me in school, feared the teachers where failing me on purpose 

It’s kind of annoying when some of the fears comes true but that’s life 

I know this sounds like a complete contradiction but I always had somebody take me under their wing and look out from me from bullies, till they became the bullies to a lesser extent, always arse of the joke and such

But I know this is not a therapy session so I skip kinda too now.

I don’t have a job because I’m terrified I fear it’s not for me or I’m going to get fired

"Let me start off by saying, I am in no way bashing my friends nor am I not recognising that they are just trying to be kind, but it doesn’t help. 
My life feels like a pit of nothingness, always. I have little moments of happiness but then it’s just back to my bland baseline, or worse. And right now, I am deep into the ‘worse’ category. I’m barely functioning and avoiding social interactions and when I do talk to someone it feels like I am watching myself in a simulation selecting the correct responses until the interaction ends. 

I have very few friends. I have never fully trusted anyone, even though I know deep down I should trust these people. I always just end up saying ‘oh ya I’m okay, just a rough patch’. When inside, I feel like I’m dead. I have no family, apart from my mum who is preoccupied with her other family in another country. I’m not in a relationship, no where even close, I feel entirely unlovable because I have nothing to offer from my empty soul.
Loneliness literally courses through my veins, there are times when I will be sobbing and I feel actual aching pain in my fingertips and body from lack of physical touch or companionship. I grew up surrounded by abusive men, my grandfather, father and step dad. But because we were wealthy, when I acted out it was ‘oh she’s just spoilt not getting her own way’ because I had all the material things I could want, when I was literally begging for help, having anxiety attacks, without even knowing it. I was never protected or nurtured and that theme has continued in my life. 

Where my friends come into it: I’m 27, had a job that I was actually thriving at for the first time in my entire life. In fact, when I was at work it was the only time I have ever felt competent or proud of myself in anyway. I met some great people during that time, and am still in touch with them regularly. They know that I get ‘down’ sometimes, and we do try to talk about it. Everything they express is with the best of intentions, you know, ‘it will get better’ and ‘something good will come along’. I always have, and always will support them because I am well aware that people from perfect scenarios get down sometimes too. They grew up differently to me, and I don’t want to explain my past and either have it 1. Traumatise them or 2. Feel that I am now a burden and their responsibility. 

I simply don’t know how to communicate the sort of things that happened to me in the past that now dictate my emotions and slumps into depression, especially considering that they come from very loving households with a lot of support. I don’t want to be pitied, or tiptoed around, if they find out. I also don’t know how to accept support and feel like I am a huge drain on my friends energy when I am in this down stage. 
If anyone has navigated this, please help me. I want to be open, but I don’t want to be that fucked up friend in the group, you know?",2,depression

But presumably Poirot will tell the other suspects (Ackroyd's household) who the real killer was, or they will figure it out by process of elimination when they see that none of them is accused.

"Hello everyone hope your all feeling well
Could do with some advice to ease my mind with abdominal cramps but no other symptoms 
I'm 29/m from the UK
So in February I lost my job of 7 years which caused massive amounts of stress, started a new job pretty much the week after but the new job is very demanding and constantly end up doing 12 hour shifts, my eating schedule got really messed up and due to finishing late every day I ended up having fast food every day for about a month.
Along with at least 6 coffees a day to keep me going. 
In early March I started getting very light abdominal sharp pains, not enough to call pain but enough to notice, a quick massage of the area would see the pain disappear.  
2 weeks after I thought ild book a doctors appointment. Dr instantly said gastritis caused by stress/caffeine and use of Ibuprofen 
I've suffered with rheumatoid arthiritis since I was 9. Suspected ankolysing Spondylitis is a recent diagnosis from 2021. 
I was taking Leflunomide 20mg for around a year for arthiritis but stopped taking when the pains in my belly came.
Always taken Ibuprofen on bad flare days from RA and back pain but stopped taking those with the gastritis diagnosis
Anxiety levels have been crazy, not even wanting to get up to go to work most days.
Booked another appointment 4 weeks later as the sharp feeling was still present, it comes maybe 10 times a day and lasts a few seconds.
DR ordered a FIT test and a stool sample.
FIT test was negative for blood but feacal calprotectin levels were 427.
All blood tests are 'perfect' he says.
I've been reffered to gastro and have my appointment on the 1st of June.
My DR now says I have IBD as it could be linked with RA, but reading up most people with IBD have constant diarrhea 
At the time of my 2nd appointment I had a few weird looking mouth ulcers and alot of spots at the tops of my legs which have since cleared up.
Im 6ft and always weighed around 11.5 stone, I've lost half a stone over the last 3 months, but i have completely cut out fizzy drinks and started bike riding every weekend.
My stools have been pretty much normal over the last 3 months, with horrible diarrhea lasting 1.5 days only once after eating a pizza :S
I can sometimes go 2-3 days without a single pain or discomfort, but it always comes back

I don't get constipated, sometimes have small pebbles at the start but a normal stool follows

"[Tw, mentions of suicide and suicidal thoughts] 

I've been like this for almost eight years. Maybe longer. I don't know how far the thoughts go back. The pain. All I remember is one sunny day when I was eight years old. Sports day. The bullying. It all comes back in a rush. My mother didn't attend that day, and I was sitting in the shade of a tree, eating alone. Watching, as everyone ate with parents and friends, smiling and laughing. I remember the feeling in the pit of my stomach.

It was the same feeling when they found my diary that night. When my mom saw the words 'suicide' and 'death' written in bright blue glittery ink. I wonder what she though of me. I still remember the look on her face. I don't think they cared as much as they said they did back then. After all, from there on out, it only got worse.

It never goes away. Never wavering for a second. It's always there in the back of my mind. It's left its mark as scars on my skin and a plauge inside my brain. Why does it have to hurt so bad? And then there's the numbness. I can't tell which ones worse. Feeling nothing, or feeling everything, all together, all at once. 

It keeps me up at night. And it's so hard. So fucking hard to make it to the morning. Blasting songs over my headphones until the sun rises, keeping the meds locked up and the blades hidden. Sometimes I just pace about in the hall, hoping not to wake anyone. I ponder it over and over. If I want this to end, I know I have to end everything all at once. It'll never go away if I don't. I reason with myself that it'll only get worse, like it always does. And I don't want to stick around long enough to see what worse looks like.

I get to writing the notes like I've done so many times before. And then I open the box. I keep my notes. Every one I've ever written. My sister tried to bin them once. Told me that it's what's keeping me sick. That and my dirty room. Those are the causes of my misery. She also tried to sell me a few of her old crystals under the guise that they would 'cure my depression' too so I'm not entirely sure how credible her advice is.

I could never get rid of the box. It means something. It's kept me alive. In there, is every birthday card. Every badge, every note, every plea with the universe, every memory starting from the day I turned 13. Its both a blessing and a curse. But I am a keeper. I keep things. I have folders filled with screenshots of messages my friends have sent me. Some current, some from people in my past. It's a reminder.

You mattered to someone once. Maybe one day, you can matter again. I keep train tickets and notes and all these little unnecessary things. Its a reminder. The sky looked pretty that day. You got a really fuckin good milkshake from the McDonald's at that train station. Your teacher wrote a note home to talk about how amazing she thought you were that one time when you were like, nine. All these things. Just unnecessary little things that I cling to. It's hope.

My hope comes in the form of collected rocks and faded sea glass. Bottle caps and scraps of paper filled with doodles and smiley faces. It comes in the form of pink and green scribbles, courtesy of the artistic talent belonging to my younger siblings, paintings of how it was. Pictures of what it will be. My hope comes in the form of little items that would often be discarded. And I cling to them so desperately. 

It's another one of those nights. The ones where my medication makes everything so much harder. Where all I crave is the end. If I close my eyes I can almost see it. A endless void filled with serenity and dotted with stars, the perfect kind of silence swallowing me whole as I dispute from the body I inhabit. Oh to be free. But then I remember my friend. My siblings. 

Oh what I would give to be able to slip peacefully in my sleep without causing them pain. What I'd give to let go, to end this fight I have no chance of winning. But I won't. Not until I'm sure they don't need me anymore. Not until I know they'll be okay. It's hard. All I want is to be gone. How am I supposed to argue with that? It would make my life so much easier. All I'd have to do, would be to end it. But it wouldn't make theirs easier.

And if it hurts them, then I guess my freedom will have to wait.",2,depression

I have no motivation to start anything. I just want to get my projects done and sit in my room all day, but I can't, I still have 4 weeks to go for this semester.

It's most likely depression and burnout, but I don't know how to make it go away. I want to start making projects again, but the thought of making people dissapointed in me again is just too much, so I end up procrastinating everything.

How can I make myself feel better? I have several tasks I need to do for the next few weeks so I can't go on a vacation or something. How do I regain my motivation?

I'm on methylpenidate, very low dose, and I take an anti-anxiety meds occasionally.",3,adhd
"So, I finally signed up for therapy and talked to my doctor about getting on anxiety/depression medicine. I'm 34 years old and have been letting anxiety control me for my entire life. I just burned a bridge with the girl who just broke up with me because I have a lot of trouble with a lack of communication. In reality, she probably needed space. Looking back, relationships, friendships, work, school, everything has been negatively affected by my constant worrying, needing reassurance, scattered mind, etc. I'm excited to finally try and take control of my life again. I'm scared to be put on medicine but I know it will be better in the long run.  
  
I'm here for any advice, conversation, anything to help me get through the next step in this.

I’m 15 in high school and I’ve just sent my freshman year/ last year with my older sister we attended the same school with her being a senior and me being a freshman. In a month she is shipping out to basic training and I’m just really scared because she’s a big role in my life. She’s always pushed me to achieve my goals and to never give up.i literally remember staying after school with her for her volleyball games and practice just watching her play and helping her out I enjoyed those moments with her. She would stay after school with me while I’m at my track practices and always wish me luck on all my meets and tell me how I can accomplish anything. And she’s literally leaving soon and I’m just so happy for her but so sad that I won’t be able to see her again until a year or two later. At first I was fine since she wasn’t going to be active be now that shes decided that she is going to be active now and wants to travel which I love that for her but I just won’t be able to close to her anymore and it’s just so frustrating because she’s always there for me and now she won’t be around anymore.,4,anxiety
"TL:DR at bottom!

So long story short, I’ve been treated for anxiety, depression & ADHD w/ trauma from age 13 to 22. Then there was a gap in my treatment due to constraints in my life at the time & I was only on medication. Then by the age 23-24 I started seeing therapists along with meds & finally found a therapist who I can say has helped me over all of these years.

So the past Few year I’ve been treated for PTSD primarily by therapist and anxiety, depression, ADHD by psyche/providers with meds. 

Over the past months of my treatment, I’ve gotten a recommendation to have neuropsychological testing & there’s suspicions to rule out schizophrenia.

My therapist has had an opinion of seeing I should do the testing because there may be other factor beside psychological that’s causing me difficulty in my life.

I’ve gathered they suspect I may have either Bipolar or Schizoaffective, or Schizophrenia. 

I’ve been on multiple medications over the years (10 - 20+ meds), and I’ve remained on: Adderall & Valium for several years. Rx’d Ketamine 6 months ago also which has been helpful. 

I’ve also dealt with Rx opioid/benzo addiction in my teen years, used weed & triggered severe paranoia for months and fear of drugs before I started taking meds & those Rx’a from off the street basically.

I’ve dealt with substance abuse for the past year after taking meds prescribed for about 2-3 years straight a year ago. So started up again with other substance/manners starting one year ago. 

I’ve added Kratom into my regimen for one year now. Around that time I also started taking extra Valium at times but not how I did years ago (80mg - 120mg years ago versus 5mg to 30mg some days now.)
Adderall which I don’t find very recreational, but still have taken an extra pill sometimes (years ago I did not abuse this med at all). Phenibut added in about 1 week ago.

I’ve gotten prescribed clonidine & trazodone a week ago to work towards stopping Kratom, stabilizing my Valium dose and eventually tapering/using as needed. But my life has genuinely been so controlled & move to another state in about 2 months. It’s been difficulty tapering with the treatment I get in work & the dynamics I’m working on in my marriage that are hurting me psychologically (no physical abuse thankfully). 

I’ve been able to maintain my career for these past 4 years, but struggling mentally versus my teen years in addiction –I could not find a way to function without opioids & benzos during that time compared to now.

So I am scared because I envision myself being on different meds like antipsychotics, mood stabilizers; the idea of being misdiagnosed and becoming worse. Being treated in a different manner by everyone. But I am open to being tested for these conditions to be logical & reasonable because I know becoming mentally stable is a good thing and working through the fear of getting better treatment could help change my life for the better. I do not feel comfortable with changing my regimen to new meds and completely stopping certain substances I’ve mentioned, but I’ll work on reducing my frequency of abusing meds. I am completely open to stopping substance abuse when I move & balancing my current meds, but I am still afraid of making changes to my meds and being on mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, etc.

TL;DR:

I am afraid of being diagnosed with bipolar, schizoaffective or schizophrenia with further neuropsyche testing because of antipsychotic, mood stabilizers, and med changes + potential misdiagnosis.

"Im 30yrs old and i spent the majority of my life wishing for death and it became normal to me. Around 25yrs old i had nothing to lose and took about 7g of mushrooms praying for salvation... sure enough about a week after and till about a month ago i was completely absolved of depression. Still got sad and anxious like normal but the depression was gone.... im summarizing heavily because i honestly just want to get this out because im disgusted with myself and the healthcare system and its 1am and dont know what to do.... anyway i had a mental break the birth of my latest child, i was under a lot of stress and phycosis took hold. I knew it was stress related but i let doctors help and gave benefit of the doubt. They slapped me on sertraline even tho i made it clear i wasnt depressed and that i didnt want to risk the one fucking saving grace i managed to get lucky on.

"during the daytime, i am almost never paranoid at all. as soon as it gets dark outside, it’s about 9 or 10 pm, and i’m no longer around people is when i begin to get very paranoid, especially when i’m outside or near a window or open closet (i get very afraid something will sneak into my backyard and hurt me, or i will see a face or person outside my bedroom window or inside my closet). my paranoia typically increases in the night after i’ve watched a true crime or paranormal video earlier in the day, but is still there either way.

during night, im not always sure what im scared of, it changes. sometimes itll be something paranormal, like the fear that some sort of ghost or demon will appear in my room. other times i’ll be nervous a human murderer will break in while i’m sleeping. or worst of all, it could be a person already in my room, hiding under my bed or in my closet unnoticed, even though i typically check those places before i sleep just to make sure theres no one. 

looking back, i think i’ve always dealt with some paranoia, even though it’s only gotten worse recently. for example, one time when i was around ten i went several months sleeping on one specific side because for some reason i was scared a tiger would break into my room?? another time when i was older, i stayed up for hours one night because i was convinced that there was someone in my kitchen, and the water near my bed was empty so i was so thirsty i couldn’t sleep. i don’t remember much of my childhood, so i cant really think of any other instances of this right now. (sorry if this seems unrelated, just trying to give as much information as i can.)

i’m not sure what the cause of my paranoia is. i’m almost certain my poor sleep schedule factors into it (i typically go to sleep at 11pm and wake up at 6:30am), but i’m not sure if that’s the root cause, as i still get around 7 hours every night, and even more on weekends. i do get intrusive thoughts, but i don’t think those are bad enough to call it OCD. i do have a slight history of mental illness, but theyre the things more typical for a teenager, just an eating disorder and self harm and suicidal ideation. my family doesn’t have much history of mental illness, the biggest thing i can think of is my uncle who is homeless and extremely paranoid, but none of my other family is like that. i don’t even know if shit like paranoia even IS hereditary.

i have been working to try to go to sleep earlier (10pm so i can get 8 hours of sleep per night), but whats very frustrating is that when i go to sleep earlier than normal, i’ll almost always wake up in the middle of the night (anywhere from 1-5am), and this time period is when my paranoia is at its absolute worst. i can’t fall back asleep unless i listen to music, which is annoying because just the simple act of opening my eyes, sitting up, and pulling out my phone is terrifying and i’ll have to gear myself up for it for minutes before. after waking up in the middle of the night, i’ll be so overcome with fear that i won’t be able to open my eyes for fear that when i open them, a person will be right above my face, or i wont be able to close them for the same reason. even blinking is scary. i don’t experience any physical effects of my paranoia except for a fast heartbeat, so i don’t get sick from it or anything, though sickness does make it much worse because of how high my fevers get. the most annoying thing is how when i manage to fall back asleep, when i wake up i don’t even remember almost anything from the night before. all i remember id that i woke up early and that i was scared of nothing again. 

although being in the dark makes it worse, i can even get paranoid in a bright room, especially if theres a mirror in the room (since mirrors make me nervous about the idea of eyes appearing behind me in the mirror), or i’ll be scared of the shadows in my room, or my backyard will be lit from lights but if i hear a sound then i just have to go back inside, because of all the ‘potential dangers’ that could jump out at me from outside. the worst part is that i’m certain being on my phone so often only makes this worse, but sometimes my phone is the only thing that can distract me from my paranoia. i’m eighteen years old and had to check under my bed last night like an eight year old because of this. no amount of reassuring myself that everything is fine helps. i know there’s no danger but it doesn’t stop the fear. it’s only gotten worse recently, especially in the past five or so months. i can’t uncover my hand or leg from my blankets when i’m trying to fall asleep, i can’t go outside past 11pm without my phone, i can’t fall asleep without music unless i’m too tired to be scared. nothing seems to help. i don’t know what to do about this anymore. it’s not quite debilitating, at least during the daytime, but i’m nervous it will be at some point. help??",5,paranoia
"Hello, all! First, I’d like to offer my warm thoughts to everyone suffering with any migraines! 

To make a very long story short, I have recently been diagnosed with AMs after dealing with 5+ years of cyclic nausea, severe cramping/bloating, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding (sorry tmi), motion sickness, and fatigue. I have 3-5 days of relief out of the month.

I feel relieved to have a diagnosis, but saddened to find out how rare this condition is—especially in adults. Of course people around me have stopped showing concern after finding out my condition is functional (affecting the function of an organ rather than the physical tissue or structure). 

All my scans and blood work had good results, and I’m left fighting these symptoms with OTC relievers that barely take the edge off. I’m trying so hard to be optimistic, but it really sucks being in excruciating, ongoing, exhausting pain while everyone around me treats me like I’m being lazy. Some days the pain is so intense I can barely move or think clearly. On the days I can move I’m met with fatigue and motion sickness. 

Is there anyone else struggling with AMs, and what lifestyle changes or OTC products have you found to be helpful? Thank you for making it to the end of this post.💕",0,negative_samples
"Usually posting somewhere makes this issue worse. But I want someone to know what I'm going through because its weird and I don't know if this is severe paranoia or delusion at times. There is a woman in my brain, whether it be a separate entity or not. Whether she actually exists I dont know. I have severe OCD with constant compulsions. I cant enjoy anything without compulsions and Ive set up a while system. Were both in charge of my brain and when I do my compulsions I touch something three times. First time I say yes in my brain, second time is no, third is I don't know. Its always no because its usually something like ""do this or you will be punished, do this or someone you know will die, do this or whatever idk its a bunch of horrible shit."" I have argued with her and basically just had breakdowns saying ""STFU THIS ISNT REAL"" I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT. But every time I do this or ignore my compulsions something bad happens. IDK. EVERY TIME. I feel like this is genuinely real. I don't actually hear her bc I don't hallucinate. Either something bad happens (I don't want to say bc it triggers me to actually type it out) Or I feel like I'm outside my body (depersonalization, de realization) or I just feel high or like nothing is real. I feel like she is going to banish me into another dimension or Ill never see anyone I love again if I continue this. I don't know if I fully believe this , but sometimes I don't have the capability to think irrationally and sometimes I do think it is. It is ruining my fucking life and I want to end things. I mean the feeling high or outside my body could be anxiety but sometimes it happens when Im not even anxious. I keep seeing signs that this is real like after I argue with her or ignore a compulsion I see the word die or burn or i see fire or something in a youtube thumbnail or whatever. Ill hear sounds like banging immediately after I ignore it. Immediately. Almost every single time. Sometimes I have been like ""if I see the color red three times in a row its real"" And i have done it over and over again and its red. There are so many other examples. I dont know what to do. I feel like something bad is going to happen to me. I cant do online therapy bc its not fucking free or go in to in person therapy bc I have no money.

I literally have made up a whole system for this. I have to write S for sorry when I argue with her on a flat surface or say intrusive thought out loud whenever I have one so she doesnt punish me. She is a irrational person and I have to be the rational one so sometimes she could punish me without me even doing anything bad. Ive literally made this all up and never saw or or hear her but Im convinced its real sometimes? I dont know if its bordering onto delusion or not but this is ruining my life. Even making this post I feel like something bad is going to happen. ",5,paranoia

"I’m peri menopausal and have chronic migraine. Hormones have always been one of my biggest triggers so the last few years have been particularly difficult. I was doing really well the last few months. Trying some new treatments that were helping and because I hadn’t had a period in several months, things were looking up. Until last week, when I had what clearly felt like a hormone migraine that started last Sunday. And I thought, well, that was a good run, but here we go. The only thing is I never started bleeding. Everything else happened. The migraine, cramps, fatigue, nausea. All the symptoms that normally happen, but the period itself still hasn’t made an appearance. Which whatever. I wouldn’t care so much, except that it’s not ending. It’s been a week now, and I’m still having to take my abortive medications multiple times a day just to take the edge off. I’m waking up in the middle of the night having to take more. It’s miserable. I wish I would just either get the period and get it over with, or be done with the migraine. This never ending misery is exhausting. Has anyone else experienced this? And what worked for you to get through it? It has to end, right?

"I've tried literally every med available and nothing helped. I give up.

I don't know what to do man, I got official diagnosed about 3 years ago and have been testing different meds since. First it was Adderall 15mg XR, then 30mg when I didn't feel anything with the 15mg. The only thing I got for my troubles was insomnia for the first few days, a constant pressure on my chest, and a annoying lack of appetite. Then I took Vyvanse, it was more of the same, I felt nothing and the only thing different was that the side effects were more tolerable. Concerta came after that, god did I hate concerta. My brain simply didn't stop buzzing, it was as if I was listening to never ending tv static and I couldn't fall asleep until I literally collapsed from exhaustion, still no change that felt even somewhat helpful. 

After concerta I thought that maybe stimulants weren't the answer, so I started taking strattera. It took about a month for me to actually begin to feel the effects of it, but for the first time I actually felt something better, not just annoying side effects, but real help, and it only got better as the dosage was increased all the way up to 80mg, which as far as I'm aware is the standard dose for an adult male. Wanna know what happened next? IT GAVE ME DEPRESSION!

It started a bit after the 6 month mark, my mood kept getting worse and worse. Every day I felt there was less and less reasons to live, every day I hated ever being born. At first I chalked it up to the stress of school simply getting to me, I was wrong. I only understood what was really happening about a month after I started thinking these thoughts, to which I immediately stopped taking the meds.

It's been two months since then, and completely disheartened I decided to try one last med, Wellbutrin, an antidepressant and off-label ADHD med that I've been taking until today. By far my least favorite of the bunch. Worst case of insomnia of all of them. And the tremors, god the tremors. My hands NEVER STOPPED SHAKING. Feels like I have parkinsons for gods sake. It's not even that high of a dose, 150 mg, and guess what? Even now I feel no beneficial change.

I understand that these meds aren't a cure, that they're only supposed to help, but I haven't felt jack. Just side effect after side effect. And I'm tired of it. Honestly I'm beginning to doubt whether or not I even actually have ADHD after the failing of all of these meds. That maybe It really is just a horrible lack of self discipline. So I'm done with meds now, honestly not really sure where to go from here, just more of the same I suppose.",3,adhd

over 10 years receiving treatment and none of it has worked. I still despise myself to the point of physical revulsion. I still self destruct. I'm a fat piece of dogshit wasting air, recieving support I quite frankly don't deserve.

"

After years of struggling and a freshman year of college straight out of hell, I was diagnosed with ADHD on May 3rd, 2023. I was put on the medication Concerta on May 18th, it worked really well for about 3 days but now for the most part I've fallen back into my old ways. Being aware of this disorder is nice and it's good to know for once that I'm not just a pathetic lazy ass. 


But I'm still struggling bad. I guess I thought the medication would be a magic bullet but it's not. It was rather naive of me to assume that, but I'm a rather naive person in general so I'm not surprised. 

I've got a lot of goals and plans. I was in the habit of making a checklist of things to do every day but I never got all or even most of those things done so today I just kinda quit. I want to be normal so goddamn bad. I'm struggling to maintain the blog that could let me achieve my dreams of being a sportswriter (I actually got fired from a part-time writing job not too long ago because I wasn't putting out content enough). I'm struggling to maintain doing work around my house like I promised myself I would do this summer. I want to put myself out there and look for a loving relationship but I don't know if I am loveable. If I had a partner I feel like I'd make their life a burden. It's not just ADHD, it's Anxiety and very possibly (but not confirmed) OCD too. 


Growing up, I was told that my quirks made me special, and some of them did because they actually worked in my favor instead of against me. I used to think my wacky brain was a gift, but for the first time in my life it feels more like a curse. I wish I could just screw the top of my head off, take this brain out, and put in a normal one. What is it even like to be a normal person? I don't know, I don't even think I can comprehend it. It has to be a whole different world. 


I feel like I only have so much energy. Maybe I can hold down a job well, but my hobbies and relationships would suffer. Maybe I can do a lot of my hobbies, but my job and relationships would suffer, etc. I've tried for so long just to pull myself together and it seems like I not only fail but don't even get halfway.

I want to start by saying that I am a minor. My whole family is closed and frankly strange, it’s immediately clear that I went all in them, so I doubt that it’s an injury or something like that, it’s clearly genes.
I was in a psychiatric hospital, but it didn’t help me in any way, through an endless amount of tantrums, I learned to hide my emotions, and then I was released after 2 months.
I am still on pills, but they do not help, sessions with a psychologist too. Doctors do not understand why nothing works, and I have already ceased to believe in therapy.
I am very bad with social contact, every time I have contact with people (even now), I get wildly worried. For me, the most ordinary things like friendship, love or ordinary communication is something unimaginably difficult. I literally Googled ""How do you start conversations? How do you start dating? How do you end a conversation?"" and everything like that. I do not know how to conduct empty conversations, I literally have nothing to discuss with others. My voice is monotonous and lifeless, it is unlikely that people will be interested in listening to me.
I hate myself, I'm helpless compared to other teenagers, I have no interests (even what causes at least some emotions is very boring and turns into a routine almost immediately), prolonged depression and a year of apathy and, possibly, anhedonia (?)

Even when I was set up confidently and positively to win, it did not help anything, since then I consider every action a failure.

So to be clear, Siri said the name of this street at least 3 times and at least 3 different ways (correctly, stuttering, then hesitantly) and she sounded so much like a real person that I’m wondering legitimately if Siri has become sentient and is only pretending now to be my personal little helpful AI.

I literally have to force myself to eat because otherwise I simply never feel hungry, I’m having these episodes where I’m really sensitive to light all of a sudden. It physically hurts my eyes to be in the light, it’s a thousand times worse if I happen to be outside (or driving) sometimes during these episodes my vision even gets blurry.  They can last from a few minutes to several hours. After these episodes I’m always super tired to the point where I have to go home and take a nap.

"hey everyone, so I have been depressed ever since I can remember. I have extreme fatigue. I remember as a teenager I would just feel so tired and I would feel very guilty. recently, I went through a phase in which I was extremely suicidal, and my fatigue was just very bad. I was also working the night shift which made my fatigue even worse. Now I am trying to do more things during my days just so I am not in bed all the time . however, it is extremely rough. For example today, I took a walk with my mom in the morning, I did some laundry, and I went to target & ulta. Right as I was getting home, I couldn't take the exhaustion anymore. I had to lay Down for a little bit. my mom was in the kitchen cooking and I felt bad for her because she's doing all the work by herself. I wish I had the energy to help her around in the kitchen. I asked her if it was OK if I rest a little bit, and she said yes. Regardless, I still feel pretty guilty about not helping her out. later on today I have to go to therapy and a friend is coming over because I need to give her her birthday gift. this is a very busy day and I'm just exhausted. i have to be in bed by 9pm bc I work tomorrow early in the morning. I also wanted to review some work stuff. I mean it's good that im busy because I don't think about negative stuff but I'm just very exhausted. I have come a long way though because two months ago I couldn't even get out of bed and my mom would have to do my laundry. I feel so bad for putting my mom through this, so I helped by buying the detergent & softener for the clothes. I also bought groceries and pay for food. it's just I don't know how to stop feeling guilty when my body starts getting tired.

"My family never taught me how to deal with emotions. They don’t really show many emotions. They show neutral, fake happy, kinda happy and angry, no inbetween for any of them. Whenever I feel anywhere between any emotions, I don’t understand how to deal with it. 

But even anger, I just don’t get it. I get angry, I feel like breaking things and slamming things, the only thing that can really calm me down is throwing thick books on a hard floor (like paperback dictionaries) but all the floors in my house are carpeted and my parents would get mad at me if I did that.

I was angry earlier and so I threw a book and several pens across the room as hard as I could, waiting to hear a loud enough noise to where I knew that I hit something hard enough, but they were all stopped by or landed on soft things such as my clothes and carpet, so I stood in the middle of my room trying to break my clothes instead. I grabbed the neck of the clothes I’m wearing at the minute and I started kinda aggressively pulling it against the back of my neck as hard as I could. I could hear the cracking of the fibres and the tag came off but I still wasn’t happy or calm, so I cried. 

I’m also sick of being told that I don’t know what certain things feel like. My parents keep telling me that but they have no idea what I’m feeling because I stay tucked away in my room when I’m at home, I’m good at hiding when I’ve been crying (I don’t do it often but even when I do my face never really gets that red) and when I’m not in my room or if I’m out in public I put on a neutral face and sometimes a smile no matter how mentally drained and tired I am.

Person: “But you don’t look autistic!”

Me:I learned against my own will how to hide my entire being at a young age as a result of chronic, repetitive child abuse, emotional neglect, bullying, ostracism, and social isolation simply because l'm autistic that lasted for over a decade, causing me to involuntarily mask on a daily basis and become a bitter, confused dissociating mess of a human shell who for a long time believed that there was something horribly wrong with me as an existing human being and couldnt comprehend that I was just different and that there was actually nothing wrong with me and I never came to terms with it until early adulthood and that is why, my friend, I don't look autistic to you

Everyone, and I mean *everyone*, grew up and was harmed by the result of living in a society built for neurotypicals. Including our parents, family, and the other people around us in our everyday life. So, maybe, we shouldn’t vilify people and essentially call them *abusers* for not knowing how to help us in a neurotypical world.

Today I happened to notice one of his social media accounts is active again and the two have gotten married. I don’t use social media much and it never really impacted me negatively but but seeing this brought up so many hard emotions.

What if the people around me get sick of me and leave me?

In summary, I think one can conclude: being “busy” appears to be a better alternative for coping with depression than just being sedentary - but does NOT guarantee happiness. Some say it’s just a distraction from thinking, and a few others say it has either helped them get through everyday life while living with depression or know someone else who has expressed and admitted this. Many of you, including myself, say it’s hard to always be busy because the symptoms of depression make it incredibly challenging to do so. However, I’ve also gotten several practical responses to how I can incorporate more quality activities in my life that are realistic for me and even offer a perspective I hadn’t considered before. Maybe the the goal isn’t to spend every waking hour doing something to avoid thinking, but instead, choose a few activities that give you some meaning to your life.",2,depression

Is that something that happens in the moment or is it in a constant state of being unregulated?
Is there a way to regulate it again for good?
Do I need to rest and reset or keep pushing through and putting myself in uncomfortable situations? Feels like I shouldn’t avoid stuff but also feels like my body needs a break.

"I have a great, musically talented, smart, funny kiddo. He will be 17 soon. His dad and I aren’t together anymore (about 5 yrs now) but we coparent well. We both have safe loving homes where he is 50/50. We tell him we love him all the time. I’d hug him if he’s let me but at his age he would prefer not. Oh well, fist bumps it is. 

I’ve noticed he’s been really angry/mopey for the last year and it’s gotten worse lately. And when he’s angry/annoyed everyone around him feels it. A short fuse with the dogs that he adores stomping around and short one word answers to questions…or no answer at all like he didn’t hear. The air is toxic. It worries me, and makes me feel like shit at the same time. But this isn’t about me…

His primary Dr recommended antidepressant a year ago which both he and his father were adamantly against. I was over ruled.  

He doesn’t like many kids at school. Says they’re assholes. I thought maybe he was getting bullied? We talked to his teachers and they said he could come to the office anytime he felt frustrated or bad in any way. He will never name names. 

I know he was getting teased about his weight. And for a few weeks I couldn’t get him to eat. That was scary. 

He’s decided he would like to change high schools for his final year. This may help? Or it may be the same ol same old. but I’m willing to try anything!  

He has no interest in doing anything fun with us. Laser Tag, a Summer Vacation of his choice, going to see a movie. He just says “Nah” and goes back to his room. 

He will not talk to his father or me about what SPECIFICALLY is going on. He said,  “Everything sucks and is annoying. Home, work, school I hate it all.” I asked him what I could do to make his home life better as I can control that. He had no specific requests. And I mean I’M WILLING to change anything I’m doing wrong. 

I would like him to go to therapy. And am open to getting him on antidepressants but, again, he has been very against it. It seems like he feels like he would be less of a “man”. Like it’s a sign of weakness to get help. This sucks! I didn’t raise him to shove down his feelings. It also doesn’t help, as I said previously, that his Dad, is against the therapy or meds too. 

Last night everything came to a head and we all talked. His dad said he should take two days to think about what he would like to do. And how we can help. If he doesn’t know what to do, that’s okay too. AND dad said that something needed to happen, like therapy, so he could be happy again. (So glad he said that!) I asked if he’s ever had thoughts of hurting himself and he said no. But is that the truth? 

Today my son said he would like to try medication. He will talk with his dad tomorrow about it. I wish he would do both talk therapy and meds (even for a short time) so he can feel happy again.

shaun had a bad childhood. and hes autistic with savant syndrome. his coworkers think little of him because hes autistic and constantly doubt everything he says. fast forward near the end of the episode and turns out he was right all along! and then repeat that for six seasons across anywhere from 18-22 episodes per season. another issue i have with it is the whole attitude of ""autism is a superpower!!"" that goes on through the show. for instance, because shaun has autism he can.. visualize things?? like, he'll stare off into space and information/diagrams of the human body appear around him? 😭😭

In last 3 months we received her diagnosis as well as my Dads diagnosis she is stage 4 but potentially candidate for surgery and Drs said will try for a cure but keep leaving things up in air and see how things go. My dad is Terminal at 69 . I’m exhausted emotionally with work and emotionally. My wife has been very snappy and pushy with me and how she wants things done around house . I get it , her whole life has changed no work all treatments appointments ect,  and scared to death. I’m just trying to keep it all together make sure she’s happy has food she can will eat and keep home clean and not piss her off and be there for a hug when ever she needs it. But my patience has been wearing and when she snappy with me and over particular about the way I’ve done something I can’t help that I’ve been snappy back here and there last couple days .

After work I go home to my solitary room and either try to clean, or workout. Sometimes I'm so brain dead I do nothing but lay in bed.

"TW: panic attack  
Like the title says, I've recently been dealing with a sudden bought of anxiety the last handful of days which culminated in a panic attack (after almost 2 years without one) and I'm trying to figure out if it was the repetitive thoughts (worries about the future, etc.) or the fact that I've been under stress the last few weeks that caused it. I know it can be difficult to separate, but is there any way to know? I feel like I may be blowing the worries out of proportion, but because of the panic attack they do feel very real and concerning to me. It would be easier to write them off as illogical if I could just say it was just from a buildup of physical stress from other things. Thanks in advance.

"I have always had anxiety, but it’s always been because of specific things i.e. social events, public speaking, driving, confrontation. As soon as the task is complete, my anxiety is gone. However, I recently weaned off Bupropion under the supervision of my psychiatrist because it was causing random severe panic attacks and all day anxiety that would last weeks at a time with no clear trigger or cause. The first two weeks I was fully off Bupropion were magic. Clear thinking, no anxiety, no panic or paranoia. All of a sudden, the last two days I have been having the same simmering anxiety that just pokes at me all day and eventually turns into an anxiety attack in the afternoon/evening after work. I feel so discouraged because I thought that it was only an issue while I was taking Bupropion, and there’s is absolutely nothing I can think of that is causing it. It’s so foreign to me, to be struggling with anxiety like this. It affects my job, my free time, wears down my emotions. Any and all advice is welcome. I am already in therapy, and have helpful tips for when I’m having an actual attack, but I’m at a loss with what to do about the anxiety that seems to just sit quietly in my body, almost like it’s just waiting and biding time to attack. I don’t want to have the mindset that there is a singular solution, and I want to better equip myself in case this is something I have to just get used to.",4,anxiety

"Hi my name is lupe and I’m 18 from southern California (sorry about getting so much into detail) but i have a brother who is turning 31 on June and for about 3 years since 2020 in my eyes he wasn’t himself anymore.

For about 3 in a half so maybe years my brother has been dealing with paranoia, delusions, and thats really about it, and i have been telling myself this doesn’t look like schizophrenia maybe delusional disorder, bi-polar, something of that nature but basically he believes he’s being watched from every single device from my game console to his phone camera, the cable box, he believes he’s being watched when he gos out to do something, he also believes celebrities, the government and other different agencies are in on it, he names different celebrities to me who are watching him, he believes he’s the most influential person, he says “I’m bigger than social media” he believes different celebrities want to be intimate with him, it goes on and on.

The thing is that he doesn’t deal with hallucinations (auditory or seeing things), he doesn’t have disorganized speech, he doesn’t have psychotic tendencies unless it involves the delusion, like hell get mad if i don’t agree with what he tells me about these specific delusions, in his case all of these beliefs are reality.

Its been hard dealing with this for 3 years especially since i live with him, i feel like i don’t know him anymore at some times, he was completely normal until boom he snapped in 2020, and now he’s just this now. Theres so much more detail that i can get into but its a lot to explain but i hope some of you people get the gist and have insight.

Me and my sister don’t have any mental health disorders, well i have ADHD and anxiety but i feel like thats common i was diagnosed when i was in elementary. But other than that my uncle does have severe trauma from jail which may have caused him to have a mental health disorder but my biological mom had 3 kids with 3 different dads so i have a different dad my brother has one and so, my grandmother says we don’t have schizophrenia in our genes as well, somethings i get scared ill end up like that, but at the end of the day i wanna live my life.

So i wanna conclude this on i hope you guys can give some insight on this, i also want to include that my brother has been through severe trauma like being ran over by a car at a very young age, doing narcotic drugs frequently like Xanax,Percocet’s, lean, pretty much ODing on them, also he got a yeast infection due to having intercourse with another girl, he also start smoking since high school until now but he stopped once he started to get like this due to panic attacks.

"Hi all, 
I have been having GI issues for 3 years. I am in my early 20s. The past year has gotten worse - resulting in over 40 lbs of unintentional weight loss, some of the worst diarrhea and stomachaches I’ve ever had, and started approaching starvation from lack of appetite. 

I finally decided to see a GI doctor. We did blood tests, and she decided to skip the stool tests altogether and go for an endoscopy + colonoscopy combined. 
My vitamin D was the only thing abnormal, at just about 10ng/ml, so a clear deficiency. My scopes are mid June. She prescribed me sublingual hyoscyamine for the meantime until my scope as well as a vitamin D supplement. 

Hyoscyamine has increased my appetite somewhat I will say, but has been lacking in what it is actually supposed to do. It dulls the average stomachache a good bit and will somewhat harden stool, but the bad cramping/wateriest diarrhea are too much for it. I am still struggling with extreme cramping and profuse watery stools 1-3 times a week after popping a sublingual tablet. I will take it preventatively some days even and it still will not help. 

Where I am concerned is if scoping and everything ends up being a waste of time and I just have IBS. I am an identical twin and my twin does not share the same GI issues. Sometimes they do have some run-ins with the ‘’runs’’, but it’s not a consistent thing like mine is. My doctor did say it was a bit more unlikely for me to have an IBD if my twin doesn’t have IBD symptoms either. I know most cases of IBD are genetic, but is it possible I could be unlucky with an environmental/lifestyle cause?

I’m just curious and at a loss of what to do. In a lot of pain and weak and tired. 

Thanks everyone.

Running late is a huge issue for me and I’m in control of it so it’s extremely frustrating. Sometimes I feel like I’m living the same morning over and over again…didn’t get up for first alarm, running late, can’t find shirt, no gas, slow moving car in front of me, etc. The flight mode is so strong when I’m late and it takes a toll on the whole day, and my attitude towards myself.

"TL;DR: Lot of sad shit happened to me and while I was positive for most of it, this week I suddenly became more sad and suddenly lost care for a lot of things and lost enjoyment in everything. Do I have depression or am I just going through a tough time?

Before I start, I am unsure if this is the subreddit I should use. I am new to reddit and looked up ""depression"" to talk about this. If there is a better place to ask this or if this ain't where I should, just tell me. So, the last 2 months have been nothing but a nightmare for me. It started when my parents started arguing a lot, and then later, I found out they are planning to get a divorce. My dad is heartless about it and being an asshole to my mom while my mom is crushed, feels lonely as hell, and has been going to my sister and I for emotional support. Then a few weeks of this and I start to feel sad, and I got less affectionate with my gf because of my sadness. My gf then dumps me, saying she ""hasn't loved me for a few months and tried to regain love for me by herself"" which I felt odd about but was too heartbroken by the fact I lost my gf of 1 year to think about it. I later found out she actually cheated on me with her roommate and told me to hide his and her shame for it. For the most part, I was taking it all well. I was trying to stay positive, and I started exercising. But then suddenly I started to feel worse in a subtle way. I stopped caring about things as much, and I lost enjoyment in my hobbies. Then this week starting Monday, after a bad day at work when I fucked up a lot of things I went home and realized how awful I was feeling and cried myself to sleep that night. Each day I started feeling worse and worse. My sister has depression, and when I talked to her about how I was feeling she told me I might have depression because she's experienced what I'm feeling before. I don't want to believe I have depression because I've been known as the friend and family member who comforts everyone else, I don't want to be seen as the one who needs comfort because I do enjoy making people happier. I told my sister that everything recently is probably just catching up to me. Do you guys think I actually have depression, or am I just dealing with a lot at once?",2,depression
" I've suffered most of my life with low self-esteem and issues with my voice and how I sound (I perceive myself to have an annoying-sounding voice)  
I share a wall with my neighbour and sometimes we hear each other. However, I hear my neighbour complaining about me.   
Unfortunately, I suffer from depression and low mood - I sometimes can get somewhat anxious and scared even at home, and I react by trying to be quiet and speaking as quietly as possible. But this doesn't work!! My neighbours then, in turn, think that because im timid/quiet I Im acting like that because they think that, I, think like they (neighbours) are spying on me.    
For the record, I dont think that my neighbours are spying or listening to my conversations but I do suffer from low self-esteem and depression so when I do talk I get nervous about receiving criticism about my annoying sounding voice.   
Its energy-sapping, having to tiptoe around my house just because Im living next door to neighbours who dont like me. I'm already depressed but it feels like being kicked when im down.  Im too poor to move but wish I could.  


TLDR

"I can't lie, I'm pissed at my parents for not getting me diagnosed. My dad was a special ed teacher. I didn't speak until I was three, yet they had no issues with it, I guess. I lived my whole life not knowing why I was so stupid and couldn't fit in. To this day, I legitimately suspect my IQ is in the low 80s because of how much I've struggled and how little I feel I understand. 

I didn't speak till three. I didn't walk till around then, too, even though I was fully capable. Had meltdowns when an interruption to my plans occurred. Sensory issues aplenty. Special interests that encompassed me. Unintentional rudeness. Crazy emotional attachments to objects. I once rooted through the garbage to rescue a nasty sweat-stained pillow and hid it from my parents so it wouldn't feel sad. Gullibility. Chewing on my hair, rotating my wrists. Not looking people in the eye. Repeating words ad nauseum. Sometimes I'd literally repeat a word for ten minutes straight if I was terrified. Couldn't understand sarcasm unless the tonal change was obvious. I literally can't wear my glasses for too long, or looking at everything will give me sensory overload. I have to keep my hair short to a old it, too. Every single adult in my life and almost everyone my own age agreed I was eccentric and different. Comorbid disorders. Hell, I even have the GI issues positively correlated with autism. I DIDN'T SPEAK TILL THREE! And my parents thought that was totally normal, I guess! 

When I was 19, I nervously brought up autism to my psychiatrist, who immediately said, ""Oh yeah, you definitely have it"" and proceeded to disect my childhood behaviors and explain all the autistic traits. I'd be much more skeptical of his confidence if I hadn't basically grown up with him (he'd been my psychiatrist for seven years). Plus, he's good at what he does, and was the psychiatrist in charge of an acclaimed residential treatment center (he might still be, I dunno). When I had to get a new psychiatrist, she was more experienced in autism and again, was absolutely sure I had it.

This sounds like everyone clapped at the end, but I've had people kinda watch me while I'm working or something, and they'll say, ""You're autistic, right?"" before proceeding to tell me about how their nephew totally does that thing I do. 

People, ESPECIALLY women and trans people, fall through the cracks that you'd think would be obvious all the time. Because of my parents' incompetence, I've felt like a foreigner in my own country for twenty three years. I've assumed myself to be brainless and sociopathic. I wanted more than anything to know why I was such an awful kid. 

Even now, I'm not sure I want to pursue an official diagnosis. That'd be, like, $1,000 bucks. I don't have that kind of money. I'm scared shitless my parents would find out. I can legally be paid less than minimum wage in the USA, where I live.

And that's if I'm diagnosed. I might not be because I'm fully verbal and have had to train myself to be articulate and hyper vigilant to social cues because I was abused if I was anything else, and I've heard too many horror stories of women getting denied a diagnosis because they can smile or have graduated middle school or have a boyfriend or are female. You want me to pay $900 for a 65% chance that some balding white dude will take one look at me and go, ""Well, you have a boyfriend and had a job, so no""? You want me to try again with another thousand bucks to be denied again because ""Well, you've been to college"" or something equally stupid.

But this group of people constantly insist i’m wrong instead of taking 2 seconds to listen to my perspective, and in the rare chance that i can actually convey what i mean correctly and adequately, they do admit i have a point. But i always feel like i have a point and before i can correctly explain it, they’re already making fun of me or just dismiss it entirely.

I know at the end of the day nobody has an ego and everyone involved has the power to be convinced, i just feel like i’m constantly having to explain myself and nobody ever takes time to give a piece of mind to my perspective, i feel like it’s always constantly dismissed. I’ve found that in other social situations people do like my thoughts and ideas, so I feel like I have built up enough reputation to have confidence; but in others i feel like they’re totally dismissed purely because i can’t ever convey it correctly.

And to clarify, unfriending them is not an option. This is intrinsically a problem with me and i don’t know how to handle it. Thank you",3,adhd

"Hi everyone!
So i have suffered from anxiety for many years now and i usually fell into anxious thought cycles that i struggled to get out of and these caused sometimes physical symptoms as well (especially i felt a pressure on my throat). The anxiety was much better until few months ago, where i’ve started getting physical symptoms of anxiety (feeling dizzy, feeling like i can’t get enough air & being hyper aware of my body) randomly and without them being triggered by anxious thoughts (after i get these symptoms i start worrying whether it is normal though). I am struggling to cope with these symptoms and breathing techniques make it somehow all worse…
Any advice to how to manage these symptoms and whether it is normal that they come without anxious thoughts? Thanks!",4,anxiety

I know I tend to feel extreme crushes for the first girl that shows me the minimum of attention or affection, and I'm sick of that, I want to form more healthy relationships with friends and posbile partners, but honestly I don't know how.

"Throughout my entire life I've had a lot of issues with socializing, anxiety, and confidence. I developed a stutter around age 6 that probably reached moderate levels of severity as a young kid but over time it improved significantly to the point where it doesn't usually affect my life or make people notice at all. Even though it improved I think it contributed to me having a lot of self-esteem issues and probably stunted my social development and I still worry about stuttering even now. Adding to that while I think I grew up in a great home I had an extremely competitive and ambitious older brother who clearly had some narcarssistic tendencies. We argued constantly growing up and I didn't live up to the expectations that I perceived as being set on me as a child by him. I was also just a lazy child and didn't really care about extra-curriculars and I was always an outcast on sports teams and I would spend most of my free time just playing video games so I think I missed out on a lot of opportunities to learn what it's like to be a part of a team and community. All of these I pinpoint to my social and self-image development being really stunted and at 25 it feels like I'm really far behind and in a lot of aspects I'm lacking on a lot of what I want in life and my youth.  
  
I have really bad social anxiety and it's always been that way to some extent or another. One of my earliest memories is from when I was around 10 and I was playing catch with my best friend at the park and a group of kids from our school showed up and were doing whatever and my friend wanted to join them. I really didn't want to go because I was afraid of being made fun of so I told my friend to go and I left and went home. In early high school I gained a bit of a reputation for being a weird kid and I was so afraid of being bullied that I felt that my reputation was unfixable (it wasn't) and the best course of action would be to just hide in obscurity as much as I can and not make waves so people would leave me alone. I was basically never invited to parties and I didn't go to any grad events in my senior year except for prom, the grad ceremony, and the convocation (so I didn't go to the annual grad campouts, the boat party, the end of year parties, none of that). I've really only been to a few parties and whenever I do go I have almost insurmountable anxiety.  
  
It's funny looking back at high school because despite all this, I actually had a decent amount of friends, or at least people that could've been friends if I tried harder. I would still joke around with people all the time in class in my later years, my senior yearbook is filled with funny comments and inside jokes, I had a ton of people that I'd talk to regularly at school and online, but I never really saw any of them outside school except for a few. I guess I just didn't really think they'd be a friend and I never pursued. The only friends I made in high school that I kept long term are people that did pretty much all of the heavy lifting at the beginning. I would almost never be the first one to say that we should hang out.  
  
And I never really learned how to make friends. I went to a community college after high school and never had any interest in the limited social aspect of it. I went to a big university after a few semesters and completely failed in the social department. I didn't meet a single person that I considered to be a friend. I went to a few study meetups but that's it for social meetings with people from school. Never went to dorm or frat parties (huge regret). I worked in a restaurant off-campus and would drink with my coworkers, almost none of whom were students. I liked my roommates but I knew almost nothing about them. I never knew how to get into that social community at university. I was too nervous to ask anyone to hang out outside class or the dorm room because I was nervous about stuttering and sounding like an idiot.  
  
I only have 2 people that I would consider friends and honestly? They're shit friends. One of them has really horrible drug and alcohol abuse issues and all he ever wants to do is binge drink and watch movies in his basement and the other just never wants to do anything interesting. I love him but besides going to a hockey game in December I can't remember doing anything memorable with him for years. I've brought him to my family's summer place every year for years now and while I'm glad he comes after a while all it ends up being is he and my brother taking every opportunity to get on my nerves and I just want one of them or both to just leave. We used to be so much closer - us three called ourselves ""the dynamo"" and along with their girlfriend's or mine when I had one that was our friend group. I remember my awesome 19th birthday, the barhopping night right before I left for vietnam, the awesome day we spent together right before one of them left on a long trip, us staying up all night and sneaking out until 6 AM in high school, going to the driving range, the bike rides into the forest, the camping trips, going snowboarding, going longboarding around town, all with them. But all of that is so long past and I don't think either of them want to do those anymore. This is different than in high school when I didn't realize that there were people I could've made solid friendships with. At this point there's really nobody I would consider as somebody that I would see on a regular basis recreationally.  
  
There was a point where life was really good. Second year of college I meet this girl at work and she's clearly very into me. After a month of flirting I ask her out and we embark on a 2 year relationship. That relationship flourishes, my friends and I are all still together, I'm going out and making memories, I'm losing weight, I go on a trip to vietnam, my confidence is improving greatly. I fucked that relationship up and I gradually lost contact with my friends and were never really the same with them since. It just sucks looking back and thinking about the time when I had a vibrant social life and real connections with people and comparing it to what little I have now. Now all I really am is an overweight line cook making a shit wage at a restaurant I don't care about with 0 skills or network gained through a 4-year degree with terrible and unresolved social anxiety issues, 0 good, close connections with people outside my family and can't get passed the first date on those frustrating dating apps. It makes me feel like such a loser.  
  
It really sucks because deep down I really think I'm just like everybody else. I have the same interests as tons of other people my age and I'm a nice guy who loves to laugh. I love following sports and going to shows and going out at night just like everybody else but I don't feel apart of any community at all. I know that somewhere there's a version of me that can flourish socially because I've been that before. I'm just so anxious about everything and have such low self-esteem and it's been that way ever since I was a kid and I hate it. I really, really don't like the fact that I'm me. I feel almost embarrassed that other people get to be themselves and I was unlucky enough to be me. I'm not happy with it at all. I really just want to be normal and happy but it seems so far away. I'm 25 now and I'm wondering if I'm just completely screwed, like I fucked up during a critical period of social development and I'll never be the person that I was supposed to be.",2,depression
"Like the title says, I drove 4 hours away from my city to hangout at my friend's house for a few days.

I'm so fed up I feel like I'm starting to spiral into ADHD paralysis. All she does is sleep in until 2pm, watch TV, smoke bud and then goes to sleep. I've literally sat on a couch for 2 days while I wait for her to wake up and get ready and then we just watch whatever she wants on Netflix for a few hours until she passes out again.

She instantly shoots down any idea I have whether it be an activity to do or even just something I want to watch on TV. I'm so understimulated and bored I've been doing her laundry and cleaning her kitchen to do anything besides just sitting.

She's ""having a quick nap"" again and then wants to go see her friends at a bar if she even wakes up. I honestly don't even want to go anymore. She's just going to talk over me the entire time and I'll probably end up getting upset, start drinking to much and end up embarrassing myself.

Idk, don't have anyone else to vent to. Thanks for listening to me.

Edit:
Thanks for the responses everyone. We were very close friends in highschool and she's the only person I've really kept in touch with through the years. I appreciate everyone showing your concern for her mental health, but this is kind of how it's always been. We used to smoke a lot in highschool and I just don't think she's outgrown that phase yet. All we really do is talk about our mental health and problems and she is legitimately doing so much better than she has in the past. I hope I didn't come off like I wasn't concerned about her.

Edit 2: 
Wow, I didn't expect this post to get much attention. There's some more relevant information posted in the comments but I figured I'd add it up here as well so nobody misses it. She lives on a farm house out in the country. There isn't a whole lot to do alone, but I did end up driving to my old highschool to see what it looks like now.  

We were and she still is to an extent ""that kind of stoner"". She has a display cabinet for pipes, bongs and other paraphernalia. Has psychedelic art and 4/20 art all around her house. Has worked at multiple dispensaries. You know, she's just really into it. I obviously can't tell if there's something deeper going on she hasn't told me about. So it's hard for me to say I don't think she's depressed without sounding like an asshole... I just want to say I was with her when she caught her ex cheating. I've seen what she looks like when she's going through pain and I talked to her everyday the following months when she was very depressed. I've seen what it can look like for her and she doesn't seem miserable. 

Honestly, the more I think about it the more she seems like me before I was diagnosed, medicated and went to therapy for ADHD. A lot of what I see as her shooting down ideas could just be poor focus and her hyperfocusing on a TV show. We both made a pretty loose plan beforehand that should have been more solid.",3,adhd
"venting and vaguely looking for reassurance

I got my car towed and left at a shop and both the tow company and shop have shining reviews but when I got back into my car at the shop, I noticed my cup.holder lid was shut. I did not shut it. that's where my quarters were. they left 50 cents. it didn't hit til now. I don't really care about losing like $3 and maybe the person who took it needed it badly but my car was full of stuff and now I'm super fucking anxious and paranoid realizing they did indeed take my quarters and I'm home now and it's been a while since I noticed like it was yesterday that I saw that. and now I can't help wondering if they took other stuff. but as far as I know taking change out of people's cars is just something lots of car people do as sort of a self-tip so whatever, and also when we cleared out most of the car it didn't look like anything was missing. but there was so much stuff in there and now I'm super paranoid that they took something important to me and I'm not gonna remember until way later and I'm just so upset and so nervous like what if they're taking more shit rn. I think it was probably the tow guy though because he was the only guy who was alone and the shop was closed when he dropped it off and I think that'd make the most sense and I had the least interaction with him. I'd think that a high rated shop would not risk that or a person working with multiple other employees would not risk getting fired if they got caught. So I think it was the tow guy. I know nobody was there but this is the paranoia board so, do you guys think they took anything else.?????? did they???! do you think they took anything ?? I didn't notice anything missing but I really freaking wonder???? also no I am not entirely insane or having an episode I'm just being entirely transparent in my paranoid thoughts just to get it out bc I'm so distraught.

"Hello everyone, 

Yesterday first time in my life i got anxiety attack after smoking weed.
Ive been active smoker for 6+ years
Never had anything like this,
Ive had this very uneasy feeling in me 
And it pretty much stayed today aswell.
Ive felt like my life is worthless and i wont be able to accomplish anything.
I got so scared in my head cause i never had mental problems. This idea of having them scared very much. Im 22years old working low paying 9-5.
I dont have many friends and im quite alone. I really dont want to be anxious or worse - depressed. I thought maybe its because of poor diet or no vitamins? Maybe i can drink some supplements to feel better? Im currently taking magnesium. I will stop with weed for a while but is there a way i can feel better?",2,depression

"I’ve worked so hard on improving myself. I’ve gotten through and over PTSD and borderline personality disorder.

My life improved a lot.

But the one thing I kept going back to therapy for, was my inability to relate and connect with others. I’m extremely extroverted. the only time I’m truly happy is when I’m able to have a lot of people in my life, go to events, and meet new people. 

But I got diagnosed with autism, and suddenly everything made sense. 

No matter how hard I try, I just can’t connect with people. I easily meet new people; and then that’s just sort of it. There’s no click. I don’t really have friends. They don’t last. Ever.

I don’t have family. I’m the black sheep.

And sure, you can improve symptoms if autism, just like how plenty of people in wheelchairs can walk for a short amount of time and plenty can improve their life and work around it. 

But, if the one thing a person in a wheelchair loved to do is running: then what?

If I were introverted then this wouldn’t be a problem. But I can’t solve my problem. And anyone who knows me, knows that I’m always looking towards the future. I always come out fine. I always make it through. I’m extremely determined and optimistic. I’m always uplifting and always willing to work towards what I want.

But the one thing that makes me miserable, that gives me suicidal depression, is the one thing I can’t solve.

There is no working through autism to hopefully no longer be diagnosed with it. There is only so much you can improve with autism before you plateau.

There’s nothing I can do to help myself.",2,depression

Recently, I went on a trip and noticed that these intense thoughts were getting so much worse. The weeks leading up the trip i was obsessively imaging the plane crashing, and during the flight I really thought we going to crash several times. 
we were going to go kayaking, and my brain told me that i was going to flip over and wouldn’t be able to get back up or an animal was going to attack. We also went on a safari drive and through out the whole week i was almost hoping it would be canceled because every single day i convinced myself that we were going to be attacked by one of the animals. 

I can’t even step outside my house because my brain has told me that someone is going to hurt me. something is going to happen.

"Hey guys, I’m really struggling.  I read my path report Monday (tumor) and Wednesday got to hear it for the first time out loud by my surgeon, I’ve got cancer.  Meeting with an oncologist next Friday.  

I am now riddled with guilt for not telling my husband immediately, but I just don’t know how. I’m living in my head and overthinking everything.  I seem to be completely hung up on this step because it makes everything “real” and at the same time, I know very little information.

I’m 40f, no familial history of cancer. Pretty low contact with my parents.  I am in no way worried that my husband will leave me or be anything but supportive, I am scared that I’ll destroy him with the news and he’ll see cancer first, for the foreseeable future. 

Any advice, guidance, opinion will be appreciated from how you told your friends/family to how you would have like to have been told.  Thank you immensely

Update: hey y’all, thank you from the bottom of my heart for the incredibly generous words of support and advice, I feel all the love.  

I told him… it was awful but I feel so much better.  He is my human and we can do anything/everything together ❤️ he told me to stop saying I’m sorry, that he was sorry I had dealt w/ this in my mind without him. He wants to stay positive and absolutely go to my appointment next Friday. 

It kind of came out suddenly because I got a letter today stating I was being called for jury duty. Really? Like after my month? This was the worst news to date. I had already submitted a preselection juror survey that should have immediately removed me from the pool. He was worried about the dates (11 ish days in July on top of the 2 days in June) since I work night shift and don’t have a good medical reason to not serve. I just sort of stared at him. I told him the surgeon will sign it no problem. He disagreed.  I said well… we need to talk about that…

Lots of hugging and a few tears, but overall doing ok. He’s in shock. I told him he could tell whoever he needed to.. I’m here for him but it’s also really important to have people to talk to outside of us. 

Again, thanks for all the love & advice. I’ll probably update next week after the appointment. Side note, whoever said that “saying it out loud is the hardest” was dead on… it was a mind fck I wasn’t expecting.",0,negative_samples

I am lacking skills in all fields. I am sitting, frozen because I cannot stop hearing my coworkers tell me I drive them crazy, my handwriting is terrible, confusing, and being pushed out. I have no joy in life and I want to curl up and never wake.


I have therapy etc but that does not help when the world has no patience. I only get compliments on my appearance sometimes.  I get insulted everywhere else and I am unsure how anyone can survive. How am I even surviving when I have nothing to survive for? 


Anyways I have tics and my sister finally told me she notices these things.





Yes meds I have and yes I know my specific diagnosis (combined and complex with loads of chronic pain. )",3,adhd
I’ve noticed a lot of my paranoia is linked to my anxiety and when I get high stress in life but a constant one that I have regardless of my mood is that people that I’m texting can see me through my phone???? Even though I don’t have the ability to see them.. does anyone else experience this? It’s hard for me to bring up with people I know because I fear they will think I’m strange.,5,paranoia

"When I have a negative thought, I will sometimes involuntarily blurt out a word or a grunt or a sigh. I see the shock in people’s faces. It’s very embarrassing. It’s hard and even impossible to recover from it socially. It gets worse. I will also dissociate, seemingly black out for a few seconds, having no idea what I said; the blacking out happens once every couple of years or so. But it just happened again. 

I was recently with some new people in a social situation, and we were hitting it off great. Then at the end of the party, I seemed to a have ruined it. I was leaving the party and getting my things. There was a struggle to get my things together. I was exhausted. I remember struggling with my things but I don’t remember saying anything. Then someone asked me if I was ok. Everyone got quiet like the mood was killed. It’s a terrible feeling. I know I said something, but I don’t know what. I just left the party. 

I’ve been through therapy and I’ve done EMDR in the past. But I can’t seem to shake this issue. It’s really making me sad today. I just called a therapist who specializes in anxiety. It’s time to go back.

I do not take any anti-anxiety or anti-depression medication. Maybe it’s time to look into those again. It’s been over fifteen years since I was on medication for depression. 

I’ve been through some tough stuff that I won’t get into here. I guess it’s taken its toll. I hope help is around the corner. I feel pretty beat up right now. It scares me that I haven’t been able to stop this. It’s a helpless feeling.",4,anxiety
"Whenever I'm around someone physically I get fully convinced that they can read my mind or even change what I'm thinking but when I'm on my own these beliefs seem really... dumb. That'snothow brains work.. but still whenever I'm around anyone it's like I lose the ability to challenge these thoughts and that's scary as well and I just don't really spend any time with anyone anymore now, it's been going on for about a month now, I just stay in my room all day. My dad tries to get me to do things with him but being the horrible daughter I am I completely freak out at the thought. I don't want to push him away and I tell him this in text messages all the time but it's like I lose myself when it actually comes to it. Please how do I push myself to not be like this. I love my dad I hate to do this to him.",6,schizophrenia
"I’ll be turning 31 and I intend to take two scarves, combine them and hang myself in the forest. 

I have nobody to talk to about my feelings anymore (I used to see a nurse every week but because her workplace is understaffed, I haven’t seen her in over s month now). 

I’m collecting disability benefits because I’m unemployed. I want to work but I have too much baggage to that, namely extreme social anxiety, OCD, depression and agoraphobia. 

I’m paralysed by my past and I’m struggling to move on. The past includes bullying, extreme humiliation in public spaces and hundreds (literally) of failed job interviews. 

I don’t have anyone in my life whom I could call a friend. 

I’m still a virgin. I can’t fend for myself because I no longer see the point of

"I'm not going to lie, I've read the book and seen the movie many times (there are differences between it) but I never knew if Amy really loved Nick or not?

First, Amy is a sociopath, I am not a psychiatrist, but what I do know is that sociopaths are incapable of love, they enter into relationships if there is benefits behind it (correct me if I wrong), but in the movie Amy did some things that baffled me, such as:

- Pretend to be a ""cool girl"" in order to impress Nick.

- Buy him a bar.

- Moving in with him to be with his dying mother, giving up everything.

- Most importantly, her face as she listens to Nick's interview on TV, killing Desi to go back to Nick, and telling him ""I killed for you.""

So, why did she does all this? Why did she come back to him in the first place? Is it because she really loves him or for some other reason?",0,negative_samples

"idk if this is going to get me anything remotely positive, but i finished college in 2019 (i live in the uk, so i was done at 19, didn't go to uni and still not really committed to the idea). i'm 22 now, i'm 2 years single from a relationship i fucked up horribly but ultimately grew from (not getting into that) but feel like i'm stuck. all of my irls are at uni, and ""all"" being 2 people. i don't have any real life friends, at all. all of my closest friends are online and live 6hrs ahead of me, i don't have any hobbies outside of playing video games all day and occasionally when the executive dysfunction fucks off i have moments of productivity with some very very small amounts of independent voice work.

jobs aren't hiring me, i can't seem to get anywhere with career advice and i just want some kind of change. i'm well aware that change has to come from myself, i have to want it and actively put myself in uncomfortable situations but the stress from the mere idea of it is so physically exhausting it causes me to just stay in bed all day.

i used to have a slightly better friend group, with the only positive really being that we were all in the same timezone, and 2 of them were irls. but they're all gone now and i have had to move on. 

idk, this is kind of just a rant ig? a very sad public one and i'm wondering if anyone else feels the same. i hate that the main way to ""get friends"" is to go out drinking or clubbing, which i'm just not comfortable with. i feel like i've driven everyone away from me. maybe i'm a bad person who hasn't really changed much after all??

"As a example, there is a (mostly dusty and unused ) drum machine box unit on the desk here, and for some reason it cracks and makes a loud clicking noise every now and then. More like a snapping sound sound than a click. It is right in front of me so it makes me jump everytime. What then happens is a short lived sense or feeling of elation, for several seconds. Every time. Noises arise elsewhere and there is a psychiatric building just beyond the back garden and the same thing. It is a lovely and professionally run place but the sudden noises that arise does make me jump sometimes.

As i type i am trying to think of some relevance to adhd, otherwise this is pointless waffle. Maybe serotonin, or endorphin is it, neurochemical release is somehow not dissimilar to this. Which i think might help explain the benefits of any form of physical exercise for some adhd people.

"Hey r/ADHD  
  
I'll try to make this somewhat short if I can. I am M28. I have struggled with anxiety and depression my entire life, mostly anxiety. Especially as a kid, I was very anxious, the most anxious kid I knew out of all my friends. It never felt fair. I want to share some of my life story here and just see if this is legitimate...because my counsellor and doctor were willing to try me out on Vyvanse but i was never officially, thoroughly diagnosed by a psychiatrist. But for the first time in my life, my anxiety is like..gone. I feel happy too, more than ever in my adult life. And the over thinking! It's like i would just have multiple streams of thoughts in my head and I would have to think of the same things over and over and over to try to reassure myself, but it would never quite work. I've tried Wellbutrin before for anxiety/depression and it barely worked at all. Also had a lot of issues with depersonalization/derealization (really terrible anxiety causes this) so basically thought i was going entirely insane.  
  
My symptoms (whether they are ADHD or not, idk) have only gotten really bad in the last year, after I went through a marital separation/divorce. For example, I wake up at 5 AM, get to the gym, but found it near impossible to focus on sets and constantly scroll tik tok in between. Same when I got home. I wouldn't get out to work until past 10 AM sometimes. Basically it would take me 5 hours to do a morning routine that shouldn't take more than 2. And it's like..anhedonia or something, like pleasurable activities are no longer pleasurable to me, no matter how many millions of songs I switch to or how many different TV shows I try out. So, I thought the culprit was depression.  
  
But I just couldn't focus on one thing at a time. I have 6-7 books on the go right now (mostly on an ereader) and I constantly bounce between all of them, I have big time difficulty staying with one book. I also can never get through a full song. TV goes on the background while i bounce between reading a book, writing in a journal, and playing games on my phone. As an example.  
  
Once i tried the vyvanse, holy shit. Absolutely calming, focused, for example i am writing this post in silence without any background TV or music which I never do. So that to me means its working, and maybe I really have this right? But I don't know if i always did or not? Is that possible?  
  
I would really like to connect with some other people who have gone through some of this. I was never diagnosed as a kid, I actually did well in school so i don't know how that factors in. I was a ""loud"" kid, the class joker in a way, could not stop talking, always wanted to speak up and often got in a trouble for that though. Also as I grew up I was always a huge dopamine seeker. Porn hooked me from a crazy young age. Although now, I have low sex drive which doesn't make sense...I always read on here how people with ADHD are often much hornier than normal, but I'm the opposite :( I love sky diving, fast bikes/cars etc anything that can give me a rush, I am the biggest adrenaline seeker I know.  
  
Anyway, I think that's enough context for now, ( Don't want to make this too long) I am just looking for any other perspectives and hopefully to chat with some others that got this more figured out. I am having mixed feelings where I am so happy I may have found something so big, but also, how did I lose my entire teens and 20s to this! Did I not have to be anxious and depressed for the last 12 years if I was only officially diagnosed?? :(",3,adhd
"In colorado for reference. I really need help and I'm sorry for rambling I'm just really going through it right now.

I've tried every single non-benzo anxiety medication and none of them work. I'm also prescribed suboxone and no provider at all will seem to prescribe benzos even though I originally got my script from an inpatient psychiatric stay. I'm really close to going back to the mental hospital just to get my ativan refilled because I'm having panic attacks like crazy and it's making it impossible to do anything and I feel suicidal and hopeless. I have to get a job and take observed drug tests for probation and both give me really bad fear, the latter from childhood sexual trauma.

Because I have addiction on my record am I never going to have a chance of feeling better? I feel like I'm shunned from getting actual help from the mental health system now that I have a suboxone prescription on my record. I've tried every single anti anxiety medication except for benzos and lyrica; basically they don't want to try any controlled substances.

"I'll go first. The ""popular"" kids bullying. Popular kids in highschool usually care about smoking/alcohol, relationships, and partying. Many are chill. You can get bullied by anyone in my experience. Usually people with low self esteem that if they make fun of you, they feel better. The only times I actually got bullied were by some racist kid and these two wanna be cool kids. The upper classman who were supposed to stuff me in a locker became my role models. And as a nerdy ass kid, my best friend was the captain of the football team. I feel that gen z’s highschool experience is different from the movies. Also, there are a lot of popular people who bully for sure, but I am just saying that many different groups of people bully. With social media everyone is more connected so the cliques in highschool will vanish more and more. These stereotypes definitely happen, but I feel that it’s changing.

"My dad (67) got diagnosed with 4th stage prostrate cancer, when he learnt that the cancer had not spread, he seems to have let loose on the seriousness of his condition. The cancer while contained in the prostrate has been identified as an aggressive form. 

After being presented his options for treatment, he seems adamant on not going through chemotherapy out of fear of the pains, trouble and potential undignifying experiences from its side effects. He has also said he is old and is afraid the side effects from treatment would diminish his quality of life. 

He has been instead feverishly seeking out information on alternative medicines and Im afraid he is slowly being brainwashed by quack theories and medicines. Furthermore, he has been deferring his appointments with his doctors and dragging his time out to go for tests instead saying he wants to take
things ""one step at a time"".

It doesn't help that my mum who is also a cancer survivor but at zero stage is extremely critical toward traditional medicine and prides herself in her knowledge of healthy eating that she claims is what keeps her cancer in remission for the past 5 years. She herself has gone for surgery (which was not an option based on the doctors advice in my dad's case).

My siblings and I have tried my best to get him to seek out more opinions and perhaps to speak to other patients who have successfully undergone chemo; however he seems apathetic and asked us not to rush him. 

We're kinda desperate for him to get a grip of the danger of his condition and to get treatment decisons before it spreads or worsens but we're at our wits ends.",0,negative_samples
"I’m being a bit short and brief with this because Reddit crashed midway through writing the first one and I’m a bit upset about it

I’ve always had a bit of paranoia ever since possibly 5th grade. Although back then it was a minor “someone is watching me” when I walked home from school, and eventually I grew out of it. After that I’ve had an issue with trust. Unless there’s is reasonable evidence that someone isn’t lying, their words mean next to nothing to me. Whenever my own mother says “I love you”, I dont believe her. I’ve been like this since I remember. Eventually I got a gf and it all settled down for a bit. I felt like I could be truthful with her. I placed my trust in her and told her things I’d never tell anyone. Mid way into last year, her friends started to test my patience and found one of my weak points, Anger. They abused the fact that I was easily angerable as much as possible. They used it to lie to her and pretend like I was a mentally unstable psycho. And they won, she broke up with me, which has enhanced these issues greatly. If there is one thing I’m certain in all of my distrust, theories, and paranoia, they did it on purpose. Once is an event, twice is a coincidence, daily is a pattern. And after the fact, she completely changed how she acted to one of our mutual friends, allowing her friends to do the same shit they did to me (although I didn’t find out until much later). After our breakup my life went terrible. They, in a way, gaslit me into believing it was entirely my fault. It made the original issue of not believing people’s words 100x worse. Even now, I dont believe some of my friends and don’t even hang out anymore with one of them just because I don’t think they like me.

Now we get to the part I’m most unsure of. Recently got into a fight with a friend. They let their friends pass on some shit I didn’t like. Nothing I’m paranoid about, they were being assholes and he didn’t want me calling them out on it. Well it lead to us falling out, then randomly he added me on discord. Never got a text from him and minutes later he unfriended me. I texted him to ask why he did that and he said “You're too paranoid people are out to get you and I don't want to deal with that again”. The thing that gets me is I dont know what he means by that. I never was paranoid or thought any of them were out to get me. All I noticed was the pattern of him being a dick to myself and multiple other people. But multiple people, even my closest current friend, said that I was acting paranoid. It worries me about what I was acting like to make them think that.

Finally I should talk about my worries about being alone. I hate being alone. I can’t stand it. Past 2 or 3 times I’ve been alone I swear I’ve heard a door open/slam. And generally speaking when I’m not distracting myself with YouTube or a video game, I feel like I’m being watched. And to a way higher degree than when I was in 5th grade.

I don’t exactly know what I’m looking for here. I dont know if there’s anything that can be said, can be done, or anything that could help get rid of my issue. It might be just to vocalize some thoughts I’ve had. I dont know anymore. Thanks for reading if you did. Have a nice night",5,paranoia

"First and foremost, let me introduce myself. I am not your average person when it comes to social situations. I struggle with responding appropriately and reacting in a way that is considered normal. My circle of friends is limited to just two people from my high school days, and outside of them, I hardly speak to anyone.  
Today, a friend of my brother - who is not particularly close to me - asked me to draw a sketch for his girlfriend. Truth be told, I really didn't want to do it. However, he was persistent and even went as far as offering to take me out to a street vendor for a meal. I agreed to go along, but he continued to pressure me into drawing the sketch.  
Unfortunately, I've been in similar situations before where I said ""no"" but the other person became aggressive and started speaking to me rudely, even in a threatening manner. As a result, I ended up giving in and doing their work for them - something that used to happen a lot in high school when I was bullied.

"Hello.. It’s my first time using this app to ask for advice because I seriously do not know what to do. I’m a sister (20) who has a little sister (16). My little sister is diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder and was doing therapy session and taking antidepressants. She was doing so well for 2 months after she decided to stop her medication. She stopped it without consulting her therapist. I didn’t realise this until she started withdrawing heavily from it.
She is currently feeling really sad and having mood swings. The thing that triggers her withdrawal symptoms is her being at school.

These past few weeks, she had a difficulty waking up to go to school and my mother gets mad at this. She wouldn’t wake up when my mom is trying to wake her up. She would groan and doesn’t get up. My mom (58) gets pissed because she cares about my sister’s education and feels like she would fail as a mother if she doesn’t have her daughter continue school.
My mother is also diagnosed with depression but takes her medication
however, I don’t think she understands what my sister is going through and can say things that I’m sure she doesn’t mean to.

I’m honestly really scared on what my sister is going to do.

She used to self-harm too but now she is doing it again..
she is also having suicidal thoughts and I’m worried she might take action.

What can I do to make her feel better but still proceed to going to school 
I know that it’s best for someone who has depression and having withdrawals to stay at home and heal better
but it is also an issue if she falls behind in her classes 
The school doesn’t seem to care either about it. I live in the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and mental health is not cared about in high school.
So I genuinely do not know what to do.

The plan so far is that she is booked again to see her therapist but it is next week and idk what i should at the moment.

Hello everyone! For the past 2 months, I started having eyelid twitching particularly on the bottom of my right eyelid.

Which didnt work, around March was when I brought it up to my girlfriend. We did what everyone else has done and we work through it. She's extremely supportive, it was very hard on us. But we've got through it. I'm starting to believe. Holding in my extreme anxiety for months on end, has lingered into my day to day. I randomly get anxious now, busy restaurants and movie theaters, sometimes when I wake up, or through out my day it hits me instantly and it lasts  for a while. The anxiety now isn't about relationship issues. It's just random and about nothing. I feel it in my chest. I've brought up to my mother that I want to go see a specialist. But all she does is try to blame the anxiety on my daily use of nicotine. Which is annoying, I'm sure it slightly could be negative.

I don't want to live like this nor to end my life but it's so boring and sad to live like this and doing nothing but staring into a screen all day.,6,schizophrenia

I'd told her that i thought i could have it, but that was months ago. She'd made up her own mind. Maybe it has stayed hidden for so long since i have quite a high IQ, so i've gotten through school fine, although the teachers often thought of me as a daydreamer.

"I think one day I will end up taking my own life. It’s not a matter of If, just a matter of when.

I’m currently unemployed, a college dropout, I barely have any friends, no romantic partner. 

I have nothing going for me. The only good thing people can say about me are that I’m “smart” and “pretty”.

Whenever I try to make friends I get ghosted. Whenever I date someone it always ends badly. I’m not good at anything I can make money off of, so I struggle financially. I have extreme trust issues, extreme abandonment issues. Because everyone in my life has ghosted me or stabbed me in the back. Everyone betrays me, so I rarely feel comfortable with other people.

I have panic attacks nearly every single night because when I lay in bed alone in the dark with my thoughts, my mind becomes overwhelmed with intense negative emotions and it’s given me insomnia.

I tried to see a therapist and I saw her for a few weeks but gave up because she didn’t seem empathetic at all nor did I feel like she understand how serious my issues were.

And maybe that’s partially my fault because I am very, very good at making it seem like I have everything together when on the inside I’m falling apart. Even the mask of normalcy I put on is slipping because I cut myself and I don’t even care enough to hide it anymore. I walk around in public with large, gaping, bleeding cuts all over my left arm because I just don’t care to hide it anymore.

 I have gone to therapists for ten years and have tried nearly every anti depression and anti psychotic on the market. All of them do little for me.

"Let me start this out by saying that I have severe chronic migraine with a MIDAS score that varies between 80 and 115. I have had chronic migraine since I was a child with a strong family history and have multiple family members with daily migraine/headache (including myself). I have tried dozens of medications with only very moderate success with some. 

Now to get to Namenda — I have been on a very low dose of Namenda for around 2.5 weeks. I am slowly working my way up to the full dose of 20 mg over 6 weeks, but I believe 5 mg works for me. I have had several (>5) episodes where I felt a migraine coming on and I took my Namenda and it went away almost completely. 

I went after Namenda as a preventive because another NMDA medicine (Ketamine) works exceptionally well for me as an abortive. 

I will see over time if this is actually what’s happening, but I just wanted to post this here because if someone like me who has been trying migraine preventives for nearly 20 years can find something new to try… so can you!

I was diagnosed almost a year ago. Autism is my special interest. As soon I received an official diagnosis, my life was filled with happiness. I already wanted to wear autism shirts, pins, etc. as it’s my special interest, but finally being able to call myself autistic made my life so much happier. I wanted to “fill my life” with autism.

I was proud of my autism for a while. Until I started seeing posts about how too many people think positively about their autism. 

Now, within recent months, my life has been filled with negativity. I started focusing on how shit it is to live with this disorder. I’m crying all the time, hating myself more, and praying to God my symptoms get better somehow. 

I’m filled with hate.

While life has buried me in embarrassment and self hatred, part of me thought ‘this is exactly how you’re supposed to feel about your autism’. But is it?

I’ve done a lot of internal reflection, work with therapists on the topic of romantic relationships but I seem to always find myself in a constant need for interaction with partners due to the all the feel good chemicals that come with being in a happy relationship. 
The problem is, a healthy relationship often requires time apart and to live our own lives, and when that happens my brain just craves to be back with them. 

It’s not affecting my relationship as such, because I do a good job of working through it myself. But it does often make me feel pretty irregulated and I find it affects my mood a lot.

"We are there for him. We are willing to do whatever it takes to help him through this. We talk a lot and have a good relationship. Except he has such a massive secret life that he constantly lies to keep us from finding out about the real him. We have had many glimpses though. 

I wish he would just tell us 'fuck you i wanna smoke pot with my friends forever and bang a bunch of skanks' because that's sure what it looks like.

Instead he strings us along with how he wants to get into tradeschool but he's interested in a break after high school. he says he's suicidal or struggling with cutting 'relapses' sometimes, and its always when we are asking him about his plans for the future. 
he mentions these things as if we knew it, but he never told us before.

he is probably not going to live with us, because we would get him into training and make sure he stayed on track.

he wants to go live in his grammas basement and work at dunkin with his stoner friends.

he doesn't have hobbies except gaming. when he's with us, he doesn't have him games, so he just goes to bed *very* early.

he has an online therapist. when he tells us his depression was flaring up and that's why he had to skip school, we ask did you talk about it with your therapist? he says 'no, i'm usually just telling her all the things that happened here' which means complaining about us giving him shit for skipping school.

He smokes weed and clearly has this whole pot head dark guy image that he's rocking right now, but he insists he doesn't use it much and will never use harder drugs, but he also hangs out with drug dealers and his friends have had cocaine parties.
we tried to get him to quit weed when we first found out and it was impossible. he says it helps him. he also takes antidepressants that the doc gave him without our consent.

**He keeps going back to how he wants to choose differently but *unfortunately* he has this curse of depression that won't let him do better.**

He has reasons to be struggling with depression. He's been through 3 divorces. It sucked.

But the rest of his complaints about life are almost headline buzzwords like 'the world is falling apart and i don't wanna just get right into working some 9-5 until i die'

Then a few minutes later, while still on edge from that experience, he was talking to me about something else and went to scratch his forehead as he was talking and the way he was moving his fingers reminded me of spider legs and that freaked me out too.

"A few months ago I decided I wanted to start working out and found myself a nice few exercises to follow on YouTube. It wasn’t too intense, but I wanted to start off small and practice setting goals and routines, so that I could slowly add on to it and not feel overwhelmed. And honestly? For a while, it was going pretty well. It became a bit of a habit for me. I started to see tiny results. I felt good. 

And then for some reason I decided to just stop. I was like, “eh, it’s fine if I skip today, I’ll just do double the workout tomorrow” or “a few days won’t make a difference in my gains” and now I’m sitting on my ass a few months later with all of my progress reverted. I haven’t worked out in a long time, and I feel worse than ever. Why did I insist on suddenly stopping, just when I was developing a healthy routine and feeling good about myself? Why did I let myself do that? I know I need to push myself to be better or whatever the hell in order to combat my depression but every single time I try I just give up and end up setting myself back. Whenever something starts going well I immediately fuck it up. Why even try anything at this point? I know it’s not going to work anyway.

"Hi, I am a 22 year old female. I am in the deepest depression I have ever experienced.

I got my degree this year and am in the middle of my Honors program. I have put so much pressure on myself for the last 5 years of studying, that I've been suppressing my anxiety and depression almost the entire time. I have been in fight or flight mode for years, and am so burnt out I can't get myself to do anything. A few weeks ago, I was put under a lot of stress with my studies and the flood gates just opened without warning. Now, I can't open an assignment, textbook or anything academic related without having debilitating waves of panic attacks. It feels like my mental capacity has been deteriorating exponentially since then. I can't enjoy anything I love anymore either. I am lucky enough to have a very supportive family, however none of them have experienced this (aside from my sister that has moved away). They do not understand how crippling my anxiety has been. I have no apatite, and I cant even get myself to go shower, let alone get any work done. It has come to the point where thoughts I am having thoughts of self harm and even sometimes suicidal ones. I've secluded myself from all of my friends, and only see my boyfriend and family (whom I have been loving with throughout my studies). I am at the point where I feel nothing but pain. It feels like I can not mentally function.

I have no idea what to do about my studies. I have adopted an avoidant lifestyle, even though I love what I am studying. I feel like I need to terminate or pause my studies until next year, and give myself time to work through all of this, but am so embarrassed about my mental state that I don't know what to do. I have a therapy appointment on the 22nd of this month, but I have no idea how to make this decision without counseling, and I need to make this decision as soon as possible because of the financial implications of my studies. I don't know what to do.",2,depression
" Hello redditors, I came here to share a story that might be of some benefit for people like us. Several years ago, I started univer-isty in a town far away from my home town, because I hated living with my parents, even though I have two little brothers that I love very dearly and enjoy being around them.

So my university started with a lot of excitement and sense of freedom, I was going to university to party and have fun, studying was the last think on my list; I was very anxious, a virgin, no friends in the new town, very self-conscious, I felt ugly and had a generally bad attitude towards myself. So with this shitty baggage, I was drinking multiple times a week partying as much as I can and making as many friends as possible. I was basically playing the popularity game, yet at the same time avoiding all of my insecurities and not working on any of them, since I hated myself there was no room for the thoughts to fix them. Not long after drugs came into the picture and I was ""testing"" all the different drugs a student could try, psychadelics were my favorite, since they take you to a different dimension far from reality. Once in a while when I would feel very down, I'd go back to my mothers house and spend a few weeks with my brothers and that seem to recover me for the time being.

After doing this for about 9-12 months, having very little emotional or mental idea of some sort of breakdown, that is soon to happen, I just continued. Not long after about a year into, I woke up one morning, just a usual day but I was feeling like something big was missing on the inside, I litterally could feel a massive void inside of me, like my soul/being was missing. Really weird and scary feeling that I again tried to escape, by being ""productive"" to keep my mind off it. Same night, as I am going to bed to lay there, I am left with that feeling inside and if I look into it, I have an instant panic attack, where my brain is telling me that I will die if I continue, so I stop and shake uncontrollably for a few hours, I call myself an ambulance because I'm not sure what is going on, for some reason I get distracted and forget that I had an ambulance coming in so I miss it. Next day it's exactly the same and for the next two weeks my days look completely exact, I feel like I'm running away from someone for the whole day and at night time I shake uncontrollably for hours, sweating and feeling like my heart will stop any minute.

I wanted it to stop.

So I seeked help and found help in books, within the next few weeks I read like 8 books on emotions, depression, fear, mindfullness, budism, stoicism. I was applying all the practises that were being recommended, basically taking non-traditional health path. Within a month I was meditating, journaling and observing myself. During that time I gathered some courage to look at this void of a feeling that I am overwhelmed by. My brain is going crazy as I am taking my attention toward that feeling, I am hearing loud hallucinations, of a siren of some sort, loud alarms ringing in my ears, I am seeing exclamation marks in my mind eye, warning signs and everything else my paranoic brain could come up with and simply decided to laugh at it, which made me trancend it immediately it was almost shut down by my attitude towards it. Yet there was still the feeling in my body, as I sank my attention into it, the feeling was growing and it was taking over my body, I was feeling cold, empty and dead. This feeling was growing and consuming my body, I felt like I'm either going unconcious or dying. Because I was in my bed, I knew that I couldn't die just like that and as the feeling was taking my body into death, I allowed it. I was okay to die there and then, laying in bed. As I accepted my death, the void feeling that was in my body, instanly switched to a feeling of ecstasy, please kind in mind that I was sober for a month now and feeling of ecstasy in your body is not something that you feel every day. As this feeling exploded in my body, I was seeing angels in my mind eye, probably due to christian culture I was raised in, my mind symbolised, love and peace in that imagery.

After this event the feeling of a void was gone, never to be seen again and with it, the paranoia and panic attacks dissapeared from my life. I felt at peace with myself for the next 3 months and then old thought patterns came back, the hateful ones toward myself. When I realised that these thoughts and beliefs about myself were the root of the problem, I started addressing them one by one, every single day for the next year, I went sober for a whole year, no alco nothing. Everything I became aware of a pattern in my mind that I didn't like, I would take a journal, question my assumtions and beliefs, write them out on paper, and make for and against argument on them, review the experience that caused that belief and try to view it from a different perspective, one that isn't as damaging to me. Usually it meant that some people needed to hear something from me and some difficult conversations were held to settle old issues, sometimes it was so easy that I simply got emotional as a kind and assumed the worst and ended up believing it.

Now 3 years later I am mentally in the right place at the right time, I know what is important to me, I live my life by my own rules. I got a girlfriend, a job I like, an apartment, a new car, I eat what I want, I go on vacations several times a year, I been helping a few friends with their mental health for the past few years, recommending books and ideas, in the end it comes down to if we want to solve the problem and it comes from an honset and genuine place inside of us, if we do, we find a way to do it. Sometimes it means confessing something to a stranged or a friend, and them listening to you is really enough to let go on the situation. So my fellow redditors, if any of you feel like you want to talk, dm me and we can talk about it, playing a game or doing whatever.",5,paranoia
"To begin this has been an incredibly trying couple of years. I am also using a throwaway account. I want to know in terms of me and my family if AITA or if they are. If they are I am willing to walk away.  
  
My parents are fairly well off, have a couple million for retirement and enough rainy day money if it should arise, multiple homes in different states that type of thing.....  
  
In high school I worked, in college I worked, between college and medical school I worked. None of this should be surprising in fact it is probably expected such is life. While in medical school admittedly overseas I was the victim of crime(s) by the medical school and forced out in good-standing. I did try and alert my parents/family that the medical school wasn't what we thought it was and that transferring would be a good option, used my connections to make it happen.... I needed cosigner's on loans and they refused to co-sign on it if I was transferring anywhere else. They also acted incredibly derogatorily once I was in to me in general. I am not sure what changed or why they choose this approach but they treated me with almost disdain. I get co-signing on loans isn't fun but on the other-hand they knew this had to be a possibility when I went to medical school. My life in the medical school wasn't good either and I was incredibly isolated had no friends there etc....  
  
When I was the victim of the crimes I did my best to alert them to it and I asked for help. I wasn't asking for money as I had enough for the situation, I just needed a phone call to a lawyer so they would talk to me using their connections. I fully understand if no crimes were committed and would admit if it was my mistake. I spent some time (alone) trying to get legal help to no avail and they absolutely refused to help. During this period I wasn't partying, hanging out with friends (I have none), just surviving and trying to handle things legally. I also wasn't legally able to work in the country if I wanted to. I eventually couldn't take it any more and went voluntarily to the psych ward for 5 or so days.  
  
I came home directly after.... They still refused any legal help. They live in the middle of the country and I am from a very cold wintery state. I have no car or any real transportation... Therefore, I applied for numerous remote jobs over a 6 month or so period. While dealing with the mental health issues arising from the crimes as well as continuing to do my best to handle things legally... They themselves admit crimes were committed and they just outright state they don't care. Suing ""wouldn't benefit them"". I was informed they won't spend a penny to help me in my future anymore.  
  
Again the same suicidal and overwhelming feelings returned and once again I checked myself into the psych ward. I will note I was overwhelmed, anxious, etc... And did cause some damage involuntarily after once again being denied any help. While in the psych ward I was informed they were kicking me out and therefore homeless (on my 29th birthday actually). Dealing with realizing I won't likely be successful, be a doctor, broke, etc... Has been a lot.  
  
\-Look I understand I am too old to be at home, I don't want it either. I have done in my opinion everything I can, including trying to prevent the situation in the first place. I just couldn't get a job. I get it's a strain and I am a burden, etc.... But the net result is I lost my family and extended family. I feel like I worked hard in my life and my family wasn't there for me. I will say the community now that I am homeless has been helping a lot. I would like your feedback who is right here?

"It's been 3 days and I am still in so much pain I can hardly stand it. I met my now ex almost a year ago. We have overall had a great relationship. We were so much alike and so good to each other. I've never met anyone like him and genuinely saw myself being with him for the longterm. The only issue we really had is that he would get very, very low because of depression. He had no energy, sometimes for weeks on end, had consistent feelings of emptiness and numbness, and overall would be very hopeless about life in general. He has said a few times that though he isn't necessarily suicidal, that he wishes he had never been born. He will sometimes withdraw from reality and just lay around. I would sometimes get mildly upset about this, especially in the beginning, bc I thought it was bc of me. But then he explained he has dealt with this his whole life and if anything our relationship is actually helping him feel better. I overall have been very supportive and understanding since he explained things to me. 

Some back story that I think is important: he was married before. He was with his ex wife for nearly a decade all together, 3 of those years married. He packed up his life and moved a few states away to support her career and paid all the bills while she was going to school. He said after the marriage, she completely flipped on him. She became very insecure, controlling, always accusing him of cheating (I can tell you now he is the type that would never cheat) and even tried to cut him off from his family. She was always telling him his teaching job wasn't good enough and he needed to make more money. He wasn't allowed to have friends or do anything without her present. Well one day he flew back home to visit family while they were going through a rough patch. She called him and over the phone told him she was divorcing him, not to come back to the house other than to gather his things, and then cut off all contact. He is such a sensitive person and i cant even imagine how painful this was for him. He is pretty certain she was cheating with a wealthy guy she married about a year after they split. Bc his teaching contract wasnt completed, he still had to go back, get a crappy apartment, and wait out the school year in a state where he knew noone and had no support.

I am the first relationship he has had since this. We started dating about 2 years after they split. He said he's dated a couple other people since, but I'm the first person that made him want to try a relationship again. Over time, he's made comments like ""I feel like you're going to meet someone else with more money and realize you don't want me"" and ""you're going to realize one day I'm not as great as you think and leave"" and ""I am going to disappoint you like I do everyone else."" I always assured him that those are intrusive thoughts and totally untrue. I adore him and want to work on any obstacles we encounter in life as a team.

Well Saturday evening, I was pms'ing and got emotional asking why he doesn't talk about the future much with me and was worried he wouldn't be able to emotionally move on with me. While I know he loves me, he does sometimes have issues being vulnerable and letting himself be emotionally deep bc of what happened to him and bc of his depression. I told him I wanted to go home for a little bit for some space and about and hour later I called him. His voice sounded different than I've ever heard. He went from sounding like my sweet boyfriend to this cold, stern person I've never heard before. Its like he snapped. He said he could not be in a relationship anymore bc he is bringing me down and he is so empty and numb that he can't even take care of himself, much less me. He said he can tell I'm down bc of him and he loves me too much to keep disappointing me. I told him to come over and he did. I thought once we talked face to face that everything would be ok. It wasn't. He was firm in his decision and left me there crying after an hour of talking. He kept saying he isn't right for me and that I am amazing and will find someone not screwed up that can give me everything I deserve. When I asked why he sounded so different, he stated he had ""shut down"" as a defense mechanism and that it was the same thing he did in his marriage when things got bad and that his ex couldn't take it.

The only contact we have had since was me calling him the next day asking about things. He still sounded so cold and said it was for the best that we breakup. I am devastated. I never thought in a million years this would happen. We never even fight. No relationship is perfect and when you love someone you help them through things, and that is what I want to do for him but he won't let me. 

He is an amazing, selfless human and I would never leave him like she did. I love and appreciate everything about him. 

Have any of you ever been through this?
Does anyone have advice on how I can navigate this? I am really struggling right now. And comments or perspective would be appreciated. I am trying so hard to make sense of it all. 

TLDR: My amazing relationship with my boyfriend ended bc of his depression and past relationship trauma. I am devastated and don't know if he will come back.",2,depression

"Hi redditors, 

I have been on Zyprexa for almost 7 months now and I have no voices or horrible tactile hallucinations but i also have no life.. I dont know what to do. I want to switch antipsychotics so bad but at the same time I am terrified that I will get psychosis while I will be switching, besides my only options left for switching are kind of activating mild antipsychotics like vraylar or rexulti or caplyta, I am afraid they will not be enough to keep my psychosis at bay but at the same time i am on a very small dose of Zyprexa, what if I will be able to successfully switch. I cant even walk on Zyprexa I cant do anything on this drug, it's not a life, i dont even care if i die with this life of mine. I have to try to switch no matter how scarry it is.. 

Another hurdle for switching is that my doctor would not let me do it, my psychosis was so bad and torturous (I had auditory and painful molesting tactile hallucinations as well as visual ones) and it lasted for so long (almost a year) that my doctor refuses to risk destabilizing me BUT i cant live like this anymore. The only reason I havent killed myself yet is because i am a coward and because of my family.

"I've been reading for a few years now and I have talked with lots of people about this and there seems to be different opinions on the topic.

For me, reading is a very active activity, I have to be mentally prepared and ready to catch all the information given by the author. Maybe its because I usually read 800-1000 pages epic fantasy which generally has lots of information and the world building is quite complex, but in my experience reading is not something I can do at any time of the day. In addition to this, I'm usually not able to read more than 1h straight because I literally get so tired from it. I don't understand how some people can read for +5 hours without a pause.

What I've been able to recollect from others opinions is that for them reading is something to disconnect, something that they can do when they are tired and not having to think too much. For me it's quite the contraty.

"I just got out of todays therapy session. Last week I actually got a lot out and felt good about myself for once. Today I barely said anything. I couldn't. I just kept thinking in my head about all these things and situations and overthinking and analyzing and deducing. I tried to tell her that this was happening but it was like there was a wall. I would think in my head of what to say but nothing would come out, like when i thought about the words it was like i was mentally putting them on some high up pedestal that I just couldnt reach. This happens all the time and it's led to me being extremely reserved. I barely talk to anyone and I hate myself for it because I want to be able to make friends and whatnot but i can just never reach the words. There's a girl i like and so when I get the chance ill try to to talk to her. its like i have to drain my entire battery life so to speak in order to make conversation with her, but i try anyway. it works but the second i start thinking about confessing my feelings the wall comes up again and i just can't speak and have to talk about something else or tell her that i have to go. this has gone on since about halfway through our senior year, and it's funny because the other day we were chatting in the parking lot of our school and one of her friends came up to her and she introduced me to them and described me as being ""kind and super sweet"" and the three of us talked for a good while longer. She's called me cute before and has complimented my outfits a lot, too. I know i should feel good about these things but for some reason when I think about it I get angry, because it takes so much effort for me to speak to her at all. My anxiety flares up and I feel my chest squeezing and compressing the whole time, and i hate it so much. i genuinely love talking with her and i hate that it's almost painful to do so. 

after the botched therapy session today i seriously have started to feel scared of myself because i've been considering harming myself. and i hate that because i feel like i don't deserve to feel so bad. i live in a nice house with successful parents and go to a nice school. i should have everything i need to succeed too, but here i am. i can't focus on my work and i am a completely average student academically and am even may be at risk of not meeting one of the graduation requirements with only 10 days left..

my therapist took note of how i was behaving today and suggested i increase my dosage or change medication. i am on two medications at high dosages already and i've tried many, many different meds and dosages. nothing has truly helped with my anxiety and constant racing thoughts. its hard not to feel like i'm unfixable.

i know this is the internet and most people aren't going to care but my therapist is going to be gone next week and i don't feel comfortable talking about my mental health with anyone else in my life and just needed to vent. if anyone has read this far i could really use some sort of response, some sort of advice. please and thank you",4,anxiety

"I underwent a miniature diagnostic process for autism a few weeks ago with my therapist. I got a 6/10, which is just on the threshold that qualifies me for a full follow-up, potentially leading to a diagnosis. I had a previous therapist indicate that I could be on the spectrum as well.

But, frankly, I'm dying to know the answer. I live in the UK and with the current state of healthcare it could take months for me to find out. But, I feel like I've already kind of accepted my diagnosis before getting it, which feels foolish. But something about it feels so right, I don't know. Even the few people I have in my life seem to think it's highly plausible that I could be.

I don't know what I should be feeling, but I'm already feeling a strange sense of relief.

"hi everyone this is my first reddit post so please be nice.

i’ve always been kind of a morose person, but lately, it has gotten worse and worse. i’m in college now, and i’m struggling to find a summer job or internship, and because i have very few friends, the days drag on and i feel useless and empty. on top of that, my mom is sick right now which is also stressing me out, and my dad is not helping out much and is not good emotional support for any of us. 
i think the stress from that, the thoughts that nobody likes me or wants to hang out with me from my hometown (i didn’t make many friends in high school), and the monotony of my days is making me very anxious and sort of depressed (not enjoying much of anything, sleep problems, random crying, etc).

i think an important thing to note is that i am a Christian but i’m kind of struggling with that too (stuff i don’t quite agree with in the Bible (i know i can’t pick and choose so you can see how that might be a problem), and also the feeling that i am just talking into a void). so praying about it (for me right now) feels very disingenuous (but i am not asking for any cynical athiest takes as this will probably make me more anxious).
i can’t get a therapist because my parents control that and they already don’t think it will be useful.

if anyone would care to read, advice (Christian and Secular) would be appreciated, just something to lift my spirits and keep me moving forward. thank you.

edit: an important thing to add too is that in the beliefs i’ve been taught, thoughts and declarations are important because they can come true. so there’s also the feeling of hopelessness and then an added layer of hopelessness because you feel hopeless (if that makes sense).",2,depression

His smile was way too wide to be genuine, it was like a big smile with teeth showing and he just watched me walk past him with no other interaction. I was painfully aware that unlike other days the park seemed deserted and so I just pretended I hadn’t seen him staring and just went on my way.  

I checked a couple of times after I had turned a corner in the park if he was following me and he didn’t seem to be but it was seriously creepy.

Also, on HBO was a 1955 version of Lawrence Olivier playing Richard the third. I’m sure it is as of its time… That being said, it seemed a lot less accessible to me. You can tell it was a (relatively) low budget affair on static stages, and The most important part of the movie for Olivier was the script, not the setting.

Of course they are their own time, and it may be unfair to compare the two, but I found the Ian McKellen version superior (even though I read later that Richard the third was in his early 30s when he died, so that kind of aged Ian McKellen out of the role).",0,negative_samples

"First off here’s what the teacher has said to me so far (these are just the things I remember off the top of my head):
He asks me “have you even done computer science?” I said “yes but last year I had a lot of health issues so I missed almost half of the school year, so I’m not as confident as most people in this class” he rolled his eyes said “sure” then walked off.
A couple of days after that - “Are you sure you’ve taken computer science before?”.
“I really want to punch you”.
“You’re stupid”.
“Fool”.
“Of course yooouu don’t understand this”.
Moves his hand towards my face with a clear intention of hitting me, stops and within inches to my face says “no I can’t do that because you’re a girl but my patience is wearing thin”.
“This is so easy even somebody like you should be able to do it” 2x.

I know I’m not dumb and I’m capable of excelling in this class as prior to this year  I have been a straight A student in all of my classes including computer science but this teacher has made me doubt all of my abilities and has made me cry every single fucking lesson. I no longer find joy in this subject. I used to cry every morning about going to school as a whole but now I only cry about going to computer science. I know this sounds like over kill but I’ve had a few nightmares about him.

I know it seems like the obvious answer is yes but there’s some variables.
It’s term 2, I’m half way through the year and switching to a different class i have no knowledge on (which are the only classes available) is going to be extremely difficult.
Because it’s term 2 the dean will ask why I’m changing classes now which means I’ll have to tell her or she won’t let me move. I can’t do that because if I do she will likely talk to him about it which means I will be paranoid walking around the school in case he approaches me and yells at me/hits me because I got him in trouble (I already feel this way but I know it’ll become unbearable if I talk to her about it). 
He’s known around the school for making controversial comments so what if I’m just being ridiculous? What if he’s joking and I’m just being overly sensitive?

A few days ago I told my friends about this thinking it wasn’t that big of a deal and I was just being dramatic so they’d laugh it off, but they said he’s abusing/bullying me and that I should move classes. What they said has really gotten to me and ever since then my anxiety has been through the roof and I can’t sleep because I’m having nightmares about him. I think what makes this really difficult for me is that he looks like my granddad who hits me occasionally and that he acts like my mother, who has been the leading cause to my diagnosed ptsd. 

I know I’m being dramatic and that I’m just being a worry wart but I need help or some advice. I have school tomorrow and I don’t think I’m capable of going to computer science or the dean.

"Somewhere in my brain I know I'm extremely paranoid and because of anxiety and all the things that have happened in my life, I'm being careful about everything on a paranoid level. Yet I can't help it. Maybe after I write this post I'll realize that I'm getting crazy paranoid so I'll be a little better and delete this post.

My relative who lived with my aunt (my aunt's brother) and was financially dependent on her, suddenly died. At time of his death, my aunt was at home, she called ambulance but he was already dead. Deceased person was supposed to inherit a part of big house later (inheritence would be shared by him and her). He was around 50-55, suddenly got sick and died. Everyone says it was likely a heart attack, but because my aunt and her other family members said no one suspected a foul play, they refused further examination. It just hit me really weird the way she said ""examination doesn't matter as he can't be brought back to life anyway"", ""it doesn't matter whether it was heart attack or if he died of other natural circumstances"" and so on and she repeated it several times, very weird. (I know she's kinda right and it would be pointless and if I were in her position and innocent, I'd also think that... I'm just being paranoid again). 

Now I'm next person to potentially receive a share of that house (though I do not plan to do so cause I don't need it) and I think she might try to harm me assuming I'm right about the thing I wrote above. Thankfully I don't live with her and I barely ever visit her (and probably will never do it again, but if I do, I will not eat or drink anything). Though I suspect she will try to find a way, to make it look like an accident.

Soon it's my birthday and she might soon bring a cake by which she might try to posion me. I will not eat a single piece of it. 

Yeah now that I wrote it down I feel even more paranoid. I am not usually like this and I hope I'm not gonna get worse or anything. The worst thing is I kinda understand it but at the same time I can't help it, cause I think to myself ""I bet if you had told this to every person who got poisoned and killed before their death would have told you that this idea was just crazy"". 

Anyway, regardless of anything, I'm firmly decided on not ever eating or drinking anything from her. Yeah.

"I honestly have no idea how to begin or if this will even read coherently but, 

I have social anxiety, it’s the type that causes irrational overthinking of social situations, panic and usually the immense urge to run away and hide. 

My issue relates to real life interactions and video game interactions (I’m a big gamer) I play games that are designed to be played with other people but yet I struggle to do so because the idea of using a microphone and talking to other people causes me to panic

In real life however I’ve basically become an isolationist. I’ve not seen any friends for years, I hardly ever leave the house. I lost my job during the early days of covid and haven’t had the confidence to go back out there and get another, which in turn has only made the anxiety worse. I overanalyse everything, every person I walk past could be a threat to me. I even cut my own hair because going to a hair dressers and having to make idle conversation would make me want to run. 

All of this originates back to when I was in school (I’m 24 now) I was bullied terribly, never had many if any friends.

This is compounded by part of my family instilling in me the “get on with it” attitude, they have little to no sympathy for mental health issues and call it weakness. Being raised around this has caused me to keep my issues to myself, again adding to the problem. 

I live in the UK and have tried several times to get a doctors appointment but I’ve not been successful due to waiting lists and such. Also the thought of having to say all of this to someone’s face makes me feel very fearful

I’ve allowed my person appearance to slip, i don’t look after myself as well as I should and sometimes getting out of bed feels like the hardest thing I’ve ever done. 

I guess what I’m asking for is advice or just to know I’m not the only one feeling like this, because it seems like everyone around me has an abundance of confidence.

Maybe I can even make a few friends who feel the same way. Id be more at ease being around others that also struggle as I wouldn’t feel like the “odd one out”",4,anxiety

"(TW: brief mention of H/tler)

(Warning that I swear a lot here. Usage of ""haha"", ""lol"", or ""lmao"" don't mean I find the situation funny. I just use humor to cope. And disclaimer: I don't care if you disagree with my political opinions. That's not what this post is about. This is about my friend being a shithead. I mention politics purely for background info.)

(And this is hella long.)

I've made a post about this person before, but I'm talking about a very close friend, like sibling close, who I've known for almost six years.

And she's super ableist. In a particularly obnoxious, irritating way.

I could ignore it at first, where it was annoying but not blatant. Usual stuff, like throwing around ""autistic"" and the r-slur as regular insults. Laughing whenever she saw the word autism like a fucking five-year-old or something. Clear lack of education stuff, which is annoying but not harmful.

It's just gotten worse, though. To be clear, she's conservative. For me, that isn't an automatic friendship-ender (though it depends on some specific opinions), but she's only gotten more extreme (she's a borderline Hitler apologist now, gotta love that /s).

We are basically complete opposites politically, so she rarely talks to me about politics, immediately shutting down any discussion when it starts heading in the direction. I realized she was doing this, so I told her that I didn't care what her opinions were (since she made it clear that she hates being belittled for said opinions). This isn't entirely true, but I wanted to be able to have open conversations with her. Didn't see why they needed to get heated. I was mistaken, of course.

Anyway, this eventually led to us having, obviously, a heated discussion. I didn't instigate it; she just started airing some of her opinions out, and I just responded. She does this with one of my other friends, who doesn't interact with her at all, so the discussions never advance from simple one-sided rants. In retrospect, this is what I should've done. I made the mistake of engaging.

She was driving and started the conversation about abortion. She's pro-life. I'm pro-choice. Again, complete opposites. We were throwing pretty stereotypical internet talking points out at each other until I eventually started asking her when, if at all, she would be open to getting an abortion.

And this is deadass what she told me. The only scenarios where she would get one or be okay with others getting one:

1. Significant evidence of a poor financial situation.
2. R@pe.

And here's the real banger:

3. If the child is mentally disabled.

So of course I ask her to back up on this point. For reference, she's always confused Down syndrome with autism and uses them interchangeably even though I've told her multiple times that they're completely different disorders. She basically says that, if the child was diagnosed with autism and/or Down syndrome prior to birth, she would abort it because she ""doesn't want it to suffer"".

I told her that the child suffering wasn't a given, and that she wouldn't know whether the child would be incapacitated pre-birth. I said that she prob knows autistic people without having any idea, because a lot of them are able to blend in with society (i.e., mask or not have stereotypical autism traits – which would apply to me, esp in this situation). Then she dropped this incredibly shitty line:

>Well, people with autism can't communicate **like normal people like you and me**.

This left me completely speechless. I was able to keep myself calm (since I wanted this to be a level-headed discussion, and she was driving, so yelling at her could be a bad idea), but this fucked me up. I've never told her I was autistic. *This* is why. She's so fucking uneducated and careless that I was able to fly as a somewhat quirky allistic under her eyes, while she spews shit like this about other autistic people. Like seriously, what the actual fuck. I may be overthinking this, but doesn't the whole idea of aborting a mentally disabled fetus sort of reek of eugenics thinking? Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the idea of being completely prepared to raise a child, then aborting when you discover it's autistic or has Down syndrome seems completely fucked-up to me. Just because you ""don't want it to suffer""?

Like *wow*, what a kind-hearted martyr we have here. Saving this poor, defenseless autistic child from the world instead of trying to improve the world for the child. That makes sense to me. That's convenient! /s

I almost can't handle it anymore. I'm trying not to make a big deal out of it, but it's just becoming dehumanizing to hear this kind of rhetoric from her (or anyone, for that matter; this coming from someone I considered a friend just makes it that much worse). I have made multiple attempts to try to educate her about what autism really is, but she refuses to improve or even try to understand, seeming content in living in her own bubble. And that's acceptable, because her opinions are accepted in certain communities. And that shit is insanely frustrating.

We're probably growing apart as friends. But that idea doesn't scare me anymore. I feel disappointed. I wish it didn't turn out like this, and that people were more open and accepting in general. One of the most infuriating things about this friend is that she is in full belief that she's an incredibly open-minded and nice person and can't fathom why anyone would be uncomfortable around her. Like seriously, dude, some self-awareness would be spectacular. Get off fucking Instagram reels and Fox News and self-reflect for once, man.

(For the record, I have friends that are not like this who I've told I'm autistic. And they were completely normal about it because they're not fucking obstinate.)

"Today, I failed my driving test for the second time due to ongoing mental health issues. When I turned 16, my mother urged me to start driving to reduce future car insurance costs. However, my anxiety and depression, diagnosed at 16, made me delay obtaining my license until I turned 18. Throughout my life, I have experienced various forms of therapy, seeing nine different therapists since third grade. In one of my therapy sessions, a psychiatrist recommended medication to manage my disorder. Unfortunately, my mother declined. I needed parental consent to take it since I was still a minor. I'm thinking that my struggles with school, road tests, and other necessities stem from a lack of access to medication and strong family support. Now that I'm 18 and can consent, I can't afford mental health help. Despite my fears about driving, my entire family insisted that I learn to drive. Their gossip made me feel like a failure for being afraid of driving. On my first driving test, I failed due to speeding at a dip. The examiner's yelling from the start increased my anxiety. Today, I had a kind examiner. I stopped at a 4-way stop sign. However, someone to my left was speeding. My nerves got the hang of me as I drove, thinking I could pass them, but my examiner had to brake. She informed me that I had only four errors, including one critical error. She realized that I had a severe anxiety disorder based on my reactions and offered some suggestions to pass the test. Her kind words made me feel less hatred for myself. However, I still bawled my eyes out at home because my instructor downplayed my mental health issues, saying I was simply making reckless decisions and that it had nothing to do with anxiety. Next time, I should expect that Californians can't drive properly and cheat at a 4-way stop. I am scared that I will get a stricter examiner the next time and have to apply for my permit again. I hate that my family ridicules me because my younger sisters drive better than me. I also wish that my family would understand that I'd rather take public transportation than put my life at risk by engaging in something I dislike. In the future, I plan to move to a more affordable state or country with better public transportation options even if I attain my license. Once I pass my driving test, I will still use the bus.

"I have a hard time understanding how i’m feeling, for instance the past few weeks, i’ll have moments throughout each day where I feel tired/bored/sleepy? I can never tell wether or it’s one or the other, for one i’m not a napper. 
I hate taking naps, even far before my anxiety has become a regular thing, I always hated the feeling of waking up and feeling confused and tired all the same. 
In the morning typically I have the most energy depending. I’ll get up stretch do my morning routine eat, then play some games if I have nothing to do starting out the day. After a good hour or so of playing i’ll get this overwhelming sensation of tiredness or something. Most people seem to be able to recognize the way they feel and go and do something to counter act that feeling. I usually spend too much time trying to identify why I feel that way. 
If I attempt to lay down and watch a movie with my family i’ll also get this feeling halfway through the movie of just some sensation of tiredness, and it seems to take a while to shake it off. 
The only time I don’t overthink as much as to why i’m feeling this way is at work, I work in retail on the sales floor and I close. So usually i’m recovering and moving quite a lot, I often don’t feel the tiredness until i’m on my break sitting down for the first time in hours. I don’t tend to overthink it though because it seems to be the only logical time to feel that tired, so I guess the reassurance works easier there.

"i’ve been seeing my therapist for a few months and he believes i have schizophrenia, i remember i started to hallucinate a year or two ago (im 19 almost 20) and they’ve been getting extraordinarily worse in the past 8-9 months, they’re more vivid and i can’t tell if what i’m seeing is real or not. along with this, other symptoms have started to show up/worsen as well. 

i hear whispers mostly, i can’t really make it out, lately the “heys” started being more regular. i haven’t had any command hallucinations which is one reason why my therapist wants to wait to send me to a psych. my personal hygiene has declined, i never go out anymore, i HATE mirrors and windows, i always see something watching me, i feel so disconnected from myself and everything else, i used to be super outgoing and now i can’t even go to the grocery store alone. my managers are starting to get upset with me because i’m never “present” anymore, telling me if i need time away from work to figure out my stuff until i’m “back to normal.” 

it sucks that i have to wait until my next visit in a month to start to get this figured out. i don’t like half knowing what’s wrong with me. essentially, i just want to know if i will feel better and feel like i’m not insane, i can’t even talk to my boyfriend without seeing or hearing something. i always feel like im being watched at all times and im so tired. 
does anyone relate? what will happen after a diagnosis? and how do you feel since being diagnosed and/or treated?

ps. i don’t typically write stuff for the internet bc i am super anxious, i just need support
from people who understand what i’m talking about, most everyone else treats me like i’m insane :((",6,schizophrenia

"19, f, latvia

i started my journey of trying to get help by going to my family doctor(?) and she said that i'm just a bit stressed and disheveled bc of exam season and made me buy 20€ brain vitamins. i called bs and booked an appointment with a psychiatrist. 

this morning i went to the psychiatrist to possibly get some help with my adhd. i haven't been diagnosed with adhd but i'm 99% sure i've had it all my life, almost everything associated with adhd i've seen online i can relate to. i've taken hundreds of online adhd quizzes(and other mental disorder quizzes to make sure) over the course of multiple months. only adhd applies. so today at my psychiatrist i tell her everything i feel, maybe leave something out because i was pretty afraid of being told i'm wrong and stressed bc of seeking help in a post soviet country since every boomer almost doesn't believe any mental illness, other than like depression, exists. she gave me a sheet of described feelings and how much i relate to them. the questions were like ""my mental state makes it hard to maintain my house, do school/work"", ""i feel i'm not as good as others"" etc so i thought it was a general sheet, i answered truthfully. later she tells me that it was a depression assessment sheet and that i scored moderate-high depression. that didn't feel right but i thought maybe, bc i hadn't thought about having depression. she prescribed me Sertralin and sent me home. 

now i'm thinking that she was very wrong because i don't feel depressed. those answers in the sheet were because my undiagnosed adhd makes it hard to do tasks as well others at the same age,education level so i'm just insecure i guess. i thought that if i come in saying that i feel i have adhd, she should've given me an adhd assessment sheet, not something else that she thinks might be it. also when i told her i started getting suspicious and looked up information online, she kind of scoffed and asked ""and why did you use the internet "", then asked another question before i could even answer. 

i really feel like i haven't been heard after waiting for this day for so long. looked up that Sertralin may make adhd worse so my hope is that if it gets worse, after a month i can tell her how awfull my adhd symptoms are and that she maybe would consider thinking that i have adhd, if not, i am going to try to find another psychiatrist that would actually listen. i don't know what the point of this post was, i guess to let my frustration out.

also i know that a psychiatrist can't really diagnose me but i had no clue where to go, i'm using misdiagnosed as, i guess, misunderstood?",3,adhd

"There is nothing worse for a person with paranoia than for all of their paranoid fears to be confirmed true, right?

I was always afraid of being hacked and found solid evidence (APK files and a spyware app) on my phone when my ex hacked me.

I was always afraid of having my mental health crisis spread around and it happened.

I was always afraid of being gangstalked and doxxed and it came true.

Sometimes I wonder if it was a self fulfilling prophecy? Like, I was so afraid of it happening I somehow manifested it?

I was afraid of my cat dying and he died last week.

Every one of my worst fears came true this year and keep coming true. It feels like I'm in a nonstop nightmare.

At least before, I could rationalize my way out of my paranoia, but having all of my paranoid fears come true honestly has broken my sanity. I barely can keep it together. The anxiety is overwhelming and unreal. I am terrified of getting a new job outside of gig work because I'm afraid it'll all happen again. This paranoia and feeling of constantly questioning my sanity because of this makes it so hard to be alive or even want to. It's psychological torture.

I have to deal with this for the rest of my life because of what he did.

"That's my motto rn. I feel as if I'm about to combust mentally, but I'm totally fine. Everything is fine. I told myself to just get up and start doing something anything in life. I feel stagnate but it's my own fault. All you have to depend on is urself. I'm tired of dealing with myself. All the mental gymnastics all the thoughts all the breakdowns. I'm exhausting. 

So I'm gonna try my best to not wallow or drown in the gloom and actually do something worthwhile. I know it's not like I wanted to be a giant failure at 21 then proceded to accomplish it, but nor did I take the proper actions to keep myself from careening off a cliff. So I'm gonna try for the umpteenth time to fix what I have left in this life. Either that or one day I figure I'm too tired too keep myself from doing something I won't live to regret. 

It's all good got hella energy until I get up to actually do something then I'm immediately exhausted. Life's just like that though for me anyway. I hope there is no afterlife cause I don't think I could or want to live again while dead. That would be pretty ironic to live in torment already just to get fed up, unalive urself just to wake up in hell after death.",2,depression

I was supposed to go out with my girlfriend and her friends tonight to see her friend DJ at a club. I've done it before and it was a really great time, so I've been looking forward to it all week. However, the past three days have been super stressful because of a sudden surgery my cat needed. Anyway, I got ready, had my finger over the button to order the car, then put down my phone and started petting my cat. 

I've done this a lot. I've gotten ready to go somewhere lively, but when it's time to go, I just flat out can't do it. I think it's part sensory, part mental (and part cat in this case). I know if I go I'll have a lot of loud sounds and a ton of people to deal with, but I also know that I loosen up after a little and usually have a good time. I feel like not going is kinder to myself and more what I need in this situation, but that I'm letting my girlfriend down and robbing myself of a fun time. I do this ""should I go? should I stay?"" dance until it's too late to go and I shut down. So now I'm home, sitting on the couch in my cute club outfit, trying to justify my choice, feeling like I let my girlfriend and myself down.",3,adhd

"Hey guys.

I have been struggling with depressive thoughts for about 3 years. It all started because of a girl, but since then it's evolved.

Ever since I turned 18 I have more and more frequently been turning to drinking to cope with my problems. I'm drunk as I'm writing this, and would love to stop. The problem is that I frankly enjoy being drunk. 

As a 20 y/o man, struggling with alcoholism isn't that much of a problem in my close one's eyes. I don't tell them why I drink. We party and have fun, and they don't recognize that I have a problem. 

As a coping mechanism, however, it doesn't work long term. I'm fine in the moment, but when I wake up I'm just as miserable as I was the day before. My therapist says I should find ways to stop, but hasn't really given me clear cut advice.

If you are like me, by all means stop drinking. I wish I'd never started, but life got in the way. The whole point of this post is sharing my experience, not necessarily seeking advice.",2,depression

"Okay so this has messed with me for a while and I'm still really confused and feel sick writing this. Idk what to think or what to call this. 

From the ages of around 14-18 my dad used to do this weird creepy thing around once a week.

I would be laying on the couch and he would walk up to me very slowly, slowly look at me head to toe, head to toe, head to toe, and his arms would slowly come up, and then when he finally got to me he would quickly grab either my upper inner thigh, or the place where the top of my upper thigh meets my hip. 

It always seemed sexual to me, and he would never grab me anywhere else when he did this thing. When I saw him coming up to me to do this I'd call my two little dogs up and put them on top of me. There was a couple times where he asked, ""what did you think I was gonna do?"" (Making me think he knew what he was doing?) But I can't know his intention, so I don't know what to think about it. But when I moved out I stopped talking to him for the most part because it seemed sexual to me and it weirded me out and changed how I think about him. 

He also asked me multiple times as a teenager if I masturbate, to which id pretend like I didn't know what it was or  I thought only guys did that just to brush the question off. 

He'd smack my ass a lot, and one time I said please don't do that and he did it several times as I tried to walk away from him. 

It's so confusing to me because this isn't molestation, I don't even know if I should call this sexual assault. All I know is that it's had a major affect on me.

 I wasn't going to tell anybody, but then in 2019 I had a phycological break where I heard a demonic voice tell me I was going to hell (never had anything like that happen before) and I was convinced I was going to die so I just opened up about everything I was hiding. It told my mom dad did something weird, she asked what is was, i didn't know how to tell her. Then she told my grandma (her mom) and they both came up to me and asked what he did, I freaked out and told them he took me in the garage one day and cut both of our hands and smashed them together (which did happen) but I told them that so I didn't have to say the other stuff. My grandma rolled her eyes and seemed mad like I made a big deal out of nothing. 

I eventually told my mom what happened and she pretty muched brushed it off and now I feel like shit because to them it seems like I just wanted attention.

Anyway, my dad died last year unexpectedly from multi-organ failure. When he was unconscious I told him I forgive him, even though I never talked to him about any of this. but I'm still left with these weird feeings. I still want my dad and the relationship we had, minus the stuff that made me feel weird. He was the most similar to me out of my whole family and I love him very much. Half of me is angry at him, and the other half of me tells me I was being dramatic and I should have just let it go so I didn't waste the last years I had with him. I just don't know what to call this. I don't know why I even want to label this. I have a hard time letting this go and it's very confusing to me. Thanks for reading if you got this far.",2,depression
I was diagnosed in the mid/late 90s a time when it felt like every hyper kid was getting diagnosed and TV shows like south Park made fun of it. Plus on top of that I wasn't told any of the symptoms and just had to guess because web MD wasn't even a thing then. 20+ years of trying to figure out why I couldn't do what everyone else could do easily. I'm hopefully going to start medication again. Maybe not Ritalin or Adderall because I hated feeling numb to everything but honestly would try it again vsince I haven't been on meds for like 20 years.,3,adhd

"I'm so paranoiac that I don't want to live. Life is a torture everyday. I do things only because I'm afraid that people would hit me, shout at me, enslave me or betray me. Because of the fear, I feel totally helpless, so I don't want to live.

Once I'm not with people around me, or more specifically people who could hit, judge or shout at me, I do no more than playing or doing exactly what immature idiot things I can do until I die. Since I do these things, I have no productivity. But because some people always come and force me to do things, I stay alive. Once I face my professional obligations, I'm totally helpless because I've barely worked. This is a vicious spiral in which I've been stuck for years. Recently, I told two big lies at work because of too much anxiety and I feel like they're going to blow up in my face very soon.

It's been months that I sleep less than 6 hours a day because I see no point to life and because I'm always trying to see nobody (I want to become nocturnal since others are diurnal). I'm saturating. I don't know what to do. I want to die but suicide is too hard at the same time. I don't feel like I can believe anyone. No-bo-dy. I trust no-bo-dy.",5,paranoia
"It's about time to face to ask something about Bat Rabies, but this time I'm actually pretty scared of it.
So one night, i was buying something off of my neighbor and as i was going home, i sprinted home and suddenly at the corner of the top of my eye, i saw a bat flying above me and then something got stuck in my eye.
though it didn't land directly to my eye, it got stuck on my eyelashes and then i rubbed it off,
That day, my anxiety about skyrocketed so quick and till today, my eye is starting to itch a little. but i was never bitten

Do bats drool when they fly?
Can bats fly when they have rabies?
Is ""fly-by"" drool a way of getting exposed to rabies?

"I hardly express myself when I feel worthless, depressed, suicidal, and on the verge of harming myself. Not directly, anyway. If I post a tweet that says ""I'm suicidal"" and someone asks me if I'm okay, I will always lie and say I'm fine, even if I'm sitting there with a blade in my hand. Is this the wrong thing to do? I honestly don't want people to be concerned about my state of being, and if I told them I was going to commit suicide they would try to stop me and hinder my plans. I can't stop lying to people, and I don't know if it makes me a bad person or not. It makes me feel so bothersome to rant and cry about my problems to somebody, it's actually rather embarrassing.

"The last few weeks, I have felt so empty and numb. It's not a simple feeling of sadness. I can't easily describe it. I rarely eat, I don't shower, I rarely even get out of bed. I don't really talk to my friends or partner much. Not even my roommates. I kinda just lay here, wishing the universe would end.

There's no trigger. It's been a gradual progression to this point. I tried getting involved more, going out more, doing things. But it all just kept losing its luster. Nothing is enjoyable, anymore. I only turn on music or TV for background noise, and can't even enjoy my usual go-to songs/shows. I still go to appointments and such, but I typically don't really want to. I just feel obligated.

I'm not suicidal. Honestly, suicide and even self-harm feel like they require so much energy, and I definitely don't have it. If the universe would just cease to exist all at once, that would be ideal. That way, no one would have to mourn anyone else's disappearance.

Anyway, I'm gonna go have a big cup of cherry Kool-Aid and dissociate for a while. Thanks for listening.",2,depression

I am, and have been, in therapy - and we focus on how I can rewire my thought about being scared. Is that how you get over it? Or is there a way to figure out why I feel this way?

"So I have a friend who is presenting symptoms of extreme paranoia. She thinks her phones are bugged and is constantly getting burner phones. She came over to my house and could only talk to me outside because she couldn’t trust cars or houses for fear of them being bugged. She thinks her neighbor is a long lost family member that is plotting with her family to kill her. She recently abandoned her apartment and is wondering around homeless because she’s sure her family is out to get her. I have asked her to seek help in the past for possible depression but she was unwilling. She just recently confessed her delusions to me after dropping off some of her favorite movies for me to keep safe in case her place was set on fire by her family and I again told her to seek help, but she has since been changing locations. I had no idea she was paranoid and I don’t know how to help, especially since she is now willingly homeless and constantly moving locations. I’m really worried about her and would like some advice on how I should proceed and talk to her once I see her again. I should add that when I talked to her she was able to admit that it could just be paranoia and that she was also suffering from derealization and she even stopped smoking for that reason but also it worsened after she stopped smoking.

"Last night I helped one of my best friends get into a relationship with someone who I actually had feelings for. I was going to make progress but unfortunately, she saw my friend as her soulmate. I’m glad that they are together considering my friend has never been a relationship. I’ve been heartbroken for years, she managed to put it all together for me, then I handed to her and went to my friend.  I’m now heartless.

I helped many of my friends that got into a relationship, some of them are even married. I haven’t been in a relationship in 7 years and that was my only time in one, and it ended off so terribly that it’s stuck with me to this very day. Thanks to that, i have depression and a shit ton of anxiety. 

To others, they see me as a great friend with the best advice. But what I think is that they think I’m very weird and very socially awkward. Truth is, I am, and I don’t think I will ever be like a normal person ever again after that relationship. I put on a face for others that, I hope, will make them smile and laugh. I always ask them how’s your day? or how are you? And are you doing well? I feel like whenever those questions are turned to me, it’s all false sympathy to me. 

All this time, I have never took care of myself mentally in the last 5 years. It’s draining and taxing my entire lifestyle. I’ve lost all interest in hobbies and even looking for a relationship since that’ll turn into me begging for love, and I know that’s not how a relationship works.

"Hello everyone,

I am carrying out an **online study** as part of my clinical psychology doctoral training. I am interested in understanding more about how people’s relationships are related to their experiences of psychosis.

This study is open to **everyone who has experienced psychosis** (no formal diagnosis required), which might include experiences of things like hallucinations and/or paranoia. 

The study involves completing some online questionnaires, which will take around 30 minutes to complete. There is an opportunity to enter a prize draw once you have completed the survey to say thank you for your time 😊.

Your participation would be greatly appreciated, and please do feel free to share this link!

"for over 10 years i have gotten increasingly more paranoid. it has ALWAYS been about being kidnapped (from the street/my home/anywhere) or being attacked in my own home/bedroom. i have no ptsd or trauma related to these topics. my trauma is mostly s*a* related + the paranoia started years PRIOR to any of those. 

i had a psychotic break in summer 2020 and since then, i have been trying to regularly take an antipsychotic. the dr decided it was stress-induced psychosis but put on my chart MDD w psychotic features.

in summer 2021, i experienced more psychosis. i was in rehab when it began. it was NOT drug induced (ruled out as i was over 1 month clean at induction). i couldn’t eat, drink, take meds, etc. it ended with what my team classified as a possible hypomanic episode. and then i fell into a depressive episode for 3 months. that ended with another possible hypomanic episode.

now we are here. in nov 2021 i went back to shelter (a shelter hotel tho) because of abuse. i was experiencing low-moderate levels of paranoia around kidnapping/attacks. i have my own room + a key card that only staff also have + my door has a deadbolt. my room should feel safe. but as of mid December 2021-NOW (feb 8 2022) i am at the point where i am going 3-5 days with no sleep, only able to sleep during the morning hours (7AM-2PM) to feel safe, being convinced people are waiting for me to fall asleep so they can attack, checking all spaces people could hide/fit, calling out to the people “in my room”, running out crying because they know i’m on to them, having shelter staff come check my room multiple times a night even though i haven’t slept/left/no one has entered for hours, etc. 

it’s getting out of control. and then this week my psych casually stated that it was probably all just ptsd related ???? i feel very dismissed. i’m barely functioning and that’s it? i can barely leave my hotel room but i also spend basically 24/7 trying to figure iout if someone is there too.

"Background: I just got done with a online meeting with a psychologist. We have been going through my intentions and the reasons I'm there. I explained that I talked to a uni school counselor (8 months ago), was told it seems like I have ADHD, then a doctor who suspected it too and now I talk to this psychologist. I shared in the first session that I failed all my university classes (or rather couldn't handle the stress of going to the exams, knowing I hadn't managed to study). That all I want is to have the tools to restart uni next term and do better. 

Now I'm in an ok place; I'm 20 years old, I have a place to live (with parents), I've been doing an internship and I have a few friends I meet from time to time. That means I don't have to get diagnosed _right_ _now_. But it feels really dumb to not get diagnosed when _before_ my life starts to fall apart (not that it will but it feels like it could). 

The next steps of getting diagnosed, as I understand it, is to get referred to a psychiatrist by the psychologist and then go through the process of proper diagnosis. Seems reasonable enough. Except I'm told that it is apparently _extremely_ hard to get diagnosed. You basically need to have your life currently be falling apart both career wise and socially for the psychiatrists to take you in and even then they are at high capacity.

"After spending like 6 months just trying to get a diagnosis, I finally got started on medication earlier this year. My doctor said she wasn’t going to prescribe adderall because of the shortage, but there were other things we could try. First we tried Vyvance. My insurance said they approved it, but they just meant it would count towards my deductible, and I got a surprise charge for the entire $350 or so. I can’t afford that, so my doctor switched me to dextroamphetamine the next month.

Both medications worked really well. I thought it was going to radically change my life. And maybe something will, eventually. But I’ve had to fight to get my medication covered every single month since my diagnosis, and I just can’t do it anymore. I don’t have the time or patience to call every damn pharmacy in town every single month.

Anyway, the title says it all: I feel like everyone is better than me. Always.
Am I talking to someone I just met? He's better than me. My girlfriend is talking to another person we just knew? He's better than me and in this case he might potentially ""steal"" her from me.
When I feel this is happening and I'm in a group, i often isolate myself by using my phone or doing whatever.
When I start feeling useless and uninteresting, I become a passive piece of the wallpaper.
I talk about this with my girlfriend, she get angry and says I need to stop thinking these things; I talk with my mother, she'll get angry too saying I need to shut up and that it is all in my mind.

"hi guys,

i  want to mention first i can’t afford private health insurance/an insulin pump. i’m a 27 y.o autistic woman with no family/support apart from my twin, & struggling to get by.

I was diagnosed 8 months ago. i was taking really good care of my diabetes for months, averaging 85-90% in range on my dexcom.

a few times i had slacked off due to depression but managed to snap out of it & take care of myself again.

however, the last 2 months i had to move house during a rental crisis in my city, while working full time & going to job interviews. during this  time i was so stressed i stopped taking my insulin . things have  progressively gotten worse & i struggle to give myself 1 needle a day, most days it’s nothing at all. it’s become a habit to skip my insulin completely for days/weeks . i think i was on the verge of dka  recently but reluctantly gave myself insulin until i felt normalish,  then gave up & went back to skipping it again.

i  know i risk diabetes complications & it’s terrible, but im so sick of giving myself 4+ needles every single day of my life & can’t  bring myself to care anymore. i tell myself i don’t want to live long anyway so why bother about complications in future - which i know is stupid. the thought of a foot amputation somehow still isnt motivation enough for me to take care of myself? wtf is wrong with me.

i  looked at my clarity app earlier & cried for hours because my stats are sooo bad, i don’t want to share out of shame/embarrassment.

how do you all have the motivation to  keep going? to keep giving yourself needles everyday? i have bruises & red dots all over my stomach, the injections often hurt & the  basal insulin burns inside me. I cant take it anymore, i feel completely burnt out & i haven’t  even had this shitty disease for a year. out of all the illnesses i  could get, i get one where i have to give myself 5 needles a day or die?  fml

ik i need to take my insulin, and the rational thing is to just simply take it. but it’s becoming so hard. thinking about having to give myself so many needles daily for the  rest of my life makes me feel hopeless. i need motivation to take care of myself again but i can’t seem to find it anymore. if anyone has  advice on getting out of diabetes burn out, i would be so appreciative",0,negative_samples

I've been struggling with chronic vomiting without nausea, loss of appetite, and early satiety since Christmas that led to anemia and 50 pounds of weight loss.

I have friends and family lined up as caregivers for a week+ post surgery. Some other friends started a GFM and I just feel awkward about it. I guess it'll cover door dash and my mortgage this month.

I was originally afraid that something in college would put a ban on me or something, and because of overthink I got paranoid that he might shoot me because I know he handles it, even though he told me it wasn't his primary job but that it works like this by the way.

"yesterday i had to severe aches all over my body and a dry throat. the dry throat continued to today and i drank a lot more water than i usually do because of that. anyway because i drank so much water i had to go to the bathroom more because that’s how that works. 

mistakenly i looked up dry throat on google and the first result was for type 1 diabetes which sent me spiraling after it also said it could happen in a matter of days. i had a mild breakdown and started panicking over the idea i had type two diabetes despite a only fitting two of the symptoms (dry throat and frequently going bathroom). i then began applying other symptoms to myself like “yeah my vision isn’t blurry but what if it is and i just missed it???” 

i panicked for a while before i managed to get a hold of myself and take into account,

1. my throat is dry probably because my allergies are pretty severe right now and i sleep with a fan directly on my face at all times 

2. i have been drinking a ton of water because of the throat dry thing (6 water bottles today) and somehow ate clear/water based types of soup for every meal today so ofc i have to go to the bathroom more

3. i fit no other diabetes criteria and while i’m not insanely healthy i’m still fairly active and eat plenty of health foods and limit processed ones

anyway i’ve mostly recovered from my spiral but i’d appreciate some advice/reassurance. the logical part of me is telling myself to calm down and remember i put myself through health spirals frequently. last week it was rabies because i had a cut i didn’t recognize.

"I have an on off boyfriend of about 7 years. We are both in our late 30’s. We don’t live together.  Over the past 18 months he has let me on much more and I’ve realised he has anxiety and depression sometimes which seems quite debilitating. He can’t get to sleep normally with something and he struggles in every aspect of life really although he has been working to improve them ultimately he is still quite stuck. 

He is really a beautiful person and I’ve seen the changes he’s made going from extremely angry acid tongued to now quite mellow albeit quite sad. The changes are what’s kept me around. 

However he has been saying he needs space and although my attitude was like ‘yea right’ as we were having the best time in our whole relationship I found this hard to believe. He has few friends and is alone a lot. 

I know I can’t make up for what he doesn’t have in friendships but he is actually my best friend and always been really supportive. I’m now trying to be on the same page and support what he needs which is space.

I’m just finding it hard to grapple with the great times I experience when I’m with him and him not finding value or fond memories of it to keep it going? 

We did spend some time together last weekend doing some selling which was planned months ago and when I left he called and asked if he ends the space will I come back? The issue is now I’ve seen the extent of the depression, anxiety and how evening something like a holiday, new experiences and total change of scenery will not pull him out of it I think he needs therapy and that’s the only way I would even consider going back. He really has done a lot by himself in improvement but he has got some traumatic memories if I think about it from quite young (being abandoned) all the way up to recent adulthood. 

I guess I’m trying to find out if he is just actually tried of me or if the depression is affecting his perspective on the relationship. We have had our issues but we have always worked through them. I’m just struggling with the space as we’ve kinda gone out on a high.",2,depression

"I'm going to post this to a couple different places but I need help. 

So I finally decided to change therapists after:

• She's continuously told me everything is in the past and to just ""let it all go""

• Her advice for dealing with my agoraphobia and debilitating social anxiety is to just go to stores, stand in the aisle in the way, and just repeat to myself I'm okay.

• To just get into the car and drive to clear my head (when I don't have a license and terrified of driving) 

• Despite doing my intake, didn't know of my diagnoses and acted shocked when I had mentioned a hallucination (and tangent but also acted like a was a specimen or something) 

• Told me that sometimes the people we love hurt us because they love us and that's okay

• Told me I cant control anyone (i get that) and no one can control me or make me do anything. When I said I disagree having been SA'd more than once, she told me that I ""learned what I do and don't like"" and ""learned how to say no."" Which triggered me bad for the past month and has had me really messed up. 

After all this, the biggest thing is that I have (for pretty obvious reasons) have not been comfortable reaching out to her for support when I'm really struggling, so with much encouragement from my friends and family, I decided the next appointment I was going to talk to her about switching. 

She then no call no showed that appointment after I confirmed. (I did miss two prior to this from other appointments and honestly just couldn't get myself to go to the one immediately after the above.)

So we put in the change provider form with the secretary who understood... and then the therapist called and said that I can't change providers and if I don't see her than I won't be able to see my med provider. I'm freaking out and at a loss. It's taken so so long to get into the psych and now I feel like I'm being threatened because I want a new therapist and have ALWAYS been told that if it isn't a fit, we can change at any time. I don't know what to do. I feel so lost and hopeless, it's just affirming that they were out to get me anyways and that I'm just another paycheck.

"Hey guys, I'm feeling pretty confused about a recent situation with my girlfriend and could really use some advice or insight. Before I delve into the details, I want to mention that I have pretty severe ADHD, which sometimes affects my judgment and ability to interpret social cues accurately. I'm not sure if this played a role in the situation.

We've been together for about four months, and things have been pretty turbulent but we obviously have a strong connection. However, today, she approached me and said she thought it would be a good idea for us to take a break.

Now, considering my ADHD, I sometimes struggle with reading between the lines or picking up on subtle signals. Initially, I was taken aback, but I tried to remain calm and understand her perspective. I didn't want to push her away by being defensive, so I told her that I thought it was a good idea if that's what she felt was necessary. To my surprise, she responded by saying that if we took a break, we probably wouldn't get back together.

Given my ADHD, I tend to take things at face value, so I interpreted her statement as a breakup since she seemed to imply that the break could lead to a permanent separation. Therefore, I accepted it and expressed my understanding that it was over. However, that's when things took an unexpected turn.

She started calling me repeatedly and bombarding me with text messages, clearly upset and demanding that I ""fight"" for our relationship. I was really taken aback by this because I thought I was respecting her wishes by accepting the break. It felt like a contradiction to me.

When I confronted her about this, she explained that she wanted me to show more effort and passion for our relationship, and the fact that I had initially agreed to the break was not what she wanted to hear. She said she wanted me to fight for her and prove that I cared.

Given my ADHD, I'm questioning whether my interpretation and response were influenced by my condition. Did I misread the situation and fail to understand what she really wanted? I genuinely thought I was being understanding and respecting her wishes, but now I'm questioning if I missed some important context.

I'm really confused about her mixed signals, my ADHD, and not sure what to make of all this. Am I to blame for this misunderstanding? I still care about her, but I don't want to keep going in circles with conflicting expectations. Any advice, especially from individuals who have experience with ADHD in relationships, would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Girlfriend suggested taking a break, I agreed, she got upset and demanded I fight for our relationship. I obviously have ADHD (diagnosed 12 years ago) and I'm unsure if my interpretation was influenced by it. Feeling confused and unsure about what to do next. Any advice, including insights from those with experience in relationships involving ADHD, would be greatly appreciated.

"My rabies anxiety started to rule over my life. I try to cope with it my having monthly projects but what if I die in 2 months?

In my holiday, while I was swinging, my toes touched a flying creature but I don't remember what flying creature it was precisely. I remember it has distinct wings though. It may be a butterfly, a moth, or even a bat! I highly doubt bat is a likely possibility because I saw the flying creature for like 2-3 seconds and did not move from my place. I think it may have been too slow or even too small for a bat. If it was a bat, I would probably only see a big flash for a split second instead. I don't even remember bat wings but I remember a black/grayish color. I actually saw bats in the area but they were flying high at night. This event happened during sunset instead. I sometimes try to reassure myself by thinking if it was a bat, I would have known it or I would have shuffled my feet away (or not able to because bats are much faster than moths/butterflies)

OK. Now the worrying part. I had a very small and old wound on one of my toes (3-4 days old at that time, not bleeding, no scab). Maybe it was a rabid bat that happened to fly slowly and some saliva touched the small old wound? For sure, there was no bite or scratch from that animal, only a small preexisting old wound. (which may not even count as open wound by that time but some of the ""toeprint"" wasn't present, the skin color was intact though, just looked like smooth new skin) Maybe my memory is wrong and it was actually a bat? They say that a bat flying during sunset is completely normal but my anxious mind says that it's definitely an odd behavior and it's definitely a rabid bat.

When I told my family about the vaccine, they went crazy and insulted me as if I was mentally defective. Yes, they know that rabies is 100% fatal. Yes, I told them the so-called ""wound"". But it didn't work. I guess I need to see what happens without the PEP.

**If I wasn't worrying about rabies for a month, for various reasons, I wouldn't even CONSIDER a bat exposure and even if it was indeed a bat, I wouldn't consider a rabies risk.** But now I keep my worry with me. Not only I don't even attempt to remove my worry, I even think removing my worry would be dangerous. It's like if I think it's a bat exposure FOR SURE, I'll try to get the vaccine, no matter the harsh consequences. But I'm not sure. It may not have been a bat at all. There may not even be a contact at all. Even if there was a contact, it may only have contacted the intact skin. But sometimes, I vividly imagine my parents' regret and depression, while I'm lying in my deathbed with a foaming mouth and hydrophobia.

I try to reassure myself by telling myself that if I wasn't having a rabies fear for a month, I wouldn't even consider an exposure but at the same time, I sometimes think my paranoia may save my life. But sometimes, it feels like someone told my death date to 3 months later. OK. At least I know my anxiety doesn't increase the chance of rabies, it may even decrease it. Even if the chances are almost zero, I sometimes think I may have won the rabies lottery with an unheard transmission method. Also, I live in Turkey, not USA. I know I wasn't exposed to bats indoors but my OCD-like self sometimes tells that I may have left the door open.

BTW, if I try to deal with this without the vaccine, the result would probably be exactly the same as what would happen without that anxiety. (unless I had a death instinct at that time and knowingly touched a rabid animal, which is too unlikely to even consider)",5,paranoia

"My a1c is 6 and I'm prediabetic but I get the described symptom really consistenty whenever I eat say.. pancakes or sugary crap.

Stopped carb intake, and then go back to eating rice. Rice is the worst for me because I love rice. 

Wondering if I'm the only one who gets this symptom ? This is the only symptom I ever have. I can make it go away by cutting sugar, carbs, eating fiber / whole grains... drinking lots of water or having a dry wine.

"It’s Mother’s Day and I was told to arrive at my parents’ place at 11am for a casual brunch. 5 ppl. For various reasons, I didn’t get there until 11.50am.

Once I realised I was going to be late, I was really stressed and anxious and trying to get there as quick as I could.

I sent some messages to my family to say I was running late, apologised, and said that they should start eating.

When I arrived I said “I’m so sorry Mum” and tried to go up to her and say Happy Mother’s Day and give her a hug, but she wouldn’t look at me and wouldn’t let me touch her.

Later on I was helping her set up and connect her new headphones and I noticed the most recent tab open on her phone, a google search for ‘why do people with adhd f*#^ up and arrive late to special occasions’.

There’s a lot more detail I could add but I just am so sick of feeling so guilty all the time when I really don’t intend to be late, and even though I have improved so much with my punctuality and I’m mostly on time, there’ll always be times that I slip up and I get so upset anticipating the impending conflict with my family.

"I apologize in advance, I tend to go on tangents and this post doesn't really have a goal in mind. I'm also fairly new to reddit. Anyhow..

Fresh off a breakup from a relationship of 5 years, having to move back home with my family. It's barely been a month but my sense of time has been distorted. Some days seem to fly by, some days feel like an eternity. I am facing loneliness for the first time in years, despite knowing I have a good support circle of coworkers and friends who have been really crucial to my well being in this time. I've always found myself latching on/jumping into relationships very quickly because I never really liked the idea of being alone and the negative connotation I attached to it. The thought of going to the movies alone, or taking myself out to eat alone, still makes me really uncomfortable. I'm scared because I want to go out and explore more of the bustling bay area, but I can't bring myself to go to these places as an individual and potentially seek out new friendships, relationships, or just to distract myself.

The icing on the cake is that I have always struggled with perfectionism, am subject to spiral and catastrophize more often, and generally just always feeling like I need to figure what it is I want to do with my life and distancing myself from people I labeled as ""stagnant"".  I've struggled with MDD since I was a pre-teen and was formally diagnosed a few years ago. I was on anti-depressants when I was about 19, and pre-emptively requested a prescription in Nov. of last year as I was anticipating a major change (transitioning from my job of 4 yrs). I think this is what has been keeping me afloat. I didn't anticipate to break up with my partner, but by then I was pretty adjusted to the medication.

(I feel) I've always valued and contributed to my emotional well being and ways to be a better friend/communicator. I've had many therapists throughout the years and always appreciated the value in opening up, as well as how understood I felt by each of my therapists. On the other side of that coin I know I am an irritable person and struggle with regulating my emotions. I tell myself that as long as I try every day to be better, things will work themselves out.

It's hard most days. I have all this momentum with job interviews, teaching myself new things like riding a motorcycle and how to (finally) swim, reading more books, discovering more podcasts, but it all is just busy work. Stuff to distract me. I often find myself asking, or more so stating, ""What's the point?"" All these things, don't seem to matter because I can't envision a future where I move on from this split and feel good about my accomplishments. Even comparing myself to 5 years ago, I know I've come a long way and I know I have my whole life ahead of me, but I can't accept it. I can't come to terms with it.

The universe works out in ways we cannot foresee, and it is unfolding as it should. I fear the unknown and what lies beyond this plane of existence, so I know I have to see this one life through. I allow myself to cry and feel my emotions, and find myself feeling a bit easier afterwards. I know it gets easier. It has to. There's a point to all of this, I just am not privy to it.

I've listened to this Sinatra song once a day, I know this is a popular song. I just hope someone else feels a bit better after listening.

"I had a health scare a couple of years ago that made me think I was severely allergic to my cat. Thankfully, my problem eventually resolved itself and this turned out not to be the case. But for a while I was put in the position of thinking what to do and how to keep my cat.  
I've seen so many heartbreaking stories of people who've had to give up their cats because of a worsening allergy. **I thought I'd share some tips on what might be a possible solution, apart from taking medication, vacuuming regularly, air filters and so on. My suggestions might not be for everyone, every household or every cat. Not everyone will agree with them. They might even sound pretty drastic, in fact. However, they might be a way to keep cats out of being abandoned or put in shelters. Also, hopefully others can chime in on what tips they have for allergic cat owners.**  
1) Wear an allergy mask or at least a face mask while interacting with your cat or being in the same space as your cat. Find some middle ground between the ones with the best filtration and the ones that are most breathable. If your allergies cause your eyes to itch or swell, wear sunglasses/glasses or even goggles. If your skin itches due to your cat allergies, try wearing long sleeves or applying a hypoallergenic barrier cream.

  
2) If your living situation allows, convert one room into the kitty's exclusive space and keep the door closed at all times. Do not let kitty into other spaces in the house. Use a baby gate to prevent kitty from running out of the door when you open it. Dander can still leak from under the door, but it will be much less than what you'd get if kitty is in most indoor spaces in the house. Put up lots of cat trees and all sorts of fun accessories, bridges, etc so that kitty will never get bored! You will probably need to do some deep cleaning of the other spaces in the house to notice a difference.

  
3) Finally, if you live in a house or an apartment with a balcony and you have exhausted all options (especially if you have a kid who is allergic), convert the patio, the balcony or some other outdoor space into a safe and cosy catio. There are many DIY tutorials online. If you live in a cold climate, put in insulated/heated boxes.

  
Like I said, these tips won't be for everyone, but I just wanted to share in the hopes that it'll help someone out there not make the heart wrenching decision of putting their kitty in a shelter.",0,negative_samples

"I’ve been struggling with paranoia and anxious thoughts since I had a major mental health episode last year. Long story short I stopped talking to a bunch of people and withdrew socially.

I have these thoughts that people I was friends with in the past are making fun of me and mocking me, posting about me, relaying screenshots between each other about me, etc. I have had this happen to me before so it’s something that makes me quite anxious. I have paranoia about being hacked/having my info leaked too.

I also get worried people try to ‘scope me out’ and say things that trigger me and then make judgments on my character based on how I respond, and use the way I respond as proof of my character. I’ve had people bring up words/phrases from music I like and had them mirror it back to me and the tone of it has felt like they’re trying to send me a message/make me reflect. I keep making connections, linking up conversations, words/phrases mentioned, and trying to ‘understand’ the link.

It’s exhausting.

It’s to the point that I have these thoughts for hours each day, thinking about past conversations and interactions. It’s pretty rough and I’m really sick of it.

Does anyone have tips/suggestions for how to gain some distance from these thoughts, address these thoughts, or shift the pattern somehow? Thanks!",5,paranoia
"TW: swearing, mentions of emotional abuse

I made a post awhile ago asking for advice about getting a diagnostic test. My main concern was my psychologists’ bias. I was 100% correct.

My psychologist did not do the whole test. She only did the questionnaires, the IQ test, and the social interview. After the test, I discussed my experience with my boyfriend who has gotten an eval before, and he said she skipped MANY components.

She based most of her conclusions on my mother’s questionnaire. I have told my therapist that my mother is emotionally abusive and narcissistic for as long as I have been seeing her. I cried to her for help and she did NOTHING. And now, despite years of telling her not to trust my mother, she decides to base her entire diagnosis on my mother’s manipulative and biased questionnaire. However, even despite the manipulation, my mother’s questionnaire still had the flags. My mother said I don’t handle change well, i struggle to transition from one task to another, I only talk about the things I’m interested in and it’s very hard for me to talk about anything else, and I have a few narrow interests. But she chose to ignore all of that because I “communicate so well”.

She threw out the questionnaire I filled out because I had “confirmation bias”.
Based on my IQ test, the social interview, and the questionnaires from my mother and teacher, I FIT THE CRITERIA FOR AUTISM. However, she said my social skills “aren’t bad enough”. She compared me to her coworker, who she said is “exactly like” me. She said verbatim, “I just wish you could talk to her, you would see, it’s just so different. You just communicate so well”. Having her A. Compare me to someone else saying I’m “not bad enough” and B. Talk down about someone because they’re autistic, was so fucking horrible. It took everything in me not to start sobbing.

The worst thing is, I can’t help but feel like it’s my fault. I’ve never spoken to her unmasked before. I haven’t spoken to my mother unmasked in at least 10 years. I’ve never spoken to my teacher unmasked either. I’ve been seeing therapists and counselors since I was 5, and I learned quickly how to act in a clinical setting. I unmasking with a therapist would be so fucking hard and so terrifying. I only unmask when I am alone or with my close friends. So I feel like her diagnosis is based on my mask, and it’s my fault.
Then there’s the part of me that thinks she’s right, and I do just have confirmation bias. So then I am back to where I started. I’m struggling. I can barely take care of myself, and I have no answers. All she told me was I’m a fucking genius, and I already knew that (honors student, 36 ACT, etc).  I’m just fucked up and I’ll never know why.

"I am 20 (m) and my depression is at an all time high. On November 1st 2022 I quit my job at Walmart for an opportunity to leave state and go live with my grandfather in Mississippi. I had only met him once in my life after my father had passed. He wanted to get to know me and wanted me to stay with him. I live with my mother and before I quit I had lashed out at her a couple times (yes it was stupid and I highly regret it) I lashed out at her because I was just so angry where I was at in life. Living in this stupid town where there’s nothing for me and working at Walmart which now that I look back was the only thing I had going for myself. I didn’t have a car and was just frustrated with everything. I blamed her for not helping me enough, she didn’t teach me how to drive and I didn’t have a car and most of all for moving us to the town. I did apologize to her but my mom was listening to what I was saying and contacted my grandmother. So long story short I suppose my grandmother contacted my grandfather and he offered me an opportunity to come live with him. He said he had land and stuff and he’d teach me how to drive and everything plus it was a change of scenery. So I thought yea I’ll take this opportunity. I quit and my aunt was supposed to get me but let’s just say me leaving never came into fruition. Also found out my grandfather is very negative very very negative and he pissed me off so I don’t even want him in my life anymore. November wasn’t really that bad since I got my last check from Walmart and had money. In December I had a fight with my stepfather because he was drunk and threw my mothers phone so I confronted him about it and told him to get the fuck out. He told me “you don’t even do anything” and yes he was drunk but that statement is very true because at the time I was waiting on something that just didn’t happen. We moved past that and now on to 2023 this is easily the worst year of my life since 2010 when my father passed. Every job I’ve applied for I either don’t get or I get stood up. I’ve applied to Kroger, the local hospital, a car wash, sherwin Williams, a machine operator, lowes, planet fitness, big lots, super 1 and I haven’t gotten a single offer. I’m damn near going broke and I feel pathetic. I feel like my father is looking down on me with disappointment. I can’t be happy with my current situation, everyone is getting to their goals and mines just came to an halt. It’s my fault, everything. The one good thing I had going for myself I fucked it up and that was Walmart. As shitty as Walmart is, I may have to go back there. No one really talks about how being unemployed fucks you up mentally. Feeling like you’re nothing and and embarrassment. I feel like I’m not good enough and I’m still just trying to hold on but this darkness seems eternal. I know my parents think I’m an embarrassment. The truth literally came out of my step fathers drunk ass mouth. They probably think I’m a lazy bum who sits on his ass all day. I’ve been struggling and I’m just about ready to give up.

"From someone that has Autism, ADHD and IBS and Asexual, I feel so many struggles that people around me dont event need to account for.

* **I cannot advance my IT career** with more 10 years of experience because it requires me to be public relation like guy and spend time doing zoom meetings, which I dont have enough attention to suffer for so many meetings. Younger people already hold better positions than me, despite my technical knowledge being better
* Despite my efforts of being social, by joining lots of meetups and local cultural places. **My social awkwardness** prevents people from getting to close to me. They have called me too chaotic /unpredictable.
* **Diet restrictions** makes me spend the time making choice of sacrificing myself risking an IBS flare up or being social excluded, sometimes I cannot enjoy things while having flare ups and wont join events.
* **Physically I am really skinny**, I lack coordination for team sports and no effort of gaining weight will help me, IBS triggers will bring my weight down really fast. Just adds frustration even trying. I am going to gym /yoga classes and I have above average cardio fitness, though.
* Since **I am not attracted to anyone sexuality**, I lack the drive of doing stuff to attract people  / learn to flirt, since I am a guy, no one will approach me, so I am dead end in terms of relationships. This was an advantage when I was younger because I had female friends who liked me this way, but I was just a placeholder free therapist until someone else arrived.
* I **never meet anyone that shares the stuff I enjoy to do**, and if I end up liking something, ADHD will make me become bored of it eventually.

On the bright side....

When someone sends me a friend request, my first thought is ""who is that and why are they after me, what are their intentions?"" Even with a friend I haven't heard from in a while, I'll assume there's some evil agenda they have. I've become distrustful of most people.

Before I see a horror movie, I check to make sure that it isn't ""cursed"" and that nothing terrible will happen to me from watching it (example: in 2014 me and my ex watched the conjuring, which is considered to be cursed but I didn't know it at the time, and afterwards a bunch of bad things happened in my life).

"I finished reading it weeks ago, but it just keeps circling back around in my head. This is one of those books that I know will change the way I think for years to come, and gave me a new sense of empathy for what addiction feels like.

Here's the setup (no spoilers, in tags just in case you like to go in totally blank slate):

>!Substance D is a new drug sweeping the nation and slowly destroying the minds of its users. As the connection between the two halves of their brains degrades, they grow increasingly disoriented and confused before suffering irreversible brain damage.!<

>!Fred is an undercover narcotics agent working to uncover where the new drug is coming from. But to find the source he has to pose as Bob Arctor, a user, and soon Arctor is as addicted as the junkies around him. Can he see through his paranoia long enough to tell which leads are real and which imagined? Or will he be consumed, like his friends, by substance D?!<

Despite the gritty, near-future setting and the serious themes, the book is funny pretty frequently because **the dialogue is so good**. Our characters may be drugs addicts spiraling into addiction, but that doesn't mean they don't act like normal friends ribbing each other and cracking jokes - at least when the times are good.

There is some very cool stuff here about **the theory of the mind and brain physiology/biology**. and even better, those facts perfectly set the stage for the twist halfway through the book so that it feels surprising but also totally in keeping with those (real) brain facts that were dropped along the way.

A big part of the reason the book feels so real is probably because it is real - Dick has said all the books he wrote before 1970 he wrote on amphetamines, and **Scanner Darkly was written as a reflection of his time as an addict**, and was the first book he wrote sober. He dedicates the book in an afterword to his friends who died or suffered irreversible brain damage from drug use - and the list is way too long. It hit so hard it made me tear up (literally, not figuratively).

If you want one of those rare books that helps you see the world through someone else's eyes (while being wildly entertaining at the same time), this is it!

Does anyone have any advice on how to level out from intrusive paranoid thoughts? I should be going to sleep but I just can’t because I can’t shake the thought that I’m going to die in my sleep. I have these wild ideas that every small thing means something. Earlier today my sister said something about final destination. Later on in the day I had a random unprompted anxiety attack. Again much later I felt a small breeze on my face and decided that it must have been paranormal. Then my sister texted me that she randomly smelled dirt. My brain has collected all these thoughts and lumped them together and has me convinced that it’s all a sign that I’m going to die tonight. I know these thoughts are crazy and paranoid but I just don’t know how to push them aside and don’t know where to turn with something like this without sounding like a crazy person.,5,paranoia

"A bit of information: I am a 23 y/o trans man, currently living with a friend *(we share a room)* and their family, a grandmother and a sister. I *have* been diagnosed with general anxiety, but no paranoid disorders.  


So, I've always thought I was... Decently paranoid. Like, everyone gets those thoughts sometimes, y'know? I figured it was normal enough, just a brain doing its thing. Maybe the thoughts were a bit irrational, but that was nothing to worry about.  


Recently, I was talking with my friend *(not sure how the conversation got here)* about how sometimes, I have to check that they're breathing, because I'm afraid they've died and I hadn't noticed. And because I tend to ramble, of course I went on talking about how I worry the others in the house have died in their rooms, and how the kitchen windows freak me out at night because I'm sure there will be someone there, etc etc. My friend then simply told me that those thoughts aren't normal, especially not that frequently.   


I'd never really considered myself to be any more paranoid than the average person. But now, I notice those thoughts really do plague me often, even if they're completely irrational, like believing someone might be hiding in the crawl space above the laundry room. Today, I had a full blown anxiety attack because my friend was gone, their grandmother had no idea where they had even left, adamant they were still home a minute ago, and they hadn't answered my text. I had to scour the whole house to make sure they hadn't collapsed somewhere. When I didn't find anything, the rational thought is just that they've gone out and they're fine. But then I began to panic that they'd still collapsed somewhere, it just wasn't in the house. I wasn't able to calm down until I called them and found out they'd just gone out for lunch.

&#x200B;

I don't know for sure if any of this is genuine paranoia, or just my anxiety acting up in a weird way. I've been talking with my friend about some of the thoughts when they come up *(I told them about my panic today),* but I don't actually know if that's helpful or hurtful to me. Paranoid schizophrenia runs in my family, so I don't know if maybe this is something I should be properly worried about. Any thoughts or advice or even similar experiences would be nice to hear. Thank you if you read through all this.",5,paranoia
"Backstory: I do a lot of internet deep dives, usually looking for obscure media. I never look for anything illegal. I always stay on the surface web, I don't actually know how to use the deep web. Sometimes these sites are not in English.

I'm afraid of us getting hacked or looking our internet connection because of something I looked up. I'm afraid of my family thinking that I am some sort of weirdo.

We moved last year and had to switch to a different ISP. It's satellite, so we have limited data, so we can check on how much we have. For some reason I'm worried my family will look at my internet logs and question me about it. I feel like I have to sometimes ask them about what they are looking at it listen in on them. Although, they usually just stuff like pay bills or look up landscaping stuff. Our anti virus software also logs our history, and we tend to check on that more frequently.

I have a collection of cosplay photos, nothing that's too NSFW. Many of these pictures come from a behind the scenes blog from a Japanese adult film studio, that uses a lot of well made and detailed costumes. I have no interest in the adult films they produce, I want only pictures of the costumes. I was looking though their archives recently, I had that open in one tab, in another tab I was looking up information about an obscure foreign kids movie. I got this paranoid thought that, because I had NSFW content in one tab and information about a children's movie in the other, the feds would mistake me for looking at CP. I thought that they might come to my house and search our stuff and my family would be mad at me.

Next up is that I torrent shows. I have an external drive full of old TV shows and anime. Sometimes the batch files can be large, so I try to download little bits at a time, as to not use too much data. I'm worried I'll end up using all of our data. Our ISP, doesn't turn off our access, but would slow it down a lot. 

Although I use a VPN, I'm worried that our ISP will send me a copywriter strike letter. I'm not sure what I was do if I was in some sort of legal trouble. I don't know how I would even pay for the fees. I don't have much money, that's why I still live at home.

I once posted about someone using my father's SSN to open up a bank account, me thinking it was something I did, even though I would never give it to anyone, nor do I even know it. I don't even use the same computer as him, so I don't know why I thought that. (We later learned that two of my mother's patients had the exact same thing happen from the exact same bank.)

Finally, just yesterday when we were having landscaping done, an SUV pulled up near our house. I buy got out, wrote something down, then left. My dad thinks he was here to do estimates about our yard, but left because we already had someone out here. (My parents called around to get estimates, two of the companies sent out guys to look at our yard without telling us they were coming. My dad thinks it's a case of that.) My first thought is someone was spying on us.

I keep telling myself that I need to stop doing this stuff. I'm not looking at anything illegal. I've been doing this for years, and it was never a problem. I don't know why I'm so worried now. I think that it might be because that things are different now. It's stupid to worry this much, about what would amount to nothing. I know that it's extremely unlikely that someone would come for me. It would take too much time and money to go after just one out of millions of people who the same, if not worse stuff than as me.

I'm mostly worried about what my family would think of me, if they knew about this. I'm afraid of having an awkward conversation about it and their opinion of me changing. I'm horrible at talking about uncomfortable things, and feel like I'd end up getting physically sick, something that had happened before when I became overly nervous.

Can anyone give me some advice? I feel like I need it.",5,paranoia
"I have been in a slump for almost three weeks. I got a promotion at work and I somehow feel more scared than excited or happy. I feel panicky and unable to do anything. I feel that I am not deserving of it and it's making it so much harder to get things done.

"Hello everyone, I(21F) have been diagnosed with ASD since I was 5 years old. Along with ASD I have: Anxiety, Chronic Depression, PTSD, and ADD.

Ever since I can remember I've always had a strained relationship with my mother(neurotypical) and I've grown up wanting nothing more than to feel loved, cared, respected, and listened to by her ever since I could remember. As time went on, I slowly came to realize she was never going to, at least, not the way that I wanted her to. I wanted her to say, ""I'm proud of you,"" ""You're doing a great job,"" or even ""I love you,"" but she never said anything like that. Not unless I said ""I love you"" first, she half-heartedly said it back. She's the type that if you don't meet expectations, she belittles, shames, and berates until you have a breakdown. 

The worst part?

Every time I tried to leave the situation to calm down, she would follow and keep going. 

This is what it's been like recently: I got a new job(all by myself might I add, super proud of myself) - I was a CNA at a local hospital on 12 hour night shifts, but got a new job at a pediatric clinic that was days and a nice 8-5 - and recently I've noticed I get sick really easily. I got sick with a throat virus that the doctors couldn't do anything about, but let it take its course. This morning- after almost 2 weeks off from a fever coming off and on- I got really excited to go but had a low-grade fever(99.4°F Oral), so I had to call out. My mom woke up and saw me home, came to me in my personal space without any warning, took my temperature and said: ""You're lying, you should have gone to work, your being lazy and I hope they fire you because I know I sure would if you were my employee."" (Note here, she's a high-ranking person in my county's health department).

She took it 2 hours after I had taken Tylenol and Pepto bismal to help(Note: my stomach was upset because she made me eat food that doesn't settle well with my stomach) She claims I'm recontaminating myself by staying locked up in my room and having the germs all over my bed spread. I don't think she's wrong, but her words recently have made my depression so horrible that I thought about getting their gun and ending it all.. I haven't had those thoughts in so long, and it really hurts to be having them again all over just because of a few words she's said. Before anyone suggests I talk to her: I've tried. All my life. Therapists, other family members, and friends have all told her to be a little nicer, but she never changes, and she probably never will. 

At this point, I'm mostly staying home because of my depression kicking my ass but I'm regretting staying home because of her treatment towards me. I have nowhere else to go, very little money since starting the new job, and feel super alone through it all since I'm the only person in my family diagnosed with ASD and have a difficult time reaching out for help because whenever I tried when I was under 18, my mom would step in, threaten that the police would take me away(a giant fear of mine she knew all about), and she would never come back to get me.

I'm really at a loss of what to do or what I can do.. I want to go back to work because I absolutely adore and love my job, but I fear I will get fired if I'm gone for much longer. I'm terrified of losing this job, I'm scared of what my mom will say/do to me if I even try to bring up my depression, and.. I'm just scared of everything right now. 

Thanks for reading this far, I hope you guys are having a good day/evening/night, and I hope you're taking care of yourselves. I'm willing to hear any suggestions ya guys have. 

Thank you again. 🤎",1,autism

I was diagnosed with Stage 1 Renal Cell Carcinoma. It was found during another exam that I was doing for my stomach.

"I’ve experienced heart palpitations before, a few years ago. I remember at that time I mostly felt them at night when I was going to bed. They only lasted a few days and then they disappeared. 

This is the second time I’ve experienced them and they’ve been happening for at least 2 weeks now. This time, I notice them more so during the day and evening. I don’t really feel them when I’m in bed. I can be waking around or sitting and I will feel a sudden “thump” and then it goes away. 

I’ve had the worst health anxiety of my life lately and so I’m not totally surprised I’m having palpitations.

"For me growing up, I asked for help with my depression and I never received it until I was 14, when I got hospitalized for trying to kill myself. I was lucky when I found my first therapist. He understood me while I was going through everything. The process of taking pills was so scary and draining. All the different medication I tried, the mood swings, finding the right dosage, talking to a psychiatrist that didn’t really understand me. It was all too much with everything that was going on in my life but I had my therapist who I had such a good relationship with to help me through it all.

I decided to stop doing it when my grandfather in Florida passed away during covid. I felt the pain but it was muted, like I didn’t recognize myself. It scared the fuck out of me and I just decided to quit on it. 

Now, life has been really hard lately, harder than I’ve ever experienced and I’ve been really desperate. I’m scared to go on medication and my therapist who was with me during that process left.

"24 F.
I’m gonna try and keep this short. 
First of all I don’t know if I’m autistic or not. I had part of an autism assessment with a psychiatrist today but had some technical difficulties so it was cut short and they want me to do another appointment at the end of the week. At the end of the appointment they said they are not sure I meet the threshold for autism but have some similarities so they want to talk more. 

To be honest I’m not 100% sure myself if I have autism. And I don’t have a problem being diagnosed, I actually want to know for sure!
I can relate to some things but totally can’t relate to other things. It was actually my elder sister’s idea that I get an assessment as she feels i’ve exhibited  autistic traits since childhood and autism/adhd runs in the family. However some of my family members think I’m not autistic and just have lack of confidence, anxiety issues and say I’ve been coddled by mother too much. So it’s very confusing for me. 

The reasons I think I could be autistic:

I did not speak as a young child except to my mother, when I started infant school age 5 teachers were concerned because I wasn’t engaging and I wasn’t making friends. Eventually I did make a friend thanks to help of my mother. When I started secondary school I managed to make a couple friends and then was suddenly introduced to a group of friends. I never kept in touch with friends from school though and I never felt that close to them. It was almost like we were just acquaintances more than friends. I was bullied at the end of high school by one of the ‘friends’ in the group and then I just distanced myself from everyone and became a loner. Still in adulthood I have a heard time talking to people, I get super anxious and feeling like I can’t get the words out. I am not very social with family members, I feel like an outcast, I don’t know what to say or how to engage. I was diagnosed with social anxiety when I was 18 and tried CBT therapy but that didn’t really work. I’ve been on different antidepressants and they also haven’t helped for the anxiety. My anxiety has gotten to the point I find it hard to leave the house by myself, I don’t go anywhere unless accompanied by my mother, I don’t take public transport anymore because I get anxious and worried about not finding my way around. I don’t have friends or a social life.

I failed in school. I was in the lower sets for all of my classes. Again I found it hard to engage or ask for help. I feel like classroom environments, the noise, distractions, constantly observing myself and trying to fit in made it hard for me to focus. I pretty much remember day dreaming and zoning out in all my lessons and wasn’t able to process or take in what the teachers were saying. I had some support from a supply teacher but it was never 1 on 1 so it wasn’t that helpful. 

I enjoy alone time, I prefer being at home on my own or with my mum. 
After socialisation I need alone time to recoup. In some social settings I will even try to remove myself by leaving early or going to a more quiet place away from others. 

I did not enjoy school, hated getting up in the mornings and still do. My mum used to bribe me into school with food or saying she’ll treat me afterwards. I never had tantrums or anything I would just look grumpy and be cold in mood. 

I enjoyed some imaginary games with friends as a kid, I feel like this was because there was less pressure to be social if that makes any sense?
I also preferred games were there wasn’t a need for much communication involved. 

Sometimes when there’s loud noises or if someone next to me is taking loud I cover my ears with my hands instead of asking people if they can talk quieter. 

I have found it hard to keep a job. The longest was a week. My last job was night shifts at a warehouse, I purposely chose night shifts hoping there would be less people but I don’t think that made a difference. After 3 10 hour shifts I quit. I physically felt unable to keep up with demands and was falling behind. I did enjoy elements of the job and if I were able to only do those things and not the others, I probably would’ve stayed longer. I also always feel a pressure to make friends with colleagues and don’t want to be left out. I feel like I’m the target of bullying or judgement if I don’t make friends. I don’t know why it’s such an important thing for me to make friends and be liked at work. I guess it makes it more enjoyable for me. 

Reasons I think I might not be autistic: 

I have never had / have no special interests or obsessions. When I told the psychiatrist this I could tell they were taken back and probably expected me to at least have 1. 

I don’t have any attachments to physical/material things. Apart from my phone and tablet, but that’s common in this generation right? Using my phone and tablet is my hobby I guess you could say. 
If anything, I would probably say I’d get more attached to people than to things. For instance I’ve always had a close bond and attachment to my mother, I stayed friends with the same person from primary school into secondary school because it felt familiar and safe. Age 5 I had the same friend till adulthood. 

I have never had / don’t have emotional outbursts. I hold my emotions in and then have a meltdown when I’m by myself in my home. 

I don’t think I have many sensory issues. Strong / bad smells are main ones but again that’s ‘normal’ right?

I don’t have picky or disordered eating. I’ve always enjoyed various foods. 

I feel pretty good at telling how someone is thinking or feeling by tone of voice, body language, behaviour. 

I get sarcasm mostly. 

PS. There’s so much more I could go into but I wont lol. 

I mean if I don’t get the diagnosis, what do I do? Do I accept that I’m not autistic? Should I still say that I am because I can sort of relate? Do I seek another diagnosis?",1,autism
"I'm not sure how to start this, but I'll just give a grand overview of everything:

In 2020, I (now, 21F) was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, and recently had a rediagnosis of Schizoaffective disorder (depressive). I feel so stuck. I don't and cannot, drive. I also find myself unable to work stressful and fast-paced jobs. I feel like I can barely talk or even move sometimes. I hallucinate frequently and have vivid delusions but I'm moreso aware of my behaviors and thoughts, now that I'm medicated (Abilify 10mg).

Although my father supports me and I live with him, he's very emotionally and mentally mean and borderline abusive to me. He basically told me how much of a burden and useless I am. We also argued as to how I'm going to survive if he's gone (he's of older age).

I realize no one can really know exactly what's best for me from a mere reddit post, but any insight or helpful advice would be amazing. I've come to the conclusion to either discuss my feelings with my psychiatrist, or seek a possible outpatient program to attend. 

But I still don't know how to go about being more independent, driving or job-wise. I just really need some support right now. Thank you to all who respond <3",6,schizophrenia

But I just feel so alone all the time, I sometimes hangout with my older brother and we exercise but even that doesn’t really bring me any joy. 

Really the only thing that makes me slightly happy is taking breaks at work and feeding the Cardinals, Chipmunks and other animals that come around.

"It all started when my friend, D, thought that he was being spied on in the Philippines. He thinks people are planting cameras everywhere. I never received any evidence from him, no sound recordings of people talking shit about him, no videos of him online, nothing.

He was using his VPN, logged into messenger. However, is it suspicious that two separate devices being used to access the same facebook account? Are there two separate devices?

"My memory astounds me sometimes. I can remember my exact thoughts and interactions Word for Word, even the color shirt I was wearing 15 years ago It is magical but I also remember such dark intrusive thoughts and hallucinations that used to terrorize me. I remember these things would keep me up at night and I eventually stopped showing my parents how they affected me because they did not seem to care. I would be shrieking and hyperventilating because I was being watched or threatened by demons and they would not blink an eye. Once I stayed in a motel with my family and our room had a tiny balcony, we were on like the 10th floor or something and decently high up. I stood out there for so long I think I was 5 or 6 and I remember being so small. The whole time I thought about how I wanted to throw myself off and what that would feel and look like.

"Hi 
I’m 20, went through a lot of fucked up stuff (abuse etc etc), and still live in the same environment of abuse and all the good stuff you know 
My main issue now is my Major Depressive Disorder , I started anti-depressants at 14-15 years old, I would take it , a while will pass like a year and a half , then it stops working , same happens to the others ( molecules) I would take after the previous stops working but the “working period” gets shorter and shorter , so I’ll take this one , would work for a year , then stops, take the next chosen molecule, works for a little less than a year , then stops working , and it goes on to today, where the last one I tried  , nothing, I don’t respond to anti depressants anymore 


Anti depressants not working = depression symptoms ( and ofc they worsened with time progressively all over thoses years as if it wasn’t enough ) 

I’m doing bad , really bad , I have no word to describe what I’m going through , and no will to since i’ve wrote all the long texts expressing it that all I wanna say now is “I’m living in everyday torture”

I’m currently taking “break yearS” ( yes pluriel) because of my depression, I can’t go finish highschool-> because I can’t study -> because of depression ( right at my last year of highschool🤩 , how lovely isn’t it ?)

Let’s say I went to every psychiatrist in my city so far over the years , and like, 5 psychiatrists when it was official that anti depressants aren’t doing anything ( I didn’t stop taking them and prescribed medication ) 

Everyday is hell , I really don’t have the energy to write a lot about details now, specially that I suffer from other things (anxiety disorder , conversion disorder (hysterical attacks) etc etc) , and  , specially that I just came from the ER for a panic/hysterical attack and first time deciding to tell them I’m extremely suicidal and need assistance ( idk why , Idk how I’m still here despite being extremely suicidal/attempted , let alone ask for help to not do it , I don’t get why it is so hard for me to just do it ) and my “mother” made a scene once here home as she religiously do to make it about her , and my father and “brother” are abusive so I have now flashbacks of all the abuse because my “brother” is being loud with slamming the doors to join her to wherever she took the car keys to go 

Well , back to what I was saying, I did rTMS ( for simplifying to the ones that don’t know about it , basically a machine put on your head that send magnetic waves to create changes in your brain to hopefully fix the hormonal mess in it, you are awake (no anesthesia no nothing, you feel it vibrating and irritating your scalp kinda , that’s it) , and well , IT DIDNT WORK 🤩✨ 

Now the “true plan” is ECT ( yeah electro convulsive therapy , where you are under general anesthesia and they shock you with electricity to create a brief convulsion to , again, fix the mess in your brain) 

Knowing that nothing is for sure when it even comes to the ECT even if it’s the most effective treatment out of everything ( and results don’t last “permanently” anyways ), and that I could , just not feel a change or relapse ( I don’t believe something good can happen to me anymore lol ) 

The question: Am I ever gonna come out of this? Do I just got to accept that : “yep, I’ll never be okay enough to function “almost” like a normal human , this is it , you are now part of the unwanted people in this society my friend, doctors for sure can’t tell you that since it will be contradicting to what they are told as a protocol , but we all know that this is it , this is the end , all that striving so you can come back to having a treatment or something that makes you “almost like others” is from the past now, the reality is , you lost everything , this is it, this is all you’re ever gonna be from now on  ” ?",2,depression
"Hello!

I'm currently being treated as Type 2 since last year (negative for type 1 antibodies / lada / mody but endo is convinced I'm too different from all his other Type 2 patients). 1000mg metformin daily. I use a Libre 3 to track my glucose.

A1c at diagnose was 9.3, and has been steady at 5.5 since about 6 months ago. I usually eat lots of plants, get good exercise, lots of protein, and low on the carbs. Sometimes I eat carbs and my glucose goes to about 160 or so and comes down.

But sometimes I eat something apparently egregious -- maybe a flavored latte, or a waffle -- and it spikes high, 250+. It comes down after 2 hours to 140 but it's that interim that scares me. Is this very risky? I know that ideally I shouldn't eat the things that make it do that but my diet is pristine 99% of the time. Am I just going to have to get used to this and permanently strike off certain foods from my diet?

I know that it never gets ""cured,"" but I was hoping my insulin sensitivity would be higher these days.

"Maybe this isn’t an ADHD thing, but I’ve been putting all the pieces together regarding my fidgets/stimming/behavior in general and there’s one thing I noticed I always do but I really don’t even know how to describe it… basically if I walk past someone I don’t know in public, I automatically do this quick little “Hhh” exhale through my nose. Usually accompanied with a smile/half smile. Like when someone says something funny or even amusing but you’re not supposed to be listening so you do that subtle little nose exhale laugh, does that make sense? I’m generally a pretty friendly person despite my social anxiety, and I’ve noticed I usually only do it when crossing paths with someone and actually making eye contact/acknowledging their presence in any way. It’s like I’m not saying hello or being friendly in words, but my little exhale is like hey, what’s up. And every single time right after, I feel so self conscious about it like they’re thinking “why did this girl just sniff at me?! Did they hear me?” 😅 Am I alone?!",3,adhd
"I have recently noticed that my behavior and thought patterns deviate from others' considerably, in that mine are much more paranoid and guarded. I don't believe *everyone* is out to get me and I am capable of some degree of trust (only fully trust one person), but I am constantly evaluating everything I say and do in fear someone will use it against me. And this does not just apply to saying something that can be taken badly, no, but also to, for example, revealing seemingly innocent information about myself that others seem to have no issue divulging. Ironically, my paranoia prevents me from going into detail here, but a good example is how I am paranoid to let people know my birthday, and when asked, I will only begrudgingly and hesitantly answer.

I see other people have no such issues with talking about such minor things about themselves, but I am constantly guarded for the not nonexistent possibility of malicious people somehow somewhere finding information that can be used to harm me. I am also incredibly paranoid when leaving my residence, often distrusting strangers on the streets and even going as far as to imagine in detail how a specific stranger who happened to glance at me plans to harm me and how I should react in that situation, constructing a very specific scenario in my head over such inconsequential occurrences. Is this a cause for concern? Is this a sign of a form of clinical paranoia? Is this something I should consult a doctor or a professional regarding, or is it mild/normal? I find the constant stress of reevaluating every tiny thing out of fear very exhausting, but I'm not sure if this is a mental issue I may be facing. To clarify, I do suffer from several mental illnesses, so having something paranoia related or my paranoia being a result of one of them would not be a far fetched assumption. Sorry for the long post, I have no idea where to go with this. I made a new account just to ask.",5,paranoia

"When the black dog comes, 
you don't hear it arrive.
One minute your happy,
Not a care in the world.
The next moment he is there. 
His tail all waggy,
He wants to play.

You play fetch with your mood,
He runs around with it, from high to low,
Bringing it back you feel quite good
But the dog wants his ball
So you throw it away
Just for him to play with
Feeling negative all day.

You play tug with a rope
Pulling your thoughts all over
Shame he is a strong dog. Not like the rest 
What was fact is now fiction
You question everything.
Pulling on the rope you do your best,  
Such a strong g black dog.

Then there's the stick, he loves it so much,
Knawing at your insecurities
Stripping away who you are bit by bit
Till you question who you are.
A strong tree, reduced to saw wood
By the big, black dog.

When the day is done, all you want is to sleep.
So worn out by the big black dog. You are.
But tomorrow you awake, knowing you have to play with him again.

Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.

"When I was little I also had this long-running delusion (I think it would be called a delusion?) that my dad was going to kill my mom and I. I had no basis for this except that he owned knives, a gun, and he was very avoidant so if I suspected he was annoyed I thought it gave evidence for him wanting to kill us. This delusion got weaker over time and now I don't believe it at all. I told a therapist about this but she never commented on it or brought it up again.

A few years ago I was so depressed that I felt like I was losing touch with reality. I was convinced that my family and my ex knew I was planning to kms. My ex had texted me asking how I was and I remember being so paranoid and thinking, ""How does he know?"" I texted my cousin asking if she said anything to him since they he had contacted her before asking about me. I thought my parents had contacted him and told him to text me. I texted her again saying, ""I feel like I'm going crazy, everyone is trying to stop me but they're not confronting me"" or something along those lines.

Now it's 3 years later and I'm really depressed. I worry that I'll start being paranoid again because I feel pretty detached from everything and hopeless. I also have trauma and I've been triggered lately, which causes me to dissociate. That feeling is really scary because I'm already worrying about losing touch with reality to the extent that I become psychotic.

"I have seen posts online that only confirm what I was fearing: a fair number of autistic women hate us autistic men. I wanted you guys to know how unbelievably heartbreaking and degrading it is for them to make generalisations such as ""most autistic men are creeps"" who ""harass and stalk women."" On one post, there were literally a thousand upvotes. Now imagine going through your whole life being called a weirdo and a creep. Why would you even talk to people? This causes many autistic men to just not speak and keep their mouths shut throughout teenage years and young adulthood - a key period for social and romantic skill development through trial and error. When they finally go to college and the workforce and try to get romantically involved with women, they end up demonstrating these traits of poor social development. On top of immense levels of bullying and rejection, we are now ""mostly creeps and weirdos who stalk and harrass women?"". The fact that they blame us for this shows how unbelievably un-empathetic they are towards us. Imagine I make a post about how from my experiences with autistic women, I feel like they are extremely dull, boring and creepy due to their poor posture, lack of social skills and weird, obsessive and clingy behvaiour.

Some days ive also felt constipated and only pooped little round balls but thats more rare. Also experience a lot of gas at times and some heartburn which i take famotidine for.

I got a text from a guy that I know at like 4:00am that basically just said: “hey, you make me very uncomfortable, stop interacting with me.” To which I just responded “I’m really sorry, it wasn’t my intention, I won’t interact with you anymore.” And deleted his number.

I feel like shit. Like total garbage. I’m a girl, and I’ve been creeped on before so I know how uncomfortable it makes me. I can’t bear the idea that I did that to someone else. And I’m not a creep!

My confidence is just in the trash at this point. One of my biggest insecurities is that everyone secretly hates me and thinks I’m a creep. And now I just had that confirmed. And I can feel my depression spiraling. Even right now when I’m hanging out with friends, I just feel so wildly insecure and out of my depth.

I don’t know what I did wrong. Did I seem overeager to be his friend? Was I butting in on his conversations? Did he think I was romantically interested in him (I did make one passing comment that I could’ve been, but that was like 4 months ago, and I ended up deciding I wasn’t and never brought it up again)? I noticed that his body language was uncomfortable recently, and he seemed to be deliberately ignoring me when I asked him a question, even though I’d asked everyone at the table the same question.

I just feel really stupid. I don’t understand why he wouldn’t just talk to me about this. I get along really well with everyone else on this floor, but I somehow just failed spectacularly with him, and it hurts really badly. Even though I socialized really well the whole rest of the day, and made people laugh and smile and stuff, every time I was alone I just started having a breakdown. 

The other problem is that I can’t talk to most of my other friends about this because we all live on the same floor, and I don’t want to start anymore drama. We’ve already had a lot of floor drama this year and I just don’t want to lose my friends, especially if they side with him. I’m upset with myself that I even tried to be friends with him instead of just leaving him alone. I’m upset he didn’t tell me what I did wrong to make him hate me. And most of all, I’m upset that I can’t read cues better. His body language was too subtle. And I’m really, really, really upset that I didn’t take the hint early enough and instead persisted in trying to make friends, to prove that I’m not a bad person. I hate telling people I have autism because I don’t want to seem not normal, but I wish I had said something this time. Maybe he would’ve talked to me about what was wrong instead of just cutting me off entirely.

To borrow some other Reddit parlance, I don’t really care if I’m the asshole here. I don’t wanna know who’s more right and more wrong. I fucked up, I’ll own that, but I just want to know why and how and what I could’ve done differently. I want closure, and I won’t get it. So now I just shout my problems into the void cuz I don’t have a therapy appointment for a bit. I’m already not in good mental health right now, and having this happen is breaking my spirit. I’m afraid of even seeing this guy anymore; I don’t want to deal with having to navigate even more eggshells when I already struggle enough with my autism as is.

Sorry about this rant, I guess just it’d be nice to know if anyone else can relate. I don’t want to be alone with my thoughts right now.",1,autism
"I've been bad at math my whole entire life, I feel like no matter how much learn and what I learn I would still make mistakes within a math test. Even right now when I'm taking extra classes for math, I still don't feel confident in my math skills. Every time I look at the problem, I get increasingly overwhelmed and overcomplicate what I need to do which well in turn makes me do the question wrong or let me sit there ages trying to figure it out. 

I'm not even sure I have ADHD but after researching it seems like I fit in a lot with inattentive ADHD or a mix of both. I'm just wondering if ADHD sometimes contributes to this overwhelming feeling whenever I look at a math problem.",3,adhd

"I was diagnosed with high-fiction autism and although I’ve had my suspicions it’s still brought on an unexpected range of emotions. Since my diagnosis last week I’ve been obsessed with researching it and have had many things answered about myself. It’s felt both relieving and kind of heartbreaking. I’ve been gaslighting myself my whole life. I’m still dealing with imposter syndrome around the topic even though I’ve been “officially” diagnosed and my research has also confirmed it. 

I’ll be 25 soon and I know I’m not considered to be very old but I still feel upset about finding out this late in life. I feel so sad for past/little me and can’t help but feel like knowing this about myself would have made my childhood a lot easier. I’ve been having crying “fits” extremely frequently and feel completely overwhelmed with emotions at all times since my appointment.

I’m also unsure of who exactly to tell and how to tell them. I’m terrified of people stigmatizing me or not believing me; I have already not had the best experience trying to open up about it.

"I've had these dreams a few times in my life that are hard to describe but it feels like either the world is going to end or that I'm going to die. I had one the other week where it felt very strange and felt like if I leaned to far left or right something would rip and I would die. I then got very scared and woke up and for about 3 or 4 minutes the fear didn't leave me. I've had these sort of strange dreams maybe 5 or 6 times but never close together. Except from now.

Last night I went to sleep and was only asleep for about half an hour where I had another one of these dreams. I can't really remember what happened in the dream but I became convinced I was going to die again. During this dream I sleep walked (which I have never ever done before) and went downstairs where my mum and stepdad where watching TV. I then told them I few times that I was scared, starting talking gibberish, walked into the kitchen and then went back to my bedroom. My sister then spoke to me through my bedroom door and I woke up but the fear didn't leave me at all. I was terrified that I was going to die and I went downstairs and told my mum to assure me that I wasn't going to die and it took the best part of 15 minutes for me to stop being convinced that I was going to die.

I'm a schizophrenic so that could have something to do with this but I'm 99.99% sure it isn't. This is something I've only experienced once when I was about 11 where I had one of these dreams and started crying in my sleep and saying that I'm not good enough or something like that. But that's about 10 years ago and I have never once in my life actually sleep walked other than last night that I know of. I'm wondering if anyone else has had these dreams before? I'm also wondering if this could be the start of more sleep walking? I really hope it's not. I'm hoping this was a one off. Any advice would be nice.",6,schizophrenia

I don't think it will prevent me from getting the positions I applied for(especially at tech startups), but hopefully, these programs start taking into account different patterns of speech amount neurodivergent individuals.

"Background... I have stage 4 breast cancer, Tnbc. 1 cm tumor in breast and metasticized to supraclavical and sternum lymph nodes. I'm on Taxol (as maintenance chemo, non-curative. Life prolonging purpose) as well as Keytruda immunotherapy

To say its been a rollercoaster is an understatement. I can deal with my side effects, and my own coping methods and emotions...

What's causing me issues is my own husband who is grieving my condition and very emotional but does not seek outwardly help.. (only from me.. The patient..). He's very up and down and all over the place. I honestly don't blame him for this but he won't seek external help such as therapy. We spend all of our time together... I try to convince him to get out with friends and get our hiking, he loves nature and adventure.

Sometimes he gets emotional and cries and cries and I am in a position of having to console him, over the loss of what's happening to myself. I deal with this on top of what I'M feeling... So I'm dealing with emotions for 2 when I'm just trying to stay as healthy as possible, while managing my own fears about my diagnosis, dealing with my own side effects from chemo, which are ever varying.. My own emotions...

For reference, I am 42, and still active. They've switched me to a new drug that is much better tolerated so I'm able to do most things.. Not much has changed with respect to ""caregiving"". I still do most housework, dishes and do laundry, gardening. Usually my husband makes dinner and I do dishes... It's been that way since before my diagnosis so no change there. He gets groceries once per week and sometimes I go with him. Sometimes he helps with driving my kids to activities... I drive myself to chemo now and sometimes he comes with me to clinic appts...

I feel like my cancer has taken a toll on his emotional and mental health. I have been seeing a counsellor for a year now to discuss my emotions about the cancer. I suggested to my husband to talk to a counsellor to help... And his response was ""nothing anyone can say to me will change how I feel about what is going on..."". I absolutely do not agree with this.. I feel a counsellor could help him manage his emotions about it and come up with healthy coping strategies as well as help with how he interacts with me...

I feel like I can deal with what I'm going through but that it's unreasonable for me to deal with that and also on top of that deal with consoling him over my disease and manage HIS emotions also... It's too much... I understand he's hurting but there's only so much I can deal with.... I have a terminal disease and I'm taking on his emotions.. It makes me feel worse and feel even more stressed.

Newest thing was he had been getting drunk every weekend for multiple (around 5) weekends in a row until I told him I really didn't like that.. And it felt like he was trying to drown away his sorrow by drinking.

How do I deal with what I'm going through but also deal with him, when it feels like he's burdening me rather than helping and that he's adding additional stress?

I relate to this so very much and I actively try to stop it but it’s like I really can’t control it.

More times than not I end up looking dumb, bc a minimal effort to look into the issue would have released it’s actually not an issue/was already resolved or whatever. 

I don’t know what this compulsion is. If I had to identify it, it’s probably based on my imposter syndrome and wanting people to know that I am working?

"In the past, I felt like I was getting an okay handle on my depression and finding ways to deal with it, but I just don't feel like I can catch a break latetly. I got broken up with by my long term partner that I bought a house with about a year ago. Her life had a lot of issues going on outside of my control and I was not as supportive of a partner as she needed. I have accepted that at this point and am moving on, but a major issue is the house we bought together won't stop having issues and it just so happens to be all at once instead of throughout our close to 1.5 years of ownership. I have handled almost all of it as it comes up, but it seems like as I fix things, something new comes up literally 2-3 days later. On top of that, someone crashed into me a couple months back and just finally claimed the crash on their insurance so I can get my body damage fixed. I was saving and scrounging to cover the crash if it did not work out which is a postive now, but I feel like some of this is just hangs over my head all day as I work my full time job. Outside of all of that, my overall depression and anxiety as well as living with my ex partner has been a lot. It is a very complicated situation so more just airing my grievances and hoping it will all work out, because I just want some room to breathe. It feels like everything closing in on me even if I have so many positives and have the resources to fix the problems. I mean, being a home owner so young is an accomplishment and as far as I know a lot of my house is in excellent quality outside of the one main area we have been having issues. I just never know what my expectations should be anymore.

I used to be on anti depressants. ADHD and anti anxiety meds, but they felt like they ramped me up even more in some of the ways they were supposed to help.

"Its become a problem in the past. I convinced myself a person I had a disagreement with had made a whole conspiracy around cutting me off as many people as they could, and people were getting convinced, and even if nothing happened and no such conspiracy existed I ended up having a nervous breakdown and ended up cutting myself off from those people anyway.

This happens every few months and I just have to wait until Im feeling better. And since that breakdown (years ago!) nothing of the sort really happened. But I fear that now I may be getting too near to that conspiracy mindset again.

Basically, people keep calling me weird and not telling me whats weird about me. My friends, my partner, some members of my family. I have a big issue with this word because people tended to use it a lot with me, sometimes with good reason, but the majority of the time it was simply used to describe me existing.

Looking back on it, it makes me really annoyed that as a mentally fucked young teen I had to figure out what is socially acceptable on my own. So, I ended up using ""weird"" as a cue to stop doing what I was doing, which quickly turned into me repressing just about anything.

So being called weird makes me feel awful. The worst part is that I have to always assume the worst given my history. So people explaining what is wrong about my behaviour is my prefered option, even if sometimes they still call me weird. But being just called weird? Fuck that, it just makes me feel bad and I constantly analyze my behaviour or start asking people if something is weird in advance.

I feel like its way too coordinated and Im spiraling over it. Do they really dislike me? Has it always been like this? Are they telling other people and trying to cut me off? And like, what is actually weird about me now? Nothing and they just want me to feel bad? Something minor? Am I making people uncomfortable, am I overstepping boundaries?

Personally I've never celebrated mother's day . My mom left when I was 3 .After a while my family moved in right next to my grandma. I spent so much time with her I basically lived at her house. She got me to go to church to do sports and really everything I did in my life.I would say she was the mom I didnt have. She died though and honestly I miss her so much.She would be so disappointed to see me now anyways.Though maybe I could go for a visit and spend mother's day with her one more time.,2,depression

I’ve got indeterminate colitis (definitely MC, but sometimes have bleeding and had visible inflammation on scope) and had been in remission on remicade for about a year.

"I needed to make a throwaway account to vent my feelings, because I just have to get some things off of my chest. I hope this post won’t get deleted because of my nonexistent Karma score on here, but we’ll see what happens.

I just hate my life. All of it. Sometimes I wish I was never born, and sometimes I just wish things were different. I hate being perceived as an incompetent weirdo, simply because I’m autistic. I don’t have the luxury of a support system, nor does anyone care about me. I’m all alone, fighting every day to even just get out of bed.

The more I do this, the more weary of existing I get. I live such a dead end existence, working a job that I’m so burned out on and have no motivation for. I’m in debt and can barely save any money at all. It doesn’t help that I have a chronic spending problem due to it giving me somewhat of a temporary high to fill the empty void where I’m given no affection whatsoever. It makes me feel good for a while, but it doesn’t truly make me happy. 

I don’t have a partner either, and I wish I did so that I could at least focus more on them instead of my broken mind and heart. I miss my Ex still even after we broke up in November. I want to be back with them but they already are with someone else. It’s super hard finding a partner at all these days now, and no matter how hard I try, I come up with no results. I guess I’m just not what people want, and I’m to die alone. Who knows? 

I lost faith in my religion as well. Nothing but bad has happened in my life, and when I turned to God for answers, more bad just ended up happening. If he exists, then he definitely hates me. I was told I was never meant to be born either way. Maybe this is my punishment for existing.

I’m surprised I’m not hooked on alcohol or drugs as a substitute for covering that gaping hole, but it just doesn’t really appeal to me. 

I just don’t see my life going anywhere anymore. I just want it to end, or I just want things to go my way for once.

I’m sorry for things being kind of crazy in this post, but my mind is just venting my scrambled thoughts.",2,depression
"Seriously i know this question gets asked im sure all day everyday, but ive never even heard of another situation like mine and just, I can't find the words for this feeling. I think i just want to ease the stress in my head with relatability. I have 3 things: ASD, OCD, and finally schizophrenia but with a huge caveat; I have accelerated thoughts i cant turn off which I'm sure is normal to most reading this, but i also have a deep, unending, obsession to question myself on everything, all the time. ""Just because"" is not good enough. I HAVE to answer why, to myself, or to anyone listening. I HAVE to. Because of this i have crazy high insight into my condition. I understand how and why i hear voices, how I go into psychosis (the primary mechanism is doubt if you're curious), why i cant stop thinking, why my head just fills with void sometimes. Everything. I understand, everything. And its absolute hell. I feel like im just constantly micromanaging myself, and i can't ever stop because letting go and not caring risks psychosis. I'll be okay. I have the tools to care for myself, and the support. I'll be fine. But i feel completely alone, so i ask. Is anyone like me?

Addendum:
I'm in a little loop. At some point in my youth i was confused, and said ""i don't understand."" And was then asked to explain. And so i did, but i did it wrong. I have to do it again, but better. Ive been doing this for decades now.",6,schizophrenia

Other times would be when I have watched films or listened to songs, etc. Someone involved would pass away.

"What is the point on life for some of us?
I am almost 25 (M), I started working and studying when I finished school with 16. 
I have been a honest person, with values, hard worker all the time, (I even worked so hard for couple seasons that ended up in the hospital for burn out). And still, I am nowhere in life.
I grew up in South America in a poor country, I was hungry of success of course, to help my family, to help my parents when they can not work anymore, to help my little sister to study the career that she wants. Emigrated to Europe, and still. I am just an average Joe, with a little. bit of money saved, working for a big company, with a normal boring life.
I did my military service and was very good at it, I was one of the most strong ones and intelligent in my unit, because I developed good leadership and other habilities and workout a lot too, motivating some people around me. But that does not help me at all, like, in this world it seems you just have to be a nerd on Software development or some thing like that , to be able to succeed financially and provide for your family and have a great life.

And now, I am living in Europe, in a country where its raining and snowing most of the time of the year, but with good and stable economy. Just depressed, alone, with my boring life. (When I could be on the Caribbean with sime friends if I just decided to take the other short way of making a living). 
 
I have some friends here in Europe that I made, but they just care about girls and partys and alcohol. Thay had a really easy and really quiet life, so it is difficult for me to really comnect with them, and I try sometimes to explain how I feel but they just say that their country is to perfect to be feeling like that. 
 I started to join some.sports clubs, to workout with people, but they dont put the work in, it is like people forgot what is like to push yourself sometimes. 
Everything around is just, average life, conversations without meanings, drinking alcohol, planning where to go on your 2 weeks trip vacation if you are lucky to recieve a bonus.

I just want to end my life, I have not done it because I know how much pain will be for my family, and they dont deserve that, and I have my two little brothers who look up to me and I just want to make them proud. But at this point I dont see what I have to do in order to succeed in this world.
Should I stay here and be miserable but stable? Should I move to other place where the climate would be better and I can enjoy life a little bit more even when I make less money? 

What career should I take? I was already in the military but it is not like USA where you can actually get deployed or something, so I am just a reserve soldier. I though about police academy but this country is so peacefull that it is just boring for me to be one. I though fire fighter but you can just be on a side, there is no like full time career.

I dont know if I should move to somewhere where I can have the Sea close and becoming a diving instructor or something like that interesting.

How do people succeed with 25 or 30. I dont get it, I mean, I have friends that are doing really good in life, they had wealthy parents and now have their businesses and everything, and I am happy for them, really. They are making money living a great life. 
I knew for me, was going to be a little bit harder because my situation is different. But bro, I have been working my ass off the last almost 10 years and I am still a loser. 

I think some of us would never be able to taste what been wealthy or having enough money to not worry about it is. 
I feel there is.people.like me who learns really quick and are intelligent, but not able to go and study 7years at university following a system. 
I just did a 2 years career in a trade in order to be able to get out there and live life sooner, that I could learn sooner. And I have been always promoted and stuff, but is still nothing that will take you to another level.

And nowadays when you think like sidehustle, is just ecom and dropshipping, things like that. People just sealing courses and stuff.

I know my parents would have loved for me to be a doctor, lawyer, or something like that. But thats not me.

I know  this post may be confusing a little bit, maybe there is too much information on different topics, but I just dont know what to do. I am just tired of life, I do everything right everyday to be a good human and a hard worker, and it seems that its not worth it. I grew up around people stealing with the goverment and doing some dr*g dealing and things like that. And I always though  that taking the other road (the honest one) will be always better.
 I just think I am wrong, those people live better than me, because I know them.personally. and maybe they just live under their own rules, they make life how they want.

I feel everyday the temptetion to take the shortcut, and use my knoweldge in some areas to just live life by my own rules, because it seems like doing the right thing and following the rules of society is just not worth it. 

I would just like to know what you think. How did you overcome things like that? Hiw are you able to find your path and be happy? Proud about yourself? 

And please, I dont need the ""be more positive it will change"" thing. I already did see a therapist a couple times and it did not help, and is really expensive. 
I know that no one can help me better but myself, but I just dont know what to do anymore. 
Im tired of living this life, I always had the mentality that not matter what happens or the enviroment you can always succeed and bla bla. At the end I am still a loser after years of waking up thinking that anyways",2,depression

It makes more sense, the way GotG 3 did it, as he would be confused not having any closure. The film did a great job in giving us the closure that relationship needs,....and otherwise was a great movie too!

"The past few weeks have been emotionally intense and draining.  I've had more than one major moment of derealization from family members surprising me with very negative attacks.  There was a death in the family.  I officiated the funeral.  I've had to take lots of time off work for these things and for migraines and etc.  

I assist at church in a big way and am training for the clergy.  Today I woke up with my head swimming and a general sense of utter exhaustion.  It's a church day of course, but I decided it would be best for me to take the day off, because of dizzy head and not having enough me-time, which is SO essential.  (I have something every night after work this week except for next Friday).  Sorry, all this detail feels relevant for some reason.

I texted the pastor this morning to let him know I didn't feel safe driving and making sure he was okay to handle the service alone.  There was no response so I called him and I honestly couldn't tell if he was upset or not.  Something about it felt dismissive, but I'm sure that's my guilt talking.  I always feel guilty when I call in sick for something.  Impostor syndrome for sure.  Maybe I'm overreacting and being selfish and maybe I'm not THAT sick.  And then I go into defensive mode and start saying things to myself as if I was on trial, even though the only response was a nonchalant ""Okay, hope you feel better.""  Now I anticipate that, rather than spending some quiet time recovering from the last two weeks, I'm going to feel uneasy and guilty that maybe I'm a selfish jerk for not trying, or something.

Sorry, that was messy.   My head really is swimming.  Needed to share this because I don't want to have a day like that.  I do want to stop off at my parents' house for Mother's day.  I wish I wasn't like this.  You'd think at my age (over 50) I would have gotten over this sort of reaction.",3,adhd

"Hello,

Like the titles says, I started having bloody diarrhea about a month ago and it started out with me going to bathroom probably 5-10 times a day and has now slowed to down to 1-2 but still bloody diarrhea.I have been passing gas a lot that smells HORRIBLE. Like bad enough for a whole room to question what I’ve been eating. Before this started, I was having a bowel movement about once a day but still feeling kinda constipated. Occasionally saw a tiny spec of blood on toilet paper but assumed it was hemorrhoids due to constipation. Assumed constipation was due to high protein diet as I do take the gym pretty seriously and eat pretty decent with high protein. lower back has also been a pain for a while now but I just attributed it to lifting since I workout everyday.

Something I found weird: the diarrhea started about a week after I switched to pretty aggressive cutting diet of around 2200 calories. At one point it seemed like it was only blood coming out and no stool. That only lasted the initial week and now I am having regular diarrhea with some blood in it. 

FYI, I currently have an appointment with my PCP scheduled for 5/25 but still have questions:

Does this sound like IBD to those who have been diagnosed? Could it be anything else after it’s been happening for a month? Stool culture said there was no infection like E. coli or salmonella.

Should I go to the ER? Will they even be able to do anything for me? (Also very costly) and I don’t necessarily feel bad although when I need to use the bathroom I need to go quickly. I have still been living normally for the most part.

Also, whenever I exercise, my stomach feels completely normal and I’ve never had to use the bathroom at the gym, even when it first popped up and I was going 5-10 times a day.

Please just lmk your guys thoughts. I am aware I need to see a doctor and plan to but have another 15 days until just the PCP is available ( I know I’ll likely have to wait again to see a GI).

I suspect there is a plan at the new place I work at to kill me. Probably an extension of some bigger plan from some hardcore criminals that I got too close with because I liked skating at the skatepark, and now they have to extend their arms out to people I know to try and end me. 

I don’t see why they would actually hire me, I’m such an undesirable person to be around. Boss man said “alright be careful with this let’s make sure nobody gets…. Toxified” about some other shit.

I’ve always struggled with depressive thoughts but it’s been so bad recently and I have nobody to turn to. Nobody knows I’m like this I’m so tired of being alone I’ve never felt so alone in my life i recently quit a job that I was content with for a “better one” and it’s honestly a lot worse I hate every moment I am awake I can’t stand it I just need to vent but I have nobody to vent to. I constantly think about suicide and I hate it I don’t want to die but I can’t stop thinking about ending it all. I work 12 hours a day to distract myself but I hate my job I quit drinking and smoking weed awhile ago because I know it’ll only help in the moment and dig a deeper hole. Fortunately I never got too involved in hard drugs. I just got home and it’s the same empty feeling I constantly feel I’m just so sick of this I’m so young and it’s only gotten worse as time has gone on I’m genuinely terrified that it will keep getting worse. I’m tired of telling myself that it’s going to get better and that I just have to keep pushing and trying but it doesn’t and never has idk why idk what’s wrong with me. I can’t find a woman who genuinely likes me either I don’t know what’s wrong with me I mean I’m not the greatest looking but I’m not ugly I workout frequently and am in good shape but I’m just not enough. And it’s not cause I’m depressed like this like I said I never show these kind of emotions. But for instance I recently had sex with this girl that I’ve known awhile and we began talking every single day and then she hits me with “I find you really attractive and we get along well and we vibe together but I just can’t see us in a relationship” like why what’s wrong with me idc about sex I want someone to spend genuine time with and I just can’t find that idk what’s wrong with me I do everything I’m supposed to and it’s just not enough. Idk there’s so much i want to experience but idk how much more I can take. Idk I just wanted to vent I can’t sleep for some reason even tho I only slept 3 hours last night I just want the day to end and I can’t even sleep.,2,depression

"My wife has depression and I'm always trying to learn and support anyway I can. A common issue we run into is that she can let very minor things totally de-rail her day. For example if I was to say ""yeah we can do that"" vs. "" yeah I'd love to do that"" she will overthink the sentence and take it as I'm only doing the activity because she asked and I'm not actually happy to be doing it which could lead to her thoughts and mood to spiral. The only thing I've seen work so far as a solution is to just talk out whatever the situation was about and give her space until she can bounce back and then she'll come to me when she's over it. This solution is ok but depending on the bounce back time can take 20 mins or sometimes up to 24hrs for something bigger. Is there anything I can do that's more preventative instead of reactionary to this situation? Or is this just a normal symptom of depression I need to be patient and sympathetic for?

"My mom just got diagnosed with colon cancer with brain mets. 
2 weeks ago she was a perfectly healthy 65 year old, although a smoker all her life. Suddenly she seemed ""off"", as in not her own self and seemed confused all of a sudden. Couldnt tell what date it was, what year etc. I called an ambulance, thinking she had a stroke, but MRI showed 5 brain mets. One large at 3cm on left frontal lobe which is the one causing cognitive problems, and 4 smaller ones at 6mm at the back of the brain. She has large amount of edema (7,5cm diameter) around the largest tumor. She was started on corticosteroids immediately, which has helped, but she is still not herself. 
Today we found out on CT scan the primary tumor is in colon, 10cm length of one tumor. Seems like rest of the body is clear. 

Colon cancer never gave her any symptoms, still doesn't, but the brain mets were causing symptoms which let us to believe something is going on. She doesnt have any pain and feels like she is fine. 

This all has happened in 5 days. We are all confused and dont know what to expect with this. Doctors said they are waiting second opinions on both, colon and brain mets. The most likely approach (according to doctor) would be surgery for colon and radiation for brain mets. My mom tried asking the doctor today for prognosis, but doctor just replied ""I dont like giving numbers cause they are always off"". 

I have been googling like crazy and everything says that this has a very bad prognosis. My mom seems happy with this, I dont understand why. I guess she thinks this is better than lung cancer with brain mets or something. 
They are saying that she will be discharged from the hospital tomorrow, and going home to wait for the second opinions and treatment options. I live 1,5hrs away and my mom lives alone. I got 3 small children and I work 5 days a week, but can work remote. I am thinking about moving in with her and try to take care of her, she wants to return home so badly.

"Please be patient while reading. 

I have been an introvert since childhood. But I was a happy introvert. I had a good friend circle, I was confident, I was getting straight As and I even had a healthy relationship. 

I had a brutal breakup, family issues, academic failure and covid isolation all in the same year (2020-2021). 

I slipped into depression. It was very bad. I isolated myself and cut people off from my life (everyone). I lost all my self confidence. I didn't utter more than a few words in 2021-2022. 

I came to college in 2022 August. I faced a lot of discomfort interacting with new people, making new friends and I again isolated myself. I rarely talked to anybody. Although after a lot of constructive introspection and self-care I managed to get better and I brought myself out of that depression. I regained the motivation. 

But even now I can't ""talk"" to people. I am confused whether it's in my nature that I don't like ""talking"" or that I have just become worse in expressing my thoughts. My friends go out in groups a lot while I just sit in my room studying or watching something. I can talk for hours if it's business or academic related, I can express my idea clearly and just when the discussion about the project is over, I will stop interacting at all. 

I am worried it's going to cost me potential friendships. Or relationships. I want to talk. But I don't know how. And I have tried talking, I sometimes talk with my best friend (whom I reconnected with just a few months ago) for an hour or two. So is it about me being uncomfortable around new people or something else?

"a little brief background about me. i feel like i always had anxiety growing up. at the time, i didn't know what it was nor i was familiar with terms such as *depression, anxiety, mental health, etc.* so it didn't occur to me that i had anything of that nature. i wouldn't say i had intense moments of anxiety, so much that i couldn't live out of my life, but definitely abnormal tendencies, though not to the extreme.

after a very traumatizing part of my life at the age of 19, i have since noticed more of this. i could feel a big jump from the anxiety i had before, after, and in present day. before, i had a little bit of it, but it was manageable. after, it was like i was constantly on anxious mode all the time (heavy breathing, instantly triggered, weird feeling of scaredness/worriedness/on-the-edge every second of the day). after 3 years of having CBT, working it out with therapists, gaining more experience, and time, i am in a much better place, though i do feel like NOW i am not directly affected by anything, but more so still dealing with the reminiscences and habits that i had gained from these past experiences. for example, sometimes i get anxious for absolutely no reason. i just wake up one day and boom, anxious. it's happened so often that i can sort of estimate when i'd have my next anxious day because it happens almost so consistently. another example would be my fear of men. 19-22 year old me was absolutely scared of men, and although i have come a long way, i still feel uncomfortable around men. i identify men as men. the first thought i have when i am interacting with men is that they are men, *what if they this and that*, *what if he asks me something that makes me uncomfortable* and i don't say no, or, *can i trust myself around him?* i definitely brought this up to my therapist. unfortunately, we only had 12 weeks together, for it was free and based on a study, but due to limited time we weren't exactly able to work on it.

anyways, what i am trying to get at is that i am definitely getting better. i am seeing the changes, but... will i always be this way? is this who i will be like for the rest of my days? am i never actually gonna defeat anxiety?

i want to add that i am in no way trying to minimize real individuals with real experiences of anxiety. i know that there are a lot of people in this world who deal with severe anxiety so i don't mean to offend anyone. i am hoping to look for some clarity with all of this and to rant as well.

Edit: after doing some more research, i can confirm that i am at a healthier place with my anxiety! that is to say that i believe that my anxiety is more or less of the normal ""quantity"" that all humans are innate with. i think what makes me slightly ore anxious than the average human is that because i have experienced intense moments of anxiety in my past, i get a little more anxious due to the anxiety because it takes me back to a place that i do not want to remember. however, there are other parts of my life like my fear towards the presence of men that are a constant in my life, and some might categorize that as an interference in my regular and everyday life. i hope that makes sense.",4,anxiety

"Hello,

I've been having anal GI symptoms (fissures, leakage) for probably 15-20 years, along with fatigue that's been worsening.  However, for the past 5 months and after a gastroenteritis bout, I've been feeling much worse: joint pain (specifically knees, hands), nausea, and occasional vomiting.  I've seen a rheum. and all my joint imaging came back normal (e.g., normal SED + ESR, x-rays, ultrasound).

A few weeks ago, I had a colonoscopy, which came back with ""focal active colitis"" (FAC) in the rectum from the pathologist's biopsy analysis.  Also, the GI found that I have a mildly prolapsed rectum.  The GI said the FAC was from the prolapse, but I can find no mention of such a thing (inflammation being caused by prolapse) in the literature.  I'm wondering if this diagnosis makes sense or if I should seek a second opinion.

Also, re the FAC, I haven't abused NSAIDs, have no current infection that I'm aware of, and the literature I've read indicates that FAC is only a symptom of bowel prep in cases where people use phosphate prep., which I didn't (I used propylene glycol + biscodyl).

"I’m so sick of scrolling through TikTok and seeing mfs make these silly goofy ahh vids depicting autism as this cute lil quirky thing. Honestly it offends me. As an autistic person I genuinely feel like only showing the “goofy ah” side of being autistic is really harmful. I feel as though it’s just going to give people another reason to fake being autistic, because they might think “omg being autistic is like so cute tehe”. And making videos of you stimming is not awareness. If you’re going to make people aware of autism, then actually make them aware. Tell people about the struggles, not just “cute” stims or special interests. Talk about sensory issues and the genuine struggles. Like for example; one time I was planning on having a McDonald’s but my parents wouldn’t take me so I ended up having a meltdown because my plans had been ruined. But if I tell that to people they will just instantly think I’m bratty or spoiled. It’s also very hard for me to wash my clothes. I have a favourite hoodie and eventually it needs to get washed but I dread that time coming up because without my hoodie I feel horrible. Honestly when I don’t have my hoodie on or at least know it’s in the room with me it genuinely feels like someone just hit my stomach and then slapped me. So yeah.

"I have caught myself saying that I want to die more times this year than I would like to admit. 

It's not necessarily that I don't want to live.. just to feel a moment of peace. A moment of relief that doesn't seemingly get taken away and discovered later to be a complete lie. I hate that I find myself even struggling to write on the internet ANONOMYOUSLY that I am broken and mad and lost and I wish that my parents gave a fuck about me, I wish I was a priority with friends, I wish I was anyone's choice and I understand that what I'm asking for is too much..  I struggle with CPTSD, ADHD, incredibly high perfectionism + social anxiety.

I feel as though I am lost. I have no idea how to navigate the world filled with weird rules and ways to manipulate others in a self serving nature. Most of the people I have met love the fun, playful, positive and excited person I am - but are never consistent in showing up or working with any part of me depressed or miserable. More often than not, I am told that my grief around not being anyone's first choice or priority is just loneliness and I need to embrace being on my own... How will that heal the pain or allow for healing of the grief that I hold over the fact that I am absolutely no ones choice? Not a first choice, second choice - nothing. I've attempted to articulate this before but continue to hear the same thing - ""learn how to love yourself, be alone, and become your first choice and priority. That's the real magic!""

I try to not hold resentment over the people that treat this like it's so easy to move on from. As if they don't call their parents daily or have someone to reach out to when they are sick, have a challenging day, get into a car accident, need support with their kids.... but honestly, fuck, it is so hard to feel so alone and not a single person can understand this. I am perfectly content being around myself, I love doing what I do on my own, and that doesn't change the fact that I don't have a safe home base outside of myself at all. I'm 32 and I feel like I've been alone my whole life and I am grieving without any end in sight. 

I been struggling with my health for years, very significantly over the past few months and today, I heard back that my body has high nuclear antibody title displaying a homogenous pattern that is suggestive of Systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic autoimmune hepatitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. I'm scared, and I'm alone, and I don't want to do this anymore. 

I feel like I am already struggling with so many basic aspects of my life... how can I keep motivating myself to keep living, when all I want more than anything is to put down my sword and rest? I guess really the whole point of me even writing this was to speak it out loud, my attempt at going somewhere for a virtual hug where I may get ignored and not noticed but at least a hug won't be rejected as I cry.",2,depression
"So my anxiety consumes and covers me like a veil just randomly comes and go as it pleases. But the problem is, when it’s present I am often unaware. My thinking patterns do not change and my world just slowly feels heavier. Before I know it, it creeps over me and holds me captive until it leaves in a rapid “whoosh.” 

This leads to health problems. I grow pale, I look terrible, I feel terrible, I get fatigued and physically ill. 

And once I’m to the breaking point and I feel like I’m just ill or that I’m trapped forever, it disappears. I need to know what this is. I don’t really have any negative Or anxiety inducing thoughts or thought patterns. This is just a condition that comes and goes as it pleases.

"I was on Lexapro several months ago and one night for no reason I woke up and had a horrible panic attack. I had never had a panic attack before so this feeling was completely new to me. I didn’t know what it was at first. I thought something was seriously wrong. After that I felt like I never really felt the same. That following week I had another really bad panic attack and I had to be put on hydroxyzine which really helped because I felt in a constant state of panic everyday. 

I switched off of Lexapro shortly after thinking that is why I had the panic attacks. I then went onto Zoloft. I had previously been taking hydroxyzine before bed every night in fear that I would wake up having a panic attack again. I finally tried not taking it during the night and found I would wake up with increased anxiety for no reason. So i would take some hydroxyzine and I would usually be able to calm myself down eventually. 

A few months later I felt like Zoloft just wasn’t doing anything for me so now I am on Effexor. I’ve been on it for a few months now on 75mg. To be honest I can’t tell if it’s working or not. I don’t want to go off of it and realize that it was helping. But Im worried that if I go on a high dose it will mess me up like the Lexapro did. 

I still sometimes feel that increased anxiety waking up if I don’t take hydroxyzine. I’m wondering if that is the meds causing this, or if it’s because of that one panic attack I had that triggered something in me to just feel completely different after that point on.",4,anxiety

"I have anxiety problems that I am in therapy for.  More specifically, I have rage issues in my family (grandfather and father all have rage problems) and while I know I have it in smaller increments than they do, I want to be able to control it or prevent it from getting worse.  That is one of my biggest goals in therapy (along with working on my anxiety in general).  I've had maybe \~5 major rage episode in my life (including today).  So it isn't as big of a problem for me as it is in my dad, I just don't want it to get worse.  I am the first person in my family to go to therapy that I'm aware of so I AM taking steps...

&#x200B;

I was driving home from the therapy session when this happened.  I was talking with my mom and she  she put me on hold.  I was getting off on a highway and merging onto another one, and there was a really slow car in front of me + a car behind me tailgaiting me.   So she came back onto the phone and I said ""please hold on"" (I was getting stressed from the tailgaiting) to which she spoke over, so I said it again - and she continued to talk.  I then yelled ""I said hold on"" and got pissed and hung up on her.  

&#x200B;

Once I was safely on the highway I called her back to explain that I was asking her to hold on and she was just talking over me.  (My mom has a habit of talking over me and I've mentioned it in the past to her.  I do the same and she also gets frustrated.  I AM trying to be aware of this and stop).  So she kept cutting me off & talking over me as I was saying this, so I started getting angry and saying that what happened 5 minutes ago was happening again...right now.  But she was cutting me off/talking over now to apologize for what happened 5 minutes ago (in a dismissive way ""fine,  I'm sorry"".)  So I said what she was doing before is literally still happening (dismissing what I'm saying and just talking over me).  Like she doesn't let you finish your sentence, she kind of just cuts in and talks over you.  And she was saying she's not talking over me....And then I lost control.   I went into rage mode.  I didn't just yell but I went like a notch higher and I feel REALLY bad about this now.  It lasted like a minute of me cursing at her and yelling at how she is always so dismissive & that is literally happening as we are talking about it.

&#x200B;

So she (rightfully so) said she's upset with me now and doesn't want to talk and hung up.  I drove another 5 minutes and called her back to apologize.  This is where I'm trying to get control of the rage and take responsibility (something my father never does).  I said I was sorry and that I wanted to talk about why I'm upset.  I did say that it was ""two notches too high"" and that my screaming was overboard.  I went on to discuss in a much more calm manner this talking over/dismissive talking that was happening is what caused me to get so angry.  But then she was saying she wasn't talking over me at all...so this kind of went back and forth in a MUCH more calm way (from me).  She said sorry a few times but kept denying she was doing it...so I said her sorry doesn't mean anything if she doesn't understand what I am complaining about in the first place.  Like she isn't acknowledging that she is talking over me or cutting into when I'm speaking (she IS doing it)...the conversation went on a bit longer and then we hung up (can't remember if we said bye or it was another abrupt hangup).

&#x200B;

I got to my house and I broke down in my car.  I started crying about that rage incident (that lasted a minute).  It's the exact thing I'm trying to avoid/focus on, and yet it is happening.  It hasn't happened THAT much in my life -- I think it was the stress of the overall day for me + not eating since breakfast (this was 6PM) and my mom was cutting me off too -- I lost it and I took it out on  her.  

&#x200B;

I called her again (from my car still) to talk about all of this.  We both said we were upset with each other.  I said again that I was REALLY SORRY for how angry I got.  She tried to keep defending herself and saying she wasn't cutting me off...and so that conversation began again about how she IS cutting me off and I keep telling her this (others tell her as well...).  We got back to the rage and by this point we were both in tears (she could hear my voice trembling) and I was sincerely sorry for the rage portion of what happened - but I wanted to address what was causing me to snap.

&#x200B;

I compared the situation to my dad who NEVER apologizes for getting into these rage modes.  He just ignores it and pretends like it doesn't happen.  I told my mom that I'm calling her because I don't want to be like him.  I wanted to discuss (in a calm manner) what was causing me to get angry, rather than not addressing the issue.  We went on to talk for another 5-10 minutes and said our goodbyes (said ""I love you"" to each other which I almost never say to my mom).  We spoke again after she had dinner and I mentioned to her that I was in therapy for this exact reason (to deal with the rage stuff).  We then spoke for another 20 minutes about unrelated stuff...

&#x200B;

\*Now I think after the initial yelling/rage episode I should NOT have called my mom back so soon.  I should have waited until after I was done driving and kind of given myself a chance to cool off but at the time I wanted to address it head on.  I plan to discuss this with my therapist next week but after that will not see her for almost a month.  I'm kind of looking for general advice on working on that kind of rage issues.  TBH I'm not sure if the therapist I'm seeing is even helping me with this (we were talking about it today but that is my vibe in general after \~8 months).  My doctor mentioned Lexapro for me two weeks ago as a suggestion if I'm not able to control my anxiety and if it is getting worse....  Is that a good idea?  I do have some Alprazolam (Xanax) that I have and I DON'T want to rely on that at (I did take one today but it is rare for me to take these).  I want to keep practicing what I'm learning about techniques about anxiety but this rage issue is what I'm truly focusing on figuring out how to deal with.",4,anxiety

"Hello! I am looking for some support and advice on hyperventilation.

Over the years I began to develop this hyperventilation habit, where I'd take unnecessarily deep breaths out of anxiety and slowly and slowly it became my most prominent anxiety symptom, and especially more this past year when my anxiety turned into nonstop panic.

A week ago, I was prescribed Sertraline (50 mg) to take daily, and quite honestly it has already made strides to my anxiety, and has helped a bit with the hyperventilating.

But my problem now is I have noticed it must be a habit of my own breathing now rather than just out of anxiety, likely for the years and more recently the intense months I struggled with anxiety without help.

What I would like to learn, or get help with, is how can I rid myself of this habit. To explain a bit deeper, when I hyperventilate, it's not what people think like a sudden rapid fire of breaths, rather mine is every 30 seconds to (I've been getting better at not doing it so often) a few minutes, I take this intense gasp of air through my mouth in order to get a satisfying feeling in my chest, almost like I am addicted to some type of substance and I need my fix every 30 seconds to a few minutes. Some people say I sound like I am sighing because the gasp is very much like a sigh, it's like an almost relieving breath of air that does more satisfaction than simply breathing through my nose or even my mouth (as I am a bit of a mouth breather due to my weight - don't make fun of me haha).

The problem is, I never hated these deep breaths, they've always given me a satisfactory feeling in my chest. However this past year, my anxiety skyrocketed, and these breaths were not always satisfactory, it was no longer a failsafe for my anxiety, but a symptom of it, and the satisfaction in my chest with these really deep gasps of air has gotten fewer and far between that they leave me feeling breathless often, and bring on the more traditional hyperventilation you see in media like the rapid fire breaths, I'll essentially inhale air until I get that satisfaction in my chest.

The issue is it's just become such a horrid habit that has exacerbated my anxiety even deeper and caused me to hit this bottom point where I decided to finally try medicating the anxiety, but this habit still persists, and I've out of fear started to believe it will end up worsening.

I am very familiar with habits, I chew on my shirts a lot during anxiety and stuff like that, but this breathing is just something else, I fell into it for far too long and it has now become a second nature thing, where I get this knot in my chest if I don't gasp for air. I plan to work on this with my therapist and healthcare team, but wanted to get a head start on providing if any relief sooner than through therapy.

Thank you for any input :)",4,anxiety

"I finally mustered up the courage to ask my psych for an ADHD eval. I got the results yesterday.

I do, in fact, have ADHD (primarily inattentive type) but she said I scored way higher on the autism part of the test. I'm really not sure how I feel about a memory/focus test being used to diagnose autism? I'm not a medical professional but that just doesn't make sense to me. 

I also didn't realize I was being tested *for* autism. I thought I was just taking an ADHD assessment. I feel kind of violated about it? Not that I'm mad about being autistic (I have suspected for a while now) but I wasn't really interested in pursuing a diagnosis because

1. There's no ""treatment"" for it
2. I've heard you can be denied medical care for being of unsound mind or whatever

So yeah I'm kinda miffed that that's on my medical record now. I don't really need another reason for doctors to belittle me and talk to me like I'm stupid.

The other reason I'm upset is that my psychiatrist seems reluctant to prescribe stimulants to me because my ADHD ""isn't severe enough"" (compared to the autism I guess? idk) even though I've already expressed that I'm struggling with task initiation and follow through, as well as time blindness- which is all severely affecting my work.

She increased my Wellbutrin rx and said we'll meet again in 6 weeks to see how that's working. If there's no impovement, she'll add strattera. Hopefully things will improve, but I'm also worried that if they don't, she won't want to try a stimulant.

She very briefly mentioned some behavior therapy to ""help"" with the autism (and I mean very brief). I'm hoping it was more of a ""this is a thing that exists"" comment and not a ""this is a thing you should do"" comment, but I'm still wary. I don't really struggle with the ""classic"" neurotypical ideas of what an autistic person struggles with. And I also couldn't give less of a shit if people think I'm weird or hard to talk to (although I think the general consensus is that I'm funny and easy to get along with).

I like her as a psychiatrist, she has generally been very good at listening to me and letting me decide what kind of medication I need. I guess I'm just worried she's going to start treating me differently now because she knows I have autism.",1,autism
"I do get it. I can mask so well I seem like a happy and social person to a lot of people, or at least just normal. I can look people in the eye, I can make small talk, if I didn’t get someone’s joke/ what they’re trying to say I just pretend I got it and get away with it. No one can see that I didn’t get their joke they just told, that the sounds are making it very hard to listen to you, that I’m sweating and that your eyes are hurting me, it seems like I’m doing just fine. If I do show a bit of my symptoms, I come off as weird or rude. 

 It makes me wonder if I could even be autistic if I can mask to this extend because sometimes it doesn’t take that much effort, or maybe I’m just used to push through these things no matter what. Sometimes I’m scared I’m just an overreacting attention seeking neurotypic (even though I’ve only told a handful of people about my diagnosis) even though I can finally relate so much to autistic struggles and other autistic people in these subreddits.  



I also be on the verge of a meltdown because of everything happening around me, but due to traumatic experiences from the past I’m extremely good at pretending everything’s fine. I’ll just be my ‘normal self’, then as soon as I get home I’ll hit myself, throw things around me and cry hysterically.
Ever since I was a little kid I would only do this when I’m alone because I knew my parents would just act like I’m doing it on purpose for attention, even though I know my emotions are so intense for me I just explode. In social settings I’ve always daydreamed/ sort of dissociated when I’m overwhelmed to cope, but if I am alone, overstimulated and one little thing goes wrong all my frustration gets out. No one sees that.


I just hate that people think I’m not having that much struggles with my autism, or that “it must be really mild then”, or “maybe I’m just a HSP!”, just because I appear to be ‘normal’ most of the time. You don’t see me struggling with emotions, doing simple tasks at home or understanding things. You don’t feel all the things I feel in my body when I’m with you.

"Hi everyone. 

This might take a bit to explain so bare with me here. 
My boyfriend left for Basic Training for the army 2 weeks ago, and my anxiety has been off the rails - always assuming worst case scenarios. I was able to get a few calls while he was waiting to start, and it put my mind at ease a lot for a few days. 
When he actually started basic, his parents weren’t able to write down his mailing info for letters. 
Well, my sister is friends with a lot of people at the base he’s training at. Her ex husband is a captain there as well. I mentioned to her that we didn’t get his info, and she ended up asking her ex husband to get it. 
Ever since then, I have been spiraling about if that impacted him and made him stand out (which in this situation is not necessarily a good thing). And then, I talked myself down from that ledge, because with how things work there they’re not allowed to only focus on one person… and why would they, they don’t even know him. 
I did, however, write in one of my letters to him a brief explanation of what happened and that I’m sorry if it DID cause any issues for him briefly. 
Now… I’m spiraling thinking what if he reads that and gets mad that something COULD HAVE happened and blames me for any issues or thinks I’m the reason for any of the attention he gets? I don’t think it even makes sense after typing it all out but I’m still concerned I shouldn’t have even said that in the letter. Ugh. How can I get out of this negative thought spiral?

"I’ve always been and remain a very avid reader but for some reason, for all of my life, I’ve been resistant to audiobooks.

Also, although I read and love all sorts of books from all sorts of genres and authors as varied as Ovid and Heinrich Heine and Edith Wharton and Zadie Smith, science fiction — with a couple of exceptions like A Canticle for Leibowitz* and *Gravity’s Rainbow* which are atypical of the genre — is a genre that I’ve never been able to sit down and read, despite actually being interested in a lot of the concepts.

What’s interesting is, I’ve purchased copies of most of these books, either to read along or to keep reading when I can’t listen to an audiobook for whatever reason, but I still find these books, which I really enjoy listening too, unpleasant or boring to read.

"I don't know why I've slept on this movie for so long, given that I'm a fan of both Christian Bale and Matt Damon, but holy crap is this movie good! 

First off, I feel like it could be enjoyed by both people who are into cars, and people who just want to see a good movie with tension, drama, solid acting and heartfelt moments. 

The movie is less about Ford as an organization versus Ferrari, but more about the journey of Bale and Damon's characters as they try to build the best car they can, despite all the setbacks. It really shows their passion for what they do and the bond that these people had. 

The racing sequences are incredible, and never have I felt so much tension while looking at a rev meter on a car!

"Went on a small trip with my wife and some friends. I asked my younger brother to come over while I was gone and feed my shrimp and gecko. Our relationship has been rocky over the years. He’s 6 years younger than I am. He recently had a baby, and I’m about to be a dad so I figured things would change. Well fast forward to coming home. I go to get my medicine and it seems abnormally empty. I didn’t think much of it. 
Today I was visiting my parents and I overheard my brother telling my mom that he was able to sell the medicine he had mentioned to her and was able to get some money to continue day to day until his next paycheck. 
When I heard him say that it all clicked. I confronted him about it and he justified it with saying he needed the money to pay rent. I don’t care that he stole my medicine. I’ll be fine. What hurts is that he came into my home and STOLE. It could’ve been ANYTHING. 
But the fact that he stole my medicine made it all that much worse. Once I counted he stole about 20 days worth of medicine. Now I have to wait until my next refill date on the 24th. I’ve been without my meds since the 5th of this month. 

I also had to tell my wife about the incident, and she’s pissed, righteously. She doesn’t want him at the baby shower.

"I've been in my retail job for years in a management position. A couple weeks ago my keys glitched out of the matrix. Completely gone, cannot find them anywhere. I'm not someone who usually loses things, mind you. I left work, drove home, stayed at home, went to work the next day and they're gone. I've cleaned everything at home, everything in the car. No dice. Since then I've been trying to keep it from my boss-because he will just use it as an excuse to make my life miserable-and have been using my keyholder's (N who is my friend) keys and swapping back and forth. Today I was using a different keyholder's keys (D who doesn't hate me but we're not friends) while he was working with me and my boss. I noticed towards the end that he has a different set of keys hanging out of his pocket. I never saw if they're store keys or not, but they're on the lanyard D previously used for his store keys.

Some context on my boss: he is very petty, manipulative, and I've seen him weave complex lies for the purpose of manipulation and mind games. He claims to care for me, but he wants to have an affair with me (he's older than my dad) and I've seen him play mind games and mean pranks on another woman who he is currently having an affair with (he has never admitted this). 

Some context on me: I took many hallucinogens and psychedelics while in high school and have experienced drug-induced and non-drug-induced paranoia before. It doesn't plague me every day but often enough to cause me to doubt myself. I was on anti-anxiety medication when I was younger as well.

I feel like my boss and my coworker somehow took my keys and are playing mind games with me. My boss has made jokes about how I lose my keys and at first I thought he was referring to when I misplace them in the store or stockroom, but now the jokes are ringing in my head. I should have a complete set of duplicated keys by tomorrow, but what if my boss is setting me up to blackmail me with the knowledge I have illegally duplicated keys?  What is his end goal? Is he just enjoying watching me squirm and laughing behind my back? Is all of this just another paranoid delusion? If anyone reads this, please, I need an outside opinion.

I don't know what to believe whatsoever 😕 so many things around me make me uncomfortable and wonder if its just me or is there something else I can't seem to comprehend when it comes to social cues.

"I'm new to this community so idk if people have a big problem with self diagnosing, I know some communities don't have a problem with it, but if you do then let me just explain first.

The main reason I'm decided to diagnose myself is because I'm in the military. I've tried to pursue a legitimate psychological diagnosis but if I was really certain about doing that and it turned out to be true, that I really am on the spectrum, then I'd be put up for a medical board and might get separated. I can't afford to get separated right now.

I do still feel weird about diagnosing myself, I've never been much of a gatekeeper when it comes to anything really, not even mental health, if someone says they think they have some mental disorder or some sort of neurodivergence then I don't discount them, but I always tell them that nothing can take the place of an official diagnosis and I encourage them to do that. If they keep doing, just going full-on self-diagnosing and telling people about it and whatnot before they have a real diagnosis then it feels weird to me. I don't plan on telling anyone though, I'd like to tell my mom or dad but I feel uncomfortable telling them something like this so matter of fact when I don't have a professional opinion to back up what I'm saying, part of me knows they're just not going to believe me and tell me I'm wrong. Even so, knowing that I'm not going to tell anyone and I'm just keeping this to myself, I still feel weird about it.

I've been feeling a lot better though, it feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. There's just all sorts of things that've been happening in my life since my earliest memory and none of it ever made any sense, I always felt awkward and weird and I thought something was wrong with me and it really just made me feel awful. Ever since the idea came to me that I might be on the spectrum though, things have just been lining up and making a lot more sense. I try to be as conservative as possible when I try to evaluate whether something ""sounds like autism"" or not, but I'm still biased and I'm not a professional so I'm not saying it with such a high degree of certainty, but it's a really fitting explanation.

It just feels nice to not feel like such a freak or such a terrible person anymore, I feel like I understand myself better now. It used to be that I'd say something weird (apparently) and people would react negatively and then I'd feel bad because obviously I must've  been inconsiderate or stupid or mean or something else, but it didn't feel that way to me so then I felt even worse for not realizing I was being so terrible. Now it's like that feedback loop has finally stopped, I still feel a little bad but now I just feel alright accepting myself for all the weird things I do or say and it all makes sense. I know I'm not a bad person, if I say something that might be inconsiderate of course I still apologize, but now I just don't beat myself up about it because I know I'm not a bad person, and really that's because I've come to understand how I think and feel through my limited research. It feels really good, my self confidence is on the rise for the first time in years.

"For context, I live in Canada and I work for a large financial co-operative in the Property and Casualty insurance sector going on nearly 7 years now. I work from home which I enjoy tremendously. I like the work I do although it can get overwhelming at times. I like the people I work with and I really like the organization as well. We have had many restructures at work; teams have been amalgamated, managers have come and gone, temp assignment coworkers stepping in place of managers while the role is being filled... it's been a wild ride. I received my ADHD diagnosis 3 years ago. During my time with said employer, I have had my fair share of ups and downs being put on Attendance Plans for taking too much sick time off, Performance Improvement Plans due to my inconsistency at work, and was given 2 write-ups for performance related actions (these only stay on HR file for 3 years and have since expired). In the past 2 years I have been consistent and done excellent work, but as anyone with ADHD knows these flashes in the pan can fade and you're hit with little to no motivation - this is where I am now.

During year 4 with my employer I went on a leave for 1 year which led to my ADHD diagnosis with a psychologist after years of struggling with depression and anxiety along with on and off alcohol abuse. I do take medication but it's effectiveness varies. I am speaking with a therapist but effectiveness also varies. Right now in the midst of yet another restructure, one of the best managers I have ever had the joy of working under left after 2 weeks. This was devastating as he had given me so much support with my issues; lots of guidance, empathy and understanding. I am yet again in limbo waiting on a permanent manager and I am anxious to see what kind of individual this person will be.

To get to the meat of it - I am on a ""Sick Note Program"". This means that I must provide a sick note from my GP (who is amazing and very helpful) every time I am off. This has been no issue. Since the temp assignment manager has shown up they have now told me I need to list my ""limitations"" in the note in order to get paid. This has been a struggle since any time I tell my GP I need the note to list my limitations she hesitates. She tells me they do not need to know this information. I had one manager ask me to get a write-up of my diagnosis from my doctor, to which my GP politely said ""the fuck you don't"". I have also been taking too many breaks at work as my mental health has declined and I am into the alcohol again... I was then notified by my temp assignment manager that this may put me on another Performance Improvement Plan which I *really* do not want to go through again. I was only just advised very recently that I can use a certain ""time off unpaid"" code on my schedule if I need a longer break here and there and I am floored as to why I was never told earlier as I could have utilized it sooner.

I want to put heavy emphasis on the fact that **I know employers are not friends or family and they only care about their bottom line.** The organization I work for puts a strong emphasis on mental health and employee support at work but I feel left out. I have made each manager/temp manager aware of my diagnosis/struggles/need for accommodations but since management has been coming and going this is getting very tiring and I am feeling ashamed/burned out. I took this week off to regroup and get back on the bandwagon - I have a call with my GP today and we are going to work on a new action plan. Mental health struggles are never linear. We go through ups and downs, set backs and great strides. I am frustrated by what I feel to be a lack of transparency on employer's side, but I also feel great fear of losing my job. I don't know what sort of accommodations I can have made, and I am worried I am going to be let go. HR is not your friend, but I want to protect myself as much as possible yet I am afraid of reprisal.

I am just looking to get this off my chest in a place where others understand depression, and some may even be able to relate. I am not looking to end my life due to this; I just am feeling depressed and a bit hopeless; so I decided to share a bit of my story in hopes it will help me feel better.   
  
January 6th, 2023, I went to the ER for what turned out to be sepsis of the right leg. In 2013, I was in a car accident which left a wound on my right calf which, for the next ten years continued to open and close and eventually became septic. From that day in January till min March, I was unconscious; partially due to the sedation and partially due to what was to come. During the months of January and February, I coded 5 different times. The first code required 45 minutes of CPR to revive me. Within those months I also became an amputee. The doctors at one point told my wife that it was either my leg or my life, there wasn’t room for both. My wife did the only sensible thing and had them amputate my right leg above the knee.   
  
During these initial months, I had a tracheotomy, was placed on a ventilator, lost the ability to stand or walk on my own due to the trauma of losing my right leg and everything else that happened during my stay in the ICU.  
  
Today during PT, we attempted to stand, and it really broke me when I couldn’t. I have a bed sore on my tailbone from my stay in the ICU. They couldn’t move me at all during a period when I was on EKMO and Impala which were keeping my heart and lungs functioning. It was during this period that the sore became a thing. Unfortunately, because of the placement of the wound, the pain is immense most of the time and spikes when I move, it is touched, or I lay on a hard surface. When the pain became so much, I couldn’t take it anymore while trying to stand, I became depressed and now feel very much a failure. Logically, I know that I have been through hell and back, so not being able to stand the first time I tried isn’t truly a failure, however my mind doesn’t always follow logic. I have cried off and on all day, feeling like I will never live a somewhat normal life again. I fear I will be wheelchair bound the rest of my life and that, though I am still in rehab, I have reached my peak performance from here on out.   
  
After all has been said and done, I feel a little better getting some of this off my chest to complete strangers. I still feel down, still feel like I am a bit of a failure, but I know eventually, I will be my old self.

"(CW: ED, overbearing parents, undiagnosed)

Hi!! This is my second post here. This is also kind of a rant. I am doing not super okay since then but I need advice because I don’t think anyone has made a post like this yet. 

TLDR: my mom is feeding me too much, not leaving me alone, making me go from my house to her house and being waaayyy to overbearing  because of my mental health and hallucinations and I just want to be alone. Is it okay to be alone during this? Am I mad for no reason?

My mom is very overbearing and has been ever since I was small. I (20) live alone and she lives on in the middle of nowhere (farm) where there is nothing to do in a small house. I like my home and feel good living alone with my cats. but since two months ago, she doesn’t leave me alone. A doctor told her it’s best to not let me be alone.

Because of her work, she needs to be home.  She makes me go with her. I am very unhappy at her house and 60% of the week and time I am stuck in her house and the other 40% I’m allowed to be back home.

I have gained weight. have struggled with eating my entire life because of my parents eating patterns. Upset? Eat. Happy? Eat. I learnt to live a healthy lifestyle after living alone. I love working out and going for long walks but now, I am unable to do so because I can’t be alone. She doesn’t get how bad it makes me feel. 

I told my mom that I am upset the way she is making me eat and not allowing me to workout or go for walks. I told her it’s unhealthy how much weight I’ve gained in a short time and now I am very upset because I have absolutely no control over my life and it’s constant bad though and the voices are so awful I can’t stop them when I am like this. My mom said I’m not eating too much but I am. 

I just want to be alone again not because I want to do something unhinged but I am just too overwhelmed. I got taken off all my meds (adhd and birth control for hormones) and I just hate this I can’t take this experience anymore. 

The clinic that will help me will call me next week after a month of waiting to get in and two hospital visits later. 

Can someone just tell me I’m okay to be alone? She talks to me like a child now and I feel so useless here with her. I have no control over my life and don’t want to go from house to house anymore. I just want to be with my cats in my own home.",6,schizophrenia
