The 40-hour work week is pure EVIL.,"I feel like my attention is like a cars fuel tank. Towards the end of an EIGHT HOUR day, I am running on close to E. Trying to do anything (like important to-dos) at home or other enjoyable things is an endeavor. 


Its like I can do the neccesary to survive, which I understand is a blessing. But dear god is it psychologically intensive. Ill spend more time deciding what do to do with what is left of my precious attention. Or start doing something, not get any sort of satisfaction from it, and then just stop. I spent all of my fuel on boring stereotypical office job bs at work.


However if I do these things early on in the day, I can actually enjoy them/get thm done. Hence why needing to dedicate 40 hours a week is so debilitating. Weekends are a dopamine vacation but nothing important gets done and it compounds stress during the week.",1
Apparently I'm ADHD masking,"Okay so, I was diagnosed with ADHD in like 2012, but only recently diagnosed with Autism as well in 2021 so I've been doing some research. I found the term masking a lot for Autism, and while it felt similar it didn't feel completely right. Just now however, I read an article about ADHD masking, and identified with 95% of what was listed.

So, now I'm crying. I'm not entirely sure why, maybe. I mean, I'm pretty sure it because I identified with nearly the whole list of very much self destructive tendencies, but ya know. 

So yeah, apparently I'm ADHD masking, which I didn't know I was doing, and this stupid article is like yeah this'll lead to depression (check), anxiety (check), and substance abuse (no check, hopefully not ever). But also it said that it leads to a diminished sense of self like the person masking might do it so well that they can no longer find their true selfves from hurried under scripted responses and faked emotions. And now I'm like, fuck, I honestly don't fucking know who the fuck I am or what I actually feel lost fo the time, just what I'm supposed to and now I'm just scared and upset and my stupid eyes won't stop leaking so yeah. 

Here's the article I found in ass anyone wants to check it out. https://readykids.com.au/adhd-masking/",1
"Stop telling us to ‘start early next time’ or ‘make a to-do list’, we KNOW.","I was expressing my guilt of not being able to finish my finals revision and meeting any other task deadlines to my friends. It was obviously very coded ‘ADHD’ but they see it as I was just being lazy and trying to get my way through procrastinating. All of them told me “next time, why not just start earlier?” Or “can’t you make a to-do list and set according to priority?” No shit I know that, time move faster than me anxiously sitting around trying to ‘hype’ myself up to start a task.",1
My undiagnosed son (18) was just fired and It’s hitting me pretty hard,I am recently diagnosed and now I feel like everything I ever had issues with were symptoms and now I have an answer. Now that I have done the research and gathered the info on my own diagnosis it is undeniable that my son also is adhd. He was just fired because he is late a lot. Understandable. But it’s what his boss told him that is bothering me. They said his life is chaotic and it’s effecting the business and he is not mature enough to work there since he comes in late all the time.  All because of lateness. Not an hour or 30 minutes or half the day. A couple of minutes. Never more than 10.  He’s gotten recognition and awards because of the effort he puts in on the job but because of the lateness he lost his job. Part of it is my fault because I am his ride. But what is really bothering me is I was there. My adhd makes me late constantly. He is not immature. He’s an 18 yr old with ADHD. Undiagnosed untreated ADHD. I had no idea until this year that I myself had it and now I see it in him. My “ could you imagine what you could have done had you been diagnosed and treated from the beginning “ is his life rn.  He’s 18 and I’ve made him appointments for therapy to try to get him treated but he forgets and doesn’t go. I don’t know how to help him and it’s breaking my heart to see him struggle like I did.,1
I can't get anything done unless i am super happy.,"It's basically the title. I simply can't study without having a panic attack, i can't focus on reading a book, i never finish personal projects, and i am just always super demotivated. I went to a doctor last year and went through a lot of tests, and it turns out i don't have ADHD, but i have anxiety. My doctor said that i have almost all of ADHD symptoms but some key things are missing, like some points on memory or something like that, so she can't give me an ADHD diagnostic. I have been taking SSRIs for a month a half now and it honestly  only made things worse.
The only time i don't feel bad is when for some reason i get extremely happy with something, like some time ago when i moved to a better house. I felt like a superhero, like i could do anything i wanted and all that i had to do was have the courage to do it, and then 1 month later i was back laying on my bed and waiting for the day to end. It's tough guys :/

TL;DR: I don't have an ADHD diagnostic, i take SSRIs, and the only time i am productive is when i am super happy.",1
Focusing on painful memories during otherwise joyful activities. Does it happen to you too?,"I'll try to keep this from being too long-winded.   
  
Something that has plagued me for years, and even now that I'm diagnosed and on medication, is this reoccurring phenomenon wherein I'll get lost in my head hyperfocusing on painful traumatic events from school (sometimes old jobs), while I'm in the middle of doing things I love (or it can even be stuff I don't particularly enjoy such as chores).

&#x200B;

As an example, I am a musician and a game designer, more proficient at the former than the latter since, but I've had a passion for both (or just creating ANYTHING) since I was a child. I also have a deep passion for cooking. So there I'll be, tweaking the rhythm section on a song, working out why the heck I can't get the dang main character to move to the left when he jumps, or simply trying not to make a mess while thickening the roux for the night's meatball and vegetable dinner; the task at hand seems to be done almost robotically, though I am actively thinking about it. It seems though that most of my **conscious** focus will be on reliving a painful moment from school; usually going over what I wish I would've said or wondering why none of my “friends” ever came to my defense too often, wondering why none of the adults around me could catch on to what was happening, wondering why so many adults who couldn't deal with children were left in charge of children etc. All the while I'm actively doing this task. No one observing me would have a clue that I was focusing on anything but that task.  
  
A little background: I (35M) went virtually undiagnosed until *last year*, which is when I finally got on meds. I'm still getting used to the meds, but they are definitely making a difference and have allowed me to accomplish a lot of things I otherwise wouldn't have. YAY! I just wish they didn't feel like they went right through me after only three hours. Boo! (Also I say “virtually undiagnosed”, because I recall at least one failed attempt to get a diagnosis in my *YOUNGER* youth. Came up negative, so then came the “well there's no excuse blah blah blah” song and dance from the adults).   
  
For what it's worth, I went to **14** different schools in my school “career”, not including the few blissful years I was homeschooled. I'm *not* a military brat, in fact the entire duration I was in school, my family **only moved** ***once***. Every other school year though, I was in a new school environment. Sometimes the start of the year where I could kind of start fresh, many times right in the middle of the year where I had to be the new guy. School is a HUGE sore spot for me. I have so much resentment and untreated wounds from those days (some physical). It seems the downside of being recently diagnosed means I'm going back into these memories and making sense of everything and having to relive things that I was trying to put away. Pre-K through second grade were...ok, but not horrific (all the time). When I discovered my appetite in the third grade, began gaining weight and started wearing these big dorky glasses, things just kind of went downhill from there socially. I've got so much to tell and get off my chest but at the risk of writing a huge book here, I'll save it (unless you're interested to hear and wanna compare notes or something).   
  
I've searched around a few times, but never could find if anyone else ever went through a similar thing. Sure, being stuck in traumatic memories is definitely a thing for us, but what about when you're actively trying to focus on something that's supposed to bring you joy? Can anyone else relate? How do you cope? I know medicine isn't a magic cure-all, but it's kind of frustrating that it doesn't shut any of that up.",1
I cannot survive .,"

I should start with yes I am diagnosed, yes I have experience with meds and know all about what is wrong with my brain. Please no “fix yourself” or platitudes. It makes me want to hit myself .


I am lacking skills in all fields. I am sitting, frozen because I cannot stop hearing my coworkers tell me I drive them crazy, my handwriting is terrible, confusing, and being pushed out. I have no joy in life and I want to curl up and never wake.


I have therapy etc but that does not help when the world has no patience. I only get compliments on my appearance sometimes.  I get insulted everywhere else and I am unsure how anyone can survive. How am I even surviving when I have nothing to survive for? 


Anyways I have tics and my sister finally told me she notices these things.





Yes meds I have and yes I know my specific diagnosis (combined and complex with loads of chronic pain. )",1
Chronic illness & feeling overwhelmed,"I recently got diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. I'm waiting to schedule with an endocrinologist 1.5 hrs away and I'm just feeling really overwhelmed by it all. I still don't know the cause, don't know what treatment will be, or how this will affect me long term.  

I was already struggling to thrive before my symptoms flared- I'm unemployed, living with parents, and feeling so very behind in life right now and this new diagnosis feels like a huge weight when everything already felt like too much. 

How do you manage it?",1
I'm about to quit another job,"I'm  20 years old and about to quit my seventh or eighth job depending on whether you call working for the same company at a different location a new job. I've been medicated for this last job and the one before. I started the medication in september, medikinet. I've worked for a supermarket/grocery store since then and transferred stores recently to become a supervisor. Honestly the variety of the job appealled but i've quickly found how difficult it is for me. i did the training in my old store and just couldn't cope . i've done marginally better here but it seems like every job i do i'm crap at and have to quit or face being fired. I'm starting college/university in september to try and open up more career options. I feel bad because i just want to find something i'm good at. I actually felt a while for this job that i did enjoy it and thought i might self-sabotage it or soemthing like that. When things start going wrong initally i take the feedback, try and learn, but when i still seem to screw up i'm like well this isn't meant to be or i'm bad at this. I don't know. I'd be quitting the job anyway for when i move away. I'm honsetly baffled at how a lot of people with adhd go unidagnosed and do absolutely fine in very good,. demanding jobs but i struggle at this; it is a demanding job but i'm intelligent. Unfortunately the things i'm good at aren't easy to monetise.",1
I'm staring at a blank email unable to tell my boss that I still can't return to work.,"I was just in an accident on my way to work at the beginning of the month. I'm really lucky it wasn't worse.

  
I wasn't found at fault, but I can't help but think that if I had taken my meds before getting in my car for the 45 minute drive that I could have had a faster reaction time.. I saw the car coming at me, I could have slowed down or gone into the next lane but I just wasn't in the mindset without my meds. Now my car has been in the shop since the 8th and I won't be able to get it until the 26th where I'll be out of the state and there's a holiday on monday meaning I won't be able to pick it up until the tuesday.   
So I'm working from home staring at my email trying to let them know that it will be even longer before I can return to the office. I can't even begin to write this email because I feel like a failure. I'm scared that because I've been out of the office for so long they will be upset with me or something I don't even know what, but I'm always on edge about being fired. I feel awful and haven't been able to get out of bed on time or take care of myself as well. Idk maybe it's just taking me back to my last accident where I actually totaled my car and couldn't get a car for 6 years. I know this isn't my fault... any of it really but I can't shake feeling like a teen again and being scolded for being so stupid or inattentive or whatever they want to think.  
Anyway it's so fucking hard and adhd in general or causing things like this takes a huge chunk out of me. It feels like, because I'll always have this and always need meds that there is no getting over this. There isn't a light at the end of the tunnel it feels like if not this there will be something I will mess up next week like forgetting an important appointment or leaving a candle lit in my office. I just feel like having this disability just makes the chances of disaster so much more probable. UGHHHH 

Sorry that's the end of my rant. Just wish me luck on attempting to figure out how to write this email.",1
Where do you think the high expectations in the life of a person with ADHD come from?," In my life there are often great expectations of me and my fellow human beings (friends, family, strangers) and also great hopes and a deep longing for a different, better life, which logically have been and are repeatedly disappointed. 

Whenever I was a little satisfied with something, I felt at the same time this irrepressible and deep-seated disappointment and dissatisfaction. When I've been out with loved ones, I've longed for other ""better"" or ""cooler"" people, or complete solitude. And the other way around.

As if my inner self has been playing images of my ""dream life"" to me for so long that I would pick myself up and give it my all to achieve it. Like some kind of intrinsic motivation, but through a constantly yelling and driving drill instructor.

Does anybody have that as well?

In that respect, couldn't we assume that expectations just naturally diminish and become less through repeated disappointments over the course of a lifetime?

I rather have the impression that my hopes for better people, better places, better times have developed in parallel with the disappointments, and that I have therefore developed higher and higher expectations for everything.

And I also know that this is totally unfair, selfish and also quite violent towards other people, because there is virtually no one for me (not even myself) who can make me feel that he/she is enough and I feel good, while I also know that this should not be my right nor my claim towards other people, but I have not yet found a proper, healthy way to deal with it.",1
Why am I like this??,"Warmed up my dinner at 6:00. Walked away for a minute to go to the bathroom. Walked from bathroom to my bedroom. Started up Netflix. Completely forgot food was in microwave until 8:40 when my hungry ass questioned whether I ate dinner or not lol. Found food still in microwave, room temperature… I feel like a sim. It’s hilarious and so frustrating at the same time.

EDIT: decided to just say “fuck it” and ordered Taco Bell.",1
Struggling with daily commute,"I had to move back to the suburbs a couple years ago and been struggling with commuting big time. Every single time I start a new job or new studies, on the first day I arrive super organised, carefully dressed and combed, my skin glowing, and a nice little make up on; all my lunch boxes and outfits are done for the week, my home is in order, and I have a fancy new notebook and take neat notes. But everyday after that, my structure falls apart a bit more. A week or two later, I go to school (it's worth mentioning I'm changing careers) unshowered, with greasy hair, nothing to eat for lunch, my smoking habit back, dressed like a coat rack,  my notebook looking full of doodles and scribblings, because I can't keep up, and shores piling up at home. I get burned out for running around in transportations (I study in Paris, and the tube is particularly grim, and there's a lot of corridors, few Escalators and a gazillion people, which makes it even more exhausting. This morning when I saw my gigantic pile of dirty dishes, I cried out of despair, and guilt for not being able to cope with what other commuters can deal with everyday, and with some with kids to take care of on top of it. Everyday I want to call in sick just so I don't have to run and can catch up with my shores. Even though I love what I'm studying. Commuting really drains the shit out of me and makes me feel like a failure. Therefore I'm looking for some advice, and, -I admit- some sympathy, people who can relate. Thank you ❤",1
I (f29) FINALLY asked my doctor about speaking to someone for an assessment..,"Her response was “well ADHD doesn’t actually exist in adults”.. now I feel instantly defeated and agreed to blood tests for thyroid and vitamins because she’s certain that’s all it is. Hon, I’m not mentally unstable because my vitamin D is low. 

I believe I am a textbook case. For so long I have suspected it about my dad and my brothers, and now after a journey of self awareness after having children.. I believe I also have ADHD and possibly quite severely. My daughter is only two, and I am not diagnosing her, but I know the chances. I also have a one year old who is very different and I guess … ‘settled’ compared to her.. and I kind of want to atleast see someone so I can have a chance at getting my shit together to give them the best chance at life. 

Anyone with similar experience? What did you do? I feel like the rejection was totally expected in my mind which is why I put it off for so long and now I don’t know if I’d ask again",1
Driving with ADHD: I just totaled my car,"I was driving home from work yesterday and ran a red light. My brain had just zoned out and I didn’t even notice the light. My brain did not register that I needed to stop. By the time I realized I was barreling toward another car, it was too late. I hit the other vehicle, spun out and hit a concrete pole. My car is absolutely totaled, and I have no means of getting to work. 

I feel like my life is ruined, and I could have killed somebody. It has really made me realize that I have no business driving without medication, but it’s so hard to get in my city. 

I live in a college town and all the doctors here assume that anyone who asks for ADHD meds is a criminal. They all want to do drug tests and weekly therapy. Drug tests are fine, but I would lose my job if I had to take half a day off every week to go to therapy. 

I don’t need therapy, I just need the medication that turns my brain into a reasonable facsimile of a brain without ADHD.

I took a few days off work and I can’t even get out of bed. A split second of inattention has severely messed up my life, and I could have killed someone else or myself. I’m scared to ever drive again without medication.",1
I want support and empathy but Dont want a relationship just for that,"Today I wake up feeling just weird, I don't know why but I feel like a melancholy for some reason that even I don't understand, and all my brain is screaming is for me to run into the first girl crosses my way and tell her everything I feel in the hope to feel like someone understands me and I'm not crazy. 
I know I tend to feel extreme crushes for the first girl that shows me the minimum of attention or affection, and I'm sick of that, I want to form more healthy relationships with friends and posbile partners, but honestly I don't know how. 

Today simply is not my best day and I have so much going into my head right now I just felt like writing it down could help",1
I can't regulate my emotions,"Hi, this is my first time using Reddit and I thought I could use some support. I can't regulate my emotions and it's just so frustrating even tho I know I shouldn't be hard on myself. I've been working hard for a school interview that I did today: I hesitated on an answer and after the interview I felt like everything was going bad and I couldn't get a grip of myself. Now I've spent the last hours overthinking and on the verge of tears every time I thought of the interview. I also have this thing when I'm frustrated or overwhelmed where I stop talking and I shut down completely and it made it even worse. I was more angry at the fact that I couldn't find the force to speak or answer texts, but at the same time I didn't want to be alone. Sometimes I just want everything to turn off but I can't find a way to calm down when this things happens. I apologize if this was long but I needed to get it out. 
(P.s. sorry for any mistakes, English is my second language)",1
What good is there in ADHD? I can't see any,"I never get anything done, been a complete failure going nowhere my whole life.

now that I have more health issues happening, I just see it as worse. never been able to hold a job, project, friendships, anything.


I never get anything done, been a complete failure going nowhere my whole life.

I just got a bruise,"I can still feel the sting from it, I can see the red mark on my shin, but I have absolutely no idea what I banged it on. My brain just skipped over that memory.

Bruises being a symptom of ADHD is so confusing. Do I just not notice the things around me? But also, I can't remember what happened? What is my brain even doing?",1
How do you deal with constantly having to explain yourself? And then never being able to completely,"I’m in this discord server and every single time I say something not absolutely literal, or make a claim outlandish, everyone just spams the chat and laughs and then just ignores me having to explain myself. I used to reply in small responses to try and stand up for myself against any single claim, but at one point I decided that every single message would just get buried. So i would just put everything i need to say in one text and send it, except now i’m being made fun of for constantly sending “walls of text.” 

Every single conversation like that becomes an argument and it looks more and more like I’m the villain when the reality is i only talk about things I’m confident in and when i’m wrong i admit i’m wrong; and if i don’t know something I ask questions and will immediately correct it to fit the facts. But this group of people constantly insist i’m wrong instead of taking 2 seconds to listen to my perspective, and in the rare chance that i can actually convey what i mean correctly and adequately, they do admit i have a point. But i always feel like i have a point and before i can correctly explain it, they’re already making fun of me or just dismiss it entirely.

I know at the end of the day nobody has an ego and everyone involved has the power to be convinced, i just feel like i’m constantly having to explain myself and nobody ever takes time to give a piece of mind to my perspective, i feel like it’s always constantly dismissed. I’ve found that in other social situations people do like my thoughts and ideas, so I feel like I have built up enough reputation to have confidence; but in others i feel like they’re totally dismissed purely because i can’t ever convey it correctly.

And to clarify, unfriending them is not an option. This is intrinsically a problem with me and i don’t know how to handle it. Thank you",1
"wtf do you mean ""your bad taste in men is a result of adhd""?!","I was watching the news last week. They interviewed a woman with adhd.
She claimed ""that she needs to date toxic men because else she will get bored of them due to her adhd"". She really sat there and went on ""well, when I date someone normal, someone loving and caring, it's just too boring. Nothings interesting happens and I want to break up with them. But when they are toxic, it's just always something new happening! I will never know what they are going to do that's so exciting!""
I got so mad about that. So if she has children she will also get bored of them or what? It made me so upset because it even was on the news.

Please tell me I am not just ""overreacting"" about this. And that this was clearly wrong to use adhd as a cause for that behaviour.",1
Just wanna say this.,"I am a 31-year-old Korean male. So far, I've quit my job due to fear and have been preparing for employment. But whenever I enter a new workplace, I get overwhelmed again and end up quitting once I receive responsibilities. 

Currently, I am in my second month of studying in a machine learning programmer course at a boot camp. However, I want to run away again. I don't think I will become a qualified candidate for employment in just six months, and I have no confidence in handling team projects or personal projects.

"With the concept of body doubling mind, do you think that breakups(or any form of losing a really close person) hits harder for people with ADHD. What's your experience with it like.","Im going through a no contact era with someone who I cared about a lot. And it's got me sad obviously, but I feel relatively healed from it. Grieving is a process, so I don't fully expect the feeling to go away.

It's just I feel so stuck, I do have things or life goals I want to do, but I can't help but feel like it'd be easier to actually do them/start them if I had him doing his own life things with me, if that makes sense. I know body doubling is your productivity increase when someone is in the room or on the phone with you. So I'm not sure if it applies to just being in my life makes things easier.

im pretty sure i was misdiagnosed,"19, f, latvia

i started my journey of trying to get help by going to my family doctor(?) and she said that i'm just a bit stressed and disheveled bc of exam season and made me buy 20€ brain vitamins. i called bs and booked an appointment with a psychiatrist. 

this morning i went to the psychiatrist to possibly get some help with my adhd. i haven't been diagnosed with adhd but i'm 99% sure i've had it all my life, almost everything associated with adhd i've seen online i can relate to. i've taken hundreds of online adhd quizzes(and other mental disorder quizzes to make sure) over the course of multiple months. only adhd applies. so today at my psychiatrist i tell her everything i feel, maybe leave something out because i was pretty afraid of being told i'm wrong and stressed bc of seeking help in a post soviet country since every boomer almost doesn't believe any mental illness, other than like depression, exists. she gave me a sheet of described feelings and how much i relate to them. the questions were like ""my mental state makes it hard to maintain my house, do school/work"", ""i feel i'm not as good as others"" etc so i thought it was a general sheet, i answered truthfully. later she tells me that it was a depression assessment sheet and that i scored moderate-high depression. that didn't feel right but i thought maybe, bc i hadn't thought about having depression. she prescribed me Sertralin and sent me home. 

now i'm thinking that she was very wrong because i don't feel depressed. those answers in the sheet were because my undiagnosed adhd makes it hard to do tasks as well others at the same age,education level so i'm just insecure i guess. i thought that if i come in saying that i feel i have adhd, she should've given me an adhd assessment sheet, not something else that she thinks might be it. also when i told her i started getting suspicious and looked up information online, she kind of scoffed and asked ""and why did you use the internet "", then asked another question before i could even answer. 

i really feel like i haven't been heard after waiting for this day for so long. looked up that Sertralin may make adhd worse so my hope is that if it gets worse, after a month i can tell her how awfull my adhd symptoms are and that she maybe would consider thinking that i have adhd, if not, i am going to try to find another psychiatrist that would actually listen. i don't know what the point of this post was, i guess to let my frustration out.

also i know that a psychiatrist can't really diagnose me but i had no clue where to go, i'm using misdiagnosed as, i guess, misunderstood?",1
Probably getting fired tomorrow,"Just got an email from my boss for a performance review meeting tomorrow when I start work to discuss my performance, role expectations and ongoing employment.
Problem is, I’ve already had my quarterly review. I’ve been late a lot and made mistakes, but I feel like I’ve been improving slowly. I think being late was really a big one. The train I would normally take was replaced by buses for a while and I just couldn’t adjust to the new schedule. I struggle so much with time management and fucking admin. It’s supposed to be easy but it’s not for me. I had the same issue last year with another admin job I had. 
I just wish someone could tell me what I’m supposed to do. What job can I even do and be successful at

Edit: So, I did get fired. I’m strangely at peace with it having had so much time to think about it. I didn’t really get a chance to mention my ADHD because they essentially started with the termination part. 
I know it was the logical decision to let me go. I wasn’t improving and I’ve been struggling emotionally lately. We parted on good terms and they offered a counselling service and an Uber home. 
I’ve no reason to hold a grudge, this was just another lesson for me. I’ve got a friend/former co-worker who works as an animal attendant and he’s mentioned his workplace is hiring so I might apply there. I’d still have to manage my time but at least it’s a hands on job, and I love animals. Thanks for your support everyone",1
My brain is broken… i hate living like this,"I (24f) have struggled with my mental health for as long as i could remember.  Depression, generalized and social anxiety, panic disorder then later finally diagnosed with Adhd and autism. Every day I’m learning how Adhd and autism has been the root to a majority of the shit i go through….
I see posts on TikTok about these and  usually they’re pretty funny and relatable but at the same time, i feel like it tends to put a pretty bow on something not pretty in the slightest. This shit is destroying me every second of my life. It’s so isolating, i feel like an alien disguised as a human trying to play a role i know nothing about. 
Everything is difficult all the time, does not matter how hard i try. Im so tired constantly, everything leads me to burn out. I don’t know how to properly communicate with others, nothing i say ever seems to make sense to others. Everyone always thinks im lazy, insensitive and overall don’t care. I seem like such an obnoxious shit person, im so goddamn annoying. I have no idea what actual true success feels like, just “thats good enough i guess”. Im never good at anything, only terrible or alright but nothing worth raving about. 
I cant hold a job long enough before being fired or quitting for being miserable. I barely graduated high school then ghosted community college because i cant even handle a cheap liberal arts degree. 
I don’t ever feel like i belong anywhere, i hate myself and this all feels like a pimento or something. My brain is broken, i hate being here and living like this but theres not much i can do about it. Im stuck with a piece of shit brain forever",1
Low frustration tolerance,I had ordered some shoes in a size larger thanlst of my shoes are and they're too small. It said that they fit large but I wanted some room for my insoles. They barely fit without insoles. I feel like I could cry. It's no big deal to exchange them for a bigger size but it feels like this small thing has ruined my entire day and I'm now super worried that my feet have gotten bigger and it will be super hard for me to find shoes that fit well,1
I can't stop causing car accidents. I cannot focus!,"I have adhd and I cannot get meds due to the shortage. I cannot focus while driving. I have four car accidents on my record, one more and I will lose my license. (Four accidents in three years). It may not be long until I get in my fifth and final (final becuase I will lost my DL and will no longer be able to drive).

What am I supposed to do? I cannot even afford insurace. I only make $10,000/year. My entire paycheck always goes to car insurrence already and it will be going up more now that I just got in another accident.",1
Entitlement?,"My friend said people who don't get bachelor degrees are lazy.... so she was essentially calling me lazy. Because of my adjd it took me 5 years to just get an associates and this was before i knew i had ADHD....I said congrats on her grad post and she ignored my comment because she  got upset that I re-shared a Facebook  memory of me getting my associates on the same day she got a masters degree .....that was completely paid for by her mom if ill add. She said im overshadowing her by posting a memory!? I bought her and made her amazing grad gifts and I just re-shared a memory?
She's gonn be making 100k a year while I make 30k. Why is she acting like this!?",1
"When did you guys learn to trust your emotions, if ever?","It seems the emotional disregulation is one of my strongest symptoms that continues on even as they increase my dosage. I don’t know if my reactions to things are justified. I don’t know if someone being incredibly rude to me is actually someone being so, or if it’s just my emotional reaction derived from my condition that makes me perceive it that way. I can’t trust what I feel is actually a reasonable reaction. Feedback from others is that “you can’t control how other people act” but it just sucks having such strong reactions to everything. 

Did you guys learn to muster this as you got adjusted to your meds or is
this just life with ADHD? (30mg of vyvanse atm)",1
I have just about had it up to goddamned HERE with filling pill boxes,"Between the mental, physical, and neurological ailments, I take a grand total of sixteen pills a day. I have three different sets of pill boxes, and three different administration schedules for up to three different dosages. And unless I fill the boxes on a Sunday, everything gets shot to hell for the rest of the week, because pill boxes is a Sunday job, not a Monday job (obviously).

If anyone needs me, I'll be lying on the floor, having a toddler-style tantrum (rather than doing something useful, like - gee, I don't know - filling my goddamned pill boxes).",1
I might fail my university degree last minute...,"I'm in need of support/advice. I (f24) am a social work student in the UK. I'm supposed to finish my degree in the next month but I very likley could fail my final placement. The reason for my failing will be lack of professionalism (i.e. not responding to emails in a timely manner, failure to arrange meetings with my supervisors, and a few absences that I did not tell my supervisor about beforehand). I was already on thin ice and now, because of a simple mistake where I sent an email to one person instead of two, I probably don't have any chances left.

I feel so stupid because the things that may have caused me to fail were *really* avoidable. I understand that I am probably not meant for social work due to not being very professionally responsible, and I plan to pursue something else after my degree, but the fact that I might have thrown three years down the drain with nothing to show for it sickens me. If I do fail this close to the end, I'll feel like the biggest disappointment/embarrassment and I have no clue how I'd tell my family.

I'm already super behind for a 24 year old. I've always struggled in the work place (especially because I have dyspraxia too). Plus, I've already dropped out of a degree when I was 18 (although that was more to do with physical/mental health problems than incompetencey). I have no idea where to go from here and I'm afraid. 

I have a supervision with my practice educator tomorrow (who sounds like she is at her wits end with me). If anyone has any advice concerning getting through the last bit of my degree somehow, I'd appreciate it. Or if there's any advice on what to do if I *do* fail and have to come to terms with the fact that I wasted three years, I'd also appreciate it.",1
I'm just really annoyed with trying to find someone who can help me get answers,"I'm sorry this will be kinda long and might be hard to read, I'll try to break it up as much as possible.

Ive tried in the past to bring up the possibility of ADHD to a few people. My therapist and APRN both told me that my case is too complex for them to be able to come up with a definitive answer on their own (I also have severe anxiety and they said it would be hard for them to be able to decipher what symptoms came from what). And my parents don't believe there's anything wrong with me besides anxiety. But there also pretty uneducated when it comes to mental health stuff. 

About two weeks ago I had an appointment with someone who is supposed to specialize in testing and evaluations. He wasn't specifically testing for ADHD but it was something I had brought up and he said he would help look into. I filled out general forms that covered multiple disorders, but the only thing he gave me that was specifically ADHD related was one screening test. 

I don't remember what it was called, but it was a test that asked questions about when I was ages 5-12 with a scale of like never to very often. 

The only things I answered ""never"" for were questions about disobeying adults (which I never did because I'm scared of confrontation and I used to be terrified of not listening to authority like teachers) and things like ""did you feel like you were driven by a motor"" or ""did you get up out of your seat when you weren't supposed to (I'm believe I would most likely have innattentive type anyway). And there were only a couple questions like that. 

He then said that, based on that one test about when I was in elementary school and the fact that nobody noticed anything when I was a child, (he hasn't finished going through the general forms) that IF I do have ADHD, it would be ""more on the mild side"" and I could probably leave it alone until I got a proper job and had more responsibilities (I'm unable to work and still live with my family) unless I'm saying ""I can't get up, I can't read a book, I can't start anything..."" To which I went ""well..."" But he kinda just kept talking. 

I really regret not speaking up more because I do have those problems and thats part of the reason I'm trying to find someone who will assess me. Like if I don't have it that's fine. I'm not trying to root for it or whatever. I just want a fair, cohesive test so that just that if I do have it, I know I have options available to me. Not ""maybe but if you do then it's fine.""

I literally had a day a day or so after I saw him where I was trying to get up to go do something, and it literally took me 20 minutes just to get myself to reach out my hand and grab my water bottle because my throat was dry. Like literally 20 minutes of me going ""reach your arm out, just grab the bottle, all you have to do is move your arm a little bit, just grab it."" I read a little bit of a book the other day too, and when I first started I had to read over every paragraph twice because the first time I was only taking in about half of what I was reading. It got better as I got a few pages in, but still. 

And I mean maybe that's related to anxiety or something else idk. But I'm just really tired of hearing ""IF you have it"" and like ""that MAYBE could be related to ADHD"". Like I just want answers and I thought this guy was gonna be a big step towards that. But instead I just got more ""maybes"" and ""ifs"" and it's really frustrating.",1
Accidental staring at the gym,"So, I find it weird when another person stares at me. Because I don't know if I stared in their direction too long, maybe I glanced at them because they popped in my peripheral, or they have the same issues that I do.  But a girl kept looking in my direction after we made eye contact to the point when I walked past her she still had her head towards me and looked back at me when I was grabbing water.  I was like, did I do something? Maybe I stared towards the stairmasters too long while walking in because I was trying to time my routine out based on the crowd.",1
I’m suffering in school god I just wanna disappear from the world,My grades are doing awful because I kept procrastinating and struggled to keep up with work. My motivation is so low it feels impossible to get started. Today I tried to finish a project today removing my phone so I won’t get distracted and sat near my teacher to stay on task. I just sat there for an hour struggling to do something. I could not focus at all my mind was going back and forth between reality and daydreaming. I kept moving and messing with my hair desperately wanting to do something but just couldn’t. It’s bad enough my mom is on my back about this. She says she’s willing to do anything so I won’t stress her out about school anymore but she won’t let me on medication. She thinks I might get addicted I swear the ignorance she has. Last year before summer ended she told me to get all my zoning out out of my system. She tells me focusing isn’t that hard but she really doesn’t know anything. I can’t handle I sometimes wish I could just disappear from this earth not having to deal with all the stress.,1
I need someone to come take my phone from me,"Instead of doing literally anything I end up just scrolling on my phone for hours while internally screaming at myself to do the things I really want or need to do.

My meds don’t really help because I think the dose is too low, but I’m scared to go any higher because if I can’t sleep then it triggers a bipolar episode lmao I’m fucked",1
Inconsistency,"I think one of the things I hate the very most about having ADHD is the fact that the symptoms we experience can vary so incredibly drastically from day to day. I have days where things are going fairly well and like I am absolutely crushing life. Then there are days like today when just maintaining enough mental focus to write this post is excruciating, much less trying to focus enough to actually do my freaking job or to get anything done on my to do list. I have literally spent the last 30 minutes rereading the same two or three paragraphs and then immediately forgetting what I am working on.",1
Rejection sensitive dysphoria?,"I failed a year at college after a major depressive episode last year. This was hard for me to accept since i put so much effort into school, but i did eventually come to terms with it. I'm working suuuperr hard this year and it's gotten me to the point where most nights i dont have to work cause of how ahead i am. I kind of wish i didn't cause now i have nothing to do. Im exercising and drawing a lot, but also smoking A LOT of lettuce. By the end of the day i feel SOOO guilty that i didn't push myself to do extra work. Its like i cant function without outside pressure. I can feel myself slipping into depression again, but i dont know how to fix it this time. Im taking a break from work, im sleeping at good times, im eating the right stuff, but i cant enjoy things without being leafed up. Is it rejection sensitive dysphoria? Or just ye ol depression..? Any tips? Anyone in a similar situation?",1
Afraid the doctor will dismiss me.,"Tomorrow I’m goin to see a doctor. I’ve been suspecting ADHD for a while now, and last time I saw a doctor for a different mental health related thing he talked to me in such a dismissing way I was afraid to even tell them about my suspicion.

This is a follow up visit, but I asked for another doctor because the other one was just so weird (he talked about his own cancer for the whole visit and kinda belittled what I’m going through). 

I’ve compiled a long list of symptoms that I have but I’m still afraid they’ll just say I’m making it all up. Especially because I’ve been previously diagnosed with depression which I really dont understand.",1
Why is rejection so hard with ADHD?,"I hope people can relate to this. I’ve just had my internship as an 19 year old male for 5 weeks and I may get a job there, I was supposed to have an interview with the boss the last day, he told me that I should call him instead because he was busy and that we could do it that way instead. I’ve been procrastinating to call him and it’s because it felt like he didn’t want me to work there because we didn’t have an interview straight away. I mean he didn’t look so busy. Ever since that day i’ve been feeling very unmotivated and not confident.
Why do I have to be like depressed for a week after feeling the slightest bit of rejection?!",1
Adhd burnout guilt,I have good days! I'm very productive and in a positive mood just ready for anything! Then I have bad days. Where I can't focus I can't do anything productive or of value. My responsibilities were pushed under the rug for another day. The guilt after burnout is so horrendous. It makes you feel small and useless. I think I’m not the only one who feels guilty for being unproductive even though it’s probably not entirely my fault. I take some of the blame maybe I did too much before getting task after task done. But also I think “Well other people do this all the time fine” “Why can’t I”! I guess this is just a rant! Today I'm having one of the bad days. Maybe someone can relate.,1
I hate how unsympathetic my GF is,"I am struggling to communicate ADHD to my partner

I’ve been struggling with this for a while now but it doesn’t seem like I can do anything at the right quality or speed to help. My gf and I have been together for 5 years and recently moved in together last year. Over the last year my gf and I have had what I consider to be pretty normal disagreements about cleanliness and chores divided. She has much higher standards than I do which I have tried to meet but we have an argument once a month where she says she feels like I’m ignoring chores until she just has to do them. 

Yesterday we talked again and she said that she expected me to improve more than I have in the last year. I keep telling her I will try to change my system to help me achieve what I need to but she told me not to try but to just do it. I feel like all I have every been able to do is try. I feel like I have been taking on half and have been getting better at cleaning to her requirements. (for example: we split dinner prep and cleaning and a year ago I didn’t consider wiping down all the counters and table part of cleaning up after dinner but I do now) I can definitely get the tunnel vision. She has insisted that she doesn’t want to nag me and I don’t want to make extra work for her by her nagging me but I’m struggling to meet this expectation. 

I have tried a few systems to try to clean different parts of the house on a schedule but it doesn’t always work for me because sometimes I run out of time after work or I’m so tired I get distracted in the middle of the chore and it doesn’t get done. She always tells me I should just listen and not make her repeat herself. 

I struggle to communicate that I have been trying. I asked her last night if there was a way that going forward we could discuss these issues positively when I’m obviously trying but not hitting the mark. For example if I sweep but forget to get under the couch, she could say “I appreciate you sweeping but I noticed that you might have forgotten about under the couch.” She said this creates more work for her and she doesn’t want that. I’m struggling to find a system that will work for us and not make me feel like I’m failing until I achieve perfection. 

We have a dog that causes some dirt/dander and I bought a Roomba to compensate but she won’t let me automate the Roomba routine because she works from home and it constantly goes off in the mornings during her meeting when I leave for work. (Trigger based on when I leave the house) I think I struggle a lot with this topic also because I want to move forward with this person in my relationship and I feel that if we were to have kids and the kids were to struggle with adhd the same ways that I do she would be really mean about it. I love my parter but I just feel so stupid for not being able to communicate the difficulties that I have had for the last 2 decades to them.",1
Any good stories about life trajectories after discovering ADD?,"I've comptemplated whether i had ADD for a while, but i never wanted to conclude anything on my own. I've gone to a university-psycologist for a while, and in the end of the last session she just straight out told me she was confident that i had it. I'd told her that i thought i could have it, but that was months ago. She'd made up her own mind. Maybe it has stayed hidden for so long since i have quite a high IQ, so i've gotten through school fine, although the teachers often thought of me as a daydreamer. The reason i'm writing here, is that today's especially a bummer. I forgot to reply to my acceptance letter for exchange at an elite french university, and i have friends from the university that think i'll be there next semester.  I got accepted to go to one of the best universities in the world, and i didn't even manage to reply. As you can imagine, i feel quite useless and sad at the moment, so i was wondering if some people here have any good stories about how life went after you got the diagnosis.",1
Waking up is the worst part of my day. Every day.,"When does your ADHD seem to impact you the most? 

Mine seems to be when I first wake up and realize what that day entails…what I forgot from yesterday…memories of every time I’ve made a mistake…reminders of why life is so hard (all my fault)…and the sinking feeling that waking up was only the first mistake I made that day. 


Anyone else have issues upon waking up? 

It’s like it takes all of 20 seconds to remember why I wish I hadn’t even bothered to wake up.",1
RSD ruined my friendship.,"I had a friend that meant a lot to me. I loved and trusted him a lot, he was among the first people I told when I was diagnosed with ADHD over a year ago. He told me he would support me no matter what, and I believed him. We had a bad falling out 6 months ago and he ended our friendship. I've been grieving and trying to move on, and honestly I've been making progress.  

But a couple days ago I remembered some things he said to me, like ""You require so much reassurance"". He also said things to me like, ""Are you stupid?"",  ""You're trying to manipulate me."", and ""After all I've done for you. After all the accommodations I've made for you"". That one hurts the worst. And yeah, maybe I did ask for reassurance from him more than other friends,  but with the things he said to me,  I never really knew where I stood with him. I would never, ever speak to a friend the way he did to me.

Now I'm sitting here realizing he never cared for me the way I did him. I was nothing but a burden to him.  My heart is breaking all over again.",1
Missed appointment,"I missed my appointment today which was supposed to finally get me medication after 20 years of dealing with this. I’ve been looking forward to it for months and I’m so frustrated, I rescheduled but now I have to wait another month. I’m not mad I had to schedule so far out, I’m mad at myself because how do I miss something that important?! Now I have to go another month unmedicated, plus I’m starting a new job. I was hoping maybe it’d help me be able to handle working a shift longer than 6 hours without wanting to rip my skin off. Or actually be able to keep up with my schoolwork. Another month isn’t a lot when comparing it to the years I’ve dealt with this, but I’m just frustrated that I got in my own way yet again. Oh and I feel horrible for noshowing an appointment of course.",1

Some days I just feel like something is missing and I don't know what,"Some days I just have this feeling that I'm missing something, like I already checked the homework, I already ate, MI room seem clean enough then, why do I steel feel like I'm forgetting something important?, Most of the time I just ignore this feeling and keep going with my life, sometimes the thing or things I'm forgetting come back to kick my ass, sometimes they don't, but this feeling sometimes just doesn't let me enjoy a perfect day",1
I can't keep going like this,"I'm 21 and I became a nurse not ling ago. I've been working at a hospital for a while and it's been really hard on me. Not only is the amount of work incredibly overwhelming (my department is known for that) but the environment is toxic. The stress and anxiety have been accumulating for these pasts month and I've reached far beyond my limit. I'm tired, sad, and I've lost the desire to do anything at or outside of work. I feel like it's drained my life and as much as I love being a nurse to my patients, I can't keep going like this. It's hurting me a lot and I can't go back to this dark place that I know all too well. 

Just wanted to vent",1
Joy and sorrow at the same time,"Yesterday my psychologist called to tell me about my evaluation. She told me there is no doubt that I have a moderate combined type ADHD. I finally have a diagnosis after a 2 year wait! 🥹 Now my crying 31 y/o ass just needs to wait for treatment ☺️

Sadly when I called my mom (who most likely also has this fantastic dx however she's clinically undiagnosed), she told me something that broke my heart completely. Evidently my dad had discussed some concerns about my behavior with her when I was about 7 y/o, but mom just brushed those concerns aside and continued as if nothing ever happened. I'm really trying to not think of ""what could have been"" but it's freaking difficult when I know that there were people advocating for me as a struggling kid but no help was given to that poor kid who didn't understand why she was different 🥲

So now I'm torn between happiness, understanding, massive sorrow & relief, and also just plain anger.

Thanks for listening to my rant 💕",1
Alvogen naps,"Alvogen IR Adderall puts me to sleep.  I literally take naps on it. Sooo diff from other manufacturers. Why does each feel different?  (I mean, my doc and I have theories).  <sigh>.

Exam tomorrow: I've been so anxious and stressed for weeks and feel burnt out from trying to learn,"I've got 2 exams for my mortgage and protections qualifications tomorrow and Friday. This is the final hurdle to get qualified and be positioned to start working with my dad to take over his business. 


My dad is terminally ill at 60, and when his cancer returned he asked me if I'd train to take on his business that he has built up over years and years. It was just his brother and himself working there but my uncle retired last year so he is solo and doesn't want it to go to waste once he has to step down. So I took it on and pivoted from my own pursuit of growing my fledgling gardening business to a sudden halt and change of direction to do this both for his legacy and my future prospects. I've studied for months and gained the first part of qualifications with this being the final 2/3rds of it to be able to work in the business. I've come back to the UK after being in Ireland with my wife (we moved there when her own father was terminal to support her mum etc), so I'm here in Scotland for my last few weeks revision and exams. 

Since arriving I've mentally and physically dive-bombed and spiralled. I've not been capable of studying properly or consistently as I planned, I've let my nutrition slip greatly and lost lots of weight that I can't afford to, my insomnia is amplified and colluding with my anxiety, stress and low moods to the point where I'm barely functioning. I've had 2 nights in the last week that I've not slept until about 9am and I am feeling so utterly lost and overwhelmed with the pressure of getting past this exam and all it represents. I'm racing against time against my dad's cancer and I simply have to get this done and begin the transition ASAP before his health fails to the point that he cannot work at all and be there to supervise me as is part of the necessary process to be allowed to run the business (I need 6months supervision once qualified to be eligible to run solo). So there is a very meaningful and powerful rationale for being motivated to study and pass these exams, yet I've failed miserably at giving myself a good chance at doing so. 


I've slipped massively into a bad mental space, I'm not doing anything right for myself, both body and mind, and I'm on a collision course with failure. I've spent much of the last 2 weeks here in bed, avoiding life, my studies and feeling entirely consumed with anxiety and depression. I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen yet it has. I'm away from my wife and pillar of support and main source of external regulation. She believes in me and says I'm dojng great and she's proud of me etc but I feel so much guilt and shame when she does because I know I've fallen so far and am letting everyone down. I tell her that I'm not managing to study and when I do rally to open the books that I cant force myself to stick to it for long before I get saturated and feel like nothing is being learned. I turn a page and don't know what I've just read when I reflect on it. My memory and recall is shot, and I know why and that not only am I not helping myself by practicing self care, drinking water, sleeping well, eating regularly and well, exercising, going outside to get done sun and air etc, but I'm also making it much harder through the neglect of myself and health. The sleep has been a nightmare and constant battle. I'm using melatonin, started to try 5htp this week, and nothing I do can override the presets of my nocturnal mind. I'm so very fucked and really don't know what I'm going to do if I can't find a path back to balance and break above the darkness I'm being shrouded by. 

Thanks. Just needed to vent and get this out my head to alleviate some of the obsession of thoughts since they're just building inside my head all the time.",1
"I'm tired of trying and making mistakes and now I'm demotivated about everything, any advice?","I get yelled at by my classmates several times a few months ago and the feelings still linger to this day. Now I feel like trying anything is not worth it because at the end of the day, people will only focus on my mistakes and my brain is wired to make mistakes more frequently than other people, so I feel like trying is not worth it anymore.

I have no motivation to start anything. I just want to get my projects done and sit in my room all day, but I can't, I still have 4 weeks to go for this semester.

It's most likely depression and burnout, but I don't know how to make it go away. I want to start making projects again, but the thought of making people dissapointed in me again is just too much, so I end up procrastinating everything.

How can I make myself feel better? I have several tasks I need to do for the next few weeks so I can't go on a vacation or something. How do I regain my motivation?

I'm on methylpenidate, very low dose, and I take an anti-anxiety meds occasionally.",1
Submitted new patient paperwork for a local ADHD clinic. Finally working on getting a diagnosis...,"This place came via recommendation from a couple of coworkers.  Things have been really rough lately and I have been struggling with some things that may potentially be related to ADHD... But we haven't had the money to get me in somewhere to be evaluated.  I also just ruled it out as me being spacey and scatterbrained with a high caffeine tolerance (seriously, I can have a cup of coffee and still doze off).  So...we managed to scrape together some money (husband has been out of work due to law school for the past three years) and I filled out the 15 page new patient packet for a local ADHD clinic last night.

Now I'm just waiting for them to process and review the paperwork and get back to me with an appointment.  I'm ready for an answer.  I'm nervous and have no idea what to expect, but I'm ready to get myself on the right path.",1
How to deal with being a hypocrite?,"Does anyone else feel like they are the world's biggest hypocrite? It's so frustrating because on one hand I understand my rationalization for the way I do things, and it feels justified. On the other hand, I can't help but feel like a bad person for setting different standards for others than I do for myself.

I know I struggle with time management, and I work so hard to be punctual and prepared. However, it doesn't always work out - sometimes I am late and sometimes I forget things. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect that I am understanding and gracious if others keep me waiting or are unprepared, right? Wrong. It feels like they have committed a personal offence against me. Like they are intentionally disrespectful. Obviously I would never say or do anything to convey this - I am am always polite and understanding because logically I know sh*t happens sometimes. But I still feel so guilty for being so upset by something I know I do often enough myself.

And there is more. I often interrupt people when they're busy, but I hate being interrupted. I live and work in my own cluttered spaces, but hate when people leave their clutter lying around. I often zone out when people are telling me things, and have to ask them to repeat themselves. But I feel in my whole body the frustration and irritation when someone isn't paying attention to what I'm saying. It's such a double standard and I know it doesn't make sense, but it's like an emotional reflex I have no control over. 

I feel like I can never voice these feelings because it's not fair to others, and it's not their fault that I react so strongly to other people exhibiting my worst traits. I feel like I spend so much of my time policing my own behaviour and making sure I don't act in a way that reflects my initial gut feeling. I don't want to come across as manipulative, or that I think my needs are more important than the needs of others. I just feel like a bad person and a bad friend sometimes because no matter how courteous I am outwardly, on the inside there's this mess of negative emotions I constantly have to push down. It's a never ending cycle of feeling like everyone is against me, and then feeling horrible for not being empathetic towards others, and then feeling hopeless because I can't help it. 

Hopefully I am not alone in this (but if I am, pretend you didn't see this lol I'll unpack it later).",1
I literally cannot function after coming back from a conference. I've got total brain-fog.,"As a forward, I also have epilepsy and Asperger's.

I was at a travel conference in DC a couple weekends ago for a hobby of mine. I had a blast, and low-key ended up becoming minor-leage famous in the industry. Part of the reason for that was helping to organize and host the pre-game party in my friend's suite (so almost all the speakers were there, etc). I don't think I consumed a huge amount of alcohol (3 Pacificos and a shot-sized amount of gin and tonic), but probably more than I'm used to. I believe I had a beer or two the following night, and some wine the day before I went home. And I was rather sleep deprived the whole time. Normally I don't drink too often and when I do it's 1 beer.


Anyway, that was two weekends ago. I came back and I'm literally completely unable to focus on anything. I mean I can look at my monitor and stare blankly at it. I'll go into a directory and forget what I was looking for (which was a problem before, but now it's worse). And I'm working at a snail's pace. 


Granted there's also not a whole lot of work for me to do at the moment. I'm kinda of doing busywork. Maybe subconsciously my brain is trying to extend out the busywork because after that I'll have absolutely nothing to do? I dunno. 


But I definitely don't think the conference was a coincidence in making me feel the way I do. I went to Europe last year and came back feeling the same way for a while, but probably less-so because I actually did gave work to do when I got back, too much work to catch up on.


Anyway, thoughts on what's going on and how I can get out of this state of brain fog?",1
Academic Suspension from school,"I’m so bummed. I had to get a 2.00 average for this semester to avoid suspension and I ended up with a 1.67 average: a ‘C’ and a ‘C-‘.  Now I have to sit out an entire semester and reapply.
I’m still  currently unmedicated, but for those of you out there who have triumphed after an academic suspension, I could really use some words of encouragement and advise. 

This is the lowest point of my life. 
I have a 1.68 GPA with 8 classes left so it’s hard to see the positive side. 😭",1
When you meet someone new and you tell them you're a bit forgetful,"In the last years I found out I have a habit of telling new people (potential friends, partners, coworkers) that I meet right at the start that I have memory problems just so they would know what they're dealing with.
I would say to them that often it will happen that I will forget something they would have said or some appointment, birthday or some chore but that doesn't mean that I don't not respect them or appreciate them and I apologise in advance.

When I met my now gf I told her exactly that, like ""Please don't be upset if I forget something you tell me or where we have been a year ago or what has happened at your mom's lunch or if I forget I have to do something, it's my brain, that doesn't mean that I don't appreciate you or care about you..""

And I don't think people really understand, they think oh, ""she's a bit forgetful but isn't everyone?"" But then I see people get frustrated, hurt, they think I don't give a crap about them or their feelings and it's not true, I just CAN'T REMEMBER!
Anyone else has the same problems?",1
"I feel really bummed, I wasn't able to pass my schoolworks.","Just had a breakdown earlier of blaming myself for being so easily distracted and always procrastinating. I don't know what to do anymore man. When I need to get things done, I get so overwhelmed and distract myself on doing other things. Coz if I do get things done early, I always change it and try to improve my work but then I ended up not having any progress and cramming that shit out. I just wanna cry, help me out please.",1
Time perception disorders?,"
Is there any known disorder in which a person experiences their surroundings as being annoyingly slow everyone speaks slow too slow to focus and big gaps between words even typing this the keyboard is like three lines behind literally. And it ALSO EFFECTS HEARING because I speak to my psychiatrist for years and they thought I had something making you see in stop motion but no everything is slow it’s not visual but wholly perceptual — NOT here looking for a diagnosis or to self diagnose but to know what to bring up to them as they seem clueless! I have diagnosed ADHD but apparently this extreme time perceptual aside from just time blindness is not common in ADHD it’s so infuriating thank you",1
Letting People Down,"I let people down a lot. I've forgotten that I'm meeting with friends on weekends/holidays, I zone out of conversations and often ask questions about stuff they already said literal seconds ago.

Sometimes in my mind I'll be chanting ""focus focus"" in my head when someone's speaking to me but I'll be so focused on that word ""focus"", I wouldn't hear a single word they said. 

I hate it. It makes them feel like I don't care about what they're saying. I do care though and it's embarrassing. 

I know they friends are annoyed by it. They know I have ADHD but I don't think they understand it's so much more than just being a bit vague and hyper. They don't understand just how big of an impact having an almost inability to focus on something affects me.

I'm trying so hard to be better but it's so hard and I break down sometimes when I'm alone thinking about what it would be like if I didn't have ADHD.",1
I’m going through a crisis and need advice.,"So to start off, I’m a 26 year old male. I started medication recently and I got emotional because I have wasted my life up until this point. I am living in self-poverty, I am fortunate that I live with loved ones and get support. Moving onto the main topic of discussion. I have a strong passion for astrophysics and I want to pursue this, but I’m scared it’s too late. I don’t know if I can go 4 years living the same way I am financially, I don’t want to keep disappointing the people around me by not being financially stable. I am also scared I might not earn the degree, and for what ever reason if I do would I even get a job. Help me please.",1
I never learned how to learn in school,"I was diagnosed and medicated in kindergarten, thanks to my mom being a specialist. I never knew any ‘struggle’ associated with my school career. I excelled in elementary and middle school, and ‘learning’ was nothing more than just arriving at school, doing work, and then going home. I never really studied or saw the deeper meaning of an education.

When I went into high school, I had no reason to change my ways. And I started to get horrible grades. I couldn’t understand the concepts, I had no scheduling or organization skills, and more importantly, I had no ethic to get shit done. Because I never needed those things.

Every time I try to independently look into a topic outside of school (for example, trigonometry today), my brain crashes again and again into an obsidian wall, and I get frustrated. I know that education is something that I can do. But it’s been heavily stained by these experiences.

My last day is tomorrow, and I’m graduating later this month. My peers are accelerating rapidly towards job applications, prestigious colleges and the like, but I’m sat here struggling to understand trigonometry.

Shit sucks.",1
Took Meeting Minutes Today. My Brain is Fried.,"It took so much concentration to get every little bit of information down, making sure I was ""paying attention"" to every little detail the entire time. The meeting was 2 and a half hours long. I have no idea how I did it other than I just had to because it's my job and if I didn't it would cause problem for me.

My brain is now done for the day. Since the meeting ended over 2 hours ago, I haven't done anything but scroll through Reddit and let myself not think too hard. I don't even care. No one will know and I'm absolutely depleted. All I can think about right now is going home and taking a nap.",1
How do you deal with LOUD people in coffee shops??,"People are so disrespectful and loud in indoor places I’m so confused!! They like yell across the tiniest table for everyone to hear their conversations and I’m supposed to drink coffee in peace how?

ADHD and imposter syndrome makes it extra hard to function,"I have been in a slump for almost three weeks. I got a promotion at work and I somehow feel more scared than excited or happy. I feel panicky and unable to do anything. I feel that I am not deserving of it and it's making it so much harder to get things done.

As a result, my home is a mess again, I am barely managing to care for myself and eat and I can't even deal with much work right now because I feel like I can't do what I need to do to do well at my job even though I know my skills. But it suddenly just feels fake. I don't know how to get out of the slump. I feel so anxious that I'm going to get demoted as fast as I got promoted any day now because of this onslaught of execution dysfunction I've been experiencing.

"Rant: My ADHD is ruining my life, I hate everything, and I don't know what to do","(Sorry this is a long post ahead, not exactly ADHD friendly)

I'm in my early 20s and recently got diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression and I honestly relate a lot to the Asperger's community. I've known that I was dealing with these things for a long time but avoided addressing it until now because I am in an intense burnout cycle that has left me feeling decapitated. My family's response is that none of this is real and I just need to stop being lazy and to get it together. They don't want me to take medication because apparently living life depending on a pill is worse than a dysfunctional life without joy (I'm aware medication isn't necessary for everyone and some people thrive on other sorts of treatment, but I want to at least try it). They even wanted me to not tell my professors about what's going on to save face and my mom thinks they're talking about how terrible my work ethic is behind my back. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't now also paranoid about this. For context, I'm currently struggling through an undergrad degree that is really difficult. I once had a strong passion for the topic but it is slowly burning out along with my will to live. It's especially awful because my parents are paying so much money for this and I struggle intensely with guilt for my lack of willpower in daily life. I feel guilty for using accommodations in school and still barely pulling through and my parents make me feel 10x worse.

I honestly don't have memories of being happy for an extended period of time. I've always been intensely emotional and had anger issues as a child, but I quickly learned how to conceal this because I grew up the only child of super religious parents who care about appearances more than my feelings. I'm afraid of them and try to do as much as I can to avoid upsetting them. My mother in particular has been a helicopter over me my entire life and has very explosive anger such that I'm constantly telling white lies out of fear I might say something that'll make her blow up. Needless to say, I got yelled at when she tried to help me with math homework. I could talk about a lot of negative experiences from my childhood, but that would take all day. My privacy was constantly violated and I was punished for ""lying"" whenever I bottled up my feelings, even though I did this because those feelings have been dismissed every single time, or worse the feelings were considered offensive.

I've also struggled socially my entire life and its only gotten worse as I've gotten older. I have a couple of good friends, but for the most part I live my life completely disconnected from society. Every day, I wake up and walk through life as if it were a simulator. It's like I'm in some sort of bubble where time is distorted. I rarely have anything to look forward to and when I do I can hardly enjoy it either because I'm 1) feeling guilty about something that I haven't done or 2) get bored and/or tired incredibly easily. It feels like I have no escape from this hell. There are some people who listen, but I've never felt like I've been heard by anyone besides a therapist I see every two-three weeks for free through my school and I'll be going home for break soon. Nothing is appealing to me in life except for my bed and my ability to get lost in my imagination. My executive function is so poor right now and it's added so much to the shame. I feel like things are never going to get better. I hate being at school and I hate being at home. I hate thinking about the future and the past is painful. What do I even do? I've never cried so much in my life.",1
Inability to learn,"I've been at my job for a year now. I'm still making the same mistakes, over and over and over. Even for tasks that are identical every day, like making the mistake has become part of the routine.

People who were hired later than me are now more competent and independent, while I still struggle and need assistance. I just don't feel like any of the training sticks.

It was never a problem in school. The few times I encountered this kind of mental block I was able to just take the GPA hit and patch it up with the next subject. I never did learn how to study the things that didn't immediately click though.

 I was supposed to be ""gifted"", I was supposed to have potential. My diagnosing psych. actually told me with a straight face that I have a high IQ and my ADHD ""brings me down to typical levels in affected areas"". All of it sounds like a lie now.

I don't know what happened. I'm literally incompetent at a job that doesn't even use my degree. Why did it all stop being easy?",1
"I hate the idea of playing medication musical chairs, and I hate that I'm subconsciously rooting for others to fail","Like many, I'm suffering from this shortage. As a result, I haven't been able to get my Concerta (and/or generic) in over a month.

People keep telling me to try asking about another medication, trying something else, and it's driving me nuts thinking about it. It's not like you can call a pharmacy, they tell you ""Sorry we're out of X"" and you can just say ""Well, what *do* you have?"" 

Making appointments is rough enough, but imagine they change you over to something else, the Pharmacy doesn't have that either, so you're right back where you started and then have to make ANOTHER appointment to get ANOTHER prescription for ANOTHER medication

All of this on top of the fact that while I get it (controlled substance and all) I hate that prescriptions expire. ""You didn't fill it in time, so you need to make another appointment and get another""

I didn't fill it in time because you didn't have it though, so how does any of that make sense? (other than, again, controlled substance and all that)

&#x200B;

On top of all that, I can't help but think ""Well if others are in the same boat as me, but they're tripping and fading off instead of repeatedly trying to get their meds, maybe I can get mine if enough of them..."" and I feel so crappy about that. I feet crappy about all of this.

Apologies for the rant, I'm just so tired of all of this and just want to be fine again",1
The fluctuations are driving me crazy,"I’ve been off & on ADHD meds for about 14 years now. First Concerta, then Adderall. I started Adderall again about a year ago when I realized my depression was caused by the constant stress caused by my inability to stay focused & follow things through to completion.

I started at 10mg xr for four months, that was working really well. Decided with my psych to move up to 15mg xr, took that for 8 months. 

Then the lovely shortage started. Around this time my psych & I noticed I could benefit from an increase in dosage. We were aiming for 20mg. With the availability that turned into 20mg one month, 25mg the next, 15mg after that, 15mg XR with a 5mg IR the next. Dextro here, amphetamine here. 

It may not seem like much but the 5-10mg difference from month to month is driving me crazy. I miss the stability of the same dosage each day, each month. I know it’s lucky to get any of an Rx these days but wow it’s hard when my brain feels so many different levels all the time.",1
Ignorance really is bliss,"Ignorance is bliss. It's sucks knowing the cause of all your major life problems and having no power to fix it. 

Finding out Adhd existed was like having all my  problems put into one word . 16 and I just really want to see a psychiatrist but my mother doesn't believe anything is wrong with me and dismisses the argument everytime. 

Before I knew what Adhd was I thought I was just an idiot doomed to fail in life. I was so happy to see that others shared the same issues in life and were able to fix it.

Knowing that my problem has a name and discovering medication was a solution to improve my unhappy life and my parents not giving a shit just made me grew bitter and resentful. 

Why me? Why did I have to be born with all this shit? Why couldn't I just be a regular kid that fits in and does teen shit? Why do I always have to give my all to things just to receive the bare minimum? 

Some days I wish I wasn't born at all.",1

The main reason being I don’t feel like there is a purpose in doing one thing for too long and I need to do as many things as possible, but then it leads to feelings of not having any one particular thing I enjoy. 
It’s hard to explain but just a feeling..",1
My inability to get meaningful treatment is ruining my life and I'm just so frustrated (long vent),"I have diagnosed ADHD with multiple comormidities: major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, mood disorder with bipolar features (meaning I just barely don't meet the diagnostic criteria for bipolar 1 or 2), and stimulant abuse disorder (in remission). I haven't abused stimulants in 10+ years.

To spice things up, I also have a rare metabolic disorder - glutaric aciduria type 2 late onset. Google it if you want, but basically my body doesn't produce the necessary enzymes for me to properly metabolize fat. There is no cure, and the symptoms include exercise intolerance and extreme fatigue. The treatment is a high carbohydrate, low fat and low protein diet. I cannot go into a calorie deficit at all or I will start to metabolically decompensate, which means a hospital stay for fluids and monitoring. I've been hospitalized seven times since my initial diagnosis two years ago. I've also gained 20lbs.

I recently switched psychiatrists because the one I had been seeing for 12+ years has no expertise in metabolic disorders, and he's located two hours away. I was also having issues with the old psychiatrist re: stimulant meds. Non stimulant medication has never been effective for me. I've literally tried them all. I need supratherapeutic doses of medications like Concerta or Vyvanse to have any effect at all, and my old psychiatrist viewed that as drug-seeking behavior.

My new psychiatrist has been practicing at Massachusetts General Hospital for 25+ years, went to Harvard medical, and lectures at Yale. He's been doing academic research in the psychiatric presentation of digestive illnesses for the past 10+ years. After our first appointment two weeks ago, he took me off all my old meds (prozac, Seroquel) and put me on abilify, lamictal, and trazodone. No ADHD treatment at all due to history of drug seeking behavior (obviously he and the old psychiatrist talked, which I authorized). Since I've gone on these new meds, I am sleeping excessively - like I go to bed at midnight and don't wake up until 4pm the next day. I'm crying spontaneously with very little provocation. I can't take care of my toddler (thank God for our nanny), I've been unemployed for 8 months, and I can't perform the most basic tasks like showering, cleaning (thank God for the maids), and cooking dinner for our family. My poor husband is pulling all the weight, and I feel like such a failure. I just want my life back. I want to be the wife and mother my family deserves.

I have a second appointment with my new psychiatrist tomorrow morning and plan to share all of this with him. My husband (who is a primary care MD) went through the ASRS ADHD assessment with me and had me write down concrete examples for each question, as well as how it's affecting my life. Despite severe symptoms having tangible negative impacts on every aspect of my life, he strongly cautioned me against asking for stimulant meds due to my history. 

I completely broke down. My husband sees how bad I am and feels the consequences more than anyone, but even in his professional opinion, I shouldn't have access to the treatment I need because I abused it in my 20s.

I don't know what to do anymore and feel so helpless. If I can't get the treatment I need, what's the point? I don't want to live this life being a disappointment and a burden to everyone I care about. 

I'm not looking for advice or answers, I just really need to vent. Thanks for reading if you got this far.",1
I want this more than anything. Why can't I just do the thing?,"22F, applying to grad school. I just have one more application to submit, and it's for the program that I want the most.

This procrastination might be coming from a place of ""perfectionism"", but I really cannot afford to delay my application any longer. Although the final deadline is in June, I'm an international student and will require a visa for grad school. So I need to receive a decision from this program by mid June. So all I need to do now is upload my SOP and click ""submit application"", like yesterday.
I had planned to finish all my applications by May 1st, but stuff (myself) got in the way. I really don't want to put this off any longer as I've submitted the rest of my apps DANGEROUSLY last minute this cycle.

How on earth can I do all this. I have limited time, energy, and money. I can't possibly spend as much of any of them that I need to do deal with all these issues and it feels like I'll have to try and get by with a bunch of accumulated damage. Like if my mental illness had been caught earlier so much damage could have been avoided. But it wasn't and now I'm left with the burden of trying to make myself a whole healthy functional human being and most of what brings me joy has to get neglected because we live in a capitalist hellscape that demands constant productivity and high earning in order to be secure.

I feel broken and unheard,"Ive been trying to get a diagnosis for the past month (psychiatrist has interviewed my mother  and GF and weve completed questionnaires), and finally today my doctor told me that Ive got the ADH but not the final D - disorder. 

From what I understand this is primarily due to me having two degrees (which i barely passed). Ive seen stories from people here where they fail there schools and degrees and that makes me feel privileged for having one let alone two degrees, but i genuinely struggle on a daily f***ing basis.

ADHD Assessment Declined,"Spoke with my doctor today and found out that the referral they sent for me to be assessed for ADHD was declined.

Going to have to wait longer for any kind of help because I don’t have the money for a private diagnosis right now. Seeing that a BBC journalist skipped the queue to make a point about how private assessments are unreliable is just so deflating because if the NHS won’t cover people’s diagnosis, what are we meant to do?",1
Why do I feel so guilty like I am doing something criminal?,My doctor told me the shortage is “getting better” when switching my back to adderall from methylphenidate.  Methylphenidate has been awful so I was hoping to start back on adderall this week.  No one has it locally.  My doctor told me to “expand my radius.”  I have struggled my whole life with always having a guilty conscious for NO reason at all.  I keep calling pharmacies and feeling like what I am doing is wrong.  Does anyone else deal with this? With each call I feel more and more like I am doing something horribly wrong.,1
My ADHD treatment seems so whacky,"I have been diagnosed at the beginning of 2022. I was 21 and when I got meds for the first time I was 22.

Now I am incredibly lucky because I got to my diagnosis within 6 months but my ADHD treatment feels so nonexistent.

I take elvanse 50mg and the psychiatrist that diagnosed me also treats me. It was and still is the only clinic I can go to because most don't accept new patients even if they already have a diagnosis. Or most just don't treat adults. The place that I go to has several psychiatrists working there.

When I had my first appointment they told me things like ""you most likely don't have adhd"" , ""woman usually don't have adhd"" and ""most people grow out of adhd so don't worry too much about it, it will most likely be gone until you are 25""

My assessment was with a different person and she actually listened and told me that she has no doubt I have adhd and that the other psychiatrists will make a treatment plan with me.

Well on the day that I should have made a treatment plan with the psychiatrist he just basically talked about ""only meds can fix it"" and that stimulant medication is the only thing that works. Which is horribly inaccurate. He also told me (and my mother who wanted to come along) that therapy is no option and it will not help at all. I didn't even know coaching was a thing and I left really discouraged but I had my hopes up bc I finally had a diagnosis and got meds prescribed that could possibly help me really much.

Despite me being happy about it I still feel like there is a lot of tings wrong with how my treatment goes (I am now with another psychiatrist and she at leas is open for everything but its not that she suggests things. Its rather me suggesting things and she then talks about it with me and maybe she will go though with it like changing my medication after I had horrible side effects from the first medication.

Also other things like depression or anxiety and other things are not really taken into consideration. 

And one of the worst things for me personally is that I only got help because I was at a breaking point. Everything was overwhelming and I had constant brain fog. It got to a point where I slept just an hour or less a day and that continued until I was so physically and mentally drained that I slept 15+ hours on weekends because I could not get myself out of bed.

This issue has unfortunately not been fixed yet.
I sleep much better but still 3-4 hours of sleep per day is just not enough and honestly I don't know what to do about that.",1

Edit: I gave my speech! When I went up there I couldn’t stop shaking (like my legs and arms) but I used the podium to help me stay still. I was very anxious but I still think I did pretty good, I mean, I got all of my points in, I made sure to look around at people, projected my voice, when I stumbled I tried to just play/laugh it off. Im pretty proud of myself because I pushed myself and signed myself up to be one of the first presenters, when I’m usually one of the people that waits till last.

I wish I could be normal. (A rant about hyperfixations),"For the last 6 hours I have done nothing but focus on the article and short documentary released about private ADHD practices (I’m not here to discuss that as it’s done on many other threads I just hyperfixated on it because it’s something I find really intrestering). It’s been fascinating but awful timing. I have a major exam Wednesday and have been desperately trying to improve my grade and it was going well but now today I have done nothing and the chances of getting it up this close with a day wasted are very low. The only reason I have stoped looking into it now is because I have to go to work.

I also have a music lesson tomorrow which I have not practiced for because I have spent all day fixating on this article and now because I’m working late tonight I won’t be able to practice and I’ve got my music exam next month too. 

My dinner considered of a mug shot because it meant I didn’t have to stop. I even bloody sat at my desk for like 3 hours just hoping I would be able to work.

I need to be up early tomorrow to mentor but again I’ve done apslutly no preparation and I know as soon as I get home I’ll be back to this fixation. 

I don’t really know the point of writing this maybe someone will be able to relate but it’s basically just a rant screaming into the void. It frustrates me so much when others see hyper fixations as purely a good thing cause every time I hyperfixate on something i hate it so much. I wish that my fucking brain could regulate attention like a normally person!!

If you got this far through I hope you are currently hyperfixation free (/hj) and enjoy your day!",1
Feeling absolutely crippled by decision paralysis and i just feel like I am bouncing from one worry to the next.,"Awaiting formal diagnosis, could be months (years?) and I am not on antidepressants any more pending diagnosis, as even they didn't seem to work much. I have a few things going on in my life, which are causing me so much anxiety, and decision paralysis isn't helping. I am just pushing through each day feeling close to tears.

I don't have any friends or family i can talk to honestly about stuff, and those few people i can talk to try to get me to ""fix it"" not appreciating how difficult it is for me to make decisions, or even think about making decisions. Just wanted to reach out, even if it's just for someone to tell me that i'm not alone in feeling like this, or that it is not me ""failing"" as a human being. Thanks.",1

I Wish I Never Started Medication,"For the sake of some background info, I'm a 21 year old female who just graduated with an associates degree in Graphic Design and Computer Information Systems. I'm currently working full time as a waitress/manager at a little diner in a truck stop. I'm currently on 50mg of vyvanse, which I take once in the morning. 

Now, the reason I wish I never started meds is because I genuinely struggle so hard on the days I decided not to take them. It's like before I ever went to the doctor, yeah, my adhd made things difficult, but I could function most days and eventually got shit done. But now it's impossible to do anything unless I take the vyvanse. I don't want to take it every day because it can be really difficult to fall asleep while on them. It's also hard because, It's not just that I'm productive on my meds, I'm also happier, my appetite is low(so I don't binge eat) and I just feel like I'm physically in less pain, like it's easier to get up and move. I just get so depressed and tired, hungry, and emotional on those sober days... nothing like how I was before the prescription.

Does anyone relate?",1
Thinking of giving up on my medication,"After spending like 6 months just trying to get a diagnosis, I finally got started on medication earlier this year. My doctor said she wasn’t going to prescribe adderall because of the shortage, but there were other things we could try. First we tried Vyvance. My insurance said they approved it, but they just meant it would count towards my deductible, and I got a surprise charge for the entire $350 or so. I can’t afford that, so my doctor switched me to dextroamphetamine the next month.

Both medications worked really well. I thought it was going to radically change my life. And maybe something will, eventually. But I’ve had to fight to get my medication covered every single month since my diagnosis, and I just can’t do it anymore. I don’t have the time or patience to call every damn pharmacy in town every single month. I have prescriptions for extended and immediate release versions, and I haven’t filled both in the same place once. I’m exhausted, and just totally defeated. I’ve been rationing the last week or so while I wait for a delivery that doesn’t seem likely to ever show up now, and I’m coming apart at the seams, and all I can think is that I’m just done with all of it.

Idk if the non-stimulant options are worth a try, but right now I’m just not even interested in trying that. I just want to give up.",1
Giving up on my dream,"Overwhelm is a mean ol’ bastard. 

I left a super toxic job to start my home-based business and I’ve been swimming upstream since. Problem is: No insurance and no money = No meds. No meds = no executive functioning. 

I have excellent ideas and all the resources to pull it off. My partner is supporting me so I can achieve this, but I just CAN’T and I don’t know why. Every time I start to work I get so mentally drained and anxious that I feel like my heart is going to explode and I become so damn tired that my muscles ache. So I do something else to soothe myself until I feel ok again. It’s a vicious, never ending cycle. 

So I gave up on my business dreams and decided just to work as a freelancer. I created my website, got the training certificates I needed, and when it came time to follow through… I’m frozen. Complete. Overwhelm. Shutdown. 

I finally decided I must not be cut out to be my own boss, so I got a “normal” job and I start next week. I’m so sad and I feel like a failure. I don’t want to go back to being a cog in the wheel, but apparently I need someone to tell me what to do, or else I can’t do anything. 

TL;DR: I just can’t seem to get out of my own way long enough to accomplish anything.",1
Having friendships feels suffocating,"Having multiple different friends messaging me mostly every day, whether to have casual conversation or invite to something, has been really suffocating me recently. I feel bad for thinking this way since many other young adults, as well as some of my friends wish they had more friends / people asking them to hang out but that's why it's very hard to express. I love my friends, and I usually have a good time online and in person, but I have an extremely low social battery. 

When I spent 3 days in a row doing spending even a few hours with friends I'm drained, and I want at least a day or two to recover and spend on my own things. When I do something social, I feel like my entire day has gone out the window since it disturbs whatever plan I had laid out for myself. If I reject one invitation, I might still have 1 or 2 more to reject that day or a text conversation to hold for an hour or two while I'm trying to focus on something else. And it's not really good to say, ""I'd just prefer to go back to what I'm doing than talk to you right now"" when I don't necessarily interact with that individual a lot. Even if I'm not doing anything important at a given moment, losing this time unexpectedly usually means I won't keep up with other things I wanted to get done. I can explain that I have a low social battery and that these things are more taxing on me since I have ADHD, but none of my friends, even ones that also have other mental illnesses, understand how straining it is for me to keep up relationships, especially online ones or if I'm expected to be reaching out first. I told that to someone and they must've misunderstood it because they still try to start a conversation every day (sometimes multiple times if it fizzles out) and think it's not straining since I'm not initiating. (Said they ""would do all the heavy lifting"") 

Explaining this to friends, especially since they don't know all of my other friends are or how I've been dividing my time, sounds like me complaining I have too many friends and that I'm annoyed that they remember my existence lol. I can go weeks without messaging a friend first because I just haven't thought about it. With a lot of my friends over my life this has been completely normal and worked out fine, but its difficult when I have so many things to keep in check just in my own day to day life. 

I wouldn't trade having my friends for anything, and I could only imagine how terrible I would feel if I didn't have any, but it still often feels like an obligation to me. I got diagnosed in Fall 2022, so I'm still learning a lot about myself and unpacking things like this",1
The anxiety for finals has me wanting to tap out,"I have finals this and next week and my brain does not want me to do this. Ive been studying non stop since Sunday for math, 9 chapters, split across 3 days/class periods, open book. However, my brains paralyzing me into thinking I won’t do well. I’m locking myself in every night, barely eating through the day and studying/procrastinating my math.

I’ve done this class once before and had to repeat, the teacher has only failed one person in his like 40 years of teaching. He told me I’m in a good position to not fail (75.6% which is a C) 

I’m just so worried for it and I’m freaking out. I’m going over it for hours on end but I’m just paralyzed",1
Med frustration,"Hello! I have just recently been diagnosed with ADHD (combined type) after trying for forever, and am on no stimulants but am on zoloft for depression. my apologies for the rambling!!

my psychiatrist just prescribed me abilify to take with my zoloft as my depression isn’t improving as it should be. i just tried wellbutrin but it made me tremor and twitch and super anxious and just terrible 

i know that my depression symptoms are worsening because i don’t have proper medication or care for my adhd and i’m so frustrated over myself because of it. i feel like i can’t do anything, and my mom doesn’t entirely understand so she doesn’t really help. my psychiatrist wants my depression to get better before trying any sort of adhd care but the “always tired, racing thoughts, bored/ can’t hold an interest” and “staying up at night or sleeping in too much” is because i don’t have proper treatment for adhd.

anytime i suggest i might need to try a stimulant she always shuts me down and tells me we have to take care of the depression first, but i just *know* it’ll be better if i have something for my adhd. 

we meet again in 2 weeks (she’s giving me time to try abilify) and i’m going to try suggesting it again just because i’m tired of being this way.

thank you for reading :)",1
lost headphones in 2 weeks,"i just began a new job on 1st of may. it’s my first since diagnosis and medication. as part of onboarding w the laptop we got headsets w the wireless usb thing and a charging cable. it was plugged into my laptop pretty much everyday. thursday i had to remove it during a call. and today i tried looking for it and it’s not in my bag, not in my locker, not at home. i feel like crying. it’s been 2 weeks and i lost it? i usually never misplace important things. in these two weeks i’ve also lost my swiss knife. i feel so guilty and also just stupid because i cant for thé life in me remember where they could be. did i leave it in office? but how didn’t it even occur to me on friday or all day today? and how do i even report this? and to who? i’m just so upset w myself. it’s been two weeks and i fucked up already",1
"Just cancelled a job interview, feeling like a failure","I have no idea why I'm sharing it here, but i feel like i get to take it all out.

For the past two weeks, I've been in the middle of a recruiting process to a very big tech company.
I went through the first two stages successfully with two more technical stages left.
This whole time, i felt like im about to lose my mind. I didn't sleep, eat, and basically, all i tried to do was to study as much as i could, but the more i tried, the more i felt like i was going backward.

I have 3 years experience as a web developer, and this whole proc made me feel like i haven't learned shit this whole time, which made me feel more and more like an imposter.

Anyways,  the third interview should've been today, and i called 3 hours before to cancel it. 
I'm so mad at myself and feel like a total failure. I have no idea how can i step out of it, i know I should learn for next time, but all i see now is black, and i just can't handle it.",1
Why does it hurt so much when parents are dismissive?,"I (24F) called my mom (50F) today since it's mother's day, and at one point the conversation turned to talking about whether or not I was still taking ""the medicine"" as my parents call it. They don't outright acknowledge that it's adhd medication for my adhd, which I've been taking less than a year.


I told them no, since I'm on break from school, and they asked how i felt without it. I told them that I felt like my brain was always fuzzy feeling without it. My dad said that ""that's just because yiur brain got used to taking it and it likes it"". My mom then said ""I think you should get evaluated by a specialist, maybe they misdiagnosed you.""


For reference, i went through my university's accessibility center and talked to a specialist there and also a doctor at the student health center, and did all the interviews, questionnaires and such for the dx process. It's not like i just went to google and did a five minute ""do i have adhd quiz"".


Everytime my parents bring up adhd, they never mention it by name, as if acknowledging makes it something demonic or something. It's always ""are you still taking ""the medicine"".""


You would think that my parents would be happy that I've been doing better in school since starting meds and therapy, and that several of the issues I have had in the past 10 years or so have been able to be managed as a result of managing previously undiagnosed adhd.


Instead I'm being told that it's not real and that it's all in my head abd that I'm doing this for attention.


I'm not very open about my adhd, but a few of my friends here at uni have said that they noticed a positive change between me now and me last year, and i feel so much better than then.
I'm at the happiest I've been in a long time, and a big part of that has been learning how to manage adhd. I don't want to go through the emotions of the past several years again. 


It just hurts so much that the two people whonare supposed to care about me the most are being so dismissive of something that had unknowingly been causing so many problems for so long, and now that I'm learning to take care of myself, it's like they don't care.


I know I'm an adult, and that others opinion's shouldn't matter, but it really hurts when it comes from your own parents. I try so hard to do well in school and at work, but it feels like nothing is good enough for them.


It feels stupid to be crying over this but it just hurts so much when I can't go to my own parents about these issues because I'll just get told to get over myself.",1
i just sat on the mother’s day card i got for my mom and now it’s all bent and i’m crying,"i’m having a Moment because i bought this nice card for my mom for mother’s day yesterday and i had it on my bed about to fill it out when i thought, “oh! i don’t want to bend this while writing on it.” so i got up to get a notebook and then thought, “it would be nice to write while listening to music” so i sat on my bed to put music on my laptop and then a full minute after realized i sat on the card. now it’s all bent. 

i feel so dumb. how could i forget it was right there in less than a minute?! 

i live with my mom rn and she has been my biggest support in my struggle with ADHD—i was diagnosed less than a year ago. she picks up all my slack with chores, she’s patient with me, she’s the best mother in the whole world and now i have to give her this dumbass bent card that looks like i didn’t care much and half-assed it. 

i had this card for less than 24 hours and i ruined it, and now all i can do is cry because i don’t know where i’d be without my mom and i just want her to know how hard i’m trying and how much i appreciate her but the card i bought for her is bent.

i’m gonna write everything i said here in it i guess and i KNOW she won’t care but i just feel so incompetent. like i got up for THIRTY SECONDS for the EXPLICIT PURPOSE of getting something to keep the card from getting bent and then i FORGOT the card and BENT it anyways. 

i feel like a child who can’t even do simple tasks.

edit: thanks to everyone who replied! i’ve read them all and they helped. i ended up writing about bending the card in the card and then went on a sappy rant about how much i love her. all we can do is try our best. also thanks for sharing ur similar stories! glad it’s not just me

edit 2: i gave her the card and she didn’t even notice just like i figured. (until i pointed it out lol) but she laughed when i told her the story. i know it’s not that deep but emotion management is hard for me sometimes. thanks again for all your support and stories!",1
"Watch out for medication doses that are too high, it's not always obvious","This post might get taken down, but I don't care. This has to be said and I didn't hear crap about it from anyone.

Last few years or so I was in a pretty low place for a while. I've always slept bad for as long as I could remember, but I also became quick to anger and get irritated. I had a cynical look on life and had a depressive mood at least once a day. I always just thought that it was because I slept bad, maybe cause of stress, perhaps I just think too negative.

I was thinking of stopping meds, but only because I didn't like that I was dependent on them to function well. Then I had an interview and drank some coffee. I just felt sedated doing the interview, couldn't form any good sentences, had major brainfog. I started thinking that I'd literally be better of without meds and I had to stop because this simply isn't me. I could probably focus better without them.

I happend to have a lighter dose of meds in my closet (ironically because I've been procrastinating on returning them to the pharmacist) and took them to see if the dose was too high, and wow. Now the meds actually do benefit me. I've never felt so sharp before, my depressive moods are gone, I barely feel irritated anymore, and i'm just happy all the time - the way I remember myself.

I've had some feelings of greef, thinking about all the things that couldve been different if I noticed this before. My dose is too high for 1.5 years!! Imagine all the things I didn't do or miss out on because I was too tired or depressed. It might've even contributed to a recent breakup.

If you experience things like:

-Insomnia

-Feeling Passive

-More irritated than usual

-Depressive moods

-Feelings of sedation

-Changes in character

Then check in with your doctor and try a lighter dose or other types of meds. Just because your heart doesn't go bonkers on a certain dose doesn't mean it's the right dose.

TL;DR: Watch out for a dose of meds that might be too high. It's not as obvious as you would think and the symptoms of a dose that's too high aren't obvious and are almost never talked about.",1
Adulting? No thanks.,"I am sitting here having gotten my work done for the day, and I can either tidy up the flat (which is a real mess), or I could paint.

P.s. I am thinking of going and living on a boat so I don't have to work so much to afford to live. This is the only solution I can see, owning property so I don't have to pay ridiculous money on rent, therefore not having to work as much.",1
Is it worth it?,"I’ve had my adhd papers on my shelf for 6weeks roughly and I can’t decide if I have adhd or if I’m just overthinking it, I’ve been fixated on a diagnosis for months just reading up on it and over analysing it, would anyone be able to tell me if this sounds like adhd. I tend to feel very fatigued at school, sleeping in lesson, or shouting out and speaking over others, I don’t do homework because I have other things I’d rather do, I don’t think inattentive is the right word, I think I just don’t give a shit about certain things and I’m highly sensitive to bordom, I can’t sit and endure these lessons for a hour, i can’t sit still, I can’t shut up. I don’t loose possessions, i misplace things from time to time though, or maybe take 4 trips from my room to the bathroom because I forgot certain things I’d need to bath such as change of clothes or deodorant. In a weird way I feel like I’m just here to eat sleep and drink, I have 0 interests, or 0 that I’ll ever actually act on or start doing , is this adhd, or am I just assuming wrongly. I deal with extreme emotions yet I can’t manage to cry, I feel like I’m the man one second and I feel terrible the next, my moods are gonna be the death of me and being called a failure everyday in school is not helping.",1
Super anxious for my 1st ADHD consult today,"I’ve been really really struggling with my job over the last couple months and it is bleeding over into all aspects of my life. Last year, I got a new job which is entirely WFH and sitting in front of a computer screen. I never have done remote work before and didn’t have to do Zoom university during COVID and it has destroyed all my focus and work ethic. I know how to do all the individual tasks, but my thoughts just race all day and it is literally exhausting. I’m crying writing this right now because it is so overwhelming.

I’ve been having panic and anxiety during my workday now bc of my inability to prioritize my massive backlog of tasks, and I have been losing sleep, forgetting things more than usual (sometimes I’ve always done during stress), and having GI issues. 

I set up a consult with a psychiatric NP today to hopefully get started finding help with medication. But I’m honestly terrified thinking about it and can’t focus on any work before my appointment. Can someone coach me before my first appointment? What can I expect for the appt and also for the first days/weeks on medication? I’ve only ever taken SSRIs in the past.",1

If anyone has experience with this and can share tips so much love for that.",1
Took Ritalin for the first time and I didn't feel anything,"I feel so frustrated and bummed out. I waited like 4 months for this medication after my diagnosis, and it is also the only legal option in my country. I started with 5mg and now I am on 10mg every 4 hours, the maximum legal dose in my country. I don't feel anything different. No side effects, no positive effects. No effects at all. I can't believe it's so hard to get a prescription for a medication that is so bland it feels like taking sugar. So much unwarranted fearmongering.  

I don't know how to go on like this. I thought meds would have helped me. I don't know why I am not feeling anything different. Could it be that I am not noticing the difference? Is that possible?  If you have some words to spare or went through something similar I would be extremely grateful.",1

Dealing with ADHD in the workplace. I am exhausted and fed up.,"For context, I live in Canada and I work for a large financial co-operative in the Property and Casualty insurance sector going on nearly 7 years now. I work from home which I enjoy tremendously. I like the work I do although it can get overwhelming at times. I like the people I work with and I really like the organization as well. We have had many restructures at work; teams have been amalgamated, managers have come and gone, temp assignment coworkers stepping in place of managers while the role is being filled... it's been a wild ride. I received my ADHD diagnosis 3 years ago. During my time with said employer, I have had my fair share of ups and downs being put on Attendance Plans for taking too much sick time off, Performance Improvement Plans due to my inconsistency at work, and was given 2 write-ups for performance related actions (these only stay on HR file for 3 years and have since expired). In the past 2 years I have been consistent and done excellent work, but as anyone with ADHD knows these flashes in the pan can fade and you're hit with little to no motivation - this is where I am now.

During year 4 with my employer I went on a leave for 1 year which led to my ADHD diagnosis with a psychologist after years of struggling with depression and anxiety along with on and off alcohol abuse. I do take medication but it's effectiveness varies. I am speaking with a therapist but effectiveness also varies. Right now in the midst of yet another restructure, one of the best managers I have ever had the joy of working under left after 2 weeks. This was devastating as he had given me so much support with my issues; lots of guidance, empathy and understanding. I am yet again in limbo waiting on a permanent manager and I am anxious to see what kind of individual this person will be.

To get to the meat of it - I am on a ""Sick Note Program"". This means that I must provide a sick note from my GP (who is amazing and very helpful) every time I am off. This has been no issue. Since the temp assignment manager has shown up they have now told me I need to list my ""limitations"" in the note in order to get paid. This has been a struggle since any time I tell my GP I need the note to list my limitations she hesitates. She tells me they do not need to know this information. I had one manager ask me to get a write-up of my diagnosis from my doctor, to which my GP politely said ""the fuck you don't"". I have also been taking too many breaks at work as my mental health has declined and I am into the alcohol again... I was then notified by my temp assignment manager that this may put me on another Performance Improvement Plan which I *really* do not want to go through again. I was only just advised very recently that I can use a certain ""time off unpaid"" code on my schedule if I need a longer break here and there and I am floored as to why I was never told earlier as I could have utilized it sooner.

I want to put heavy emphasis on the fact that **I know employers are not friends or family and they only care about their bottom line.** The organization I work for puts a strong emphasis on mental health and employee support at work but I feel left out. I have made each manager/temp manager aware of my diagnosis/struggles/need for accommodations but since management has been coming and going this is getting very tiring and I am feeling ashamed/burned out. I took this week off to regroup and get back on the bandwagon - I have a call with my GP today and we are going to work on a new action plan. Mental health struggles are never linear. We go through ups and downs, set backs and great strides. I am frustrated by what I feel to be a lack of transparency on employer's side, but I also feel great fear of losing my job. I don't know what sort of accommodations I can have made, and I am worried I am going to be let go. HR is not your friend, but I want to protect myself as much as possible yet I am afraid of reprisal.

Strategies for more helpful self-care/comfort?,"For years, I keep wanting to implement positive changes but haven't found success. Part of it is depression, which is being treated, and ADHD is just recently being treated, but it's still hard to do things I KNOW are good for me. I have inspiring revelations late at night that seem to be completely out of my reach the next day.

I want to eat healthier, exercise, have a small skincare routine, etc. I want prioritize buying myself things that I need rather than what I want. I want to read, learn a language, or meditate.  These are things I've recently learned people do as acts of comfort and self-care, and they enjoy it. But not me - some of my self-care and comfort habits are in junk food, doing the exact opposite of exercise, and struggling to brush my teeth twice a day. Even the healthy food I buy, most of it goes to waste because of the effort or it's less convenient than frozen dinner or fast food.


I can't quite get into doing the better things or feel like I'm doing them for me.  When I buy takeout or X hobby item (that at this point I'm just collecting instead of doing), I get the feeling like that's doing something for myself. But spending the same amount of money on new clothes that I need or a skincare product to get me started? Can't seem to do it, or if I do, I don't use it then feel bad about my current condition.

What I want is to get that same ""comfort"" feeling from the more uplifting things than the harmful/unhelpful things. Is it that I don't want these things ""bad enough"" so my brain doesn't steer me towards them?

I would love to hear the strategies, and even the baby steps, anyone has taken to do more uplifting comfort/self-care things. How do you even get started? How do you learn to love and get pleasure from these things and prioritize them over the other less-helpful acts?",1
Anyone struggle with friendships?,"I have just been diagnosed late in life with ADHD and it makes a lot of sense but I am struggling with my lack of friendships and ability to navigate social situations. 

Every time I try to contribute to a conversation there seems to be tumbleweed moments and deafening silence.

Does your head say nope to everything,"Since I started medication I have discovered that one of my most annoying qualities is that my brain says nope to everything. Just ""nope"" and there's no reason for it. It's practically impossible to get around the nope and it always requires a lot of exhausting mental gymnastics. Even if I want to do whatever it is or if I really need to do it, there's that wall of nope that makes it impossible to jump into action. The medication fixes the nope. It is _incredibly_ hard not to think that ""the nope"" is laziness. Even though I've literally read about studies where dopamine deprived rats became completely passive - and it sounds a lot like a ""nope"" issue, I still feel like a fraud somehow. Because, you know, meds make neurotypical people feel like doing things too. I feel like I need some sort of definitive proof or it will bother me forever...",1
Anyone struggle if you have more than one thing planned for a day?,"Like I have therapy in the afternoon. Or need to go out for a doctors appointment? My brain goes crazy.

Being fired and feeling like a criminal,"I feel like such an awful person because I was fired for insubordination and passive aggressive behavior. I worked at a preschool that had some skewed values. My bosses verbatim told me they believe in using micromanagement. I also asked my supervisor to please kindly not speak to me 
in a certain way, as she was beginning to be snappy and short. We had a great rapport at first and I felt comfortable expressing this. She became very power over. She replied “You just need to nod your head and say ‘Yes ok got it’”. I told her so nicely and it was just such a sudden change in her demeanor. I don’t work well with supervisors like that nor do most people. 

I was constantly told I’m inflexible for pointing out things many, many other people would frequently complain about. Things my bosses previously apologized for and said they never wanted to happen to an employee again they used against me. Such as, they said parents were complaining about a specific teacher that I also brought up to them, as did many other teachers. Then, they mentioned that in my firing that I was causing too many problems with that instance in particular. That makes no sense. Obviously a bullshit reason. 

I just wonder what the kids think, what the parents think, what the uninvolved coworkers think. I know the families were probably told something vague, but it is totally against everything I strive for to seem as though I just up and left. It hurts to know the kids probably think I abandoned them without warning. I had such good bonds with all of them. I wonder what all the gossip is about me. I know I was liked by many, and I do always strive in being honest so at least I have that.",1
Today everything feels like it's too much,"I have no real reason that makes any since. I'm not sure what is so different but today every little thing's feels like it's just ending the world. I'm so annoyed with myself and I can't seem to stop focusing way too much on how shitty I feel like I am. It's making my work day completely miserable and I feel like breaking down. I can't take a sick day because I'm already not making enough due to unexpected factory slow down, so I just feel like I'm stuck both here and in my mind. Does anyone else feel like this? What helps you?",1
Do you feel “addicted” to a love interest?,"Note. This is well beyond the time frame of “hyperfixation”. 

By ADHD standards I have a pretty decent grasp on my life. I have and continue to hold down a great job that I enjoy and am able to navigate the world we live in despite having a spicy brain.

The one thing i struggle with is relationships. I’ve done a lot of internal reflection, work with therapists on the topic of romantic relationships but I seem to always find myself in a constant need for interaction with partners due to the all the feel good chemicals that come with being in a happy relationship. 
The problem is, a healthy relationship often requires time apart and to live our own lives, and when that happens my brain just craves to be back with them. 

It’s not affecting my relationship as such, because I do a good job of working through it myself. But it does often make me feel pretty irregulated and I find it affects my mood a lot.

Just curious to know what, if anything can help with this. 

Thank you!

Edit: I am not on medication.",1
Spaced on calling my mom yesterday.,"Annnnd she's pissed. My mom is rather dramatic and really hits my emotional rejection sensitivity button pretty hard. Not a lot I can do about it now, but hopefully I can make it up to her (if I don't forget).

"Please give me permission, internet stranger! My brain is broken and I hate it!!","39/F. ADHD combined and Fibromyalgia. 

I lost my previous job (story of my life) and landed a new one and I was supposed to start today.

Last night my little girl (7) was really sick and I was awake with her until 4 am, I was very close to heading to the hospital with her because her fever/pain/elevated heart rate was so bad.

Instead I did what I could, giving her pain relief/monitoring her/holding her for hours until she calmed down/fell asleep.

Needless to say when the alarm went off at 7am his morning I was a total wreck and my Fibromyalgia has flared up so badly my body is in aching from head to toe.

I messaged my new boss and he was cool with me starting tomorrow instead. Literally so cool about it. 

But.. Can someone please tell me why I feel so guilty about missing one day of work, all I did my was my job as a mother and looked after my sick child?

I honestly feel sick with stress to the point of panic and nausea because I feel like I ""let everybody down""

Why does my brain do this!?

People take sick days *all the fucking time* why do I feel like I need permission from an adult or something to justify looking after myself?

It's literally just one day.

😭",1
I feel like I know everything yet nothing,"Have you ever been asked a question and you know the answer but your brain can't seem to form a coherent sentence at all, so you end up saying nonsense and ending it with ""I don't know""?

My ADHD has been terrible, and it's affecting the way I talk to people. I mean, my social skills have never been great, but I feel like my mind is always empty all the time. I feel like every time I want to talk to someone, I need to pull out a mental vocabulary book and spend a few minutes searching for the correct words to say. My mind is never empty, I think about 2-3 things at once every day (including the music in the background), but at the same time, I feel so dumb.

People perceive me as ""dumb"" and ""slow"" because of this. I feel like my mind and mouth are running away from each other.",1
"There is a noise in my house, no one else hears it and it's driving me insane","Long story short, I live with a roommate and my gf. Roommate is in the autism spectrum, gf has a much worse ADHD than I do. One would think that they're as sensitive to sound as I am, if not more, right? WRONG! 

Since yesterday I've been hearing this low, low vibration, kinda like an infrasound, I *feel* it in my eardrums and head more than hearing it, and I'm going absolutely FERAL. It's unnerving,  it makes me feel like I have motion sickness, I literally have a reduced field of vision and holy crap no one else hears it! Not even the cats seem bothered by it, although one of them sometimes stops and stares, but that could just be because his one braincell went into sleep mode.

So yeah, just a rant but does anyone relate, and if so, is there a solution?

im venting (dont ming the way i speak),"im 19 living in france, and studying 3D animation. im taking fluoxetine (might be called prozacin other countries) as my antidepressants and ritalin 40mg to focus. i dont know how to keep my life together. my school costs so much like 9000euros and i feel obligated to keep going bc my parents showed me they'd be dissapointed to have yet another kid that doesnt have a future.

i have no idea how to make a post but im desperate for reassurance. living is just getting hard in some way. i keep getting this feeling that sincei was a kid, i desperately wanted to be successful later in life. to this day i can't take it out of my head and it's making me question whether or not i'd be the kind of person to: 1. be hard working and obsessed with work and genuinely ok with it or 2. live through a silly job, get a minimum wage but be satisfied with a simple life.

this makes me go crazy during school, i'm trying to hang on and convince myself it's just a hard phase i gotta go through before entering a simpler lifestyle but i can barely motivate myself to go homework i even like. i feel on the edge of a burn out. im scared of being nothing later on. not even sometimes i or my family could be proud of. i've always listened to my mother telling me work is everything and it's breaking me.

i cant even say im hardworking althought what i study requires me to be. im so scared of all the deadlines and i just try to relax by playing games, and even during that i think or work and i'm screaming at myself in my own head although i look like im calm.

im sorry if its too long to read i guess its because i need help

my family doesnt think adhd is a thing even if i got diagnosed like 3 months ago, they think that i got cured or something as a kid because i used to get tested through tests

i keep crying because i feel like a pathetic insect

im sorry this isnt pleasant to read and i shouldnt expect anything but i think i needed to write while knowing someone like me might see",1
Can’t stand this anymore,"I went grocery shopping last night and forgot all the groceries in my car overnight. I bought some amazing steaks and chicken which I was excited about cooking, but now I have to throw them away. Not to mention that they weren’t cheap. They were prime 1 steaks 😕. 

I’ve made the change to cook every meal at home, but clearly that’s not an option with ADHD. This disease makes me hate myself and feel like a piece of shit. Like who tf goes grocery shopping and then leaves everything in their car. That means I parked my car, walked inside with nothing in my hands, and had no recollection of what I just did for the last hour. 

I’m only 22 and understand that there’s no way I can go the rest of my life with this level of incompetence. I live on my own and can’t afford to waste $80 worth of groceries, especially with the inflation my government has caused these last couple years. 

Is there anyone here who is older than me that can give me some advice for the future?",1
Tired of my ADHD Overtaking My Life,"I’m 30, live with my girlfriend, and don’t have a great paying job. I probably could make more if I took on more responsibility, but I have terrible inattentive ADHD. 

It stops me from doing things that I know I need to do. Instead of doing things to better my life, I always want that short term fix to keep me happy.

Truthfully I hate my job. I’m in sales, and I was pigeonholed into it. It’s the worst, especially for someone like me.

When I was younger, I was put on Vyvanse but I went off it after a day because I didn’t like how I felt on it. But now, I really feel like I need some meds. My girlfriend just got a really nice job with a significant pay raise, while I’m here struggling to find a purpose and getting caught in the despair that ADHD has built for me.

I know I was rambling, but I’m having late night thoughts that are keeping my up tonight",1
"I thought i got rid of my anxiety, i was wrong.",I've been having anxiety from the time i woke up till the time i fell asleep every single day almost 7 years now. I met someone 1.5 months ago. Fell too hard for him. The funniest thing happened and ever since then i did not have anxiety AT ALL.  Which very weird for me because i do not remember a single minute without anxiety for the past 7 years. Then of course things didnt work out and my anxiety came back the day he left my life. What could be the reason i honestly dont know. I know that i miss him a lot and would do anything to get him back. But still cant understand how someone can have an impact that huge unknowingly.,1
I think my ADHD meds are changing me…..,"Iv been on Vyvanse 50mg and Ritalin 20mg for at least 1 year now. I’m a (f29). 

Iv noticed some great positive effects from the medication such as 
-motivation 
-less meltdowns 
- feeling like I’m able to think a lot more logically
- don’t take things personally anymore. 

However I have also noticed that I’m beginning to see friendships/ relationships for what they were when I was not medicated this has left me feeling like I want to distanced myself and do what’s right for me. 

I’m confused as to if I’m genuinely changing for the better or worse. 

I just can’t seem to fake any more conversations with people like I used to before , or partake in things that I don’t want to. The thought of having surface level interactions and long conversations with people just really throws me off. 

Most times I prefer to be alone in my own little world.",1
how to relax after making a possible life-threatening mistake?,"i'm currently cat-sitting for a friend, and i stayed over today. wanted some toast to eat while watching tv, there's no toaster here, so i turned the gas stove on, which has like a middle griddle on it, which usually just has one big burner (my stove and most other stoves layout) but this stove has two burners, so i turned both on, changed my mind about the toast and just turned one off (this is what i'm used to since my stove has the one big burner) and forgot all about the other one, went to watch tv, felt tired, got in bed and as i was about to go to sleep i got super thirsty, went for a glass of water and realized i had left the one extra burner on for like 2 or 3 hours with the griddle on top, i obviously turned it off and instead of relief i freaked tf out which was followed by an unshakeable sense of dread and my mind just started racing with what-ifs: 

what if i hadn't gotten thirsty and left the burner on all night and burned down my friend's house, killed myself, her cats, the neighbors, the neighbor's kitten, what if i left it on and the flame somehow got extinguished and i killed myself and everyone in this building from carbon monoxide poisoning, the tamest one: what if nothing happened but my friend's gas bill came back at an exorbitant rate and she got super mad at me and stoped trusting me altogether.

mind you, stovetops have been a huge struggle for me since time immemorial, but being unmedicated (idfk know why since i was dx'ed pretty young), i've prided myself on becoming an insufferable controlling apprehensive heap of neuroses, because that's the only way i can cope with this ~~curse~~ disorder and not fuck everything up in my life in one millisecond, and yes, i do have some modicum of control over my life despite the adhd and mainly because of these neuroses that stemmed mostly from continuously and mercilessly self punishing whenever i fuck up since i have a memory. this is a double edged sword as you can see because i cannot stop ruminating on all the fucked scenarios that might have come from this and now i can't sleep even though i'm tired as hell and need to sleep because i'm in the middle of a major ibs flareup from too many stressors and sleep is much needed. 

 i just can not stop going over the same damn thing and hating myself about it and thinking about how i told my therapist i didn't feel fit for catsitting because i had preemptively thought about all the worst possible scenarios and she told me i was actually trustworthy and responsible and now this is a testament to the opposite and that i shouldn't have been trusted around the cats because i was obviously going to kill them and myself from being such a ditzy dumbass, as always.

and yeah just wanted i guess to vent and ask y'all if you went through this or something similar and how to cope",1
OCD & Anxiety are a terrible mix with ADHD,"I have ADHD (Inattentive), along with OCD and anxiety.

"Not new to ADHD, but recently lost my job and am looking for some help with making a plan","I'm a 45 year old man. I was diagnosed with ADHD during a meeting with a psychologist... 6 years ago.  I knew about ADHD, like everyone else. But it never occurred to me that I ""had it.""  To be honest, like most everyone else, I wasn't even sure it was a ""real thing.""  I certainly did not think it was something that applied to any adult. So... anyway... I am in a real ""bottom of a well"" situation right now... and I just thought I might reach out for some help after watching a YouTube video where someone mentioned this subreddit. If you read this post, and think... ""Well... okay... but what specifically are you asking?"" I must pre-apologize... because I am not 100% sure. My life situation has gone from doing-okay... to NOT doing-okay... in record time. And right now, I have more problems than I could ever squeeze into a Reddit post. So... I'm kind of just... reaching out... hoping someone can give me... some kind of perspective or advice.

My job:  The job that I had up until I was laid of in March, was... the text book definition of... the WORST job for someone with ADHD. My job was one of those jobs where, my manager would assign me some mega-task... where it was not clear to anyone whether the task might take someone 2-3 weeks, 2-3 months... or even > a year. The team was made up of absolute golden-soul kind-hearted people... so... it seemed to me like a *perfect* job. They would basically ask me how long I think something would take. I would give an honest answer. But... I always over-estimated how long it really takes to do something. Like... I would say... ""I can have that done by Friday."" only to discover... I should have said ""three weeks."" But it was okay... because they would always say... ""No problem... just have it done by the end of the quarter."" i.e. deadlines of three months were extremely common. So... of course... I would intend to get right on that. But then... two-and-a-half months later... I was always scrambling to get something done. And always disappointing everyone.  I am a very charming guy... so i was always able to get help from all my resources... and I would get it done. But. for 5 years, this job was one big feeling of... Oh my God, I am a terrible person!!! dot com!!! dot  gov!!! dot ORG!!!

Then... when COVID began, I had to do my job from home. I'm divorced, and live alone. So... I became the shut-in-extrovert. And.. after two years of the most complete loneliness I've ever felt... plus... having a job that I was clearly destined to fail at...  my outlook on everything was (is)... bad. Very bad. And... I could not seem to explain it to anyone. My mom... sister... friends... Try explaining how your job is basically a cake walk in the park... and it's making you miserable!!! No one understands. They think it sounds perfect! Flexible deadlines.. Given months to complete easy stuff... blah blah blah. It all sounds like job-porn to most people. Anyway... my self-worth was at -11... and then... one morning... I get an email that my position was being eliminated. Laid off. 

At the time... I was not even upset! I honestly felt a deep feeling of relief.  I felt like I could finally get back out there and find something that I could be proud to do. Well... now... it's been 2 1/2 months. I have done some very minor online job searching. I've completed my resume and sent it to some companies... but I have not actually gotten down to business and started a solid job search. My insurance lapsed, and as I type this... I have no health insurance. I don't even know what COBRA is... and I feel absolutely paralyzed. paralyzed with fear that I might have an accident and have no insurance. Paralyzed that I am 45 years old and have NO IDEA. what job to search for. I don't know what I want to be when I ""grow up."" I was taking adderal, but that ran out 2 months ago. I was also taking Lexapro for anxiety... that also ran out.

So... yeah... I was already depressed, lonely, and feeling worthless. I lost my job... and within a couple of weeks, I've gone from feeling worthless to not even knowing it was possible to feel this bad. Stopping those medications cold-turkey like that was... terrible. I am not a ""sad person."" Meaning... I do not cry often... I do not think bad thoughts... In general, I'm a pretty ""peppy guy"" usually. But... since I lost this job... I've been crying, every, day! Like... sobbing in the shower!!! I haven't slept an actual night's sleep in... months. I wake up at 6:00 pm... feel like I'm in some kind of bad dream where I am awake all night... and then pass out from exhaustion at 7:00 - 8:00 am... trying to NOT do that... so i can reset myself and try to stay awake so I can ""get normal"" again. 

I've started walking every day. I try to really push myself to do exercise hoping that it will reset my clock.. and I can get some good Vitamin D from the sun and some endorphins.  And I do feel a good sense of accomplishment, but it is not helping with the sleep. I don't drink alcohol (thank god!) I did in the past... but... I got away from that years ago. And, I've been trying to do as many ""Reaching out"" activities as possible. i.e. using Meetup dot com to find some hobby groups... tried online dating... trying to just meet some new people. I think the dating part is a little stupid right now...but to be honest... it's been great! I have been starving for just conversation... so... I enjoy it, even if I am not exactly ""boyfriend material"" right now. 

Anyway... I will end this post now... but really... my main ask... of you guys... is... How on Earth can I find a job that fits my ADHD brain? I did some Google searching for ""Best jobs for people with ADHD,"" and they were all jobs that I cannot just... get. Like... Teacher. Journalist. Food Service.  I'm 45... single income... have a $1,500/month mortgage. I can't just... be a teacher. or ... become a journalist. And Food Service... I wouldn't have the slightest idea about that. 

Does anyone here have a resource for, ""ADHD Tech jobs."" I honestly feel like my ""calling"" is to be something where I am helping people. But... like... within a tech sector, environment. Like... a manager... or a consultant. But I don't have any mgmt experience and... I just don't know where to turn for some help with getting my head straight.",1
Sound looping / earworms,"If I could give up one thing about having ADHD it would be this. All bleeping day I have had 1 line of ""Say It Ain't So"" by Weezer in my head ON REPEAT.

I don't even LIKE Weezer or know where I even heard that song last, nor could I tell you any other word in that song aside from the line that's on repeat. It's torture 🫠

Just a finals week rant blah blah blah,"I'm just ranting is all. I fucked myself over and im gonna probably fail some classes. My professors were nice and gave me extensions for my assignments. I had a solid 3 weeks where i had a clearer medicated head to potentially complete my assignments. but i didn't do it. I kept making excuses and putting things off and going on my phone feeling sorry for myself. I'm an incredibly fortunate person for even having the chance to do another semester after quitting halfway thru my 2nd one. I have a therapist, i have meds, so i think i just need to fix my habits. I say that and never bother to fix them. I'm failing classes once again.  


I knew i knew i knew my lazy school habits werent all from my mental illness, but i latched all my hope on the meds anyways. Now i fucked myself over. Again! Just when people were starting to expect me to actually do something with my life for once.

&#x200B;

I'm incredibly lucky and privileged to be able to go to college, to have my parents pay for it, to have a sympathetic family, to not have to juggle a job during the semester, everything. I'm sick of taking everything good in my life for granted. I'm sick of failing classes and missing assignments and disappointing myself and others. But it feels like i will NEVER have the willpower to make myself a better person. I just lie in bed and watch youtube all day. So many people have it so much harder than me and deal with mental and physical problems that i can't even comprehend, but all i'm bothered to do is whine and complain about my own problems.",1
Feeling trapped,"I'm in art school, art was something I used to love doing, but in the past years i began losing my focus. I do less and less every day, be it school work or just personal art for my own enjoyment. Right now, finals for my 2nd year in uni are _weeks_ away and I have absolutely zero drive to work on anything. All I do is fixate on very short-lived obsessions for that dopamine rush, like certain games or movies. I dont have any aspirations. I have a burning need in me to _know_ things, to learn and experience and DO stuff. But i just... can't.

Recently, I began to realize some things are not actually in my control, and out of a last attempt at finding _why_ i couldn't escape from this hole I've dug myself into, I went to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with ADHD. I will start medication in a month, which _is_ progress and will most likely help in gaining some control and drive in my life... yet I cant help but overthink everything. The second i feel that terror and discomfort creep in, I dont even try doing any work. And due to toxic relationships in my life, and due to my previously undiagnosed ADHD, i have little to no trust in my own mind.

Here is where i feel i need an outside opinion. Whenever I'm in a conundrum, I start spiraling and end up with nothing but mush in my brain. Am I stopped by my condition, or am I letting myself be stopped? Do i have the power, actually, but its just very uncomfortable to overcome this struggle, or is this thinking the same one used by the toxic people in my life, to belittle my struggles and blurr my limits? Am I, by not trusting myself, reinforcing my insecurities, or blocking out the response I learned to throw _at_ myself as a punishment?

Am i pushing myself in this corner or just accepting ive been pushed here by other factors?

TLDR: I'm overthinking my every choice/ avoidance _of_ choice, cant tell if its more my fault or out of my control and I need an outside opinion in hopes that i can figure out what to do.


So sorry for how lengthy this is.",1
Canceling plans and guilt,"The past few weeks have been emotionally intense and draining.  I've had more than one major moment of derealization from family members surprising me with very negative attacks.  There was a death in the family.  I officiated the funeral.  I've had to take lots of time off work for these things and for migraines and etc.  

I assist at church in a big way and am training for the clergy.  Today I woke up with my head swimming and a general sense of utter exhaustion.  It's a church day of course, but I decided it would be best for me to take the day off, because of dizzy head and not having enough me-time, which is SO essential.  (I have something every night after work this week except for next Friday).  Sorry, all this detail feels relevant for some reason.

I texted the pastor this morning to let him know I didn't feel safe driving and making sure he was okay to handle the service alone.  There was no response so I called him and I honestly couldn't tell if he was upset or not.  Something about it felt dismissive, but I'm sure that's my guilt talking.  I always feel guilty when I call in sick for something.  Impostor syndrome for sure.  Maybe I'm overreacting and being selfish and maybe I'm not THAT sick.  And then I go into defensive mode and start saying things to myself as if I was on trial, even though the only response was a nonchalant ""Okay, hope you feel better.""  Now I anticipate that, rather than spending some quiet time recovering from the last two weeks, I'm going to feel uneasy and guilty that maybe I'm a selfish jerk for not trying, or something.

Sorry, that was messy.   My head really is swimming.  Needed to share this because I don't want to have a day like that.  I do want to stop off at my parents' house for Mother's day.  I wish I wasn't like this.  You'd think at my age (over 50) I would have gotten over this sort of reaction.",1

"Feeling low, need advice",I (male 26) found out i have undiagnosed ADHD recently. I am addicted to porn and binge watching tv shows as a coping mechanism for my childhood trauma. I was fine last year in a way. I had a girl whom i loved very much. But she was not as into me which i found out later when i proposed. I really wanted it to work with her because she was the first person in a long time who saw me for exactly who i was. I was never so happy before in my life. Its been almost a year and we talk from time to time. Now i feel like there is a void where the love and friendship used to be. I need to better myself first. I am trying to move forward but i feel like i have lost my anchor in life. I find myself watching porn and binge watching shows when i should be working. I feel bad afterwards but now i feel like i have lost the reason to better myself. I would want some advice from you guys on reditt on how i can get back on track and not lose sight of what is important. The ADHD kind of makes me forget and it is hard to coordinate. I just need some helpful advice.,1
"Rejection, Getting over someone","Hi everyone, sorry in advance if I write a bit weird, Honestly I find it somewhat hard to open up, I'm not very good at it. Throwaway account because this is rather personal. I figured this would be the best place to ask this as I believe its related to my ADHD and you fine people might relate.

I have been attracted to a friend for some time, so I finally decided to take the plunge and ask her out. I got rejected, with a very cookie cutter rejection, which kind of hurt, but we are still good friends. Initially I had a wave of euphoria because I actually managed to ask her in the first place, but this went away after some time. Next came the inevitable sadness.

I still see her in a romantic way, it feels like it wont go away. I got a no, I should be fine to move on, but I'm NOT. I don't know how to handle this, and tbh I feel like I'm wasting time, imagining a relationship that will never be. So why am I still so attached? This feels like such a setback when I've been working on myself mentally for a good while now...

She is also actively dating and telling our friend-group and me about it, which, well, doesn't exactly help or feel great.

Do you guys ever go through this? How do you deal with it?",1
my adhd ruined my relationship with someone who meant the world to me,"last year at 22 I got diagnosed with adhd and have been on vyvanse ever since. it has helped a lot school wise but i didn’t realize until now all the other issues that adhd has caused. 

my boyfriend that i was dating for over a year just broke up with me and i’ve finally realized that it was adhd causing so many issues for me in our relationships as well as my difficulty to make/ keep friends my whole life. 

I didn’t even realize what the true issue was until i started to research adhd more and it has finally made my whole life struggles make more sense. 

but now i am also struggling with the guilt of ruining my relationship with someone who meant a lot to me. i struggled with emotional dysregulation a lot which made me cause a lot of fights as well as not being able to communicate how i felt effectively. i struggled to be social with his friends sometimes out of fear of rejection even though they were always nice to me. 

i know that not understanding my adhd made it impossible to stop these issues. now that i do know i’m working on managing it so that i can avoid these problems in the future. i just wish i would’ve known sooner.

I’ve started seeing a counsellor to help me work on it. I just hope that one day he’ll give me another chance. I know i made a lot of mistakes and it sucks that i didn’t even know that i was doing it till it was too late. i know that i need to work on it to have a healthy relationship. I just know that i wouldn’t have lost him if i didn’t have adhd. i am already improving and hope to continue improving each day. i know i needed to learn this about myself and grow as a person but i just really hope there’s another chance for us in the future.",1
Am I deppressed? Is it the meds? Is it my period?? (TW: feelings of incompetence\uselessness),"It wasn't supposed to, but it's kind of a rant.

 I've just been feeling kinda..weird, lately. If I'm not actively crying\\having an almost anxiety attack\\feeling an overwhelming sense of uselessness, I can't say for sure what I'm feeling. 

I'm in college since 2021; since i started I've felt useless\\incompetent\\stupid in at least one subject. That's fine, i guess; I assume everyone deals with something like this. But this semester is especially bad. Even in subjects that I supposedly already have some knowledge on, I just fuck something up and can't keep the assignments on time. And even before I fuck something up or even star something, I just think, ""let's see how long this lasts until it derails completely"". I don't feel like doing anything other than lay in my  bed or watch something random on youtube, thus making everything harder for myself.

In general, I have some difficulty taking showers (I like being clean, but the whole process of taking a shower really tires me out), but it's never been as hard as it was these last few weeks. Doing anything,  washing the dishes or cooking an egg, made me feel like crying. I have\\had group assignments where I'm not doing much, I know that, I've apologized to my friends that are doing them with me, but most of the time I just can't **make myself do it.** Since being diagnosed and getting on meds (Ritalin), I've been ok at forcing myself to do things, but it just hasn't been working lately.

I just have this sense of failing in every aspect of my life (college, living alone, managing relationships, having any ability to get a job, even as trainee...) and it's tiring, for me and for the people around me. My boyfriend thinks I'm depressed; i disagree. I think it's me being generally bad at being a member of society, mixed with having a period that usually messes deeply with my mood (it's supposed to come this week, that's why I'm wondering if the last shitshow week could be a result of it, but it's usually not that bad). 

Some things in my personal life also messed with my emotional, so yeah, it's been...a month. I'm just wondering if it's deppression, my innability to do things, hormones, a mix of some, a mix of all.... Tired, that's something I know I feel most of the time.

Next month I'll look for a therapist that my ensurance covers. I'm not doing it for me though; if I waited until I felt like going to a therapist for me, I just wouldn't go. I don't like the ideia of just talking about personal things to a stranger (yes, i realise the irony of posting something like this online, but I can't see you, you can't see me, so it's easier and less likely for me to get embarassed and shut down), it doesn't exactly makes sense the whole process of it, to me. Even more so after i tried therapy before, and the therapist complained to my parents I wasn't opening up fast enough after six months. 

So I'll do it for my parents, for my boyfriend and friends; for the people I fear hurting because of the way I feel about myself. 

English is not my first language and sorry for the rant. Hope your week has been good.",1
Thing my mum googles about me,"It’s Mother’s Day and I was told to arrive at my parents’ place at 11am for a casual brunch. 5 ppl. For various reasons, I didn’t get there until 11.50am.

Once I realised I was going to be late, I was really stressed and anxious and trying to get there as quick as I could.

I sent some messages to my family to say I was running late, apologised, and said that they should start eating.

When I arrived I said “I’m so sorry Mum” and tried to go up to her and say Happy Mother’s Day and give her a hug, but she wouldn’t look at me and wouldn’t let me touch her.

Later on I was helping her set up and connect her new headphones and I noticed the most recent tab open on her phone, a google search for ‘why do people with adhd f*#^ up and arrive late to special occasions’.

There’s a lot more detail I could add but I just am so sick of feeling so guilty all the time when I really don’t intend to be late, and even though I have improved so much with my punctuality and I’m mostly on time, there’ll always be times that I slip up and I get so upset anticipating the impending conflict with my family.

I just feel like a piece of crap. Apart from trying harder to be on time, what can I do?",1
Had my brother feed my lizard while on vacation. He stole my adderall.,"Went on a small trip with my wife and some friends. I asked my younger brother to come over while I was gone and feed my shrimp and gecko. Our relationship has been rocky over the years. He’s 6 years younger than I am. He recently had a baby, and I’m about to be a dad so I figured things would change. Well fast forward to coming home. I go to get my medicine and it seems abnormally empty. I didn’t think much of it. 
Today I was visiting my parents and I overheard my brother telling my mom that he was able to sell the medicine he had mentioned to her and was able to get some money to continue day to day until his next paycheck. 
When I heard him say that it all clicked. I confronted him about it and he justified it with saying he needed the money to pay rent. I don’t care that he stole my medicine. I’ll be fine. What hurts is that he came into my home and STOLE. It could’ve been ANYTHING. 
But the fact that he stole my medicine made it all that much worse. Once I counted he stole about 20 days worth of medicine. Now I have to wait until my next refill date on the 24th. I’ve been without my meds since the 5th of this month. 

I also had to tell my wife about the incident, and she’s pissed, righteously. She doesn’t want him at the baby shower. 
I guess it just hurts, ya know?",1
Need advice? Support?,"I’ve been off my medication and I can’t do anything. I’m behind in my class and meant to withdrawal and I missed the deadline by two days. I’m so disappointed in myself. I’m extra forgetful. I don’t know what to do. I just am disappointed in myself. I’m going to fail and I can’t catch up. 

It’s just one class that I’m not interested in at all. I sit down and try to complete assignments and I can’t get myself to start/finish them. I’m so embarrassed",1
Sudden noises makes me jump and then elation for a few seconds.,"As a example, there is a (mostly dusty and unused ) drum machine box unit on the desk here, and for some reason it cracks and makes a loud clicking noise every now and then. More like a snapping sound sound than a click. It is right in front of me so it makes me jump everytime. What then happens is a short lived sense or feeling of elation, for several seconds. Every time. Noises arise elsewhere and there is a psychiatric building just beyond the back garden and the same thing. It is a lovely and professionally run place but the sudden noises that arise does make me jump sometimes.

As i type i am trying to think of some relevance to adhd, otherwise this is pointless waffle. Maybe serotonin, or endorphin is it, neurochemical release is somehow not dissimilar to this. Which i think might help explain the benefits of any form of physical exercise for some adhd people.

I hope this is not overly obscure, because iff i could bottle the intial response i would. Its almost like i am over-tense, worrying about things, using the computer and wham! im shaken out of this for short time anyway.",1
Off meds & Angry at the noise,"Hey guys, I think i'm mostly looking for reassurance that i'm not a horrible person, but for the past few months, my tolerance to noise has gone way down the drain. My doctor and I decided to taper off vyvanse (which I have been on for 2-ish years), and I still think this decision is for the best, but for the life of me it pisses me off how much noise the general public makes. 

The neighborhood kids surrounding my apartment love to scream for hours on end outside, and it seems like when *that* is not happening, some other neighbor leaves their poor dog outside to yelp and scream and make noises no dog should make. It makes me sad that the sound of kids playing gets to  me this much, and i can literally feel it igniting my nervous system and I'll try so hard to just work through it but the anger always comes in so quick and fiery if yk that feeling. 

I know it's not the kids' or dog's fault, but I just feel so frustrated bc it seems like these adults give absolutely no consideration to the echo chamber of concrete walls that surround the area. If i'm being super super real, I think the anger probably deep down is at myself for not being able to tune it out like the rest of the world... I've tried headphones and earbuds, but they both end up hurting my ears after about 45 min which also makes me feel just like a brat who wants their way...but i just want ***quiet*****.** 

**TLDR:** 

Please, if you can relate to this or can share a similar story, please do!!! 

Any words of advice, wisdom, encouragement, or criticism are welcome, I just feel alone",1
This ADHD is gonna end up making me homeless,"I don't want this ADHD anymore. I feel like I can't even manage taking care of my house. I just can't focus on my simple daily tasks. It's hell. I'm living in someone's upstairs house right now. I have to borrow their washer dryer and kitchen because the upstairs doesn't have appliances. All I have to do is remember to clean the things I use, and I can't even do that. I'll cook and go upstairs and forget about the dishes I just made, and next thing I know they pile up and the landlord gets pissed. I'll put laundry in the washing machine and walk away and forget I even put any in. Everyone in my life has had enough of me. From my boyfriend to my landlord. I got told I'm no longer allowed to use the washing machine because I accidentally left clothes in it on a hot day and it made mold. I'm working a minimum wage job I can't afford the laundromat along with groceries and rent right now.

I feel like my brain is against me. Between the adhd and depression it almost feels impossible to do the smallest of things. I just moved out of my abusive mother's house. I was never given the chance to manage my mental health. I wish people would understand how hard I'm trying right now. I just started therapy to help with everything, but it feels too late by now. No one will give me a chance to redeem my mistakes. My boyfriend is on the verge of leaving and I'm about to lose my house if I can't do my crap correctly. How do I manage this? It feels almost impossible.  I'm in dire need of advice from someone because no one around me understands anything about how my brain works. I just wish people would give me the chance I need. I'm not lazy, and I'm not a slob. I just forget to do things. What is the best coarse of action to managing this? This isn't a crisis of any kind. I just need advice.",1
I want to eat well for adhd without being overkill,"Lately I have been trying to get the most out of managing and treating my adhd symptoms. I know high protein breakfasts are really important for stimulating dopamine production, so I have been looking at recipes. I want to find stuff I can make on the weekend that I can just grab before work that week.

The problem is I cannot search ""high protein muffin recipe"" without getting results geared towards health nuts. I'm looking for a muffin with lots of protein - I don't care about low carb low cal low sugar low fat whatever. I'm trying really hard to regain/maintain a healthy relationship with food, but all these suggestions seem to be coming from a place of borderline orthorexia. 

I guess I'm just frustrated that the obsession with ""healthy living"" and diet culture make it so there is no option between indifference and obsession. I'm very close to just taking a regular recipe and cutting the flour with protein powder. I just want to make muffins without feeling shamed for using oil and granulated sugar.",1
Hard time having conversations?,"When I talk to people, I have a hard time thinking of what to say or how to keep the conversation interesting. I talk to myself in my head before speaking and I blank out when having conversations. I also just end up not responding to the other person when I’m a conversation and end up making it awkward. Is this just me?",1
Anybody got labeled as having “minor” ADHD when in reality it’s much worse?,"I got tested when I was 9 or so and I got labeled as having “minor” ADHD, when I tend to hyperfixiate all the time, obsess about little stuff like making music and work ethic and had an issue with stealing money/kleptomania (which I have since fixed, thankfully, but it was caused by ADHD but I just read this online).

My parents don’t take it seriously and just say I have minor ADHD, and nothing major (mostly that there’s nothing wrong with me but seriously, they should’ve helped with the stealing). It doesn’t feel like I have a good structure for it. Anybody else deal with this",1
Tough week.,"This week was rough. It seems Wellbutrin (originally on for depression) is no longer keeping up with my symptoms. I’m recently diagnosed & having a lot of grief & relief at the diagnosis.
This week alone I: left some of my groceries in the cart at the store after paying for them, lost my AirPods & replaced after looking for days (found them in an inexplicable place this morning), got to the station to gas up without my credit card, and my morning meditations have been a SHLOG. 
    
I know this isn’t permanent. There will be better weeks and possibly worse. But this one was rough.",1
So...What Now?,"Hi. I've recently been through an extensive process of trying to get an ADHD diagnosis. I have it, I know I have it. My sister has a diagnosis of it from when she was a child and my symptoms are so much worse than hers, I've researched back and forth for literal years and it's the only conclusion that makes sense. I figured I needed meds, so I pursued a diagnosis. 

I went through like a whole system of questionnaires aiming to figure out once and for all whether I have ADHD or not. At the end of it all (months of work) my psychologist said I don't qualify. I have plenty of symptoms, especially of inattentive ADHD, but not enough hyperactivity to count, so they can't prescribe me any meds. The condition has such a strict definition in my country and meds are so tightly controlled that I just can't get them. I can't even try them out just to see if I'll get better. 

At first I was pretty frustrated and disappointed, but after about a week, I figured I could at least pursue non-stimulant meds. Surely they'll be less strictly controlled. So I researched and immediately found out all of them require an ADHD diagnosis. Every single one. 

Now I'm just disappointed. Am I supposed to just pull myself up by the proverbial bootstraps and deal with it? Live the rest of my life with cobbled together planners and calendars trying desperately to fit into the world? Is there any other way? I just don't know what to do.",1
"My girlfriend initiated a break, but now she's upset with me for accepting it. Did I do something wrong? (ADHD Considerations)","Hey guys, I'm feeling pretty confused about a recent situation with my girlfriend and could really use some advice or insight. Before I delve into the details, I want to mention that I have pretty severe ADHD, which sometimes affects my judgment and ability to interpret social cues accurately. I'm not sure if this played a role in the situation.

We've been together for about four months, and things have been pretty turbulent but we obviously have a strong connection. However, today, she approached me and said she thought it would be a good idea for us to take a break.

Now, considering my ADHD, I sometimes struggle with reading between the lines or picking up on subtle signals. Initially, I was taken aback, but I tried to remain calm and understand her perspective. I didn't want to push her away by being defensive, so I told her that I thought it was a good idea if that's what she felt was necessary. To my surprise, she responded by saying that if we took a break, we probably wouldn't get back together.

Given my ADHD, I tend to take things at face value, so I interpreted her statement as a breakup since she seemed to imply that the break could lead to a permanent separation. Therefore, I accepted it and expressed my understanding that it was over. However, that's when things took an unexpected turn.

She started calling me repeatedly and bombarding me with text messages, clearly upset and demanding that I ""fight"" for our relationship. I was really taken aback by this because I thought I was respecting her wishes by accepting the break. It felt like a contradiction to me.

When I confronted her about this, she explained that she wanted me to show more effort and passion for our relationship, and the fact that I had initially agreed to the break was not what she wanted to hear. She said she wanted me to fight for her and prove that I cared.

Given my ADHD, I'm questioning whether my interpretation and response were influenced by my condition. Did I misread the situation and fail to understand what she really wanted? I genuinely thought I was being understanding and respecting her wishes, but now I'm questioning if I missed some important context.

I'm really confused about her mixed signals, my ADHD, and not sure what to make of all this. Am I to blame for this misunderstanding? I still care about her, but I don't want to keep going in circles with conflicting expectations. Any advice, especially from individuals who have experience with ADHD in relationships, would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Girlfriend suggested taking a break, I agreed, she got upset and demanded I fight for our relationship. I obviously have ADHD (diagnosed 12 years ago) and I'm unsure if my interpretation was influenced by it. Feeling confused and unsure about what to do next. Any advice, including insights from those with experience in relationships involving ADHD, would be greatly appreciated.  


**EDIT/UPDATE:**

I woke up to 147 notifications and have tried to read as many as I can.   
  
I am blown away, absolutely blown away by all of your support, I am so grateful for all of your comments and I am so sorry I can't respond to them all.  
  
I now have clarity around the situation after thinking about it deeply and of course taking on all this feedback from all of you wonderful people.  
  
I have decided to take steps to end this relationship for good, but I will be doing it in a way that is tactful and will try to minimize harm to her in any way possible. But yes, given that I already felt like I wanted out and the overwhelming consensus from all of you beautiful people, this is the right thing to do for both of us.  
  
Much love to all those that replied/read/upvoted etc., I needed support, and you all delivered, more than I could have ever hoped for.

Conflicted/not managing well,"Hey everyone. 

I've been diagnosed with adhd for 2 years, type one diabetes for 24 and coeliac (severe gluten auto immune response) for 20. I also suspect I struggle a lot with autism socially. 

I'm struggling to tolerate side effects of both stimulants and atomoxetine so can only tolerate a small dose of dexamphetamine every other day.  

Basically, I have ways to sort of get by and cope about half of the time but the pmdd side of things throws me out of whack and I stop being able to function (unable to work, so irritated by every little noise/find it so difficult to be kind to myself because of the amount of pressure I have to do things because of my health, intensified rejection sensitivity, feeling and thinking irrationally).

Due to the unpredictable and demanding nature of type 1 and of how difficult is it to avoid cross contamination for gluten I'm nearly always unwell (especially with adhd making it hard to remember to do things/to eat/hard to process things at the necessary speed to keep up with my health). 

I live in the UK and I'm very lucky that we have the NHS I doubt I'd survive without it. However, I don't know I can help myself, not sure if I'd like comfort or solutions maybe both? But I'm experiencing a lot of suicidal ideation (no planning just the feeling) the last few days, particularly from the effects of when I accidentally ingest gluten (malnourishment, brain fog on top of the adhd kind, migraines, double fatigue). 

Is there anything anyone has found helps them cope or lessens their number of meltdowns? I know this was a long winded one so thank you if you're reading. I have a pip assessment coming up which is a battle in itself, I know that support would go a long way if it goes well (ongoing for 5 years).",1
Getting diagnosed + QB testing,"Hello! First-time poster, but have lurked quite a bit.

  
I am 32 years old female and I'm in the process of getting diagnosed with ADHD. At least I really hope so! I started looking into all of this maybe about 6 months ago (after a TV show talked about it) and let's just say that everything suddenly clicked.

  
Thankfully, I found a really great doctor. She referred me to get tested with QB Testing without any extra questions, although she didn't say much more about the diagnosis process. I probably should have asked but I was really nervous about it!

  
Now, my question is about QB testing. I am a bit nervous very about it as I have read some stories about people getting a false negative result with the QB Test. Does anyone have any tips for when I do take it? How would you suggest preparing? Anything I should keep in mind, anything I should make sure to do during the test?

  
Or if anyone has any stories that could put my mind at ease about it all, I would also really appreciate it.",1
