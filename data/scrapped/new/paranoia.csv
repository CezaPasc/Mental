do the iv amino acid terapy help with antipsychotic or drug withdrawal?,,1
My parents made me so paranoid,This all started when I was younger and my dad and stepmom (mom died when I was 7) would sit downstairs in the room above mine and listen and monitor every little movement and noise I made. This made me very paranoid my whole life and I know any movement or noise I make will be met with punishment. They expect me to be downstairs with them all day every day and to listen and talk about them all the time. Anytime I try and talk about myself or something I‚Äôm dealing with it‚Äôs always a story from her or my dad about how they had a similar experience when they were my age and ‚Äúunderstand what I‚Äôm going through‚Äù Then they will continue talking about themselves and how great they are. Now the eavesdropping and creepy behavior didn‚Äôt stop when I got older. It got worse. We only have 2 bathrooms in my house and one is upstairs near my room. The kitchen is right above that bathroom so they would whenever I went to use the bathroom go in the kitchen and listen. Then my stepmom would always come upstairs and wait in her room for me to finish. Then not the second I opened the door she acts like she wasn‚Äôt just listening to me and walks back downstairs. She always would comment about the smell always telling me to light a candle or you need to ask your dad for some airwick. She would always go in the bathroom after I was done and always listen and be around when I did. Now that I‚Äôm older and still live at home I can‚Äôt even use the bathroom anymore. I haven‚Äôt used the bathroom at home in over a year. I‚Äôm gonna need years of therapy and behavioral therapy just to reverse all the trauma and damage they did. I always think no matter what someone is listening and monitoring everything I do. They even watch the WI-FI to see exactly what I‚Äôm doing and looking up. I have never in my life been around people who treat someone like this just because they need attention.,1
help,"so, i live in not the safest neighborhood. majority are on meth, the rest of us are either old or uncivilized families. my family is one of the more normal families here, thats not saying much considering our next door neighbors are on meth and constantly being roudy in the middle of the night. 2-3 years ago, i was never concermed for my safety and i loved being home alone. now i dont even feel safe when everyone is home. anyways. we recently purchased 2 ring cameras, one for our front porch and the other for our driveway. so far we've seen multiple people, one presumably on something and others who had stolen from houses nearby. i keep hearing things. outside my room is a blind spot to the camera which is terrible because i can not constantly moniter who is outside, and i have to make my own judgements. i will ALWAYS go with my gut, which is why i have currently locked myself into a different room in the house and i will be sleeping here for the rest of the night. i dont know what to do. i dont feel safe in my own home anymore. im terrified somebody is watching, waiting for the perfect time to break in and do god knows what. what if they hurt me or my family or both? ive been living everyday like its my last because it could be true. i mean, these people are already senseless, but anything that mightve remained has definetly been overtaken by the meth. i cant live like this anymore. id rather burrow away for the rest of my life than live in this constant state of fear and worry to the point where i jet to a new room at 3 in the morining and rant on reddit about how scared i am. im always listening and worrying. i cant take it. i might as well be the one on meth because it feels like im going insane. what do i do?",1
How many gaming names should I use for privacy?,"I used to use just one name for Reddit, Discord, Steam, Xbox, and other gaming stuff. Now I have like 3 I use.

looking for advice,"hi, i just found this sub with a quick search because i feel kind of desperate to talk to someone about how i am feeling. please let me know if this doesn‚Äôt belong here. 

i (27f) have had diagnosed anxiety and depression since i was 18. i want to be fully, completely honest here because i never had been before. i have talked about my intrusive thoughts before with my doctors, i have been through inpatient treatment. i didn‚Äôt always have them, it‚Äôs been about 3 years of having the ones about me wanting to die. however i haven‚Äôt described what i am going through recently because i do not want to and can‚Äôt be back in inpatient again. 


i am having intrusive thoughts almost constantly. anytime my mind is left to wander i immediately find myself thinking and sometimes even saying out loud ‚Äúi want to die/i want to kill myself‚Äù. i have never had a suicide attempt and i don‚Äôt feel like i am actually going to kill myself, i just can‚Äôt stop thinking it.


my intrusive thoughts have drastically shifted towards about being paranoid about being murdered. i live in a city with alarmingly increasing violence on the streets and public transit. it‚Äôs almost daily. this past winter i was physically assaulted by someone on the train. there is no specific person i am scared of or have been recently threatened by. but in public i constantly think i am going to be assaulted and killed. i think someone is going to attack me on the bus. i think someone is going to knife me from behind when i‚Äôm walking down the street. i think someone is going to shoot me in the back of the head through my window when i‚Äôm sitting on the couch.  i only ride the first and last subway cars so i can stand near the conductor incase something goes wrong. i get off of buses and trains as soon as anyone one makes me feel scared in any way at all. i don‚Äôt use headphones in public anymore and won‚Äôt look at my phone or read a book on transit. even if i wanted to i hear louder and louder and feel stronger and stronger that i am going to be killed. i didn‚Äôt know how to shake this. if anyone has any advice, books, other subs, or online resources to suggest please let me know! 
i want to reiterate that i am not a danger to myself, i don‚Äôt actually want to kill myself it just fees like a guttural  reaction for me to feel the thought and think i want to die. i am not a physical danger to myself. thank you in advance!ü´∂ü´∂",1
I think i‚Äôm paranoid?,"I‚Äôve always been a very anxious person and i worry a lot however i think it started a month or so ago i noticed i‚Äôve been having intense thoughts of things going wrong. Such as choking on my food and no one is around to help, which has lead to me not eating until someone is home. noises leading me to believe that someone is breaking into the house, being watched if the curtains are not closed, more commonly at night (i had to pin the curtain to the wall i was so stressed out)

Recently, I went on a trip and noticed that these intense thoughts were getting so much worse. The weeks leading up the trip i was obsessively imaging the plane crashing, and during the flight I really thought we going to crash several times. 
we were going to go kayaking, and my brain told me that i was going to flip over and wouldn‚Äôt be able to get back up or an animal was going to attack. We also went on a safari drive and through out the whole week i was almost hoping it would be canceled because every single day i convinced myself that we were going to be attacked by one of the animals. 

I can‚Äôt even step outside my house because my brain has told me that someone is going to hurt me. something is going to happen.

it‚Äôs gotten pretty bad with my social life too where i‚Äôm convinced people hate me. it‚Äôs made talking to others difficult to the point where i‚Äôm pushing people away.

to be honest, i cant tell if my anxiety has just skyrocketed or i‚Äôm starting to become a paranoid person. is this paranoia or possibly something else? or am i being overly dramatic? any advice on how to calm my mind down would be appreciated!",1
I think I need help. I might be paranoid.,"I dunno how bad it is. I dunno if I‚Äôm paranoid or correct, actually. But theres no way any of my friends actually like me. She hates my guts, and he thinks I‚Äôm cringe, and she thinks I‚Äôm annoying. And, one of them tries to plan things without me being there and talks behind my back. Maybe they even have a gc without me in it. Within the past week, I experienced what could be an ‚Äúepisode‚Äù of paranoid thoughts that were like this but so intense. It was like someone was screaming in my head. It ruined my mood for the whole day, and thats coming from someone who can go from sad to happy in a minute. Do you think these are signs of paranoia? Or something like it? It‚Äôs all so confusing and feels so real, maybe I should ditch my friends‚Ä¶",1

paranoid delusions and the gates of hell,"okay so i want to start out by saying this is me reaching out asking what exactly to do..
stats: 
age - 15
height - 5‚Äô5
weight - 137lbs
sex - female
amount of dxm consumed - probably 3000mg ish over 6 days. 

it all started off as me doing dph over a year ago, i quit ts since. i have known about dxm for a little over 6 months now but decided to give it a try about a month ago. 
the first two times did nothing exceot make me tired, this was with robotussin syrup. then, i found out about coricidin, this is where my memory gets blurry. 
about 2 weeks ago i went to my local cvs and borrowed from the generous store about 3 boxes. i popped 8ps (240 ish mg) the first night. this was the beginning of my binge. i then proceeded to pop another 4, and then another 4 all in the same night within 5 hours. i stayed up the whole night, it was amazing, i never wanted it to stop. 
the next night i did the same (night before being friday night) so it now being saturday night i dosed up 13ps. (390mgs). 
i didnt do any sunday night as i had school monday (or at least i dont think i did).
i took 300mgs monday morning before school. i didnt want to go through the day sober. 
i had an amazing time being out of my mind and going through my classes in a daze. 
i did the same routine gradually upping the dose the next few days. 
whenever i stop i get extremely depressed, ive burned myself oretty badly during all of this (second degree). 
keep in mind i havent smoked thc at all during this. the triples were enough. 
then this is where it starts to get crazy. 
on wednesday night my friend came over unnanounced, it really confused me, i thought she was a hallucination. 
she smoked me up (by that i mean one bong rip) by then i had already taken 400mg of triples. she found out about it and just really confused me. 
listen, I can‚Äôt even tell at this point who‚Äôs fake and who‚Äôs not. I can‚Äôt tell who‚Äôs real and who‚Äôs not. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. I am living through my days in a daze and I can‚Äôt tell anything from reality. 
i really want to just end it. i need help but idk what to do. someone pls tell me what to do. i cant even recall most of this past week. the morning after my friend came over i was so fucked up and shaking so mf bad and was so paranoid i flushed the rest of my pills away. (sometimes during my binge i went out and got 7 more boxes). i just dont know what to do. after smoking the thc w my friend i was having paranoid delusions about getting sent to hell and my mom finding out and calling everyone who i thought was against me. i thought my friend was doing this on purpose. i just dont know ehat to do. 

i should probably mention i did all of this coming off an antipsychotic (abilify). so probs not a good idea (haha).

I keep seeing the number 666,"Title. I've been seeing the numbers 666 everywhere. License plates mainly, URLs, in media, even reddit usernames. 

I'm not a very religious person, though I have struggled with feelings of paranoia, it's gotten a lot better, though seeing the amount seeings is getting to me. It feels like an omen. 

Today, I noticed two cars parked outside of my place of work, first there was one ( I had taken a 15 minute break in my car) and then an hour or so later there were two ( On my 30 minute lunch ). At first I thought maybe the cars were empty, but one of the drivers stepped out, spoke to the other driver, and then they left together some short time later. 

I feel as if I am being watched, hunted, the infamous G-word

Saying this probably won't help, but I want to hear what others think.

extremely paranoid due to ptsd?,"TW: minor mention of abuse
I honestly don't know if this is normal for people who suffer from PTSD but I was in an abusive relationship for two years as an early high schooler and it's been almost 4 years since it ended. For that time I've had really bad sleep paralysis/paranoia based on my ex boyfriend. It ranges from him hiding under my bed to reach out and grab me, hiding in my closet, sh00ting me through my window, or hiding anywhere in my house with intent to hurt me or my family. Unfortunately recently aside from all of that normal paranoia, I've been scared of driving alone, being home alone, going to the store/public alone, etc. for fear that he's stalking me and going to find me to hurt me. Besides all of this I have routines and rituals I have to follow to feel safe such as I have to jump from three feet away into my bed so he can't grab me, close my blinds over my windows by 6 pm so he can't see in when it's dark, etc.

Main point of that whole thing is does anyone else struggle with PTSD based paranoia? / Is that a thing?",1
I‚Äôm so paranoid that my relationship is a trick.,"I‚Äôm very paranoid, like everyday, sometimes more one day than another, and it‚Äôs especially more potent in my relationship. I‚Äôm so afraid that this could all be a trick. I‚Äôm afraid of the idea that my girlfriend could be leading me on and trying to get me to be really attached and then hurt me really bad because it makes her feel good. I can‚Äôt convince myself that it‚Äôs okay or genuine. She says she loves me and wants to get married one day, she says she just knows I‚Äôll be her husband and that we‚Äôll have kids and be together forever. I‚Äôve spent Christmas and Thanksgiving with her and her family, and I‚Äôve been over to her parents lots of times and her mom talks about us getting married and says things like ‚Äúyou guys can‚Äôt break up.‚Äù They‚Äôre all so normal and great. I don‚Äôt feel worthy of being there which makes me feel like it‚Äôs all a trick. She‚Äôs invited me to parties and shown me that she wants to work on things together in our relationship and tells me I can talk to her and that she wants me to open up. I‚Äôm just afraid that it‚Äôs all apart of the trick and that I‚Äôll feel so good and then she‚Äôll ignore me one day or break up with me or cheat on me or find someone else and leave me for them and she‚Äôll feel good that I‚Äôm hurting. I‚Äôll feel so dumb for thinking I was good enough. I consider or feel strongly that this could be all apart of her plan; I don‚Äôt necessarily believe it but I feel it and consider it. She has everything. She‚Äôs beautiful, she has both parents, nice clothes, and good friends, and she‚Äôs going to school to be a teacher. Why would she want to be with me? I‚Äôm weird and sensitive and worried about things a lot and I‚Äôm afraid that all my worrying will ruin the relationship even though she says I‚Äôm not ruining anything. I wish I didn‚Äôt feel or think all the things that I do. I wish I could believe and enjoy the reality of things but I‚Äôm constantly suspicious that it‚Äôs not real and I hold myself back from fully attaching because I don‚Äôt want to get hurt. I‚Äôm afraid that we‚Äôll get married and have kids and then she‚Äôll leave me and take our kids and she‚Äôll be happy that I‚Äôm hurting. I worry that she would hurt me so much that I‚Äôd kill myself and that that‚Äôs what she wants because it will make her feel good to know that someone killed themselves because they couldn‚Äôt be without her love.",1
"Does anybody else ""enjoy"" their paranoia episodes?","Like it sometimes hits me. But the adrenaline, will to fullfill and do everything to protect myself, making plans how to protect myself. I feel like on amphetamine and time doesnt exist then.

I know its strange and it can be dangerous. But somehow when I am getting paranoic episode there is a part of me that enjoys it.",1
My teacher threatens to hit me and I need help/somebody to calm me down,"First off here‚Äôs what the teacher has said to me so far (these are just the things I remember off the top of my head):
He asks me ‚Äúhave you even done computer science?‚Äù I said ‚Äúyes but last year I had a lot of health issues so I missed almost half of the school year, so I‚Äôm not as confident as most people in this class‚Äù he rolled his eyes said ‚Äúsure‚Äù then walked off.
A couple of days after that - ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôve taken computer science before?‚Äù.
‚ÄúI really want to punch you‚Äù.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stupid‚Äù.
‚ÄúFool‚Äù.
‚ÄúOf course yooouu don‚Äôt understand this‚Äù.
Moves his hand towards my face with a clear intention of hitting me, stops and within inches to my face says ‚Äúno I can‚Äôt do that because you‚Äôre a girl but my patience is wearing thin‚Äù.
‚ÄúThis is so easy even somebody like you should be able to do it‚Äù 2x.

I know I‚Äôm not dumb and I‚Äôm capable of excelling in this class as prior to this year  I have been a straight A student in all of my classes including computer science but this teacher has made me doubt all of my abilities and has made me cry every single fucking lesson. I no longer find joy in this subject. I used to cry every morning about going to school as a whole but now I only cry about going to computer science. I know this sounds like over kill but I‚Äôve had a few nightmares about him.

I know it seems like the obvious answer is yes but there‚Äôs some variables.
It‚Äôs term 2, I‚Äôm half way through the year and switching to a different class i have no knowledge on (which are the only classes available) is going to be extremely difficult.
Because it‚Äôs term 2 the dean will ask why I‚Äôm changing classes now which means I‚Äôll have to tell her or she won‚Äôt let me move. I can‚Äôt do that because if I do she will likely talk to him about it which means I will be paranoid walking around the school in case he approaches me and yells at me/hits me because I got him in trouble (I already feel this way but I know it‚Äôll become unbearable if I talk to her about it). 
He‚Äôs known around the school for making controversial comments so what if I‚Äôm just being ridiculous? What if he‚Äôs joking and I‚Äôm just being overly sensitive?

A few days ago I told my friends about this thinking it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal and I was just being dramatic so they‚Äôd laugh it off, but they said he‚Äôs abusing/bullying me and that I should move classes. What they said has really gotten to me and ever since then my anxiety has been through the roof and I can‚Äôt sleep because I‚Äôm having nightmares about him. I think what makes this really difficult for me is that he looks like my granddad who hits me occasionally and that he acts like my mother, who has been the leading cause to my diagnosed ptsd. 

I know I‚Äôm being dramatic and that I‚Äôm just being a worry wart but I need help or some advice. I have school tomorrow and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capable of going to computer science or the dean. I wouldn‚Äôt be posting on Reddit but I don‚Äôt have an appointment with my therapist until Wednesday and tomorrow is Monday and I‚Äôm just at such a loss.",1
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening,"I think I might be in a manic episode, and have been experiencing pretty severe paranoia lately, compared to what it used to be.

And I just don‚Äôt know what to do or who in my life I can have an honest conversation with about all of this. I‚Äôm scared and tired.

Girls,I have major paranoia and anxity when it comes to doing anything with other people male or female. I have extreme social anxiety.  I have a very bad problem especially with women especially when I find them attractive I almost can't even function. I become so paranoid and anxious I hear stuff and thing stuff like she is watching me she is judging me. Then I look to see if other people are watching me because I think they are watching me talk to her and stuff. It's very bad even if I am by some attractive girl not even talking once to her I get these voices and racing thoughts and I get all red. It's even embarrassing because either have a new boss who happens to be an attractive women actually double my age embarrassing as it sounds and everything she is just by me I turn red and get voices and thoughts and she actually laughed about it are times it is so embarrassing. I go over many phrases in my head and I would never be with someone I work with but yet I still vet this way. What would you do?,1
"scared of everyone, can never speak up or talk about anything anymore","I‚Äôve always had paranoia and recently diagnosed with ocd , bpd depression etc. all the good stuff. but I didn‚Äôt realise I was so bad until I went into a psychosis episode where I went totally crazy ran away and was seeing / hearing things and that everyone including my family was out to get me. it was really insane I now have ptsd from it and now ever since and it‚Äôs been over a year that it happen my paranoia has reached its high and I‚Äôm not the same anymore:( I don‚Äôt talk to my family much anymore and I feel very isolated. I feel ashamed, guilt, scared, paranoid. I‚Äôm constantly on high alert. had a neighbour move in next door and their windows face ours and I feel like he spy‚Äôs / is out to get me.

Neighbors talking about me and my life.,I am being told that I am making this up in my head. But I feel like I hear the neighbors upstairs talking about me and my roommate. It sounds as if they are listening to every move I make and following me around the floorplan of my apartment to keep tabs on me and are waiting for a time to strike to make me leave. I'm very quiet and I don't make much noise. It's been making me not want to go home or fear for my safety coming and going. Idk what to do. Or how to prove to myself that's it's not real.,1
"I'm starting to realize that I've become a paranoid person. Warning, do not read the first paragraph if you're paranoid about fictional awful ideas, the second paragraph is more so about my paranoia relating to real people or things.","The most extreme thing I'm struggling with lately that has made this obvious is that I worry about being transported to a horrible place. There's a story I've seen about a boy who pressed a button to receive a million yen in exchange for being transported to an endless empty void for 500 million years, and then at the end of it he forgets all of it. It details all of the immense suffering and loneliness he endures and it's pretty horrible. Basically I worry about that happening to me, that when I fall asleep I'll wake up there, or maybe I already have every night and I just don't remember any of it. For weeks now I've felt uncomfortable with falling asleep in general, since that sort of temporary death experience scares me. But now it's to the point where my brain is telling me that falling asleep will actually result in hellish torture. I suffered from this to an even worse extent when I was younger, I thought it couldn't happen to me again, but it has.

&#x200B;

Reading other posts here I'm also realizing that I'm paranoid in other ways. Like when people don't respond to me quickly especially my boyfriend I worry about and even visualize them being dead or in immense harms way. I also feel like if I don't constantly outperform myself and do my best and work as hard as possible, the world will crumble around me and I'll be on the street or dead. These feelings are both similar to posts I found, and I was shocked that I related so much to posts on a subreddit about paranoia, because I've never thought of myself as paranoid before. I also have really bad OCD these days and worry about stuff like touching a surface and then getting sick, or I touch the surface and then my eyes and then I'll become blind. I also have to check stuff so many times, like my car being locked and especially that the burners on the oven are off, even if no one in the house has used them that day. Despite a lot of things in my life going really well, my anxiety and mental health in general has just been falling apart over the months, and it's becoming so hard to deal with.",1
Any advice would be nice. TW,So I‚Äôm in a long term relationship (almost 3 years). About a year ago someone forced themselves on me. I obviously told my partner what happened. He was kind and took care of me and things have been great. I can‚Äôt get rid of my paranoia though. I find myself torn apart worrying about if this person will contact my partner and try to convince them I was disloyal or try to ruin my relationship. These thoughts control every day. I start hyperventilating and sobbing uncontrollably. I‚Äôve tried talking to my partner and he obviously tells me he would never believe the words of someone else. But still. What things can I do or tell myself to get past this? (I‚Äôm in therapy and have been for a long time. Just wanted some outside perspective maybe? Thank you.),1
How to talk to someone with paranoia without upsetting them?,"My partner was hacked via online gaming about a year ago. Since then it‚Äôs caused her paranoia that has progressed to her believing my family and people at work are  somehow in on it. She thinks the original hackers created some kind of live feed of her conversations and it‚Äôs accessible to people she knows irl.

Her main evidence is that people repeat things she talks about in private in front of her. I have no way of explaining these things other than coincidence. She‚Äôs convinced my family wants us to break up without any basis or reason other than that they may have heard something bad she‚Äôs said on these recordings. She‚Äôs been talking in a suicidal manner and I tried to bring her to the hospital yesterday but she refused. She has a therapist but I feel she isn‚Äôt helping the way she should be. What can I possibly do? 

I confronted my family to ensure that they‚Äôve never been a part of this and they tell me absolutely not. But she‚Äôs still skeptical. I can‚Äôt tell her she‚Äôs crazy or wrong about it because that makes it so much worse. I just need help.",1
Why am i so paranoid?,"I cant go to school without thinking every one is making fun of me when they laugh or they are looking at me. I cant get myself to eat in school. I ruined myself in sports, i was so good at soccer but i got so self conscious on how i run by the bullying i don‚Äôt bother playing it anymore because i think someone is looking at me or filming me. i feel like someone or something is watching me or is in the same room as me.  my body doesn‚Äôt feel right.

I am terrified for my safety and families safety, i get panic attacks like someone is gonna break in my house any second while im home alone or that im being stalked. (???)

It‚Äôs grown to the point where i cant sleep. I convince my self that there are spiders in my room/bed. To the point i hallucinate my walls moving (like melting and creating weird spider like things and seeing their legs come out of the walls?) ik its not real but i cant sleep by myself like that.

I often give people advice if they are paranoid on their looks or do. I tell them nobody really cares and if they do just give it a day or ignore it, but i cant use that advice for me its just hard., i want to work on my mind to take back control",1

Hi :),"these thoughts are consistent and common enough that I don't recognize them as alarming thoughts rly. today's thoughts: 

the government sees everything I do say and think and let me do bad things and ruin my life, because encouraging criminal actions of the undesirables like me ensures the celebration of our execution. I am intrinsically evil, something wrong in my core. despite my resistance and pleading to God I'll eventually become a murderer, rapist or smth. they will wait until I become completely insane, arrest me, and kill me in jail. people will celebrate my death as I was a burden on all of society and did horrible things. this creates the allusion that justice was served.

In reality they know my decay is happening and they know how to help me, but they won't. they want me to become a horrible criminal, they could stop me and save people, save me, but they won't because a local villian distracts the masses from wanting justice of the elites. its all a distraction letting ppl like me fall to the extreme so they can maintain power.

people in my life are in on it. anyone except for like my mom & dad are all fake in a ploy to trick me. all my friends are nice to me to get dhit out of me, get me talking, fill out a file idk maybe it's just a game, laughing at me while I get a panic attack from someone smiling at me. everyone who needs to know knows and acts like they don't to ruin my life, they want to see how far it goes.


why are you talking to me? what do you want? what do you know? why are you being nice?

MY friend asks many private questions but he never talks about him self. I am very suspicious. Am I paranoid?," 

We  have a friend that always asks questions but never talks about himself.  He is 40 years old. Once I met him after job he asked me: did you go  somewhere in Saturday night? I replied that I went to some coffee shop.  Then he asked me 2 more times if I went to other places. Then he asked  me same questions for Friday. I was at 3 places.  I replied where I was.  Then he asked me if there was some band playing at place 2. I figured  out that he was checking if I am saying truth and I said yes. I figured  out that he will ask me more questions about my life and I decided to  play that game. He asked me if I go to coffee shop on working days, what  do I do at home, what do I do on computer, do I play games on phone.  Later he asked me what is happening on Facebook , how many Facebook  friends do I have, when do I wake up, when do I go to bed. Do I always  go to bed early? Did I ever go to bed at 3 am? Do I always go to beach  at 4PM. Once I told him that it is not good to go to beach before 4PM  because of UV radiation. Where do I go for the walk. Do I go outside at  same time. We know each other in real life. He asked me on chat: were  you outside, where you were, did I met somebody?  ( probably to ask that  person if they met me, to see if I am telling truth. ) I asked him same  questions to test him and he skipped them all. On question he asks new  question, he does not answer. he also asked me if I was drinking, how much, did I vomit  after drinking, do my cats pee on walls. etc. Once he was traveling in  other country and he spent 1 month there. he told nobody that he will  travel there. He spent one month there and he never told what happened  there. I asked him 3-4 questions and he gave me most boring answers.

He  does this to other people too. After he asks you many question, then he  talks about windows 7, Firefox, smart TV and other easy to understand  things about technology, but never about himself.

He  behaves like he is programmed. He walks same streets every day, He goes  outside at same time and goes back to home at same time. He goes to one  of 3 coffee shops every day. he stays at home every Sunday.

I decided to find excuses when he sends me messages, because it is weird. I do not go outside with him anymore. Am I paranoid? Am I bad person because I avoid him?",1

Is this paranoia or something else?,"One day I was sitting in my living room with my boyfriend while in a reasonably good mood. He came over to me to explain some math related thing, which involved him holding up a piece of paper flat (so it's just barely a line) in front of his eyes and it started making me very uncomfortable, I had to ask him to stop holding the paper in front of him because it felt like he was attempting to do something to me.

Then a few minutes later, while still on edge from that experience, he was talking to me about something else and went to scratch his forehead as he was talking and the way he was moving his fingers reminded me of spider legs and that freaked me out too. 

Edit: by the end of this 10 minute scenario, I had cried from the overwhelming feelings I experienced.

I only experienced these things every once in awhile. No more than a few times a week - few times a month. I do have BPD, and I know that one of the diagnostic criteria for that is transient stress-induced paranoia.",1

Plotting against me paranoia please help me,Hi what do I do if I feel like everyone around me is plotting against me? I feel like I‚Äôm just waiting for the people in my life/who were in my life/or people I‚Äôve come across in passing have been documenting me for years and are waiting for the right moment to give away all of my secrets. I‚Äôve also convinced myself the government is watching me or my phone/laptop have been bugged in some sort of way? I‚Äôm scared to even post this because again I‚Äôve convinced myself I‚Äôm being watched and documented all my life and someone is gonna find me. I was watching a show just now and it turned off by itself and now I‚Äôm convincing myself it‚Äôs the person watching me trying to show me little signs that they‚Äôre there and I should be afraid. Am I crazy? What do I do,1
Help?,I've tried voicing my paranoia to my family which many of you know isn't easy considering I think they too are plotting on me. I know that it's just my mind playing tricks on me but this shit is exhausting and I'm not talking about the lack of sleep. I mean mentally exhausting to not be able to trust a soul anymore. Started feeling this way slowly but surely when I was around 19 and I'm 22 now. It's gotten progressively worse and shows no sign of getting any better even though I'm aware of the problem. Anyone have any suggestions? I'm grasping at air over here trying to figure something out before I go insane.,1
Paranoid after eating cookie,"I don‚Äôt know if this fits the sub and I‚Äôll take it down if it doesn‚Äôt but I‚Äôm looking for some clarity and relief with this. So I just ate a Peeps frosted cookie, the ones from Lofthouse, and this one had a very strange texture in the middle of it. It had a sharp taste, like physically sharp, and it stuck to the side of my tongue, I still feel it even after multiple sips of water and even milk to try and get it off my tongue. I‚Äôm paranoid it was spiked with something, especially after hearing about fungus traveling in flour. Am I overreacting? Could it just be an overload of flour sticking to my tongue? Or should I do something about it?",1

"TW I feel like my life is stuck in a ""tsukuyomi"", or that life is a bad dream, and its awful","So much of what i see, especially on the internet, but even outside of the intenret, is my own internal experience, memories, and associations, reflected back at me through other experiences, things, names, and people.  its awful.

Some days i honestly feel like how Mal felt in inception, or how Truman felt in the Truman show when he realized everyone was keeping him in the dark and that his life was just a play.

I'm afraid of these feelings affecting others, but this is really how i feel about my own life and its scary to me.

My brain seems to spin narratives out of nothing, where i feel overconnected to the sounds my neighbor makes, and even find myself subconsciously going to the bathroom at the same time as them, only to find out after hearing them flush while im in the bathroom, and its like what they're doing is a reaction to what i am thinking. same with the (loud and annoying) cars outside my window, and of course i just HAVE to live on the bottom floor by a busy street, its like my parents did this to me on purpose, for revenge on me living with them insufferably for years after dropping out of college. even tho i know thats not how they think they feel, i think that's how they feel sometimes, and they wont admit it, but who am i to say how they feel, despite them gaslighting me and me gaslighting them.  so fucked up

it happens with the TV too, feeling like my brain is having a conversation with the TV itself. i know that's ""hallmark paranoid thinking"" but as long as im aware of it, im ""still in the prodrome"" or whatever. i know i need psychiatric help and that's what im getting, but i want to be able to pull myself out of this way my brain works without meds, because i have had really bad experiences with meds and they scare me more than this does.

and yet sometimes when normal life feels less real than this, i really dont know what to make of it, and i dont know what to do.

it doesn't help that i'm really socially isolated, and yet people trying to encourage me to be more social, while not offering up themselves as a social person to be social with, just makes it feel like their help is really misplaced.   doesnt help that because i was socially isolated before getting a job, i tried to force friendships on people i ultimately didnt even want to be friends with and was probly honestly not a good ""match"" for them because i projected what i thought they were onto them, based on appearances and past friendships.

on a different note, i can't believe this is how my life has gone, i had friendships in high school and college, but those were before i came out as trans, and in retrospect, those friendships weren't that deep because i was always acting and being someone i truly wasn't. but since those memories are real, and since the fucked up person i am today is really detached and dissociated, that person i used to be feels like the realest me i have, even tho back then it felt like i was repressed. so now i feel like im trying to find my old self just to get to my new self and its all traumatic.",1

Looking behind me and expecting to see someone I don't know,"Hi. Recently I've been noticing something odd.

I am petrified that I'm in a constant cycle of being replaced,"I feel like this happens to me too much. I get cast off by friends and my spot gets filled by someone else. I feel like I'm always the least favourite and most forgettable/least valuable. I've gotten really close to someone online over the past five years but have always felt this fear in the back of my head that I'll never be special and will be forgotten about eventually. It kind of happened a few times in minor ways but I would always isolate myself first before I could be isolated, then I would reunite with her when I felt the threat of being replaced was gone. We've visited each other several times in person and spent a week or so at a time at each other's homes. I would consider her my best friend and that my fear of being replaced just gets in the way of me embracing that fully.

I get really scared whenever she mentions meeting other friends. I know this isn't healthy and is just a product of my irrational fear. I'm planning on travelling to meet her in less than two weeks. She's just told me that she doesn't know if we're going to be able to see each other again for the rest of the year, at least not the summer, because she wants to get a job and is planning on having a different long distance friend over, who happens to have the exact same name and hairstyle and glasses and eye colour as me, and she doesn't want to have both of us over at the same time since we don't know each other.. I don't know how to cope with this. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for almost half my life and I've been getting better recently but this has pushed me back several steps. I can't even talk to her about this because I know this is a completely irrational fear but it's too much of a coincidence, it's driving me crazy. I truly can't cope with the idea of being swapped out for some other girl who looks the exact same as I do and has the same name. It's too much.",1

Once somebody drops 1, the other will drop another, then another, then another, and you know the drill. 40+ years of Nuclear Winter All across the globe. Your life would be different forever. I was thinking about this when i was laying down with my cat, and I don‚Äôt want to lose what I have now. I‚Äôm scared is all, scared that humanity is what led to our downfall. People being greedy over land and going to extreme lengths to do so. Extreme lengths that include killing the masses, like a lamb to the slaughter.",1
Pocket Knife.,"Some time ago, I posted about wanting to get myself a gun, for self-defence reasons, then I realized it‚Äôs not a good idea, and that I might hurt someone or myself, but I got myself a pocket knife. I‚Äôm always scared of someone coming up to me and attacking me, or someone breaking into my house. However, sometimes i hear voices telling me to kill myself. And they‚Äôre driving me insane. I always have a feeling someone may betray me, so I don‚Äôt know if carrying the pocket knife with me is a good idea. Technically I feel safer, but might do something to myself if I actually listen to the voices. But the fact I‚Äôm always scared of someone taking my life, shit.",1
what qualifies as paranoia??,"so my entire life i‚Äôve always had anxiety about feeling like i‚Äôm always being watched/stalked, and sometimes those feelings will also be telling me that whoever is ‚Äúwatching me‚Äù is going to try to hurt/kill me, but i‚Äôve never really thought it was a big enough deal to really tell anyone. lately though things have really escalated, those feelings telling me that i‚Äôm being stalked have become much more intense, to the point where i‚Äôm only getting around 3-4 hours of sleep every night because the feelings are too intense to let me sleep. it‚Äôs not only the feeling of thinking i‚Äôm being stalked though, because around a week ago when those feelings started ramping up i started having new feelings too, ones that were telling me that people around me were going to poison my food, and that my family/friends were planning on hurting/murdering me. most of the time when this is happening the feelings will tell me that i have to leave the room or even building i‚Äôm in because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot safe‚Äù or something. these feelings have been making it incredibly hard to function and just do basic every day things, so i just needed to ask, what qualifies as paranoia? does anyone think i have it? i just need some opinions. (i am going to see a professional about this but i won‚Äôt be able to talk to anyone for a few months, so i just wanted to post this in the meantime to see if anyone could give me any opinions.)",1
"The US doesn‚Äôt exist, we have already been invaded by aliens, or something","Basically I have become convinced that everyone already has neurallink or something or there is another form of government that exists that I do not know of and am not allowed to be a part of where the United States no longer exists but for some reason everyone who knows this is refusing to tell me about it. 

They all know every minute detail of my life like they are studying me constantly and everything I say or do in front of one person is instantly reflected in random strangers who comment on it when I see them. I‚Äôll give and example I‚Äôm talking to my therapist telling him personal details of my life and then later in the same day the person at the fast food restaurant is commenting on them and say how much they have people like me or something (but very specific details about me). 

I wish someone would tell me the truth. I wish I could be a part of the future. Why do they refuse to make me part of their future? Why have they all gone on without me? Why am I unacceptable to the world?",1

I get up, grab my phone, turn my light off and start getting undressed for bed. I just sleep in a shirt and boxers. As I was taking my sweatshirt of, I was facing my wall meaning, my windows(which the blinds are always shut) and my door are to my back.

I had to turn around and check. I checked my laptop to make sure the camera was pointing down and away from me, I check my xbox in case there was a hidden thing on it that could be watching me. I almost started having a panic attack by how freaked out I was. The last time I had a thought like this was months ago when I started to feel extremely depressed and anxious all of the time, to the point where leaving my house was becoming a rare occurrence. I‚Äôm freaking out now because I‚Äôm just waiting for it to get bad again. I don‚Äôt know what to do So now i‚Äôm just waiting and laying bed because i‚Äôm so nervous.

I feel like I‚Äôm about to start crying and punching shit but at the same time I can‚Äôt move. 

Im scared as shit right now and I feel like I‚Äôm being watched but I know it‚Äôs stupid but I have this feeling like something sinister  is going to happen. 

All week I‚Äôve had this feeling looming over me that something bad will happen, I brush it off as my anxiety but I feel like something is actually going to happen this time. 

I cant even recognize myself anymore, I look in the mirror and I just stare blankly every time I look I look different, my eyes change or my eyebrows of how my face shape is. 

Randomly when I‚Äôm having a conversation with someone it‚Äôs like my entire body freezes and it‚Äôs like when your in a dream and you realize your in a dream and everything feels unreal, and like everyone is trying to kill you . 

I freeze up and it‚Äôs like my soul fucking leaves my body and I‚Äôm unable to move and it‚Äôs like my body shuts down and I can‚Äôt talk and my eyes start tearing up and I start freaking the fuck out. 

I keep having images of myself pop into my head , but sometimes when it happens it sends me into a panic because I can‚Äôt recognize myself i don‚Äôt know how to explain it, it‚Äôs like someone took over my body and it‚Äôs not me anymore like I‚Äôve been fucking replaced but I‚Äôm still In my body. 

I don‚Äôt know if it makes sense and I don‚Äôt know how to explain it In words it‚Äôs just a feeling I get it‚Äôs like pure terror when it happens and I sit there and it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt breathe for a bit. 

My heart is beating so fast and I feel like I‚Äôm about to cry I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening but I‚Äôm fucking scared , I feel like something in the universe shifted and something is wrong. 

It‚Äôs been like this for a while it‚Äôs like one day somethint changed, I don‚Äôt know what it was but the world changed. 

At my old school I would have this same feeling and I would have to speed walk through the hallways so I wouldn‚Äôt start crying, it‚Äôs like everyone was staring at me. 

It felt like something was trying to get me and if I stopped and looked around I would see it. It stopped for a while and I felt better but it‚Äôs started happening again and it scares the shit out of me.",1

How do I overcome nightly paranoia?,"during the daytime, i am almost never paranoid at all. as soon as it gets dark outside, it‚Äôs about 9 or 10 pm, and i‚Äôm no longer around people is when i begin to get very paranoid, especially when i‚Äôm outside or near a window or open closet (i get very afraid something will sneak into my backyard and hurt me, or i will see a face or person outside my bedroom window or inside my closet). my paranoia typically increases in the night after i‚Äôve watched a true crime or paranormal video earlier in the day, but is still there either way.

during night, im not always sure what im scared of, it changes. sometimes itll be something paranormal, like the fear that some sort of ghost or demon will appear in my room. other times i‚Äôll be nervous a human murderer will break in while i‚Äôm sleeping. or worst of all, it could be a person already in my room, hiding under my bed or in my closet unnoticed, even though i typically check those places before i sleep just to make sure theres no one. 

looking back, i think i‚Äôve always dealt with some paranoia, even though it‚Äôs only gotten worse recently. for example, one time when i was around ten i went several months sleeping on one specific side because for some reason i was scared a tiger would break into my room?? another time when i was older, i stayed up for hours one night because i was convinced that there was someone in my kitchen, and the water near my bed was empty so i was so thirsty i couldn‚Äôt sleep. i don‚Äôt remember much of my childhood, so i cant really think of any other instances of this right now. (sorry if this seems unrelated, just trying to give as much information as i can.)

i‚Äôm not sure what the cause of my paranoia is. i‚Äôm almost certain my poor sleep schedule factors into it (i typically go to sleep at 11pm and wake up at 6:30am), but i‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the root cause, as i still get around 7 hours every night, and even more on weekends. i do get intrusive thoughts, but i don‚Äôt think those are bad enough to call it OCD. i do have a slight history of mental illness, but theyre the things more typical for a teenager, just an eating disorder and self harm and suicidal ideation. my family doesn‚Äôt have much history of mental illness, the biggest thing i can think of is my uncle who is homeless and extremely paranoid, but none of my other family is like that. i don‚Äôt even know if shit like paranoia even IS hereditary.

i have been working to try to go to sleep earlier (10pm so i can get 8 hours of sleep per night), but whats very frustrating is that when i go to sleep earlier than normal, i‚Äôll almost always wake up in the middle of the night (anywhere from 1-5am), and this time period is when my paranoia is at its absolute worst. i can‚Äôt fall back asleep unless i listen to music, which is annoying because just the simple act of opening my eyes, sitting up, and pulling out my phone is terrifying and i‚Äôll have to gear myself up for it for minutes before. after waking up in the middle of the night, i‚Äôll be so overcome with fear that i won‚Äôt be able to open my eyes for fear that when i open them, a person will be right above my face, or i wont be able to close them for the same reason. even blinking is scary. i don‚Äôt experience any physical effects of my paranoia except for a fast heartbeat, so i don‚Äôt get sick from it or anything, though sickness does make it much worse because of how high my fevers get. the most annoying thing is how when i manage to fall back asleep, when i wake up i don‚Äôt even remember almost anything from the night before. all i remember id that i woke up early and that i was scared of nothing again. 

although being in the dark makes it worse, i can even get paranoid in a bright room, especially if theres a mirror in the room (since mirrors make me nervous about the idea of eyes appearing behind me in the mirror), or i‚Äôll be scared of the shadows in my room, or my backyard will be lit from lights but if i hear a sound then i just have to go back inside, because of all the ‚Äòpotential dangers‚Äô that could jump out at me from outside. the worst part is that i‚Äôm certain being on my phone so often only makes this worse, but sometimes my phone is the only thing that can distract me from my paranoia. i‚Äôm eighteen years old and had to check under my bed last night like an eight year old because of this. no amount of reassuring myself that everything is fine helps. i know there‚Äôs no danger but it doesn‚Äôt stop the fear. it‚Äôs only gotten worse recently, especially in the past five or so months. i can‚Äôt uncover my hand or leg from my blankets when i‚Äôm trying to fall asleep, i can‚Äôt go outside past 11pm without my phone, i can‚Äôt fall asleep without music unless i‚Äôm too tired to be scared. nothing seems to help. i don‚Äôt know what to do about this anymore. it‚Äôs not quite debilitating, at least during the daytime, but i‚Äôm nervous it will be at some point. help??",1
The stress was really getting to me in rehab.,"Every now and then I get random bouts of unfounded existential crises. Especially if I'm not talking my antidepressants. The rehab I was at didn't allow medication and I just wanted to go back to my family the whole time. My heart was racing 24/7.

Every night I looked out my window and would see a bright star, I guess it was a planet since it was so bright. I kept staring at it and it looked like it was flashing and moving a tiny bit. I kept thinking it was aliens or the rapture. I had to ask a fellow patient to look at it and reassure me that it was just a star.

Thankfully I walked out a week later and got back on my meds. Now I can comfortably admire their beauty in the Texas sky.",1
Are there websites that publicly put out your IP for everyone to see?,"Is there any website that does that?

"generic paranoia, everyone can read my mind.",I‚Äôve made an issue for myself by watching videos centered around ‚Äúglitches in the matrix‚Äù and several consisted of basically mind-reading. I was like ‚Äúcoincidence‚Äù and sure I‚Äôm still like that but literally only ever since that happened I‚Äôve been super paranoid and thinking everyone is reading my mind or that I‚Äôm reading other people‚Äôs minds. I can‚Äôt think about anything personal when around anyone because I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhat if my thoughts are being projected into theirs and they know it‚Äôs from mine????‚Äù And I don‚Äôt know how to get over it or how to ground myself.,1
concern about accidentally misrepresenting paranoia in my campaign film,"I am a first year university student looking to make a campaign ad/film concerning paranoia and the importance of reaching out to someone when in need of support.

The story follows a woman as she tries to find the source of a constant banging noise in her house and a figure that follows her around by appearing in places around her. The idea is to use the figure as a way to represent her stress personified and the banging noise is meant to be an auditory hallucination.

In the end she calls up a friend and all the rising stress comes to a stop as she briefly vocalises her emotions to her.

I am afraid of coming off as tone deaf and insensitive/misrepresenting the struggles people with Paranoia face. I apologize beforehand if the idea is crass or inaccurate, it is not from a place of malice, but rather from a lack of understanding.

Any pointers, criticism, and advice would be much appreciated.",1
i think my boyfriend's friends are trying to make him break up with me,"i just told this to my boyfriend and he said i was delusional. 

none of his friends like me. they all did something bad to me at least once, in the span of 5 years. (i am talking about emotional and sexual abuse from one of them). i literally get death stares from them and they are trying to break him up with me so they can get rid of me. i also have to mention that his friends are nice with him. they've stopped any bad behaviour towards any other person, and it's only me they hate.

they only want to see me suffer, and they'll start by torturing me slowly. the only way they can do that? brainwash my boyfriend into thinking i'm going crazy so he'll break up with me.

does this even sound like paranoia? i cannot help but think this is actually true. i'm not even kidding. it sounds like a vicious circle and even the fact that i suspect myself for having paranoia feels like a part of their plan.",1

I think I'm gonna get jumped tomorrow...I'm scared,"Basically, I'm a freshman and in my period 1 class there is this guy and I think, no he DOES HATE ME, it was because I was overly nice or something and now he wants nothing more than to fuck me up, He sits behind me on a different desk and I overheard he and his friends talking about how they wanna ""Smack someone on the back of their head"" and many more rude things but they never specified a name, Later than some people started to ask for my name while laughing, what's funny?, of course, I'm kind of used to it but I know this is ridiculous but I feel like they're trying to see who I am for a fight or something idk, the point is I'm scared, I've also had a really bad paranoia that someone is gonna bring a gun and shoot me or something like that, of course, there is barely any evidence towards this but I keep having this bad paranoia, it's eating away at me",1

Need advice,"Through these few months, I have pondered the condition of illness, persistently emphasizing the fact that there could be any kind developing inside me any moment. Whether by will or by choice, these thoughts would be followed by minor pains throughout my body.

The pains have gotten worse and now I'm thoroughly convinced I'm going to die (though, I'm aware I probably won't).

Paranoia about war?,"This started happening around 10 months ago. I think it started off as extreme anxiety about the possibility of nuclear war but it's kinda spiraled out of control.

At first, I was anxious about the possibility of nuclear war. I wanted to move out of the city I'm in to the countryside. I remember crying to my mum about wanting to move away because I was that terrified. I would go to sleep thinking everyday was going to be my last.

That fear got worse. I started to become scared of any planes, helicopters, etc. Multiple times a day I would start screaming because I thought one of them was a nuke and I was about to die. I would constantly be watching the sky to see if I could see any nukes. I live near a hospital where theres a lot of helicopters coming and going, it freaks me out.

I started hallucinating too. I would see everything getting really bright which would freak me out. Or everything around me would start to distort. One time, when everything was getting bright, I genuinely hallucinated my name being called. It was freaky.

Anyway, it did start to get better. Ive been avoiding the news about it and I try to avoid conversations about it. I'm still scared of helicopters, planes and loud sounds outside. 

I'm not sure if it's starting to get worse again. I recently moved in with my boyfriend and the bedroom faces a main road. There are cars constantly going past. The particularly loud ones really freak me out. I jump everytime. This morning, I got woken up by a loud car and it really scared me. My heart rate was 130bpm when it woke me up. Of course when I came onto reddit I see shit about Putin pulling out of the nuclear treaty and my boyfriend commented that ww3 is coming soon. I haven't told him about this stuff yet, it's honestly embarrassing.

I'm not even fully sure if this is paranoia? Maybe before I was paranoid but now I'm just terrified by outside noises (cars too apparently). 

I just want it to stop. I miss not freaking out over these things. I never used to pay such sounds any attention.",1

So, I'm 19 [F] and the day before yesterday I saw someone on the train taking pictures of me (at least that's what it looked like -i wasn't wearing something weird or have dyed hair or piercings or anything like that) and now I'm extremely paranoid that people are watching and following me waiting for the right moment to kidnap me. Im already scared that people are stalking my house and will try to break in and now I'm even more afraid something bad will happen to me.


 The thing is, everytime I try to calm myself down I think that I am just being extremely observant or that the universe is sending me messages so that I can be ready when the right time comes. Basically it tries to protect me by making me paranoid and scared all the time. I know this probably sounds kind of crazy but I can't stop thinking that way.

Need advice about MIL.,"Hello all,

I‚Äôm not a part of this sub, but I‚Äôm here because I don‚Äôt know what other sub I can talk to about this issue. My mother in law is an amazing woman, I love her, she‚Äôs always gone above and beyond for her son, me and our 3 kids. The past couple of years she‚Äôs been talking about people watching her from electronic devices. She refuses to share Wi-Fi passwords with people, even us and when we bought her a smart tv, she put it in storage because she swore someone was watching her. She has two phones, an iPhone and a flip phone. She mainly uses the flip phone with a bandaid covering the camera. She leaves her iPhone in the garage most of the time. We figured that it‚Äôs probably just her not knowing how electronics work, but today she said something that truly worried me. 

She said that she went out to eat at a restaurant the other day and she usually leaves her purse with her iPhone at the table with her husband while she goes to the bathroom. This time she forgot and took her purse with her. When she noticed she took her purse, she decided to leave it in another stall while she went to another to use the toilet. I told her if she has her phone in her purse no one can see her, she said that they can see through her purse! 

We (my husband, i and her husband) have tried talking to her and explaining that no one is watching her, but she insists that God told her they are. I‚Äôm scared of leaving my children with her now. What if she starts to think they are sick and gives them medicine that they shouldn‚Äôt have? Which is something she did once. 

She‚Äôs never gone to the doctor for this, she refuses to, but my husband thinks the medications she takes daily are causing her to be schizophrenic. What can I do to help her? I don‚Äôt want to have to keep her from being alone with my kids, they love her so much.",1

I need to know if it is real or imagined.,"I have a persistent belief that my neighbors are spying on me with hidden cameras in my living room and maybe other places in the house. Rationally I have tried to believe that they had some sort of device in their house that can make out images of the inside of my house. I read that this belief is extremely common with people that suffer from Schizophrenia. However, the other day something that I believe happened to me concerning my neighbors has left me as confused as ever. 

For many years when I masturbate, I do it as if I am a woman. This means that I act as if I am a woman. I do not cross-dress but I do act as if I am Demi Moore from Striptease, Elizabeth Berkeley from Showgirls. When I see an attractive woman on television like Faith Hill during her NBC NFL opening, I like to act as if I am a woman, that I have the body of a woman and that usually allows me to ejaculate. This started probably when I was a teenager when I was admiring my butt in the mirror. I even use to joke to the few friends that I had growing up that I was a lesbian trapped in a man‚Äôs body. 

The problem that I have with my neighbors is that when I do the things, they appear to have a way of arriving and leaving from their house in strange 10 minute, 20 minute, Hour rituals. So let us say I ejaculate at 5:13pm. Say someone is at home at his or her house. At 5:23pm, a neighbor 10 minutes later will arrive or a neighbor already inside the house will leave 10 minutes later! Overtime this same thing has occurred 20 minutes later, A full hour later, 5 minutes later (this also appears to happen a lot when someone is about to arrive at our house they will show up five minutes before they arrived). 

Strangely, when this happens lately I have noticed what appears to be police sirens going off in the same matter. Therefore, it has caused me not to masturbate even when I should. I believe that it is not all legit and that these same neighbors along with other people routinely seen in my neighborhood could very well be involved. 

I need to know if this is all real or imagined and why I‚Äôm feeling this way.",1
Is this a cause for concern?,"I have recently noticed that my behavior and thought patterns deviate from others' considerably, in that mine are much more paranoid and guarded. I don't believe *everyone* is out to get me and I am capable of some degree of trust (only fully trust one person), but I am constantly evaluating everything I say and do in fear someone will use it against me. And this does not just apply to saying something that can be taken badly, no, but also to, for example, revealing seemingly innocent information about myself that others seem to have no issue divulging. Ironically, my paranoia prevents me from going into detail here, but a good example is how I am paranoid to let people know my birthday, and when asked, I will only begrudgingly and hesitantly answer.

I see other people have no such issues with talking about such minor things about themselves, but I am constantly guarded for the not nonexistent possibility of malicious people somehow somewhere finding information that can be used to harm me. I am also incredibly paranoid when leaving my residence, often distrusting strangers on the streets and even going as far as to imagine in detail how a specific stranger who happened to glance at me plans to harm me and how I should react in that situation, constructing a very specific scenario in my head over such inconsequential occurrences. Is this a cause for concern? Is this a sign of a form of clinical paranoia? Is this something I should consult a doctor or a professional regarding, or is it mild/normal? I find the constant stress of reevaluating every tiny thing out of fear very exhausting, but I'm not sure if this is a mental issue I may be facing.

advice?,hi i couldn't find rules for this subreddit so forgive me if this is out of line. basically i've had OCD my whole life and my paranoia comes and goes but i'm living on my own for the first time and i'm basically constantly in total terror. like i'm spending every moment i'm in my apartment just paranoid out of my mind that someone is in here and is gonna fucking. get me i guess. like i can't shower i can't move around the apartment once it gets dark i can't make any loud noises i don't know what to do. i have an alarm for my front door and it's also a double key system to get into the complex. but does anyone have any advice for reducing paranoia to any extent????? i am in therapy btw.,1
feel like im being watched by the goverment,"I've been having a psychotic episode for a while and worse and worse shit keeps happening and I feel super hyper-aware of every camera and mirror in my home. I feel hunted and it's driving me insane. I've felt like this since before middleschool and I feel like I can't talk to a psychologist about this because they'll try and put me on meds when I know I don't need any more. I've never told anyone close to me about this other than my boyfriend. My mother also feels the same way and I've gotten most of my worries from her and things that I do ie covering cameras, not drinking out of the tap, not having my phone near me, being overly carful about everything. I don't know how to stop worrying it hurts",1
Creepy smile,"So this happened just this morning. I was walking to work and I usually walk through a park to get there and there was this guy on the swings probably a couple of years older than me staring at me on the swings. 

His smile was way too wide to be genuine, it was like a big smile with teeth showing and he just watched me walk past him with no other interaction. I was painfully aware that unlike other days the park seemed deserted and so I just pretended I hadn‚Äôt seen him staring and just went on my way.  

I checked a couple of times after I had turned a corner in the park if he was following me and he didn‚Äôt seem to be but it was seriously creepy.  

While I was walking to work I noticed someone else watching me for a long time after I walked from the park and thankfully they not smiling creepily but I think that might be me just being paranoid. 

Even now I keep on looking at everyone around me. 

What experience has everyone else had that‚Äôs nothings happened but kick started their paranoia.",1
Do you get fearful for no reason?,,1
Trouble sleeping - too afraid of ghosts,"I've had very strong paranoia ever since I can remember. I used to be unable to sleep without my mum in the same bed because I was too afraid of ghosts. Sometimes I couldn't sleep even with her lying next to me.
I also sometimes get extremely paranoid when I wash my face that when I look up there will be someone behind me. This happened to me earlier this evening actually. 
Anything related to ghosts can make this paranoia worse. 
It's gotten slightly better as I've gotten older, but sometimes I still get the same fear and can't close my eyes at all, despite how tired or sleepy I might be. 
Location plays a big role in this, for example, in my home I generally don't have problems with this anymore, but I still am extremely paranoid when I'm staying at my mum's childhood home.
The frustrating thing is that I get these very vivid images in my brain of ghosts in doorways or in the reflection of the mirror, despite the fact that I generally can't picture things very well in my head.",1
i feel crazy? anyone else deal w this?,"i should start by saying i have borderline and bipolar disorder i guess-- but anyways, i literally cant shake the feeling a character from my favorite anime is watching me. this has happened before, i truly  thought that richard ramirez was stalking me and looking at me in the dark everywhere even though hes dead i was SURE he was there. but now i really feel like this character is watching. he can see everything i do, and i can feel him even reading my thoughts. it scares me even if its irrational HES WATCHING and i dont know how to get this feeling to go away. i just want to feel like im alone!!!",1
am i insane?,"i've been suffering with this for a while. i feel so guilty. i've noticed that a lot of my thoughts and a lot of the things i do are probably not normal. i've always been scared of the dark since i was a young kid and i thought i'd gotten better but i don't think i have. i don't feel safe in my own home ever. i always have this crippling feeling that someone is watching me, hiding behind or under objects, waiting to brutally murder me. for example, one of the things i always do is check behind the bathroom door before i walk in (when the lights are off) and after i walk in and turn the lights on, i'll immediately turn around and check the entire room. i always feel like someone is hiding behind the door, standing in my shower, or someone is outside my bathroom door waiting to kill me. this has been happening for as long as i can remember and i just recently realized that it probably isn't a normal thing that people do. i have terrifying thoughts of even my loved ones killing me, or me killing them. these also occur in my dreams pretty frequently. i'll be doing normal things throughout the day like eating dinner, and suddenly my brain pictures a scene where my dead body is on the ground and my parents walk in and they get murdered along with my death. i don't know what to do and im hesitant on how i should deal with these feelings. i'm a young person and i feel like i shouldnt have these feelings/thoughts.",1
I accidentally upset a customer at work and now I‚Äôm paranoid over it.,"I work a retail job as a parking lot attendant. I had gotten my work done, so I stood by one of the entrances. A customer was in the road calling over to me. I didn‚Äôt understand him so I asked what he said, he held up his cigarette and I thought he said ‚Äúis this alright‚Äù as in ‚Äúis it okay if I smoke out here‚Äù to which I said yes. He started walking towards me and I realized he actually said ‚Äúyou got a light‚Äù asking if I had a lighter. I asked him if that was what he said, and he said yes. I apologized and told him I misunderstood him and I didn‚Äôt have a lighter. He said ‚Äúyou trying to play me out?‚Äù I asked what he meant and he said ‚Äúyou said you had a lighter and you don‚Äôt‚Äù. I told him it was a misunderstanding, but since I‚Äôve never had a confrontation like this at work, ‚Äúi thought you said is this alright‚Äù came out as ‚ÄúI thought you asked if I was alright‚Äù which makes no sense. 

He walked away and I stood there for a few more minutes. I didn‚Äôt feel safe anymore so I went into the building and walked around a little bit. I went back to working thinking he was just passing by, but he was still outside the store. I passed him again and apologized to him again and walked away. 

I walked back into the store and passed by the entrance I was standing by and saw that he was standing there on the phone. I don‚Äôt know what he was saying, but I thought he was talking about me and I thought I heard the word ‚Äúshoot.‚Äù I walked around a little more and he wasn‚Äôt at the doors anymore. I lingered for a minute and watched him walk into the store like he was waiting for me. 

This whole thing just made me unreasonably paranoid. I‚Äôm not sure why.",1

"Is anyone else paranoid, that the messages on some apps are just going to be there forever?","Like some conversations I've had, when I was a dumb teenager. I am so mad, that the delete option appeared so late on FB messenger. But even then, I deleted some of them for my own good, years ago. But to think, they might still be there...",1
"Random abuse by strangers in california, often teens or children.","I have been the victim of several instances of children / teenage boys seeing me and accusing me of racism. The first instance I was out at about 8 or 9 pm, sitting in a chair outside eating a burrito. A group of boys came out of a shop nearby and immediately one of them yelled ‚Äúwhat is he doing out? Doesn‚Äôt he know it‚Äôs too late for him to be out?‚Äù He then took out his phone and started yelling for his other friends to come over while saying ‚Äúthis guy attacked me!‚Äù They came out and asked what I did (I was about 20 feet away and never saw the boy or said anything to him before in my life). He responds ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, haha, just who he is I guess! They‚Äôre kind isn‚Äôt supposed to be outside this late!‚Äù 

I was sitting looking at my burrito and glancing back at the boy as he yelled. I didn‚Äôt say anything or move. Eventually they left me alone but the incident startled me.

Last week at Whole Foods, I was looking at pizza. Out of the corner of my eye I looked over and a five year old girl was holding up her hand like an imaginary gun shooting at me. 

Today I was at the park walking my dog. I was going to throw a bag of dog poop away and two boys were on the bench nearby. One of them had a skateboard and he loudly popped it against the ground. Startled and beaten down from months of threats and intimidation, I looked down at the ground. Then I heard him say ‚Äúyeah!‚Äù He was staring right at me with hatred in his eyes. I felt like he was purposely threatening me. Trying not to give in to fear, I looked back up at him and threw the dog poop away. Then I walked off with my pup. My dog walks slow and makes lots of potty breaks so as he did one I turned around to see the boy with the skateboard taking pictures of me. He then started to complain to his friend how ‚Äúthey will say he‚Äôs just walking his dog.‚Äù And how ‚Äúhard it is to get this guy‚Äù. 

I am very afraid that the younger generation is learning to weaponize their phone against anyone they don‚Äôt like. All they have to do is threaten or insult the person, then whip out their phone and film the anger. It‚Äôs so easy to make anyone look like the bad guy, and you have no proof that they insulted you or threatened you for no reason. 

Why don‚Äôt I take out my own phone? Is it fear that holds me back from filming them in response? Stupidity? My PTSD silences me. In the moment I cannot speak, which is probably why I am still alive and free. But I am afraid they will come for me soon. 

I‚Äôm making this statement now, trying to raise awareness. If anyone is out there, be careful around children who may be entrapping you by inciting anger or rage in you. They want you mad, they want to film it happening, and they want to pretend that they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong so that you take all the blame. 

At this point, I feel that I am a victim of serious abuse. I am suffering regular mental breakdowns and fear for my life. I just want to be left alone. I just want peace and quiet. I don‚Äôt know what caused all this rage and anger, and I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm the target of it, but at this point it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter.",1

should I visit a doctor?,"Hi from Germany! 
I have negative thoughts all day long. 
When I have a very (paranoid) episode, I am completely convinced that someone has all information about me and is spreading it. In 2014 I lost my smartphone and when I got it back all the pictures were gone. At that time I was already struggling with negative thoughts about other things and was very suspicious of my surroundings.
Strangely enough, in 2014 I didn't have any obsessive thoughts after my smartphone disappeared. In the meantime, however, I think about it all day long. I think in all situations that people have private information about me. When people around me laugh, I think that they are talking about me.
But not only that, I also have other (paranoid) thoughts that keep coming from time to time. In the meantime I also suspect that former friends want to harm me.
When I am in a bad phase, I also look for evidence and spend a lot of time with it. So for all my negative thoughts I find evidence if I search.
At the beginning I thought that only my pictures were stolen. Meanwhile I think that they have synchronized my Google account or installed a spy app. 

Finally, I can say that since 2014 it has never happened that a picture or something similar was ""published"" about me.
The only thing I feel is that since 2016, I have been treated extremely unfairly in my work. For this I also have concrete facts. I do not have a plausible reason for this. Therefore, I can only speculate.
Physically, the compulsive brooding costs me a lot of strength.
Especially when I have an (paranoid) episode, then I can not sleep, have to throw up and feel extreme restlessness. I have realized that I have to change something.

Even if my fears are true, how can I stop the negative obsessive thoughts?
And how do I know what are paranoid delusions and what are legitimate fears and worries?",1
Fear of being poisoned is killing me,"Sorry for the long story!

I broke up with my long-term girlfriend around a year ago. Tried to split amicably; we lived together so I had to stay there for almost a month before I could move to a new place (it took a while because I had moved halfway across the country to be with her, and was now moving back of course). She got a bit mean that month at times, but otherwise we were both coping well with the split and managed to live next to each other until I moved out (at least, that's what I thought).

Her parents, however, are a totally different story. Ironically, the had always supported my side in the argument that led to our breakup, but strongly freaked out at me when I decided it was finally too much and broke up with their daughter. Unlike her daughter, they coped very badly and were seemingly much more depressed and angry than either me or my ex.

Then weird things happened in the month I was there. First they suddenly were seemingly friendly to me again (maybe they hoped for reconciliation?) and even invited me for dinner at their house for one last time. After said (unremarkable) dinner they turned semi-hostile again. I later found out that when I was out the whole day to sign the contract for my new apartment (as I said, quite far away), they tried to break in (they had a spare key because they owned the apartment and we were renting it) knowing I was not there. When I later confronted them, they said they only wanted to do so to make a video recording of the whole place and avoid discussions about possible damage due to me moving out later on. They didn't actually manage to do it because I was coming home earlier than expected, and instead had their daughter film everything and send it to them. I actually would have agreed to them just coming over to do so (I understand that they want to protect their property and would take accountability if necessary), but doing all of this behind my back left me feeling deceited. I kept my calm to avoid further conflict, but started growing suspicious obviously.

I should add that these are extremely over-protective people. They‚Äôd literally make the university homework of their daughter while she was out having fun. They'd write mails for her in her name. They‚Äôd text her all the time and would panic if she didn‚Äôt reply within an hour (she‚Äôs almost 30 btw). Stuff like that (I know, should have run away immediately at those red flags).

Then, I got mislead again. In that month we still did grocery shopping together, and my ex told me she wanted to go to the shop close to where her parents live to buy some fish (because it's cheaper there). Said shop was closed when we arrived (no way her parents didn‚Äôt know). But since we were there, she briefly wanted to go to her parents for some other reason I don‚Äôt even remember. When we got there, her parents handed me a contract that they asked me to sign. It stated arrangements for me leaving the apartment (ok, I get that), but also stipulated that it was my decision to break up, that I should be responsible for cancelling mutual accounts, that I‚Äôll be accountable for any damage bla bla. Anyway, I adjusted/scratched some of those ridiculous agreements in there and signed to avoid apartment-related disagreements later on. I mean, I get that something had to be put on paper about the apartment, but her parents making this ‚Äúbreakup form‚Äù for her and all of the other stuff in there was just ridiculous. Oh, I later also found that even after me signing that contract (and leaving a pretty obvious agreement about cancelling/dividing all mutual possessions in there), they called the bank where my ex and I had a mutual account to make sure I wasn't hiding (stealing?) anything...

At that point, my suspicion turned into fear, and I did something I should normally not do to avoid any further surprises being plotted behind my back. My ex has an Apple Watch, we she often leaves at home when she is out working. Knowing that she frequently texts her mother, I started reading those texts on her watch when she was out (only those, didn't want to know what else she was writing to friends etc.). In those texts I learned how they had indeed been scheming together to sneak in when we would both be out and so on. I also learned that despite them acting friendly / concerned about me again, they were secretly cheering in those texts whenever I had some bad fortune coming my way (e.g., when I was having trouble getting the utility companies registered at my new address, when my 76-year old grandmother caught COVID, ...). They'd literally put a heart emoji on those messages, but then the next day her mother would call me to offer her help packing my boxes because ""it's not good for my back"" (I do indeed have back issues from time to time); felt super creepy because I obviously knew by then that all of that expressed concern and friendliness was fake. Of course I had to pretend everything was fine (couldn't let her know I was reading those texts with her mother), but inside I felt sick; especially considering that just a few months ago I went to her mother's place every day for an entire month and worked from there  (I was working from home during COVID) to take care of her because she had broken her shoulder and needed assistance. There are a few other things they lied about (and did) that month, mostly minor/childish things that I just tried to ignore.

Anyway, her mother being a total snake, and my ex at the very least playing along with it, did make it much easier for me to realise breaking up was absolutely the right decision. I was so looking forward to the day I was moving out to finally have these kind of people out of my life for good. Her father, however, is a different story. He got very angry and shouted at me the day we broke up, then pretty much remained completely quiet throughout the entire month. To be honest, I was so focused on the scheming mother that I didn't pay much attention to him. To sketch a picture of the man: he's a rich and highly intelligent doctor, but at the same time also a very isolated, introvert (and honestly, frustrated) person. He has no friends that I know of (as in, during the 4 year relationship with my ex he never met with any friends that I know of) and is very unhappy in his marriage (without going into further detail, there is at the very least frequent verbal abuse between him and his wife; they never divorced ""because of the kids"", my ex even told me herself). His wife also blurted out one time that he was dealing with some sexual frustrations (really didn't need to know that). He suffers from intense paranoia too; he would for instance sometimes leave his cellphone at home when going for a walk (especially during COVID restrictions), because otherwise government authorities could triangulate his cellphone signal and track his position. Perhaps this paranoia was also the reason for the contract, recording my apartment, calling my bank, changing the locks of the apartment the same day I moved out (yes, they did that, despite them being the ones previously plotting to abuse their key to my apartment...). I don't know. I know that, a few months before our breakup, he for instance got a pretty serious letter from the police following a complaint from one of his patients. Really don't know what to think of that now. Other than that, I actually liked him because he was always nice to me (before the breakup), had many interests (art/travelling/cooking/...) and could have a deep conversation with you instead of just chit-chat (once you did get him talking). Again, a very smart person I actually looked up to in some ways. On the other hand, I found it hard to gauge his character for all of the above reasons.

Getting to the point: a few weeks after I had moved out, I started having some weird medical issues. It started with some mild aching pain around my testicles, and without going into too much detail (sorry if TMI already), I suddenly also developed sexual dysfunctions I didn't have before. Now, there is also pain in my foot, making even simple walks uncomfortable. Doctors have no clue what's going on (after multiple MRI/CT screenings of my back and pelvis, blood work and so on). Seems to be some weird inexplicable nerve issues, despite me testing negative for all common causes (diabetes etc.) for such issues. Things are also gradually getting worse, and over the last few months the fact that it's not going away is starting to affect me mentally as well (which of course makes doctors think now that ""it's all in my head""). I started panicking, and researching myself what could be wrong. Similar to the doctors I had consulted with, I couldn't find an answer.

Then, an idea started bothering me: I had just gotten out of the strangest, most suspicious month of my life (with people scheming behind my back, and me probably knowing only half of it through the texts I had read), followed just a few weeks later by the most suspicious medical issues I've ever encountered. What if that's not a coincidence? These people clearly had bad intentions set out for me; what if they went as far as to poison me? They have the means to do so (him being a doctor and having full access to any prescription medication/chemical), the motivation (knowing what they had already done ...), potentially the history (the suspicious police letter a few months earlier), their totally weird/suspicious behaviour, and honestly they also have the social isolation and mental instability necessary to be capable of doing such things. Continuing my research, there are indeed drugs/chemicals causing symptoms such as mine that are extremely long acting (sometimes persistent for years) and can be administered both orally (and I had dinner there after our breakup) or topically (they had access to my apartment, and could have put it into any of my bathroom products). I have since thrown out everything (shampoos, douche gels, toothpaste, hair products, perfumes, olive oil, ...) I had taken with me when I moved out there.

Initially. this idea seemed way too unlikely to me; but honestly, as months have gone by without any other explanation, and as I really can't judge these people properly (and I can't just ask them; I know they are excellent liars and I have been fooled by them before!), I am starting to consider it more and more as a possibility, and lately even reality. It's making me so scared that I even contacted a toxicologist for an extensive blood screening (which costed me quite a bit), but they couldn't really help me out (as it may no longer be detectable in my blood). For the last two months I have been having constant nightmares about these people (not my ex even, just her parents!) and what they might have done to me. I wake up in panic, sweating, heart racing and not knowing what to do. It seems impossible to ever know what really happened, and I just fail to rationalise that this could not have happened.  I'm started to have panic attacks throughout the day. I'm truly \*constantly\* thinking about this, making me basically unable to enjoy anything anymore. I fear that I'll never get a full answer, while at the same time living like this in a constant state of anxiety is unbearable and driving me to some dark thoughts ... and it's not getting any better as time goes by, that's clear. Never had any mental issues before. I'm hesitant to seek psychological help, because that would only help calm me down about my fears, until they get me to believe this didn't happen, hence fooling me twice in the case it really did happen (a possibility that can't be excluded)!

Is this the way to go?,"Hi there,

I have been living with paranoia for all of my life.

Even before entering nursery school I can remember not being able to sleep because when I closed my eyes I felt like I was being watched.

A key memory of mine was in primary school where I sometimes ran to school as fast as I could because I was able to see shadow creatures far behind me when I moved my head quick enough. Even though it was exhausting it was better than the fear of being followed.

Over time it got worse enough that in secondary school I didn't go to school for a week because I the creatures were getting closer. Almost breaking of the intense fear the creatures just stopped appearing and I went on as if nothing happened.

Through secondary school I started to have moments where the creatures appeared again and over time the frequency started to increase. I was in school acting like usual and suddenly freezing, internally screaming and barely able to breath while a creature stands besides me, barely visible and terrorizing me with its gaze.

I thought often about telling someone about my issues with imaginary monsters but I didn't trust a single person and was scared to appear like a clown so I just lied when someone noticed it. I also considered suicide multiple times and I'm glad I never went through with it.

At some point when I was 20, covid had started, this state was permanent again and made me quit work, I hid in my room below my blanked. I only survived thanks to my roommate paying rent and giving me bread and water. (True MVP here)

I am only able to rely on my roomates telling as most of memories of that time are very blurry and dominated by extreme fear but I remember that I somehow started to actively suppress it. As suppressing it was very demanding I used weed to calm my mind while searching for other solutions and then I had a weird idea while being high.

By recognizing their existence (looking at them) which makes them look real (they usually were shadow/fog like) I got used to it and realized a few days ago that no matter how close they are, they just exist and can't be a danger to me.

&#x200B;

Currently I'm sitting in my room while a bunch of humanoid creatures are watching me which gives me a weird feeling of assurance and well-being, occasionally I look at them in awe for what my mind is able to create. I may struggle a bit with trusting others but that's something I just have to work on.

Is that a good way to accept my paranoia or do I sound insane? I honestly don't know but I'm generally more happy than ever.

Thank you very much for reading and it's very relieving to have written down what has been on my mind for a very long time.",1

i have waves of what i think it's paranoia,"Sometimes when i'm with friends and i smoke like 5 puffs of cannabis i get into a state of me thinking people are judging me and gossip me behind my back, i get hostile to them for like a week, i change attitude in general.

I am under medication, i take zoloft and wellbutrin for depression and social anxiety, since i abused alcohol last summer i went into a mild hypomania wich made me do things i would never do, and when i switch mood to depression i get paranoid that people know i'm sick and ill, since i starte using cannabis again i question reality, i have chronic depersonalization and sometimes derealization, i'm scared of becoming schizophrenic.",1
is it paranoia ?,"So basically i was wondering if i was wrong or no. i'm doing this so one day i'll understand myself to feel better.

I have let's stay... neglectful parents on the emotionnal plan. So because of that i cannot really trust people. While i was on reddit i realised that i was doing some things that may seems like i'm being paranoiac with my peers. I'm doing this to understang my behaviour , so i thank you in advance for your help. you guys will literraly save my future life.

\- I have trust issues. My friends don't really know me and when I feel like i'm opening myself too much I isolate myself from them.

\- I tell my secret life to strangers on the web because they don't know me so they can't use my secrets against me.

\- i'm hypervigilant and i analyze everything. Foot steps, physical language , the way a person is breathing, eye contact, voice tone...

\- I isolate myself from people. i deactivate my socials when i feel like i've said too much.

\- sometimes i may feel like i'm going to die very soon. this feeling is strong. then i realise that i'm not dead...

\- my mom tell me to not see my friends too much, that they can steal my energy from me. she often tells me that i need to be careful to what i say, i should never talk about my goals.

\- i have intrusive thoughts, sometimes they are so strong that i need to tell myself ""shut up"" with aloud. 

i don't drink , i don't smoke, i'm working hard to have a healthy life. i'm still young  \[19F\] so i think i'm able to grow and to give myself a second chance, that's why i'm doing that. thank you.",1
do others here experience this?,"I want to know if anyone else here experiences this. When I'm having paranoia it's like there's two halves of my brain. One is being logical and says that it's just paranoia and I'm fine. But the other says no this is 100% real. I'd think I'd actually prefer just having the fully believing side, because right now it's like I'm going crazy and I know it.",1
I think I gave myself a paranoia disorder?,"Just like the title says, I think I accidentally gave myself some sort of paranoia. I have been a fan of analog horror (bear with me), and none of it has ever really effected me outside of a simple spooky fear rush, but for some reason a new one I watched has made me so paranoid being in my own home. I've had to sleep with the lights on, I'm terrified every time I open a closet or pass by a cabinet. I KNOW what I'm afraid of isn't real, it was made up by someone online, but something in the back of my mind is making me scared that I am going to be attacked. I already have anxiety, and this definitely doesn't help. I can't stop thinking that someone or someTHING is in my house, in every crevice and corner, ready to kill me when I turn my back. And, like I said, I know it's not real, that nothing is there and nothing is going to harm me, but the persistent worry and anxiety is there throughout the days.",1
IS THIS PARANOIA?,"At the age of fourteen, I'm scared that someone will break into my house. There has only been my stepdad, mom, and I ever since my sister departed to attend college. This, I believe, has a significant impact on how I'm feeling because my fear began occurring immediately after. Similar to when I hear a commotion outside, I am terrified at the slightest noise and lock myself in my room. Although I understand that it's extremely rare that somebody will break into my house, it's nonetheless possible.",1
scammed and scared.,"hi. I'm 18f. 
I am kind of scared right now.
I opened my Instagram dm requests for the first time in weeks and saw a sugar daddy saying he wanted to get to know me. usually I only message these guys back to mess with them then block them and move on. but this person sent me pictures of a check so I could do the mobile banking feature on the CAPCOM app on my phone.
I did it thinking it would just be bullshit but it wasn't. $1,050 into my account.

so I was obviously very shocked and a bit confused. he tells me to buy bitcoin with it and send it to another account and was starting to get aggressive. 
I know this was stupid so please don't berate me too much in replies but I gave him my phone number and email. like an idiot. I know.
anyway, I blocked him because my friends told me to do so and he emailed me saying he had my information and I needed to return his money so I tried but my account would only let me transfer $200 and then wouldn't let me do any more. 
I tried to explain this to him multiple times but he continued to be aggressive so I blocked him again. then he texted me the following message: 
""Hey. [my first name] [my last name], I'm U.S Marshall G.H Dozier from the Department of Homeland Securities. A report just got to us from a certain Smith Christopher that  you attempted to Steal from her of her work funds. It is advised that you get in contact with her and sort out the discrepancy before the law takes matters into its hands. We will have approached your bank and acquired all the necessary information needed to find you and confiscate you. Make America a better place. And get back to me ASAP.""

so obviously I knew it was complete bull because
1. a US. marshal would not text you
2. he spelled my first name wrong
and just a whole bunch of grammar issues I don't even want to point out.
I blocked the number and thought that was the end of it. two hours later I received another text.
we had the following conversation:

him: ""hello [my first name] [my last name]. Good morning. Am officer Eric.""

me: really now. police officers don't text people. or use improper grammar like you do. if you continue to harass me I will be in contact with the police. leave me alone.

him: why do you block your sugar daddy. why get u paid $1,050. 

me: because he was scaring me and so are you. goodbye. leave me alone or I will call the police.

then I blocked that number as well.
I finally thought that was the end of it, but I checked my bank account because I wanted to see if I could change my pin number just in case and all the money that had been sent was gone (there is still however an extra ~30 that was not there before and everything that was there before is still there as well). 

when I checked the mobile check deposit tab in the app the check now says ""pending"". 
does this mean he has my banking information? or can you just un-deposit someone's check if it's in your name. 

I'm very confused and very scared. it is also important to note that I have a paranoia disorder. every time a car goes by or I get a notification on my phone I start to freak out again. my cat was just messing with my sisters door and I thought it was a knock at the front door. every little noise has me on edge. I'm terrified. please someone give me a rational explanation and tell me this was just a stupid teenage mistake and I've learned my lesson and nothing else will come of it.",1
OPTIONS BESIDES MEDICAL HELP?,The idea of someone breaking into my residence is so terrifying to me. I will lock myself in my room with my dogs when no one is home and think about potential escape routes and what I should do if something horrible occurs to me.

Please read this I need help,"Ok this is going to be hella long but I hope someone is willing to read this because I need help. For nearly my whole life or as long as I can remember (my earliest memory of feeling like this was when I was 4 and I am now 16) I have been extremely paranoid and it has not stopped in 12 years. It‚Äôs not a type of paranoia that I read about most on here like I‚Äôm afraid my neighbors are plotting against me or my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt actually love me. I constantly feel like there are ‚Äúthings‚Äù around me and out to kill me. They taunt me all day every day waiting for the one day they will all finally get me. Now obviously I know that this is a delusion, but I guess the thing with paranoia is you can‚Äôt actually convince yourself it‚Äôs not real. There is never a single moment where I am not afraid or weary of my surroundings. Like I said this has been going on since I was about 4. The first memory I have of it was I was sitting in my parents bed alone and I wanted to get up and go to the living room but I felt like there were evil things all around and if I got up they would hurt me and when I finally worked up the courage to get up I had to sprint to the couch because I could feel them chasing me. I‚Äôve lived with this feeling every since day since then. I don‚Äôt remember having any sort of crazy trauma that may have caused this, or maybe I did and it was so bad I can‚Äôt even remember it. My childhood is a foggy memory I don‚Äôt really know. 
I have ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù I guess that can be as short as a couple hours or as long as 2 weeks. They‚Äôre just periods of time where I am twice as paranoid than I usually am, and in consequence I severely lack in self care such as showering or brushing my teeth because I‚Äôm too scared to go into the bathroom or be near the mirror, or I can‚Äôt do anything all day because if I get out of bed or up off the couch I‚Äôm too vulnerable and in danger. I‚Äôve found that they are usually triggered by seeing a scary movie or creepy picture/video on social media because it gives my mind more delusions to make and place them everywhere in my life like for example something that has happened before was I saw a video from an account that makes like digital art video stuff and it was this very disturbing human looking creature creeping around and then bam that was everywhere in my house for the next two weeks. I basically live life in constant fight or flight mode. In my house it‚Äôs just me my dad and my dog. I do online school and my dad works full time 5/6 days a week so I am home alone 80% of the time and that is when I am the most scared and vulnerable. I am still very paranoid when my dad is home though, it‚Äôs just not quite as bad. I don‚Äôt think I have ever truly  hallucinated but I do always think I see things or see an object as something else like a person, or think I see things running around or past me. I also don‚Äôt think I really hear voices necessarily, it‚Äôs more of my voice in my head saying things that I‚Äôm not voluntarily thinking like ‚Äúif you go in there you are going to die‚Äù or ‚Äúget out right now‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs coming‚Äù, ‚Äúhurry‚Äù, stuff like that. Maybe that is what hearing voices is, but it sounds like my voice so idk. I used to only be paranoid when I was alone and when someone was with me I was completely fine. But in the past year and a half ish everything has been getting continuously worse I‚Äôm not even slightly okay anymore when I have someone with me, sometimes it‚Äôs worse and I think they‚Äôre not even real and just a trick to get me to feel safe and let my guard down. 
I‚Äôve always thought this would just go away one day or I‚Äôd get used to it but it is impacting my life way too severely now that I‚Äôve been considering therapy and maybe even medication who knows.  

If you read all of that I love you so much.

Should I be Paranoid about my Christmas Leftovers?,"I want to provide some context.
When I was 8 I was adopted by my Aunt and uncle (my uncle is my blood, my mother‚Äôs brother.) They already had one son which they shared together (let‚Äôs call him Teal Blue) and one from my uncle‚Äôs previous marriage (let‚Äôs call him Rose Red.) 
Rose Red usually split his time between his mother and his dad (my uncle) so Teal Blue and I were raised primarily by my Aunt and Uncle.. Now that you have back story about the family dynamic I want to get to the real point‚Ä¶
So my Aunt has always had body image issues.. she even shared with me that in her early adult years she suffered from anorexia. Ever since I moved in with them at the age of eight I‚Äôve known her to be insecure about her weight and she runs at minimum 5 miles a day.
Even now in her mid 50s she runs sometimes 10 miles in one day. She‚Äôs thin and weighs about 120 pounds but still calls me and says ‚ÄúOmg I need to lose weight.‚Äù Now this bothers me at times because I‚Äôm much heavier than her but that‚Äôs not my issue because I‚Äôm not insecure about my weight at all.
My issue is that both me and her bio son (Teal Blue) have always been a bit on the heavy side. Again, Rose Red lived with his mom most of the time so he doesn‚Äôt struggle as much with weight because he didn‚Äôt really eat my Aunt‚Äôs cooking. AND SHE COOKED AND GOT FAST FOOD A LOT.
The fact that me and Teal Blue have been overweight and struggled with bad eating habits really bothers me since my Aunt is a health and fitness coach and she herself is thin. (I‚Äôve expressed that to her.)
Once I moved out there was one time that I‚Äôd actually become pretty thin because I was eating healthy and running about two miles per day. I‚Äôd come home from a college break to visit my Aunt and uncle and my uncle was impressed and called me HOT (in a very normal not weird at all way).. he just wanted to express that he was proud of my weight loss. His wife, my Aunt, responded to him (in front of the kids) ‚Äúyou‚Äôve never called me HOT.‚Äù That was almost 9 years ago and it haunts me until this day that she would show jealousy towards a child she raised. 
Now to the REAL point. Anytime I visit them which is very rare these days (mainly on holidays) she always makes me my own ‚Äúseparate batch‚Äù of something which I never ask for. I used to think she was just being kind but because of her obvious insecurities I‚Äôve become curious about it. She‚Äôll say to me ‚ÄúI made Mac and cheese but I made you your own separate batch to take home.‚Äù When I return home I‚Äôll usually get a text asking if I ate it. Not if I liked it but if I ATE IT. As if she‚Äôs making sure I consumed it. This Christmas she offered me coffee and I accepted. She literally asked me five times if I finished it ‚Äúhey did you finish the coffee?‚Äù
‚Ä¶ ‚Äúdid you finish your coffee‚Äù over and over again she asked and she did not make it herself so it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs wondering if I liked it. And not once did she ask if I liked it only if I finished it. Now I‚Äôm paranoid because as I said me and her son have always struggled with our weight as kids even though she professionalizes in health and fitness and now that I‚Äôm grown and can control my own intake it‚Äôs like she forces food down my throat whenever I visit. I know she has this thing where she likes to be the thinnest person in group pictures and I just don‚Äôt know how to feel. Maybe she never wanted us to have body image issues and over fed us out of love? How would you feel?",1
I feel like there's people watching me,"I'm probably being so paranoid but all day long I feel eyes on me, whether it is when I'm alone or in public, or just with someone I know, I feel something watching me. I talk to my therapist about that and she didn't say anything much about this, she just asked me some questions. Usually, I am very anxious and paranoid about everything, for exemple : the other night, my dad's girlfriend made food for me and my brother but I didn't eat it because I was scared that she put something bad in it. Those paranoid episodes affected my friendship with my ex best friend : I had a boyfriend and I thought she was gonna stole him from me and I thought he liked her so I broke up with him and stopped my friendship with her. I lost all my friends after that.

I was diagnosed with autism during all of that (I don't know if it has a relation with that)

I can barely sleep at night because I'm feel eyes on me, or something because I'm scared of dying in my sleep

please does anyone can help somehow ??
thank you.

Ever get the feeling of being watched?,Sometimes I get the feeling that I‚Äôm being monitored by the government through my phone and they can see my face through the camera as well as my screen. Or being watched by some random gods that can see through my eyes.,1
horror movies,anyone else struggle with not being able to watch any sort of horror movie or scary things at all? i have paranoid personality disorder and i‚Äôm unable to watch any horror movies or anything that involves a great deal of violence or death and want to know if anyone else relates? obviously unable to watch true crime as well but i feel that‚Äôs more common. i‚Äôm unable to watch any of it for fear of it instilling more fears in me than i already have. any time i do watch a horror movie to fit in or feel included it ends up lingering in my mind and making my paranoid thoughts so much worse. it‚Äôs definitely embarrassing to me to not be able to watch things like that especially when i have to tell my friends i cant watch something because it‚Äôs too scary. it just sucks. anyone relate?,1
I deal with nightly paranoia,"Im 15 years old and at night i will sometimes feel heavily watched.

Does anyone have any tips for helping this?",1
"Can you be paranoid but not have power, support, or love of life enough to combat the possibility that it's accurate?","Is paranoia often right about a part like an energy but not about its most extreme manifestations? 

It would be seem more paranoid to monitor more , but the available monitoring won't tell what i worry about, because what i worry about is what is not senseable, not seen before, and would probably be hidden to be able to work

I might act if i saw something but i worry about surprise. Has the 'i want to kill you' emotion result literally for enmeshed people? For family who are ashamed, enraged, and maybe dishonored by younger family? Not from culture where honor killing is associated with but don't all cultures have honor killing, just some as assassination or war or death penalty?

I'm Truman,"It's hard for me to function because I feel like I am watched 24/7. Even as I type this I suspect someone is remote viewing my screen. I sleep during the day and come out at night so I do not have to interact with anyone. My free time is mostly spent sitting under a blanket and playing video games. For me it seems impossible to break this, unless I can afford a place alone I think I'll be stuck. When I have my own place I can ensure that there are no cameras, or another method of watching me. Until then I sit and hide. Imagine you had a drone following you around 24/7 and everyone you know is watching you through it. You wouldn't be able to think huh? Ultimately I just want to be free to do the things that I want without fear of criticism or attacks. I'd like to learn something new, work out and improve my life but can't.

Am I thinking illogically?,"6 years ago I had an interaction with a sex worker.  It was short lived and I wore protection the two times I saw her and have been rigorously tested for STD's.  After both encounters the lady took the condom into the bathroom and flushed it, or so I think.  I believe her age would be somewhere between 40-50, and she was living with another worker in a very rundown motel.  At the time, I was a virgin and 20 years old and felt the need to lose my card in a non-judgmental way but have since determined this instance to be the worst mistake of my life.   Now to the paranoia:

What are the chances that she took the condom, didn't flush it (I didn't visually witness this) and used it to impregnate herself?  Would someone do that, maybe in a child-support ploy?  Would it work?  I blocked the number directly afterwards.  But her profile was deleted two months later, around the time someone would discover pregnancy?  

I worry that one day my future children will get some kind of 23 and me testing and find a sibling, and I am having a hard time reconciling whether this is some kind of paranoid, anxiety-based thought or something with merit? 

Any logical, third party opinion would help.",1

zombie area 

military area (kill npcs and other players)

ffa arena (free for all, 2 entrances to it)

so my 2 other friends started apparantly claiming to see a ""figure"" in the FFA arena, my friend describes it as a mixture of me, the other friend we were playing with and another friend i have. in the FFA arena in the center is an ammo box for ammo, and he describes it was there, he blinked and it apparantly ""disappeared"", it continued to happen multiple times until we decided to do stuff in my discord server.

my other friend started to see figures but i dont know if i believe that or not, i only believe that the friend that first saw it (lets just call him michael, and the other friend we were playing with, joj)

so michael saw it first, joj joined not long after we first joined the game.

can someone please explain what is happening since michael is describing himself to be ""traumitized and petrified"".

Every single paranoid fear I had this year came true. Now what?,"There is nothing worse for a person with paranoia than for all of their paranoid fears to be confirmed true, right?

I was always afraid of being hacked and found solid evidence (APK files and a spyware app) on my phone when my ex hacked me.

I was always afraid of having my mental health crisis spread around and it happened.

I was always afraid of being gangstalked and doxxed and it came true.

Sometimes I wonder if it was a self fulfilling prophecy? Like, I was so afraid of it happening I somehow manifested it?

I was afraid of my cat dying and he died last week.

Every one of my worst fears came true this year and keep coming true. It feels like I'm in a nonstop nightmare.

At least before, I could rationalize my way out of my paranoia, but having all of my paranoid fears come true honestly has broken my sanity. I barely can keep it together. The anxiety is overwhelming and unreal. I am terrified of getting a new job outside of gig work because I'm afraid it'll all happen again. This paranoia and feeling of constantly questioning my sanity because of this makes it so hard to be alive or even want to. It's psychological torture.

it‚Äôs getting bad again and i don‚Äôt know what to do to stop it from getting worse. i feel like they hate me. i know deep down that that doesn‚Äôt make sense just because i am upset that you‚Äôre not responding to my messages. and i recently went to the doctors and saw that i gained 10 pounds and seeing that sent me over the edge, and you said you were proud of me for gaining weight but why would you be proud of me for that?? And on top of all of this, recently every time i try and fall asleep i hear music?? or just noises and they freak me out so i stay up longer and then try and sleep again and hear it again? I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong. i have therapy on monday but i‚Äôm scared that she might think i‚Äôm lying because when i started therapy with her she asked if i was seeing or hearing things and i said no because at the time, the answer was no.",1

I think I'm paranoid.,"The drugs. I think the doctors. Doctors in general. Are giving people useless drugs.

I take medication to deal with. I don't even know.
I don't even remember why I take it. I don't even eat breakfast. I eat maybe half an apple for lunch. I eat a little dinner. And that's it. Every day.

I don't remember when I started taking medication. I don't know what it's for and I don't think it does anything other than make my insomnia worse.

These drugs they give people do not help them. They are lies. They are there to make you think it's helpful. But in reality they want you to keep taking it so they can make money off of you.

These sedatives merely hide the issue, rather than solving it.

What does it matter? It's like trying to hide the fact that your legs are broken. You want to ignore it by covering them up. But they are still broken.

I think the media is lying. I think society is lying. I think they're all connected as one. It's all a scheme or something. Not some Illuminati who ha whatnot. But something else.

I suppose I wonder, why did so many Germans do nothing about the Nazis? Why did they comply when they knew it was wrong?

I don't trust that. I don't trust people because of how easily they can be manipulated. We learn nothing. The old generations knew, the new generations didn't. History repeats itself. We can teach the new generations all we want but they won't understand. I come from the newer generation.

I don't understand my own generation. I feel weird. I feel above, yet below. The people around me are not trustworthy. Not just because of my probable paranoia, but also because they are imbeciles. They are so reckless that I am. I don't understand. They care not for their property nor their lives. What is wrong with them?

What is wrong with me? Why am I so different? I am the mentally ill one, yet somehow I am above them. That's not how it's supposed to work. I'm supposed to be below them. Not above them. I don't like that.

I am surrounded by idiots. The older ones are too intimidating. I don't trust anyone. I am a little scared. I am a little anxious.

I am very anxious. I don't even trust the people on this site. You'll probably tell me to see a doctor or take a bunch of drugs to suppress these emotions or feelings.

That's the problem though. These feelings are the broken legs.

I am aware of them. I know of them. And I refuse to ignore them. I want to heal them. But I don't trust your methods. I don't think they're gonna help. And I don't think some nut job can help either. Nut jobs with their mystic magical whatnot. They are corporations. They only care about profit. They do not care about human lives. They only care about feeding their own ego.

I do not trust them, but also because drinking urine is pretty dangerous and doesn't actually do anything other than make you very sick.",1

How do I help my paranoid friend,"So I have a friend who is presenting symptoms of extreme paranoia. She thinks her phones are bugged and is constantly getting burner phones. She came over to my house and could only talk to me outside because she couldn‚Äôt trust cars or houses for fear of them being bugged. She thinks her neighbor is a long lost family member that is plotting with her family to kill her. She recently abandoned her apartment and is wondering around homeless because she‚Äôs sure her family is out to get her. I have asked her to seek help in the past for possible depression but she was unwilling. She just recently confessed her delusions to me after dropping off some of her favorite movies for me to keep safe in case her place was set on fire by her family and I again told her to seek help, but she has since been changing locations. I had no idea she was paranoid and I don‚Äôt know how to help, especially since she is now willingly homeless and constantly moving locations. I‚Äôm really worried about her and would like some advice on how I should proceed and talk to her once I see her again. I should add that when I talked to her she was able to admit that it could just be paranoia and that she was also suffering from derealization and she even stopped smoking for that reason but also it worsened after she stopped smoking. 

Please advice!! Thank you!",1

Seeking advice for overcoming strict and controlling parents during childhood,"As a 24-year-old guy, I'm looking for advice on how to overcome the challenges I faced during my childhood with strict and controlling parents. Growing up, my parents were extremely strict and had a lot of rules that didn't allow me to have any freedom or independence. As a result, I didn't have many friends and felt isolated from my peers. My parents also painted a fake picture of our life to others, always praising me and saying I was a good child who didn't do anything wrong. In reality, I didn't have the social skills or experiences that other kids my age had because my parents saw things like dating and having sex as taboo.

Now that I've moved out of my parents' house and achieved financial freedom, I feel like it's a good time to start working on myself and overcoming the challenges I faced during my childhood. I'm struggling with social situations and have a hard time fitting in because I never learned how to make friends or communicate effectively. I also have trust issues and get paranoid about having people in my life. As a result, my thinking patterns are messed up and I'm struggling to navigate relationships. I feel like I missed out on a lot and I'm not sure how to overcome this and learn the social skills I need to survive in the real world.

I'm looking for advice on how to overcome this and learn the social skills I missed out on as a child. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1

Break ins and fear,"Here is a little back story, since otherwise it might not make entirely too much sense. I have always had a crippling fear of being alone in places, like heart pounding, peeking through windows, etc. I have house sat for friends and family and physically couldn't be alone without having severe anxiety and paranoia. Needless to say, my partner and I moved into a new apartment üéâ he works nights so I had some really bad fear and anxiety to begin with but was okay. Flash to Thanksgiving day and someone uses a key and comes into our apartment. We have since taken a ton of precautions to assure that that won't happen again: new locks, dowels, burglarbars, etc. However, I am still living in great fear. As soon as the sun goes down, I'm peeking through windows, overanalyzing every noise I hear, and having crippling fear.

Is it unhealthy to knowingly trigger an episode of paranoia because it's thrilling?,"I love horror and a lot of it can be really triggering and send me into a pit of paranoia but sometimes I like that in moderation. Certain images or sounds usually. I haven't been diagnosed with anything but it's a variety of symptoms such as episodes of manic paranoia or simply thinking people are lying to me (girlfriend cheating, friends hating me etc.) It doesnt need to make sense for it to hurt.

Overcoming Unfalsifiable Thoughts,"Hi /r/paranoia,

Lately my stress and paranoia have been spiraling out of control. A few months ago, a paranoid thought popped into my head, and I cannot get over it. No matter how much I try to reason away the thought, it doesn't change the fact that it affects my mood and self-image. This thought is also about a touchy subject which makes me feel ashamed to admit to it.

I woke up one morning, and I had the thought that someone had molested me in my sleep. 

I couldn't remember whether the doors had been locked the previous night, and I couldn't check in the morning, because my roommate (who wakes up before me) would have locked the door after leaving for work. I don't suspect my roommate did anything to me. I'm instead worried that somebody broke into my house at night, and had their way with me while I was sleeping.

I know that if I was actually molested, then I most likely would have woken up during the act. I didn't feel like I was drugged. I also know that the odds that my roommate and I both forgot to lock the doors is very low. I'm also sure that my dog would have barked at any strangers coming in, and that would have woken me up.

Despite the rational side of my brain telling me that nothing probably happened, this thought continues to eat away at me. It's because I can never be 100% certain what happened. There's no way to definitively prove this thought to be false. 

I haven't told anybody about this, not even my therapist. I'm embarrassed by this thought, especially since there are so many people who have gone through real sexual trauma in their lives. It feels like my delusions are spitting in the face of those who have been legitimately molested and assaulted. I'm worried that I'll never be able to have a healthy sexual relationship again. I just feel so violated.

Does anybody have any advice for overcoming thoughts that can't be proven false?

&#x200B;

TLDR: I had a paranoid thought about something that happened, and I can't prove that it didn't happen. Any advice on overcoming this thought?",1
Me siento roto.,"Bien. Posiblemente ni un alma lea esto pero bueno, creo que ayudara a desahogarme y sentir algo.

Siento que estoy roto, no tengo metas. No tengo nada que esperar de esta vida m√°s que humillaciones.

Esta tortura comenz√≥ en 3ro de primaria. Yo era bastante sensible y a mis compa√±eros les gustaba jugar con eso, sol√≠an golpearme y llamarme ""bebe llor√≥n"" o simplemente ""perdedor"". En ese tiempo solo contaba con una amiga, yo la apreciaba mucho y quer√≠a hasta que descubr√≠ que solo me hablaba por pena y para contar mis secretos con otros compa√±eros y as√≠ burlarse de mi. Eso me destruyo. Mis esperanzas en este mundo se terminaban, a mi corta edad ya pensaba en tirarme de un maldito puente y olvidarme de todo, volver a nacer en otro lugar y no tener este cuerpo sensible de mierda, no ser yo.

Comenc√© a alejarme de las personas, comenc√© a ser solitario hasta que me aburr√≠, quer√≠a contarle mis ideas a alguien. Quer√≠a tener amigos. Ah√≠ conoc√≠ el internet, me enganche al instante, el hecho de que pod√≠a hacer un mont√≥n de cosas sin salir de mi cuarto o moverme me fascinaba pero aun  no me sent√≠a satisfecho. No me siento satisfecho.

Los amigos que llegue a tener en el internet no eran suficientes as√≠ que lo deje. Trate de volver a la realidad y activarme un poco, eso paso el 18 de Marzo en 2021 pero ""OH SORPRESA"" mis piernas no funcionan, mi cuerpo no funciona. Tan solo estirar mi cuerpo me duele, y mucho, no aguanto ni dar 10 pasos para caerme rendido. Al inicio no le di importancia pero a los pocos d√≠as comenz√≥ a darme una obsesi√≥n con el tema, probaba dar unos pasos y descansar para seguir caminando pero no funcionaba, tenia miedo, aun m√°s por no tener a quien contarle.

Decid√≠ olvidarme del tema y seguir viviendo por el internet pero ya no era lo mismo, saber que mi cuerpo no estaba funcionando bien me puso paranoico y ansioso. Mis horas de pasar jugando videojuegos pasaron a revisar paginas medicas, buscando que me pasaba. Lo m√°s parecido que encontr√© fue un ""tend√≥n inflamado"", no estoy seguro si es esto pero me esta matando.

Al volver a clases. No pude comunicarme con mis compa√±eros, ellos trataban de hablar y conversar conmigo pero yo sent√≠a un nudo en la garganta, algo no me deja hablar. Siento que algo me obliga a no juntarme con nadie, que algo trata de hacer lo posible para que no me mueva del ordenador. Siento que algo me mira. No s√© si ya estoy loco o si es mi paranoia quien me hace creer esto. Siento que esta detr√°s m√≠o, escondido en la profunda oscuridad de mi cuarto, puedo ver algo correr de un lado a otro, puedo escuchar algo ah√≠ atr√°s, algo llam√°ndome, algo pidiendo que termine este sufrir. Tengo miedo de levantarme, quitarme los aud√≠fonos y verlo detr√°s de mi, observ√°ndome. Quiero pensar que estoy loco. Quiero creerlo. Quiero creer que solo creo que hay algo persigui√©ndome por esta maldita soledad y el vac√≠o que siento en mi. Quiero pensar que mi padre esta afuera tratando de entrar, que trata de sacarme de este infierno. Quiero sentir el calor de un abrazo y que me digan que todo esta bien, que solo fue una pesadilla y que tengo muchos amigos esper√°ndome para hablar y hacer locuras juntos pero no, estoy solo, solo con mi oscuridad y con este sentir de que algo me persigue.

Quiero salir de esto, aun si la muerte es necesaria.

Perd√≥n si fui muy cr√≠ptico pero necesitaba desahogarme y si alguien puede ayudarme, por favor... AYUDA.",1
i am paranoid ?,"my brain convinced me 
a person or an other stuff live in my house 
sometime i just can‚Äôt taken my shower
or listen music 
because i have the impression an stuff gonna kill myself

i sleep with the light 
the night and the black really afraid me 

what‚Äôs i can do it to have a normal life ?
(sorry for my horrible orthographe, the english is not my language and i am dyslexic)",1
Am i being paranoid?,I was lying on my bed watching my phone when i suddenly heard a strange frequency in my pillow. It was relatively low and did not sound like those frequencies your ear makes but rather it sounded like a device?? I got up immediately after that and started pressing my pillow to try to see if there were any bumps to indicate a device but nothing. What if the device is like a voice recorder that is so small i cant detect it? Its not like i can tear up a perfectly good pillow just for my minor suspicion but god i dont know what to do,1
Online security,What are the basics for online and mobile security.  I'm paranoid that people are stalking me and I am wondering if somehow they have access to my location or some of my messaging accounts to read my messages. Obviously this could also be paranoi but I like to cover all bases.,1
Am I developing paranoia?,"I dont really know where to start but I will try my best to explain this.
So I am normally suspicious of the motives of other people but not to the point where it is interfering with my life however, I do feel like the potential is there. I recently went out to eat at a restraunt when the food and drinks are served to me a small thought creeps into my head that says ""I wonder if this could be poisoned?"", and the more I think about it the more paranoid that I get to the point where I won't eat the food and want to leave the restraunt. 
I had another incident in which I went to the doctor for a prescription for a sinus infection and as I went to take the medicine I began thinking ""what if they're not trying to help you, they're trying to hurt you"", I do manage to break out of the suspicion and take the medicine but there have been times where I almost avoid taking the medicine.
At night or when I'm alone I always feel as if there is someone watching me and due to this I keep protection near me at night and when im alone.
I do not like to self diagnose and I dont trust a Google search to answer my questions so I won't .
Thank you in advance.",1
I feel like bugs are crawling around inside of my skin getting ready to chew through it? Idk what's going on...,"I feel like bugs are crawling around inside of my skin getting ready to chew through it. I want to tear my skin open with my fingernails to let the bugs out. A small piece of me knows this isn't rational but I also believe it at the same time.

I'm already planning on telling my therapist and my psychiatrist about this, so please don't worry about me too much.",1
High frequency devices against babies?,"My kid has been having trouble sleeping, doctor says it isn't digestion issues, not an ear infection, not a cold or covid. But every night it's loud crying and screaming for over an hour before they fall asleep. I know this old lady neighbor hates my kids and family, and has called the police on us for noise complaints several time which had not resulted in anything but them getting frustrated at her for wasting their time. I'm just paranoid she is using some high frequency device like a dog whistle for babies to disturb my baby at night, please someone tell me I'm wrong or if there is some kind of device that would do such a terrible thing...",1
Since watching Mandela catalogue I can‚Äôt respond to people around me unless I can completely confirm that they are not an alternate help,,1
just need to let this out,"I am not completely certain this is the right place to tell this. So i apologize in advance. 

I have very bad anxiety and equally as terrible Agoraphobia. So of course as a result, i now struggle with paranoia. I have not yet been diagnosed with anything but i think its easy to tell when you are paranoid, i think the average person gets paranoid every now and then. 

Anyway, for about half a year now, i have a very unsettling feeling that i'm being watched. Like by multiple people. That some of the people that are around me in public that aren't the people i came with are connected to these ""figures"" who watch me. That they all don't exactly want to harm me but definitely are not in my favor. I even believe that people are recording outside of my bedroom window as it faces the neighborhood street. 

It's completely taken over my life. I can't go out with my friends, i cant enjoy time with my partner. I cant be outside for longer than 2-3 hours.

I just need to tell someone, anyone, what i have been going through, without being told im crazy.",1
My paranoia gets 10x worse at night,So I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with anything like besides ptsd anxiety and autism so I don‚Äôt know exactly what I have that causes my paranoia or what subreddit to put this in but like 2 years ago it was so bad to where I could barely leave the house or even sometimes go online. Now I can regularly go to school and I function mostly good during the day but at night especially around 10pm it starts being triggered again. Does the night make anyone else‚Äôs paranoia really bad? I used to stay up late like until 2am on the weekends but now I have to lay in bed and sleep before 11pm or even 10:30pm or my anxiety will get so horrible I Will harm myself to calm down. It is now 12:20am and I am regretting not going to sleep. I start believing that people are out to get me and that I need to delete all evidence of my existence online and stuff like that.,1
Everyone I love is a threat.,Whenever I develop a close bond with somebody all I can think about is how they are going to ruin my life over and over and over and over again the paranoid thoughts feel real even though I know they are not and I am constantly recovering from trauma that never happened with people that love me and I‚Äôve never done anything wrong to me.,1
Update: brain damage delusions dictate my life,"Slight update adding onto my last post but yep‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs getting worse, I can‚Äôt do anything in fear I‚Äôm gonna get brain damage, I don‚Äôt know what it is about the concept of brain damage that terrifies me, maybe the thought of waking up and suddenly losing what made me me, losing everything that my friends and family loved about me all together and alienating me, a fate worse than death in my opinion. My neck snaps suddenly and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm gonna have a stroke and develop it, it‚Äôs a vicious cycle of avoidance from anything physical, inescapably getting into that physicality, then worrying about it all day. I can‚Äôt really vent to my friends because they‚Äôd think I‚Äôm crazy, and I can‚Äôt really prevent the fear because everything in my mind will give me it, I‚Äôm trapped in myself at this point, guess I‚Äôll have to ride it out",1

Cars Parking Near House and Just Waiting Paranoia,"The neighbors across from me haven't been home for a few weeks. Their driveway is on the other side of the street. 

For the past week or so there will be a car that just stops on their (non-driveway) side of the house and you'll see it just wait for 5-10-15 minutes.  I feel like whoever is stopping is looking at our house.  It's been kinda creepy.  The longest I've seen someone hang out there was 30 minutes. 

Today I opened the front door and a car drove off. 

The neighbor (whose side they park on) has a gigantic fence. So if they were casing their house it would probably just show that the lights were off.  Also I don't really imagine some epic heist that would take place there.  Car break ins are becoming more common around here but the side of the street these cars are on rarely has cars parked outside ( we parked ours in the garage).   


I'm sort of trying to wrap my head around why cars are just stopping at this location in our neighborhood.  Part of me tries to reassure myself that maybe its a person who got lost in texting or a mom who wanted to finish her podcast before pulling into the driveway.",1
okay what should I do??,"So first of all, I don‚Äôt even know if I should be posting this here but I have no where else to post it and I‚Äôm scared. This boy recently moved to my school and he keeps asking me weird questions like, ‚Äúhow many dogs do I have‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat does my room look like‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat do your dogs look like‚Äù.

It‚Äôs debilitating, my fear dictates my every move, not shaking my head too hard or moving too jarringly because I might trigger brain damage, I‚Äôve pretty much convinced myself I have brain damage, my speech is a lot less clear and my behavior is a lot different and it‚Äôs ruining my social life, I need genuine help",1
pretty standard case,"Like a lot of people who are labeled with a paranoid condition I'm often told by my family and friends that I have fanciful ideas and dream stuff up. They can deny all knowledge of whole swaths of my life for example being on sour terms with people, they're like ""oh things have always been great between us"".. have they heck! At the same time I have to accept that there have been times when I've dreamed things up out of nowhere,  but when you're told that you're living on a whole other plain of existence where there's your version of things and that those things are separate from things that actually are and there's this dual narrative going on where everyone in your life can be nasty to you one minute and nice to you the next without any recognition of the fact... lets just say it gets disconcerting.",1
His paranoia has ruined my love for him,"The sad truth is I have to end my relationship with the man I've been with for nearly 3 years. We met online so that meant we had distance between us and despite it we spoke most days and messaged a lot. He seemed pretty normal from the conversations although he did seem reserved, but I put that down to getting to know you or he'd make small remarks that you could brush off as quirks. Fastfoward to now and he is more paranoid than ever, it is frightening and exhausting. Everywhere we have been people are out to get him, he accuses me of knowing them to put stuff in his food, in cities I have never even been to before. He makes all the food, he doesn't trust me to cook and then yells I am a baby for not cooking. His mind has descended into more irrational scenarios and it is taking a toll on his overall health. He has asthma and smokes which of course causes reactions like he coughs more, he feels like he can't breath right, his voice goes hoarse and all I get it is me doing it to him. No, it is an asthma attack and this could be dangerous for him. He thinks cigarettes are made ""worse"" these days or a pack must be chosen especially to make him feel worse. He coughs and coughs, complains of lumps in his throat and it is my doing. I get yelled at for being ""sneaky"" and I am laughing at him and plotting. He sees bad in almost everyone and that businesses are flushing money through them to hide criminal activities. He has had over 30 jobs in his life because people were ""attacking him"" or out to get him etc. He is religious and so people are putting spells on him or demons are targeting him which is frightening to hear a person be absolutely convinced. I have anxiety and lockdowns made it worse and I was in a bad place and he helped me so much and I have become too reliant on him. The paranoia seems to have become more intense and the accusations, from me being ""paid by someone"" to have targeted him or he has ranted about a jewel and people I have never heard of. I get verbal abuse and told I am useless and worthless. The end of the road has come. He is never going to get help and he hates doctors. He had his eye test months ago and was told he has cataracts and needs an operation. His parents had them, but he has refused to get it done and says his eyes are getting worse. He thinks he can fix them and ordered stuff, but the only cure is an operation. I can't be with him as his paranoia colours everything in his life and his health is going downhill. His parents are gone and he had a tough upbringing, his dad was cold and distant, his mother was loving to him, but he isn't close to his siblings. All he sees is bad in almost everyone and everything and most is aimed at me and I am made out to be the most devious, horrible, sneaky person ever. I am not and you can't reason with him. Paranoia has now coloured every aspect of this life together and I don't want to be part of it. My anxiety is going up being with him and he mocks it and calls me mental. He has severe mental health issues, his physical health is getting worse and he once was actually talking to his doctor, but now he mistrusts them more. I have to end this relationship for my own sanity too. I love him, he has been kind and supportive, but getting through to him is almost impossible now and false accusations are thrown back in my face.",1
What should I do?,"I‚Äôm not sure if I even have paranoia and I‚Äôm not trying to self diagnose my self but I need help.

- friend lied about her sister giving birth and her having to take care of the baby because she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me. The pictures she sent of the baby are randoms pics she found online

- recently got my licence and my mom is usually suuper overprotective but now she‚Äôs encouraging me to drive alone because she wants me to get in a car accident so i can always stay home with her

- made eye contact with a man in a walmart parking lot n convinced myself he wanted to steal the car n had an anxiety attack so i ran out of walmart because i kept psyching myself into thinking i didn‚Äôt lock the car

are these normal anxiety thoughts or more? Should mention that reading these back, i know they‚Äôre untrue but some part of me thinks they might be true",1
How do I know if I have just anxiety or paranoia,I‚Äôm not sure how to ask for help regarding paranoia or be able to confirm myself having paranoia,1
Leaving the camera behind,"I finished moving out of my room in my apartment today. I was having so much paranoia and mistrust of my roommates. I got my exit and I left. The biggest thing being thinking there's a camera in my room. I kept dismissing the thought. But it was so persistent. It just kept coming back. It was better for my mental health to leave, and live with people I knew I could trust, regardless of fault in this relationship. But I kept going back and forth. Thinking there really was a camera and the roommates really were saying the things I thought they were. And then telling myself that that's a delusion and I need to let it go for my own health. I've been out of the apartment since September but just finished grabbing the very last of my things today. I'm stressed. Sure, I bought a house and there's a lot of things on my mind including other things at work and family things. But as pressed as I've been I've been staying positive or atleast neutral. Today was a stressful day. A lot of things to do and my new roommate was mia for health reasons. Plus I had done a carpet patch and I was worried the roommates would complain about the quality since the color was not an exact match. So maybe it was that. All the stress and worry and anxiety. About finally saying goodbye to them. But then, as I went to finally leave. For the last time. I came up to my roomate sitting on the couch to say goodbye. And I swear. On her phone. She was watching my face. I didn't get a great look and I have trouble recognizing myself in videos and photos. But as I walked out the door. I swear I heard her start to say to her boyfriend ""she saw.."" This is why I have to leave. Real or not it's causing me severe mental distress. But the idea that there really has been a camera in my room this whole time. The idea that all this psychosis I've been worried about struggling with for my whole life. Is actually just gaslighting. I can't go back and forth on it I know. It either did or didnt happen but it's in the past now and I guess I'll know going forward. But rn I am not doing well.",1
Paranoia,,1
Paranoia about being framed,"There is a cop who is a family friend of mine.  I can tell she doesn‚Äôt like me and has feelings for my husband.  I know this is silly, but I wonder if she could really be capable of getting me out of the way by killing me and covering it up or framing me for some crime.  I don‚Äôt want to think someone would be capable of this, but my paranoia is really getting the best of me here. 

Any help for how this would be difficult for a police officer to accomplish or at least improbable would be nice!",1
Parents poisoning food,Personally it doesn't happen too often but whenever my parents would make food unannounced and only for me I always feel like they poisoned it and I refuse to eat it. I remember experience this a few times when I was younger as well.,1
Sore throat appeared out of nowhere,"I have a sore throat that started yesterday evening and got worse overnight. Now it hurts to talk or swallow.

I tried to take a Covid test to see if it could have been Covid (even though I have no other symptoms), but when I got to the drops step, a ton of drops all came out at once by accident and ruined the test. I've been all over the place with no mask, and I'm terrified that it's Covid.

There are other possibilities, like the seasons changing; it got warmer for a day out of nowhere. That evening is when the sore throat started.

Also, I did exercise that day to the point it hurt to breathe, if that means anything. I don't know. I'm terrified that this is Covid.

If anyone has reassurance that'd be outstanding. I'm terrified.",1
gift ideas for someone who struggles with paranoia?,"My partner wants a nightlight for christmas since his paranoia has been getring really bad, so ive been thinking of making a big care package for when hes struggling.

Paranoia+ OCD,"Hi everyone, first post here. 
First of all, let me start off by saying that I‚Äôve had OCD for quite a while; therefore, I get all kinds of crazy thoughts. However, recently I‚Äôve developed thoughts about me being harmed for bizzarre causes.
For instance, this week I received a friend request by this guy with a blank profile picture on instagram and rejected it. He then sent it again, and I blocked him. 
Whenever things like this happen, I always get scared that someone is trying to harm me somehow. The most annoying part to me is this feeling of vulnerability‚Ä¶I just feel like I‚Äôm scared of everything, and I would like to simply live life without having to feel fear constantly. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do :/",1
Hearing voices,Some days i can‚Äôt even go outside because i try to leave my house and then i just hear like distant yelling in my ear telling me to go back inside over and over and over and it doesn‚Äôt stop until i do. Then other days i wake up and they‚Äôre just yelling at me to go outside and to leave and to get out of my house and i don‚Äôt want to but i have to because it doesn‚Äôt stop until i do.,1

Should I seek treatment?,"I think my paranoia is just extreme at this point. I want to move out to an apartment high up, so it's unlikely someone will rob me, or something will come out of my window. I want to buy a gun (of course legally) and keep it under my pillow, or on my desk at all times, just so i can defend myself at any time, I always feel watched, or if i am going to be betrayed or poisoned by my own family.",1

Paranoia After really bad panic attack,"I had a really really bad panic attack that keeps lurching into  paranoia, like I'm rational and thinking logically that's why I'm like looking for any sort of help or advice if possible. 

I smoked some weed and get dragged into the worst panic attack I had ever had like I was in a thought loop that lasted hours long after the high had passed and it just made me paranoid like to the point where I was searching if I possibly had a schizo effective disorder or something. I have Depression Anxiety PtSD (and probably also autism and ADHD but I haven't gotten official diagnosed yes I am afab) 

But yeah I keep having really bad fits of paranoia and I feel like I should see someone for it but I also know I'm completely fine so I was wondering how other people deal with things like this",1
Paranoid ideation is hurting my marriage and I don't know how to proceed,"I've been married for over a decade to the love of my life, but I believe she has a problem with paranoia and I worry it's going to destroy our marriage.  She always feels like people are criticising her, insulting her, judging her negatively, etc.  If someone says something completely innocent, she'll read a lot of unspoken, negative meaning into it and often times either cut them out of her life or lash out in anger at them.  Every time we've visited my family, she's gotten upset over something totally innocent -- someone having a certain expression on their face, or watching too much TV, etc -- and she'll be convinced that it's somehow a personal slight against her and demand we leave early.  I'd say about 40% of the time that she goes out to e.g. pick the kids up from school, she comes back all pissed off at some random person because of the way they exhaled or failed to greet her and she's sure it's an intentional slight.  She can't go to buffet restaurants because she feels the owners are watching how much food she takes.  If someone tells her something, she believes there's a whole mountain of hidden meaning behind it, which is always negative toward her, and this causes her to behave angrily toward them.  Years ago, she agreed to go to therapy (not for this, but because of depression) but only went for one session because she believed the therapist insulted her.  

None of it ever makes sense to me.  I try to discuss it with her and she's never able to rationally provide any evidence for how she feels, but she is 100% certain of her perception.  It enrages her when I am not ""on her side"".  Every time I bring this up because I am concerned about her, it leads to the hugest arguments where she talks about leaving me.  In our marriage, it's basically the only thing we argue about.  Her father is the same, and she often complains about it, but she is unable to see the same behavior in herself. 

She has other issues which, best I can tell, often accompany this.  Trouble sleeping.  Anger problems.  She had a bad childhood.  These issues with paranoia get worse when she's under stress.  

I feel bad about the drama this causes, the relationships it hurts, the things it prevents her from doing.  Mostly I feel bad that this problem robs her of the happiness she deserves in life.  And I'm scared that one day she really will leave me for not ""supporting her"" by playing along with these false perceptions. 

If I explain that I've done a lot of reading online and that the way she behaves is a common thing people experience and seek help for, she'll react badly.  Broaching this subject in any way that proceeds from the assumption that she has a problem and that her perceptions of persecution don't make perfect sense will just result in a blow-up; the same blow-up that we've been having on a regular basis for years.  I don't know where to go from here.",1
my life is on borrowed time,,1
I get random surges of intense paranoia about my parents having motives to stalk/harass me in some way.,"Idk how to stop it. I can't sleep and it makes it hard to function sometimes. This is normal for me at this point bc it happens so often and that scares me. 

My mother's eyes just stared into my damn soul when i came home and i never questioned it, i never asked why and she said nothing. I can still see her eyes just looking at me and i wonder what she could possibly be thinking but now I worry that there's something wrong bc my dad is off work now and i can hear them talking.

It's sort of angry but not quite at each other, more like intensely agreeing or talking about a topic and that's suspicious bc she was just looking at ME so what could they possibly be talking about?? I just put my ear to the floor to hear them from my upstairs bedroom and i can barely hear them just muffled chatter.

It's almost like i can HEAR the pounding on my door that isn't even there, but that i kind of expect to happen soon while they interrogate me about something i know nothing about, why is it in my head???

I just needed a space to vent and tell SOMEONE about this, i hate bottling my feelings inside... I'm scared bc what if i don't make it through the night?????",1

They dont care my depression or anything else and my mom thinks me having autism is the explanation for my depression and anxiety. im so scared to live in this house and I feel so unsafe, im scared they watch everything I do. my partner told me yesterday that its not possible and it isnt real but I feel like there might be hidden cameras in my room that are installed by my parents, ive thought that for many years.

 I dont know what to do anymore",1
i feel like everyones out to get me,for most of my life ive been acutely aware of an anxiety that people are talking behind my back but in the past year its gotten so bad i feel like everyone ive ever talked to gets together and tells each other about things ive said and that everyone can hear what im saying and i just want people to stop talking about me and stuff because its really stressful and i feel like ive got no one to turn to because they all tell each other what ive said,1
"Is this paranoia, or people don't want that I achieve my goals?","I figured out that when I say my goals to other people, they find a way to make me not able to achieve that goal. If I am good at something, or if other people know that I am making progress, they will find some obstacles to put on my way etc. i decided to never talk about my goals and keep them private. But also people do not know what I am able to do, and because of it I do not attract women, because they think that I am just average guy.",1

My surroundings have been communicating with me‚Ä¶,"For the past 2 years there has been this voice in my head that comes and goes. The voice takes the face of old friends I had at the time. The voice speaks freely and when I try to tune it out, it finds a way to hold on to things in my surroundings to catch my attention. For example, (I‚Äôd be watching something and they could say ‚Äústick to the basics‚Äù and my mind will go on and on about how I am not equipped enough to win this battle in my mind.) This voice tells me to stop trying and that I have no purpose. This voice tells me that I have sold my soul and that I‚Äôm not in control of myself. This voice tells me I am cursed. This voice also tells me that I am in hell and that I belong with whatever friend takes face in that moment and nobody else. Everytime I have a negative thought numbers pop up, ex.) 717, 222, 313, 525, 369, etc. these act as a confirmation to the thought I was just having. I feel overwhelmed by these thoughts. Anyone else experience something similar?",1

Need help badly. Ruining my life.,"Paranoia is ruining my life now. I get paranoid so often.. daily. I cant do anything social, even be around people or think about people im close with. My mind forces me to have these thoguhts of paranoia ... being hated, shittalked, cheated on.. hit on.. insulted. Ill often have audio hallucinations of people close to me saying something insulting to me.. or looking at me weirdly. On top of it all my thoughts always spiral into paranoia on top of it all. Like that my close friend is stealing my money or looking thru my phone whenever im not with her, or im being cheated on whenever im not with my partner 24/7. The list goes on. Into way more personal and fucked up delusions/hallucinations that cause complex issues and pain in my life.

why does everyone know my name,I have a very uncommon name and yet wherever I go I hear people saying my name. When I'm at work. When I'm home and nobody is around. When I'm at the grocery store. Even in videos I see online. Everyone knows my name. What do I do? Should I run away? Should I try to find who is saying it? What do I do? It doesn't help that I have what I think are hallucinations.

So I can truly find out.,1
My Story,"I understand this is a small community. But I feel the need to type this out. Recently. About a few hours ago, I had a nervous fear craving to draw and write in my journal. 

""Oct 19th. I had the dream that has kept me up at night for several nights in a row. I barely get sleep. As I write this, the front door light is on and I'm scared of looking through the window. Their antlers pierced the moon. They know I'm aware. They stalk. They tap against the glass, they test the wood of the home. I don't know if the deer are after me.

I cannot fathom dreaming of them again.
Revalations 1;18: I am the living one, I was dead, and now look, I am Alive for ever and ever!  I hold the keys to death and hades""

Those are the first two pages.
The third
""The web is a trap. A site is a desecration. Being lost is a mutilation""


The fourth page.  Before this. I open my gallery, select a random image and it's a picture of my saturn light. In all of it's aesthetic glory. Then I realize. 
""Aug 14th, that was the closest saturn was to earth this year""
The next page
I picked a random photo again. This time of a tree in fog I took nearly a year ago. I sketch it out. It looks like a branched antler. I panic.
Next page
""July 29, 21.""
This time, I recall pulling up a video I had took on that same date, tonight I realize it's all coming together. Are the deer protecting me?

The next page 
""The windows are to stay locked. Shut. Locked. All lights on. Keep a gun close. Shut all doors. Lock them. Pray often.""
The next page. A drawing that came from one line. A sunset over hills through a window, next to a door. The perspective is as if I'm standing down a hall. The door is to my right,  it would possibly open outwards. The window is facing the hills. The door is facing against the wall adjacent the window. 
I scrawled ""fall into the sky"" next to it. Followed by a crude scribble armature. I can't pick out any details other than it looking humanoid.  
Next page. An eye I drew. Trying to avoid the thoughts
The page after that. A disturbing scrawl. It's ss if someone had no face, with a beak or some pyramid replacing all details. The neck is inhuman. Stretched. 
The next two pages are just recreations of the last two, in reverse.
I ended the journal journey with a mind boggling reminder 

""You found me!"" Then a little stick man with a thumbs up.

I can't tell if I'm losing my mind. If I'm letting my thoughts envelope my dreams, or maybe I'm taking the form of a blessing into the form of a threat? I've looked up the meaning of it.

Glowing white deer. One spoke to me. I can't remember what it said. I think it said ""come child, it will all be okay"" I heard a shuffle to my right. Eyes, shot open. I can't look away from my phone as I type. Fear in my heart. I can't help it. I just need to be heard. To not be forgotten. My story seems made up, but this truly did happen. I don't know if I'm losing my mind but I'm scared. The fear is engrossing. Wrapping around my heart like a venomous serpent.

I'm sorry to those who have read this -- I don't mean to increase your own fears. Worries and desperations. The world will think we're crazy. Maybe we are. Or maybe we're right. That's what it's all about. Paranoia is a gut feeling, a primal need to be scared, at a more advanced level. A conception made by man to make it seem wrong to not be worried about the unknown. What you don't know, you can't fight back. 

Please god. Let me be free from this heinous brain torture.  It's an unfathomable sensory overload. My eyes dart. My heart races.

I apologize. Everyone.",1
paranoia is driving me insane and I need advice,"I had a falling out recently with a group of friends. I was neither the protagonist/antagonist in the argument, but I chose to cut them all off after seeing their true colors and how they handled the situation. ever since then I‚Äôve been extremely paranoid over the tiniest things. I will wake up and check all their social media making sure they aren‚Äôt talking badly about me, making negative posts about me, etc. I‚Äôll check our mutual friends and see if they‚Äôre not talking bad about me together or if they‚Äôve unfollowed me. I check every 30 minutes I‚Äôm awake during the day and it‚Äôs driving me insane. none of those friends have tried reaching out to me since I cut them off so it‚Äôs safe to assume they have chose to forget about me. I used to never care how other people view me and cutting people off was so easy for me. so why am I feeling this way and how do I stop?",1
I‚Äôm think I might be dead/ in a coma,"I came to the realization today when I heard a story about neck injuries. When I was about 14 or 15, I went to a church retreat. They had bouncy houses and a bunch of games to play. One of the bouncy houses was an obstacle course where you can race another person to the end. The house started out having you crawl though some obstacles until you got to a climbing wall thing. At the time of the event I had really long hair, like mid waist almost hip length hair. My hair was in a low ponytail also. We begin the race and as soon as I try to crawl past the second obstacle I step on my pony tail and wrench my neck, it didn‚Äôt hurt but the sound my neck made is similar to someone getting their neck broken. I was stunned for a minute but continued on with the course.

From what I remember I continued my day and life after that with only minor neck pain. 

The thing I can‚Äôt stop thinking about is ever since that incident my life has changed, I developed depression along with a bunch of other mental health issues and my life was just weird.

I understand the age this happened to me could be caused by hormones and stuff but I talk to my therapist about that and she‚Äôs no help at all.

Im worried I‚Äôm living in come sort of purgatory. I deal with frequent black outs where I dissociate in situations and go on airplane mode.

I might be paranoid,"I‚Äôve had diagnosed anxiety for many years- although it‚Äôs been present for my entire life. But Lately started to wonder if it might be worse than just anxiety. Here‚Äôs some examples of what I experience.
-Always think someone is following me when I‚Äôm driving 
-Hate showering because I think something will happen to my husband while I‚Äôm in there
-when I was a kid I always thought my siblings would be kidnapped when we went to the store 
-Anytime I hear a strange noise outside I immediately assume the worst
-When it comes to other adults, I tend to assume they don‚Äôt like me until proven otherwise

How to stop paranoia? CBT ?,"Hi. I am paranoid. I won't bore you with all the details, but for about 10 years I have always been thinking people are following me and watching me with a plan or intention to hurt me.

This year I have been trying to change this problem, because it is very exhausting and I often change places or move around and never really settle in one place. 

What do you guys do to help paranoia. I went to the doctor and got some therapy but it didn't help much, and in the end I didn't trust the therapist.

I think my episodes are starting again,"I was diagnosed with paranoia years ago.  I had extreme episodes during that period, I couldn't even leave my room or use electronic devices.

 I was treated with doctors and therapy, nothing beyond that.  I have, or had at least five years without an episode after the end of my sessions, but it has returned.

 A few days ago, I noticed an opening in my window (which I had not paid attention to before), the curtains do not close completely, it was then that a million possibilities fell on me like a bucket of water;  That someone, one of my neighbors, had seen me in a vulnerable or intimate situation.

 Nowadays, it's easy to record mostly everything, and also everything becomes a ""meme"" quickly and I think this is one of my greatest fears, that people or someone with bad intentions use me as a source of ridicule and be bullied again.

 I feel like I'm falling back. I covered the windows again.  I'm terrified to look out on the balcony and I feel very alert.  Hearing laughter in the environment is my biggest trigger and also makes me feel bad to feel that is about me, because isn‚Äôt good be that self centered. 

 It makes me very sad because I don't know how to stop it, I'm not going through a good time financially, I have depression and the stress is added even more by this.  My partner knows that I suffered from this before we met and I worry about him even more, since I don't want to put this burden on him.

 This crisis was triggered most likely the same way as my first time.  But what makes it different from what happened a few years ago is that at that very moment I was able to affirm that I was right with my theory within the crisis and clearly, thanks to that I fell into a spiral.

 I'm not quite sure what to do as everything tends to escalate quickly... Any advice?

Thanks",1
My cat has tapeworms and I have a huge phobia of worms.,"Long story short, she never had fleas or worms until now (I know where she got it from too, it was not at home or from outdoors). I noticed she was acting slightly off last night, so I took her to the vet and I didn‚Äôt even suspect worms. I was suspecting a UTI or severe constipation, but then the vet found that rice looking thing that is from worms. So she gave me both amoxicillin and dewormer in case it was either suspected thing. 

I get home and I gave both the dewormer and amoxicillin. Immediately she goes to poop, I check, 

And I see a worm shirking and stretching in her poop. 

I have a strong phobia of worms. I am so incredibly serious when I say that if I ever get worms, I will commit self die. So I freaked out and ran out my apartment, went to my sister‚Äôs place because it was extremely overwhelming to see it alive. Later she came to help me clean my sheets, vacuum, and disinfect her litterbox (and throw out the poop with the worms that died at that point, I didn‚Äôt even scoop the poop I just dumped all the litter). I even bought the petamour flea household spray in hopes to kill anything there. 

I gave her food for the night and her second dose of amoxicillin, and now I‚Äôm staying the night at my sister‚Äôs place. I feel guilty for leaving her alone for the night, but the thought of being in the same area as worms (and my cat jumping onto my bed immediately after using the bathroom) is too much for me. This is the first time she‚Äôs going to bed alone and I feel so so bad but the worms are too much for me at the moment. 

I‚Äôm going back in the morning to feed her again and the second dose of dewormer, but the thought of the sight of poop with worms with it is too much. But I definitely must have to scoop out that poo, if any, in the morning. 

EDIT: Now I‚Äôm scared I have worms. I don‚Äôt even want to poop. It‚Äôs been a full day already about about to be 2. I‚Äôve washed my hands 7 times just to put my contacts in. 

What can I do to help this fear? Any words of encouragement? :‚Äô)",1
Paranoia flare-up,"I recently had some things stolen from my porch, something which in itself makes me feel like I was targeted by my neighbors.

"Am I paranoid, or is this just a coincidence ?"," 

Back story: I used to work at a small independent grocery store. There was a man Tim (not his real name) who was a regular customer. He was creepy guy, I don‚Äôt have anything specific to say why, he just gave me the creeps the way sometimes people do. At some point he applied for a job at the store. After he was passed over for the job, he became somewhat of a nuisance to management. He would regularly visit the store and talk to the owner, or the meat department manager, trying to convince them to hire him. I was also a manager and, one day, I saw a letter he had written to the owner, begging him to give him a chance and hire him. It was in this letter that I learned the reason they wouldn‚Äôt hire him. He had a criminal record that involved theft at a former workplace. 

Fast forward, I no longer work at the store. I quit two years ago. The weird thing is that I keep seeing Tim. I see him at the grocery store, walking on the sidewalk as I drive by, in a vehicle that I pass while driving. One of the weirder encounters was when I placed a curbside pick-up order at McDonalds and Tim was the person that brought the order out to my car. I live in a meduim-ish populated town (about 60K people) It feels weird that I keep seeing this guy. Why do you all think?",1
Help me,"Idk if this is considered paranoia but I needed somewhere to put this. Today I (M) was at my girls house and everything was good as per usual and I left, as usual now bear in mind I‚Äôve walked this way home around 50 -60 times and never experienced anything like this it‚Äôs about a 1.5 mile walk takes me around 30 minutes. As I‚Äôm walking out of my girlfriends block of houses I start to hear like a quite deep sobbing sound almost of that of a middle age woman. I shrug it off and continue walking, as I‚Äôm walking by the school near her house I then start to hear the sobbing again, this time  much higher pitched also this time I actually heard it as if I could pinpoint where it was coming from whereas last time I could only pinpoint a general direction. While I‚Äôm hearing this a man comes out and starts walking his dog and continues paying no attention at all to what I‚Äôm hearing. I continue walking but now I start doubting myself so I start videoing and cannot hear it in the video I took. As I‚Äôm walking I‚Äôm growing more and more scared so I phone my friend and at which point I now hear the voice again this time it was humming some sort of tune in a lower tone it was humming the song of one of those old music boxes. So I kept walking and at this point I start running in attempt to lose this voice but when I stopped running (about half a mile from where I‚Äôd first heard it) I started hearing the sobbing again and I was getting really freaked out and felt like this thing was following me. I continued running and got to about (a mile from where I‚Äôd first heard it) and thought I‚Äôd lost it. I then heard the sobbing again from a garden near me and sprinted again right up into a housing estate where I could no longer hear the noise. I then got to me house (1.5 miles away from where I first heard the noise) and while I was waiting on my little brother to answer the door I heard it for one more time before entering my house I don‚Äôt know what to think of this do I need peoples opinion on what I should do.",1
please tell me I'm not alone,"i don't know if this is considered paranoia so i'm sorry if i'm in the wrong place. i have scoured the internet for hours upon hours and i can't find a single result ANYWHERE saying someone else experiences the same fears that i do.

i'm going to start by saying i know this is extremely irrational, impossible, and quite frankly that i'm not important enough that it would ever happen to me but that doesn't change anything.

i have a fear that everyone will disappear. not in an abandonment issue type way where i'm scared everyone hates me. no. i am afraid that every single person on the face of the planet will randomly vanish into thin air and that i will be the only person in existence and stuck in this world absolutely alone and terrified. stupid, right? but here i am. i live with my boyfriend and i just walked into our bedroom after going to the washroom, knowing i saw him walk in there before me. he was hiding in the closet as a joke (he doesn't know about my fear) and i had a full blown panic attack. sometimes at night when i am facing away from him, i need to make sure we are touching in some way just incase he disappears while my back is facing him. and this doesn't only happen with him, this fear goes back to when i was 8 years old. i'm just using him as an example because we are together the most. anyway, i just wanted to hear someone's thoughts about this, and to know if anyone else has ever experienced this / heard of someone else experiencing it.

and yes, i am seeking therapy.",1
Uncanny Valley at every corner,I'm 17 but I'm left alone for extended periods of time in the house. I now am scared quite a lot.

Drug addiction and paranoia,"Hey Guys!

My best friend has been through abuse by his Nmum. Coming from a toxic family has impaired his mental health since an early adult. He has substance addiction. We always used to think his paranoia about being harmed and persecuted were due to his drug. But later I realised when he‚Äôs high yes they became worst but it was an onset condition that he probably didn‚Äôt even realise. He hasn‚Äôt even realised where and how these thoughts and mental torture started. With my knowledge I feel he might be suffering from CPTSD. The psychological damage from Nmum left him with huge paranoia of people out there to get him, control issues, fear of government institutions and etc. Now he is on a recovery programme and he needs to do mandatory urine test every week. The state will charge him if he fails to report or if tested positive. However, since he has this huge paranoia he feels this procedure is a plot/artificial and thus has failed to show up for it. He has been absent without valid reason for two months. If he doesn‚Äôt report in the following weeks, he will be charged severely. We can‚Äôt seem to get him help such as seeing a mental health professional or anyone as he is rather avoidant. He just wishes isolation. Many times he even suspects me and mistrust me. Right now he has isolated. How do we get him help and what‚Äôs running through his mind? 

He has substance addiction too to cope with the cptsd. I really don‚Äôt know how to help him.",1
How to deal with paranoia when it becomes validated by real life events?,"A little back story.
I have CPTSD that stems from intense childhood trauma. One thing that continues to get worse as I get older is the feeling that I am unsafe. Im a 24 yo female and the world around me feels so unsafe. Sometimes I feel unsafe even in my own home. I have nightmares often that I‚Äôm being hunted/chased and cant seem to rest even while I‚Äôm sleeping. 

I have a particular fear of men and dating/engaging with them. This has started to impact my daily life as I have become isolated and antisocial from this fear. When I do start to get close to someone I start having delusional and racing thoughts about how they will probably end up harming or killing me at some point. 

Keeping this in mind, Ive been really traumatized the past few months. In June I was at work reading through local news articles when a picture of a man popped up that I knew. I used to teach group fitness and this particular man took my classes and he would always come to class early to chat and hangout with the instructors. We added each other on snap and casually started chatting. He was working on a book and would have me proof read it and stuff of that nature.
I never got particularly close to him but we still were very friendly with each other and I would say that we were decent friends. Not really sure what ended up happening but we ended up out of touch. Fast forward to a few weeks before said new article was found, he ended up trying to re-add me on snap by name but I ended up denying it due to said paranoia about men. 
This guy ended up murdering his ex girlfriend and her friend in a parking lot before taking his own life. 
This obviously has been kinda disturbing to me because it plays into my main fears and paranoia. I am very analytical and self aware so normally with irrational fears I am able to reassure myself its just that, an irrational fear. But recently I don‚Äôt have that reassurance to give myself which has been distressing. 
I don‚Äôt really know how to work through this and it has started to impact my social functioning.
Any insight and advice is much appreciated.",1

paranoid coworkers are talking shit about me at new job,"After months of job searching I finally have a job, and a decent paying one for an entry-level position in my field. Only thing is now at work I am plagued with intense paranoia and anxiety about how my coworkers perceive me. It gets to where I have a really hard time concentrating on what I'm doing and then I screw up, which then adds more fuel to the fire because ""oh, now they saw me mess up and are probably gonna talk about how stupid and incompetent I am"".

At my previous job the people were great, I felt very safe, comfortable, and just appreciated there. It was such a nurturing environment to be in and I really took that for granted.

The last person in my position was very well loved by everyone there and I feel like since I am not her and I am very shy that at least some of the people there already dislike me. Like yesterday I said good morning to the receptionist and she looked me dead in the eyes, saying nothing back. It was quiet and I spoke clearly. I know she heard me. I just hate it, because I always have felt negatively toward/about myself and to have that mirrored by others just multiplies that self-hate, self-criticism tenfold. Back when I saw a therapist, he commented that I have rejection sensitive dysphoria which means that anything I even perceive as rejection I can't help but fixate on.

This is a solid position for me to start out at and gain experience with so I don't want to leave, but I just wish I could let go and stop caring. But I can't. I have never, ever been able to just not care what other people think about me.",1
Fear of death,"I don't really know how else to put it into words. All I know is that everything scares me at this point.

I am terrified to sleep at night because I am paranoid that someone is going to break into my house and murder everyone in my family, starting with me. 

I'm scared to go to work because of harassment that hasn't happened yet but because it happened once and I'm concerned its going to happen again. I am scared he's going to come in while I am working and unalive me while I am at work because of a grudge that he holds against me.

I learned today about a kid who was unalived while at an amusement park while watching a video and now I am petrified that is going to happen to me. I just don't know what else to do anymore. I just don't feel safe anywhere",1

Anxiety of malware,"It started when i accidentally entered a website and I thought it was malicious and i became very anxious for many days and i scanned countless times with antiviruses ,however, it showed that my pc was fine. I ended up searching it on the internet which gave me good information ,but it also made me feel more anxious the more i searched about malware and learning stuff that scared me. I later found out that the website did not contain any malware, but after doing so much research i got worried by the fact that when i was younger, i was not careful with downloading stuff ,and i decided to scan my moms computer for such stuff since she uses it for work and because i might have had downloaded malicious stuff when i was younger there. I scanned, it detected some stuff and that was it. However, due to all the videos i watched and stuff i read, i couldnt help but be paranoid that the computers might still be infected by stuff that could not be detected or by the fact that it might be hacked, despite all of the scans ive done and all the signs that my computer is alright. I have been trying to overcome it, but it has been 2 months now and i cant get it out of my mind and i even get anxious when i go to open the computer.",1

Am I paranoid?,"Alright, so for the past few years I've been heavily depressed and I've also got anhedonia (the lack to feel pleasure). Recently it's been getting worse, i:e Suicidal Thoughts becoming more frequent, Unmotivated and even planning out my own ""self-end."" I've always been a night owl, and my sleep schedule is usually like this; I wake up at like 3-5 PM and go to sleep at around 6-8 AM (Yeah, I know it's weird). About 9 months ago, we moved into a house located a small lake. We've been living her ever since and no issues so far, but recently (about a month ago or so) I started hearing odd noises in the night. I went outside one morning at 3AM to give my brother something (he lives in a small flat outside). I then admired the views of the stars a bit and walked around the house. When I got to the front yard, I heard sounds of something screaming in the distance, yet closeby. It clearly sounded like a woman, but far worse. If I had to describe it, it'd be like a demonic woman screaming in a movie or something. And then a few days later, I was in the bathroom one morning also at around 3AM. I heard dogs barking and a howl in the distance. It didn't sound like a dog or anything, since I heard dogs barking. If I had to describe it, it sounded like a ""demonic werewolf"" (if that makes any sense). And since then, I've been hearing this deep, eerie croaking sound every night (when outside). 

And just now, at around 3-4 AM...I went to the kitchen to prepare some food, but as I placed food in my plate; I heard a horrific sound that sounded like a beast/demon thing throwing up (like a metal screech or something). 

My older brother also has more or less the same sleep pattern as me, and everytime I heard a sound...I'd ask him if he heard it or if he could check outside. Each time, he claims to not have heard or see anything. He called me paranoid this morning when I told him about the sound I had just heard. So I don't know, I just hear these very odd, eerie and disturbing sounds at times. I heard them quite loudly and clearly. I don't think I'm crazy, but nobody else hears them. 

Am I being paranoid for no reason, or is something wrong with me? My brother claims that it's ""all of my negativity"" driving me crazy...",1

I just feel like there is someone listening to me, watching me, somewhere, and I don't like that.. it feels like I have no privacy even though I am very quite, keep to myself a lot, and alone more than I'm not. Along with that I am intensely paranoid about thinking or saying certain things too.

I'm being extremely paranoid and I don't like that: My aunt might try to kill me,"Somewhere in my brain I know I'm extremely paranoid and because of anxiety and all the things that have happened in my life, I'm being careful about everything on a paranoid level. Yet I can't help it. Maybe after I write this post I'll realize that I'm getting crazy paranoid so I'll be a little better and delete this post.

My relative who lived with my aunt (my aunt's brother) and was financially dependent on her, suddenly died. At time of his death, my aunt was at home, she called ambulance but he was already dead. Deceased person was supposed to inherit a part of big house later (inheritence would be shared by him and her). He was around 50-55, suddenly got sick and died. Everyone says it was likely a heart attack, but because my aunt and her other family members said no one suspected a foul play, they refused further examination. It just hit me really weird the way she said ""examination doesn't matter as he can't be brought back to life anyway"", ""it doesn't matter whether it was heart attack or if he died of other natural circumstances"" and so on and she repeated it several times, very weird. (I know she's kinda right and it would be pointless and if I were in her position and innocent, I'd also think that... I'm just being paranoid again). 

Now I'm next person to potentially receive a share of that house (though I do not plan to do so cause I don't need it) and I think she might try to harm me assuming I'm right about the thing I wrote above. Thankfully I don't live with her and I barely ever visit her (and probably will never do it again, but if I do, I will not eat or drink anything). Though I suspect she will try to find a way, to make it look like an accident.

Soon it's my birthday and she might soon bring a cake by which she might try to posion me. I will not eat a single piece of it. 

Yeah now that I wrote it down I feel even more paranoid. I am not usually like this and I hope I'm not gonna get worse or anything. The worst thing is I kinda understand it but at the same time I can't help it, cause I think to myself ""I bet if you had told this to every person who got poisoned and killed before their death would have told you that this idea was just crazy"". 

Anyway, regardless of anything, I'm firmly decided on not ever eating or drinking anything from her. Yeah.

I would be shrieking and hyperventilating because I was being watched or threatened by demons and they would not blink an eye. Once I stayed in a motel with my family and our room had a tiny balcony, we were on like the 10th floor or something and decently high up.

Do I have paranoia? I lack sleep because of this. I even recently pulled my first all nighter. I did the same the next day. I only sleep for a few hours each night.

Edit: I am okay now, I am no longer sleep deprived. My health is normal again. Thanks for the help!",1
just wanted to vent about first 2 days back in the office trying to be normal,"I've been wfh mostly full-time, customers and managers live interstate. They visited the office yesterday and today so I was expected to join the team in the office for 2 full days of meetings. Seems easy, but damn the anxiety and paranoia hit so hard. I know I'm supposed to ignore my negative thought patterns and definitely acted that way but it was extremely exhausting to be constantly ignoring my own thoughts and feelings (mostly persecutory). I came  home yesterday feeling a bit suicidal. Because I was so tired and quiet today I thought everyone would notice and judge me etc. Glad it's over and I can go back to not being a full-time actor.",1

Am I being paranoid?,"Basically, a car followed me to my house, which is on a loop.  This loop is the very last section of a larger neighborhood.  Only one way in and out.  Single street access to this loop.  I am new to the neighborhood, so I don't know many peoples cars yet.  My house is the first at this loop, where it meets the street, so everyone who lives in this back neighborhood (30 houses).  This car follows me all the way home (about a 13 min drive with 9 different turns).  Nothing about their driving was suspicous besides the fact that they were behind me the entire way.  They made each turn I made, then when I parked at my house, I thought to myself, let me sit here and see if that car that followed me leaves this neighborhood loop.  Sure enough, that car circled the entire loop in less than a minute and left.  I took a picture of the license plate.  Now I know there's a possibility that other car driver near me, and maybe they just needed to drop something off real quick then leave back out, which seems very rational.  But I am a paranoid person.  Do you all think it was probably coincidence?  I will probably go out late tonight and see if that car is visibly parked at any of the other houses and hope to God I see it.  Yea, I have a problem.  Thoughts?",1
From The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon,"‚ÄúFallopian watched her, nothing if not compassionate. ‚ÄòYou ought,‚Äô quietly, ‚Äòreally, you ought to think about it.

Advice,Does anyone have any advice on how to level out from intrusive paranoid thoughts? I should be going to sleep but I just can‚Äôt because I can‚Äôt shake the thought that I‚Äôm going to die in my sleep. I have these wild ideas that every small thing means something. Earlier today my sister said something about final destination. Later on in the day I had a random unprompted anxiety attack. Again much later I felt a small breeze on my face and decided that it must have been paranormal. Then my sister texted me that she randomly smelled dirt. My brain has collected all these thoughts and lumped them together and has me convinced that it‚Äôs all a sign that I‚Äôm going to die tonight. I know these thoughts are crazy and paranoid but I just don‚Äôt know how to push them aside and don‚Äôt know where to turn with something like this without sounding like a crazy person.,1
Paranoia about photos or videos online with me in them,"Hi everyone, I'm a 17 year old guy who is paranoid.
It all started with a meeting with a friend while watching a movie, I stared at the TV screen, and put my finger in my nose (but did not pick it). I lay there for about 10 minutes, but the problem is that I was afraid that he could take a picture of me on the phone (he took it in his hands while we watched the movie and when I stared a little) and maybe put it somewhere on the Internet. We have here such networks as vk, telegram, tiktok, facebook.
And the next day I came to the college and obsessive thoughts began - someone smiled when he passed next to me, two girls started laughing when I sat and ate lunch in the dining room, some guys laughed looking in my direction when I was waiting for the bus home , etc. .d. It seems to me that they all recognize me from this video or photo.
Everything got to the point that I asked 12 people (acquaintances and a friend) if they had seen me anywhere on the internet. Everyone answered that they had not seen, but I practically do not trust everyone (except relatives).
And I also asked my friend (with whom I watched the film) to show his gallery.
There were no photos or videos. But I don't know if he saw something on the Internet with me or not.
I don‚Äôt even know what to add here , some people on the street still smile when i go through them.
If you read all this, then I would not be against some advice (because it seems to me that I will go crazy soon)",1

Could you tell someone what is going on for you and trust them?,"I fear if I were to tell people what I experience then they would lock me away‚Ä¶ How do you talk about your experiences without fear that a psychiatrist or therapist will recommend for you to be sectioned? 

I have told 2 therapist‚Äôs at different periods in my life what was going on for me in terms of my mental health, I was bluntly open and honest and then they became angry and sort to intimidate me and made veiled hostile threats to have me locked up in a institution through wilful force of their own. 

It‚Äôs made me question how mature these therapists are to just outright come out with threats simply because they feel uncomfortable or challenged. It has made me question a lot about human beings. 

So how do you take the risk to tell people what‚Äôs going on for you if they are in a position of power that may result in them directly contributing to having you locked up against your will and they may do so at a whim if they feel you aren‚Äôt doing what they want you to do‚Ä¶ Seems a bit of a power play and these therapists are willing to use extreme cards on the fly if it appeases their ego and they do so in a reckless and careless manner just to gratify their own ego‚Ä¶ That ain‚Äôt right",1

help convincing spouse to go to therapy.,"I think my wife is suffering from paranoia. She constantly comes up new and out of the world thoughts. As of this week, she suspects that her parents are not her real parents and that she was adopted. Not just that, she now suspects that 90% of the people she knows were adopted. Of course there is no logical argument that can convince her others. She cries frequently thinking all things in her life are fake if even parents aren't who she thought they were.

and now after an incident where I was arrested and kept in custody for over 8-hours (i have no prior history with law enforcement) caused my once manageable paranoia to become completely unhinged, I'm worrying about things that have no physical way of happening, or going over and over the same scenarios in my head and working myself into almost psychotic states of mind.

it's getting so bad that I'm starting to see things moving in the sides of my vision, feel things crawling on me, and having almost daily panic attacks // my mother has paranoid schizophrenia as well as a few other mental health issues, and according to her, I'm showing the same signs that she did at my age ( early 20s )

Paranoia worsening,"My paranoia seems to have worsened over the years. My current belief is that a demon is after me and I'm under some curse (to the point where I would rather speak to a priest instead of a psychiatrist about it, to see if anything can be done to remove it from my life).

When someone sends me a friend request, my first thought is ""who is that and why are they after me, what are their intentions?"" Even with a friend I haven't heard from in a while, I'll assume there's some evil agenda they have. I've become distrustful of most people.

In the shower, sometimes I'll imagine that there's a black hole behind me ready to suck me in. I am well aware of the process of spaghettification, so it has become a fear. Some people say black holes are not scary, but uh, being stretched out and sucked into a hole that leads to who knows where definitely is pretty scary to me.

Before I see a horror movie, I check to make sure that it isn't ""cursed"" and that nothing terrible will happen to me from watching it (example: in 2014 me and my ex watched the conjuring, which is considered to be cursed but I didn't know it at the time, and afterwards a bunch of bad things happened in my life).

Oh yeah, and I believe I'm psychic and that everything I worry about will come true or is true.

I'm on meds. I've gone through different forms of therapy. I'm seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. But my mental state seems to continue to deteriorate.",1

Am I too paranoid?,"Hey ya'all. Throwaway account for a bunch of reasons.

Quick background before I get into my problems just so it is easier for you to understand, I hope. We have an average sized friend group, it is mostly the people that I hold near and dear to my heart. Yes, I am very picky when it comes to friends and I'm not the type who would want to have loads of them, cause the people that I talk to have a certain value that they hold. I have severe paranoia issues I believe(not diagnosed or anything), to give an example - 

Whenever there's like an event organized by this group and I can't make it due to some other reasons, my minds flooded with questions - what if I'm going to be left out for everything else? What if they're going to do something in a sense that has a negative impact on me etc.. How can I deal with these issues. The other side of my mind clearly knows that nothing bad is going to happen and everythings just going to be perfectly fine but my minds still overwhelmed by those kind of questions.

rant/vent,"So I went to this treatment center over the summer, and it basically made my paranoia extremely bad. I felt like taking my own life just to get out of the situation.

I just want to be a normal kid, like the kids at school. Not having to worry if people in your life are lying to you and backstabbing behind your back must be a gift. feeling like no one is trying to kill you at night must feel great.

They stole my quarters,"venting and vaguely looking for reassurance

I got my car towed and left at a shop and both the tow company and shop have shining reviews but when I got back into my car at the shop, I noticed my cup.holder lid was shut. I did not shut it. that's where my quarters were. they left 50 cents. it didn't hit til now. I don't really care about losing like $3 and maybe the person who took it needed it badly but my car was full of stuff and now I'm super fucking anxious and paranoid realizing they did indeed take my quarters and I'm home now and it's been a while since I noticed like it was yesterday that I saw that. and now I can't help wondering if they took other stuff. but as far as I know taking change out of people's cars is just something lots of car people do as sort of a self-tip so whatever, and also when we cleared out most of the car it didn't look like anything was missing. but there was so much stuff in there and now I'm super paranoid that they took something important to me and I'm not gonna remember until way later and I'm just so upset and so nervous like what if they're taking more shit rn. I think it was probably the tow guy though because he was the only guy who was alone and the shop was closed when he dropped it off and I think that'd make the most sense and I had the least interaction with him. I'd think that a high rated shop would not risk that or a person working with multiple other employees would not risk getting fired if they got caught. So I think it was the tow guy. I know nobody was there but this is the paranoia board so, do you guys think they took anything else.?????? did they???! do you think they took anything ?? I didn't notice anything missing but I really freaking wonder???? also no I am not entirely insane or having an episode I'm just being entirely transparent in my paranoid thoughts just to get it out bc I'm so distraught.

I'm scared to look around corners, into empty rooms, mirrors, closets etc. because I'm scared that someone is gonna pop out or I'm going to see something terrifying, I even move my head extra slow so I don't accidentally scare myself with a strand of my hair (which happens often). It's hard for me to fall asleep because of gow scared I am ans whenever I close my eyes I can literally hear and see tereifying things that stop immediately after I open my eyes again. I also often get scared of my own face in the mirror and my own shadows.

I feel like this paranoia is mostly related to me being scared of getting scared, like you would from a jumpscare in a movie. Being alone overall gives me a lot of anxiety so every little thing can trigger a panic attack in me, but I'm not sure.

Can anyone else relate to this? What should I do?",1

therapists think im paranoid but..,"Background info on recent diagnoses: CPTSD ,BPD , social anxiety, NLvD 


This is the second time I score high at a test for paranoia. But I dont think im like really paranoid. I think its just because of trauma? And like a symptom of ptsd but not like full blown paranoia and it makes me scared ppl think I do have it. What do you think?

Why does she think I am paranoid/ May be psychotic
Is because I think ppl are talking about me when I sit in my garden. I know its probably not true but its real to me at that moment and I will go inside because of the fear and anger.
When I am outside and walk along houses I feel like I am on a catwalk of shame. Like everybody thinks I suck ( i always have had the thoughts of ppl disliking me but not to this extend, this has been going on for 2 years or something)
I get anxiety when walking by ppl because the May think I am ugly or crazy or whatever.. or they will judge me on how I walk because if my physical problems.
I sometimes see mouses when I have insomnia or hear people talking but that's just because of the lack of sleep.
I think my friends secretly hate me, like im some kind of punishment to them that they have to entertain.
I can't relax when im in lot of physical pain in my house cause im afraid someone will find me lazy 
I haven't told my therapists but I also have this thing when ppl go down stairs I see them falling and crying and hurt in my mind

But a lot of it is trauma related I guess.. and I think its more anxiety/ptsd than paranoia/ psychoses? But it makes me afraid.  I do have most of theese symptoms for over 2 years. So it can be psychoses cause that doesn't last so long I guess?
And when I was younger I used to see and hear ppl.. thought I could hear ghosts. So there was probably always something like that in my system.",1
I‚Äôm scared that my online friend has bad intentions,"So basically I (F20) met a guy(M23) on tinder. He lives across the world, I‚Äôm from Kazakhstan, he‚Äôs from the US. We got really close through texting over more than a half a year and we had one call. I would tell him about my problems, he‚Äôd tell me about his and all of that. 

Then one time I complained how I had a hard time making a living on my job. So he offered me money. First time I refused, but next time he insisted and I took it. It was $120. Then he gave me $200-400 every month (april-june). And when I got uncomfortable with it, I told him I don‚Äôt want it anymore.

We planned living together in September for a month. He‚Äôs going to come to Kazakhstan, which is kind of weird in the first place. And I was excited for it to happen but now I have this sick fear about him being some murderer because of how weird our relationship is.

Also he gets very offended if someone doesn‚Äôt reply to him or leaves him on read, and it‚Äôs understandable. But these occurrences make him doubt humanity. 

He also doesn‚Äôt have any friends irl, hasn‚Äôt had a girlfriend and is a virgin. He has trouble with relationships because he doesn‚Äôt really like a lot of people. So he decided to stay away and be a loner because he‚Äôs more comfortable with that.

And one more thing, he‚Äôs very into serial killers and darknet, reads stuff about them. He says it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs interested in psychology and history. But it kind of makes me anxious.

And lately I just don‚Äôt really want to talk to him because he makes a big deal of people stopping talking to him (online). He thinks everything is a waste of time if he stops talking to someone. And he can be really mean when he has these episodes, tho he always apologizes afterwards.

But generally he was sweet to me and supporting, willing to talk about my problems. He helped me in many ways over this time that we‚Äôre friends.

But now I started worrying because I realized that I‚Äôm going to live with a guy I never met irl and could know nothing about, like what if he lied to me? What if it‚Äôs he‚Äôs evil plan? I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ paranoid.

I‚Äôm scared to calling it all off because he already bought the tickets, booked a place and started packing. I don‚Äôt want to be that friend who cancels last minute. And I myself was very pumped and happy about this trip. But I‚Äôm very uncomfortable going. I was also diagnosed with schizotypal disorder that can trigger paranoia.

What do you think about the whole situation? What should I do?",1

"semi validated :( (tw religion, suicide, being watched)","Hey all, idk if I'm paranoid because when I'm in the middle of my thoughts I'm telling myself I'm being paranoid. Idk if being able to call myself out for being irrational or *sounding* irrational negates anything about it, but I thought I'd share anyways

Let me start this out by saying I have a history of religion related issues. Most recently, I think I'm a mistake from God or that God wants me back in some way; I nearly died all throughout my infancy and my birth(c-section) was very traumatic and near fatal for both my mom and I. I met someone today who, within the first hour of talking to them, told me that demi-gods live among us and the church is trying to hide that. They told me God loves me and that the stones I wear as a necklace are masculinizing my face through magic.
I fully do not believe God loves me. I think God wants me to fuckin kill myself since he couldn't take me out as a child.
Anyways I can't really get what they said out of my head.

Also, today my manager told me he full on had people watching him with cameras and shit. Took pictures of these people and everything. They had recording devices and told me how they pretending to park in a neighbor's driveway to watch him through binoculars. He said they were trying to watch him to look for evidence of insurance fraud since he had gotten severely injured that required surgery and they were looking for evidence that he was lying.
That also freaked me out because I often feel like I'm being followed or watched in public. I start noticing things, little slip ups. Seemingly completely different parties whispering to each other as they swiftly walk by, then clearing their throats around me like some sort of code. People staring at me in public, slowing down in their cars as they pass me on the sidewalk, and other little things I don't remember off the top of my head now. 

Can someone give me some reassurance? I'm feeling kind of scared and alone rn",1
I keep thinking that people are in the closet.,"So since I, [18F] was 12/13 or at least 11 I  was extremely scared of closets like any closet's especially my Bathroom closet that I'm still scared of to this day because I keep getting visions [I'm schizophrenic] and a feeling that someone or something is in the bathroom closet or in my bedroom closet. Idk if this is paranoia or not but I hope it isn't. I think it's because since I was 11/12 I was watching scary videos but I'm not sure that is the cause. Also I had a nightmare awhile ago [not too long ago] that I was going to the bathroom at night but then I saw a shadowy figure in the bathroom closet but I that was a year or two ago and I first became scared of the closet when I was 11/12",1
idk if im paranoid or not,"Hi, im new here and im having a hard time rn with an obsessive fear (don't wanna talk about it). I don't know if im paranoid or something but it was always a thing i asked myself in the back of my head. I remember when i was little, my mum would go out of the house to take care of our garden (to hot the day to do it), and i was absolutely terrified that she would disappear in anyway, the more common fear about that that i had was about aliens abductions (i feel stupid writing thst down) or just the fact that it was not her but someone or something else that took her appearance (same with the rest of my family when they go back from outside, i just automatically think it might not be them. I even do it my my pets, i tell them stuff like ""i know its not you"" and all, i even try to test their normal behaviour.

Another time i remember when i got out of school waiting for my mum to pick me up, i had the sudden fear that everyone, EVERYONE, was not real, they were robots, i could've stand that my loved ones might be too, then the fear went away for most of the time.

I also have this fear of behing spyed on with everything, phone, spy cam, people. I was so scared of that, that i didn't go outside for a long time.

Now back to present, im scared right now, i wonder if i could just take a lorazepam to try and calm that down but i dont have any prescription for it and im scared what it would do if i take one, but i also just want it to stop hurting for the night",1
My girlfriend triggered a new fear,"I (M19) am in a relationship with my girlfriend (W18) for about a month now. We know each other for like 4/5 months. I really love her and our relationship is doing great. I know that a lot of people with a paranoid personality disorder are scared of the possibility of their partner cheating. Now to the story,
She is on vacation and I‚Äòm too (we didn‚Äôt travel together). She called me yesterday at 5am to tell me that she dreamed about cheating on me. She called me in her dream to tell me. She also said that she was into it while she was asleep. She felt guilty and all of that. I know that she can‚Äôt influence her dreams, so she is not the one to blame. I just usually wasn‚Äôt afraid of her cheating, because I trust her. 
She also told me earlier, that the people in Greece are hot. That wouldn‚Äôt bother me, but now it does. 
What can I do against this irrational fear?",1

My gf hugs me, kisses me, makes plans for the future with me, loves me, sleeps every night with me.... she must be a narcisist who is manipulating me and in reality she is having an affair with people from different cities because she is a sex addict.

My mother is developing a serious case of PPD,"My mother is honestly scaring me, since her thyroid surgery. She took medics (Levothyrox), and for two years, she's been creeping the fuck outta me with her typical PPD behavior.

if you don't want to listen to my vent pls don't bother reading this i'm just in need for desperate help

is this even paranoia? or something else...?

i might've posted something like this on my profile. it's the same topic, albeit things have changed over time. i'm unsure if anyone else has this problem, too, but have you ever felt like someone is watching you, reading your mind and getting into your personal thoughts?

capable of hearing/seeing what you think of, even if you were thinking of it for one second?

it's much worse when you have intrusive, unwanted thoughts. randomly coming into your mind.

i feel like someone's threatening me and watching me while i'm at home, reading my mind. whatever i like, they'll think of the same thing albeit in negative emotions. when i like something they'll think ""oh i don't. you're stupid and cringe and edgy, you know that, right?""

i'm unsure if this is even paranoia. just a whole other level of feeling threatened, scared, worried, anxious, and paranoid but in another way.

does anyone have a problem relating to this? because i really need someone i can talk to about this. at least someone who'll comprehend and care.

mother won't care; nor will sister or brother. my mother would say ""oh, it's because you're setting your mindset to that kind of thing"" when it's not me. my father will say ""you're weird"" because he probably assumes i'm a normal, cis child who is innocent and non-suicidal. non-mentally unstable.

sometimes, when i try perceiving on what's happening to the person watching me, i feel as if they're some person/demon who looks identical to me. but more annoying and creepy.

i feel like i can read what they're saying in my mind; albeit what would they really be saying? ""oh you're a wonderful person"" no they wouldn't say that. they'd say something more opposite; like ""oh you're an idiot, you just fake your depression you ugly emo brat. i'm now threatening you because i don't care"" and i feel like nobody can help me. nobody, in the whole entire fricking g\*d-damn world.

like people would just say ""no you're just setting your mindset to that"" ""nobody can watch you, you're 'safe'"" ""the only person who can read your thoughts... well, is you"" (according to my therapist). i can't get proper help because nobody will understand me well.

the person watching me might as well be an old imaginary friend; who now despises me. or might be some person i hate irl watching me through technology. even if theres no such thing as cameras around my house, i feel as if they're watching me some other way.

i'm unsure about whats happening. i need desperate help.

summary/brief explanation: basically i'm saying that i feel like some person is watching me and threatening me in some weird strange way (not by using cameras) and i can't get any help or remove this stuff from my stupid brain.

i just want to harm myself; how would that go with the person watching me? or should i say demon?

anyways ty for reading have a nice day.",1
I can't play Minecraft without becoming extremely paranoid,"I've been playing Minecraft for a LONG time, since I was around 14 maybe (I'm 22 now, I know, I'm a late bloomer when it comes to video games). I used to stay up for hours and hours playing Minecraft on my Xbox 360. I finally moved to PC within the last couple of years, and don't play it as much as I used to when I did on console. Around October of last year, I had what I would call a time of extreme paranoia. I didn't leave my room unless it was for class, I thought my roommates hated me (and avoided them), I thought that everyone was staring at me and hated being seen outside. Whenever I would play Minecraft, I would be incredibly paranoid to the point where I'd see things peek out from behind the trees, and run from far away (I have no mods installed, and at this point in time no one but me ever got on my PC). I hated playing because I knew that I was the only sentient being in the whole game, or sometimes I would think that I wasn't the only thing playing the game. I avoided it for a long time and couldn't play without my mind racing and overthinking. Now, that's all I can think about when I play Minecraft. I really don't know what to do, because I'm not as paranoid anymore but keep overthinking.",1

From my room, just standing by my door. I haven't done this in awhile since I realized I should just leave well enough alone and let them sit in their feelings. But today and the day before I thought they were talking about me but when I tried to listen in I'd hear them quiet down and make statements that sound like they're watching me and know I'm trying to listen in. Again I am worried about my mental health but I have to rule out the possibility that they're watching in on me somehow.

Can someone help me and my bf figure out what he's going through?,"Hi, for some context, spurred by experiencing one of these moments my boyfriend has recently confided in me that he often has these strange..terrors? Only that's not what they should be called. Trouble is we don't know what to call them.

There are about four, each with their own distinct look. -One is a man who has no teeth and smiles. His neck can stretch high enough to look through second story windows and he watches you. If you turn your head he'll kill you. He usually is outside the window or at the end of the bed. -the other is a being with teeth like a whale, no eyes, and stands on all fours only his joints are all wrong. He is usually found on the ceiling or next to the bed -the third is me but my neck and limbs stretch out and I usually murder him -the fourth is a pulsating ball of nails.

Normally we'd call these hallucinations but the problem is he doesn't see them. He doesn't hear, or taste, or smell, or even feel them either. He'll just be existing in a moment and then feel as if they're there. He has never seen them in person, but feels as if he knows what they look like (this is how I got my descriptions. He drew them and they are thoroughly creepy).

He has more but these are the most reoccurring and memorable for him. They only happen at night and before he goes to bed. (The ball of nails only occured during sleep paralysis).

We want to know what it is he's going through and if we should be looking for some deeper help or if this is just some strange form of paranoia. Please if you have any idea, let us know",1

Working through paranoia,"Seriously has anyone got any actual practical advice on this shit? I‚Äôm sick of paying ¬£200 a month on fucking therapy which doesn‚Äôt give me any tools to actually help with my problems. I sick of having to take antipsychotics to try and dull down the thoughts even though they don‚Äôt go!

I constantly think everyone is lying to me, I constantly see holes in everyone‚Äôs actions and insert my own narrative. Everyone feels dark and nasty and no one is to be trusted. I would say I really only have one person in my life I can fully trust with anything that I know will be good to me. It‚Äôs not nice. 

I feel like I‚Äôll never be able to form a healthy relationship, I‚Äôll be doomed for psych meds forever and just ruin my own life for myself :( 

How do you deal with it?",1
Reddit Enemies...,"Have you ever stopped to think about how many unknown enemies you've made on reddit?

Recently became more paranoid.,"The past few years (especially my last year of college) I have been more and more paranoid. Not just about me going on a bridge then me thinking my tire is about to blow and falling into the water. Not just someone hacking into my banking accounts and stealing every penny I have every few hours. Not just me thinking I have to hide my wallet in different places in my room because I believe someone is going to go through it. But I have had these phases of just‚Ä¶ images of me or my family members closest to me passing away. A recent example that I have only told my gf recently is why I‚Äôm scared of heights. People think others are scared of heights because it‚Äôs plainly intimidating. Well, when I would look down I see a clip of me falling to my death. I‚Äôm paranoid I‚Äôm going to have the urge to just jump when I don‚Äôt want that to happen. Another example is me hurting myself in other ways and me even hurting the people I love the most. I have NEVER wanted these thoughts. I have NEVER thoroughly thought or planned to possibly fulfill those awful thoughts so I know I‚Äôm not crazy. I pray I never act upon them; they genuinely disgust me. Idk why I have these thoughts let alone why they come and go like they have been. A lot of those first three have heightened rapidly the past 4-6 months I‚Äôd say.",1

After this morning I dont feel safe in my own home,So around 1 this morning I was in my living room staying up late as I usually do but then I hear this almost rhythmic tapping against the wall as If it was a person. Now in the 2nd story bathroom you can hear tapping in the walls and ceiling but it's just birds. This was different I heard it and ran by the stairs then I heard a creak and I then was at the top of the staircase and eventually went down and fell asleep an hour later probably because it freaked me out so much I was tired. But I just dont know what to do at night I'm always worried about someone in my house and this has not been helping.,1

overwhelming paranoia/shame/humiliation,"I'm constantly in a state of walking on eggshells. No matter what I do. I don't know what to believe whatsoever üòï so many things around me make me uncomfortable and wonder if its just me or is there something else I can't seem to comprehend when it comes to social cues. Everything I see is the opposite of what it feels. Or at least it feels like that. I feel like I'm a supervised prisoner in my own mind. Unable to get a single person to turn their head for just one moment for a breath of relief. I'm incapable of speaking up because I cannot face fear. Nor can I face the truth. I will admit that I am not the best person in the world. Not even good by far. I've made bad choices for most of my life and now that I'm old enough to recognize the repetitive destructive behavior, I can't escape it and I feel like everywhere I go the past haunts me because I feel like everyone already knows and shame is one hell of a speed bump. More like a neverending sinkhole that will eventually swallow up anything that enters. I'm never going to be able to fully process this and my thoughts run crazy and are all over the  place. I try not to cry and talk myself through it but I'm so lost and consumed with negative thoughts about my self image, which I've ""completely destroyed"" that I go into almost a panic attack and break down in tears because I simply do not understand. I'm trying so hard to understand why. Why can I not make one decision on my own. I have to be directed to do something or im lost. Co dependent is an understatement. I've lost all sense of creativity. The ability to come up with my OWN idea is completely impossible because I can't see it in my head at all. I don't even know where to start. I always have to look for something someone else has done first and basically do the same thing. I officially hate every single part of me. I'm not looking for sympathy. I don't want an oh it gets better. I am incapable of trusting anyone that could possibly help. I want to. But the one person I want to  talk to would never look at me the same and that would set the whole thing back to square one. Lost cause.",1
paranoia?..,"Its always dark roads, or something that screams horror movie vibes that make me feel unreal. Was binging the Halloween movies to basically stalk the stalker Michael Myers. Unfortunately it did get to me a little bit today, went to the park and deciding for my future health to leave the park I was at when it started raining was better then getting drenched and sick. Taking the route I always take I got a little spooked by a cat, laughing it off I continued cause the rain seemed to be getting heavier and I was still about 20 minutes from home. The cat had my heart racing just a little bit and the rain mixed with occasional bursts of thunder drowned out the sound of cars and talking people I passed. When I was about 6 or so minutes away from getting home this guy was 'following me' so like a normal human being that has seen a single movie ever (and Is a female walking alone) I picked up my paste and pretended to be on a call on my phone, I got to the block before mine and quickly turned, the guy kept going. I waited incase he was waiting on me, and I watched him cross the street a few more blocks down and dissapear into the dark street. Panicked I ran home and just took a minute to breathe, I currently feel extremely stupid. Was it just paranoia or did I react somewhat rationally for the situation?",1
idk how can I work if I have paranoid thoughts,"I tried my best and pushed myself out of the comfort zone ...I haven't worked for 3 years and I went to have some temp jobs. Yesterday I finished the job but today I quitted it cuz I almost had panic attack. The job is very simple but they need us to wait in waiting room for 2 hours and during that period, I panicked. I looked at my phone only and couldn't look at anybody else. And then a bunch of loud people joined and I panicked even more. They laughed and shouted and stuff and I felt they were laughing and talking about me. My thoughts went wild and I simply went to the supervisor and said I am unwell and can't do the shift. I felt so guilty and useless now. Yesterday I could do it cuz the people were quieter but today I couldn't deal with loud people. I felt I couldn't function in society anymore.

I can't seem to get rid of the thought that my parents have installed cameras in every room, which doesn't even make sense because they wouldn't be able to afford systems like that. I can't sleep at night because it feels like someone is always lingering around in our kitchen downstairs or that my parents are standing beneath my stairs and that they're listening to every move I make.

To those in a relationship how does paranoia affect you ?,"Im in a relationship with paranoia and anxiety , i find it so exhausting some days worrying about the tiniest things she does",1
I keep thinking people loathe my existence. I need advice,"Its become a problem in the past. I convinced myself a person I had a disagreement with had made a whole conspiracy around cutting me off as many people as they could, and people were getting convinced, and even if nothing happened and no such conspiracy existed I ended up having a nervous breakdown and ended up cutting myself off from those people anyway.

This happens every few months and I just have to wait until Im feeling better. And since that breakdown (years ago!) nothing of the sort really happened. But I fear that now I may be getting too near to that conspiracy mindset again.

Basically, people keep calling me weird and not telling me whats weird about me. My friends, my partner, some members of my family. I have a big issue with this word because people tended to use it a lot with me, sometimes with good reason, but the majority of the time it was simply used to describe me existing.

Looking back on it, it makes me really annoyed that as a mentally fucked young teen I had to figure out what is socially acceptable on my own. So, I ended up using ""weird"" as a cue to stop doing what I was doing, which quickly turned into me repressing just about anything.

So being called weird makes me feel awful. The worst part is that I have to always assume the worst given my history. So people explaining what is wrong about my behaviour is my prefered option, even if sometimes they still call me weird. But being just called weird? Fuck that, it just makes me feel bad and I constantly analyze my behaviour or start asking people if something is weird in advance.

I feel like its way too coordinated and Im spiraling over it. Do they really dislike me? Has it always been like this? Are they telling other people and trying to cut me off? And like, what is actually weird about me now? Nothing and they just want me to feel bad? Something minor? Am I making people uncomfortable, am I overstepping boundaries?

I think Im just rambling at this point. Idfk.",1

"Trying to understand paranoia because my partner has it, I need some input from you.","Hi!

I need your help. And maybe my help helps you?

I was talking to someone about his schrizofrenia and his past and we talked about needs, Maslows piramid of needs.

The base layer is physiological needs. We needs nutricious food, enough water, rest and excercise to have a healthy body. The layer above this layer are safety needs. These two layers are the basic needs of a human.

If you don't feel safe you get fear/ paranoia.

My thoughts are as followed; Trauma can cause two problems:

- Not able to fill in the needs to feel safe and secure.
- Not able to guard boundaries so you don't feel safe and secure.

If my partner is able to define her needs, she can fill them; and if she is able to define which boundaries are crossed, she can learn and develop strategies and skills to fill her needs and guard her boundaries.

Basically when we are young our caretakers teach us how to do so, but if they are the ones who took away the needs or crossed the boundaries... how could you have learned these strategies and skills from them?

My question for you is:

Can you verify my thought process? 

If you reflect on yourself, how are your skills in filling you needs for savety and security and how are your skills in guarding your boundaries so you can feel safe an secure?

If is all about a lack in strategy and skills, I'll be able to ask for specific help for my partner so she can learn and develop herself and hopefully be rid of paranoia.

Thanks for reading and I hope some of you take the time to respond. I see my partner suffer so much.. and I want for her to have a normal life.

And as an extra question: What environment / situation would be the best for you to start building these strategies and skills?",1

"Strange occurrences.. ET‚Äôs, Men in Black, Gov, Lizards","Was listening to binaural beats constantly, getting in at least one good session a day. One night I heard a ‚ÄúBang‚Äù so loud it had me frozen. Laid there trying to grasp what happened, my thought was a gunshot with how loud it was. Sounded as loud as it would if you shot it right by your ear. I slept with the lights on that night. This was a couple years or a few ago. I always feel like someone or something is checking up or watching me ever sense this event. Any ideas? One night a car was fucking with me at like 2 or 3 am. Came down a the gravel road that‚Äôs private and a one way in one way out type of road. He seemed as if he was dropping off mail. But some how that fucker knew I was peeping at it through the shades. Know way should they been able to notice since they were driving back out. It happened back to back nights so this time I was like wth keeps driving up here at night. I hurried up and shut the tv and light I had on off, there was no back light. Yet that mf stoped fast as hell just sitting there in the middle of the road. I shit you not, then shut the lights off only for a second then turned them back on but left his tail lights off and slowly rolled away but I knew whoever it was wanted me to know they know I was watching them. Pretty sure my neighbor works a gov job in some way cause we had people come to ask us questions like are they good neighbors.. Ik this shit is long and kinda two story‚Äôs but they happened close together. Brain explodes one night and weird mf fucking with me the next.

very very paranoid and feeling guilty,"Had anyone had CT scans, X rays or any radiation procedures specially as a child and doing fine after decades without any radiation induced health issues?
I am asking it because my kid had 2 sets of neck, chest and abdomen x rays ( total 6 x rays) at ages 2 and 4. Out of which one set was not necessary. Kid is only 6 I am worried about future cancer risk due to the radiation, much concerned about abdomen radiation. I neither want to scare anyone nor offensive, I read that children are more prone to radiation risk.
Not saying the doctors were wrong, but those were due to me being panic and not discussing any alternate testing or imaging procedures with the doctor. I really feel like a dumb parent.",1
Sure it's probably just paranoia but who's to say that my friends don't secretly despise me like my paranoia tells me they do,"So, I have this friend. And as far as I can tell, he is a genuinely kind person who has been *exceedingly* (I'd go as far as to say entirely too) kind to me and genuinely enjoys my presence... And I feel like a complete jerk for it but I can't shake the feeling that he secretly thinks I'm a loser which is probably just projection because *I* think I'm a loser because I *am* a loser and he is more or less a normal person with a job and a life and other friends and I haven't been able to maintain any other friendships so why would a nice normal person *want* to be friends with me? Not to mention I've already ghosted him twice during a depressive episode and he's been patient and gentle with me through it which just makes me feel worse and through no fault of his own makes me feel more like the dumb little mentally ill pet that he says nice things to in order to placate me so I don't do anything stupid.

We're both writers (not published or anything, mostly as a hobby) and even that is a constant source of unwarranted paranoia on my part. I regularly show him drafts of things I'm working on for feedback and he always tells me that it's good and that I'm talented. So naturally my awful gremlin brain latches onto the idea that either 1. he's just complimenting my abilities so much to humor me because I'm his sad loser friend who doesn't have the attention span to do anything *but* write and he pities me (bolstered by the fact that he tends to not actually have any criticisms of my work despite them constantly being contrived, formulaic and absolutely *riddled* with typos) or 2. if it's so good then one day he'll steal my ideas and put them forth as his own because he actually has a body of work posted that people like and expect more of and he wants to keep up with demand (I've been too much of a coward to share my work with anyone but him thus far). I have no reason to believe either of these, especially not the second one. The first one maybe, I can definitely see him being the type to be too nice to accurately call me out on my BS especially now that he knows I'm depressed but there is *literally* no evidence of him stealing other people's work and even if he did, his stuff's already good, he wouldn't need to market my trash ideas as his own, and he's just a good-hearted, talented and (I pray) honest person who doesn't deserve to be suspected of something so underhanded.

I feel awful because he's great and absolutely deserves a friend who isn't an obsessive paranoid little freak and he's always telling me how much he likes talking to me and it just puts me more on edge cuz I'm always anticipating the day that he no longer likes talking to me and this is why it's easier to just not have friends, as sad as I am when I'm alone >\_\_\_>

Even when we're just speaking about random stuff, I always get the feeling that I'm asking too many questions or misunderstanding too many things or just plain being an idiot and he always reassures me that I'm not and I'm fine but *of course* he'd say that if he didn't want to hurt my feelings by being upfront about what an awkward weirdo I am >\_\_\_\_\_\_>

Alone in a hotel room.,"Like the title states, I am alone in a hotel room. For context, every year my whole extended family goes on a trip to another state. This year, my one uncle who usually doesn‚Äôt come, did. He also left a day early and offered me his room. I took it because it‚Äôs a lot better than sharing a bed with my little brother who roundhouse kicks me every night.
Anyways, I locked every door and the balcony. I even covered the little hole in the door to look out of, and yet. I still feel like there‚Äôs someone watching me in here. I‚Äôm sleeping with all the lights on because it makes me feel safer, along with the tv on.
I feel like I‚Äôm going insane. I don‚Äôt want to go back to the other hotel room because it‚Äôs 2am and I don‚Äôt want to wake everyone else up. Im just freaking out and I hate it",1
Hello there,"Hi! I‚Äôm new to the channel and just wanted to share what I‚Äôm going through. 
See if I‚Äôm alone and if anyone can help? I feel like it‚Äôs pretty common and I know I can‚Äôt be the only one who feels like this. 

I‚Äôm a cisgender, female who has been in a committed relationship since summer 2019 and I still feel like he‚Äôs cheating on me. I have literally no basis for this and each time I ask he is open and transparent, offers his phone, leaves it around all the time, answers any time I call, I‚Äôm active in his family life, like at this point if he‚Äôs stepping out it‚Äôs on him not me. Yet, I still feel sometimes (and less often every day, this post is a step for me towards not feeling trapped like this) that he‚Äôs seeing someone. And the type of trist I‚Äôm thinking of is totally out of character, he‚Äôs never been a one night stand or a cheater. He did confess to being an emotional cheater long ago and in another life and again, we‚Äôve talked AT LENGTH about how we are both different people as I used to be a cheater too. Either way, I know I‚Äôm with my partner and my person. And I know they feel the same by their actions and words. So why do I still get panic attacks when I see a girl we both know at the same event or do I go on a days long trip out when he mentions he texts this girl that used to be a good friend of his. He has very healthy friendships who are in committed relationships so I‚Äôm not worried about his friends and they spend time together weekly. 

I‚Äôm at a point in my journey now where I know the following: I need to give him his time and space and respect just like he gives me, I need to reflect when I feel these senses of panic and find out where they coming from, and I need to ask myself what I can do to control or deny this feeling either by staying busy or by not over analyzing every little thing. But I‚Äôm wondering what are some good habits or things you do to get out of this hole? Any music or books that helped you along the way? Any type of friendships I should lean on? 

Hope this finds y‚Äôall well and if you have any advice I‚Äôm happy to hear. Even if you feel the same, you‚Äôre not alone in that feeling and you‚Äôre not crazy either.",1
someone help me,"Hi I'm new to this subreddit but I need help I'm not even sure what to do but I just need to talk I guess, context first I'm 14 years old and all of this started (or at least started affecting my life) about a year and a half ago. I'm scared all the time, no I'm not being dramatic but I really am never calm my memory isn't very good honestly I think I'm getting dumber to my memories deterating I'm scared and sometimes I just can't understand text or people when there explaining complex things I could have before anyways back to the memory problems I can't even rember how I was before I know I wasnt like this but I can't rember not being so terrified [SORRY FOR LONG POST IN ADVANCE]

I have nothing to hide but when someone's behind me while I'm on my phone I panic I could be playing a normal game or just reading and I want to cry because someone can SEE, I can't talk about the music I like or the shows/games I enjoy without feeling like I'm going to puke for the entire day I can't be by myself because I feel like something if someones there but I can't be around people without feeling like they can read my mind? Or I'm actually thinking out loud but somehow I don't hear it which I know is impossible but I still feel that way, because of this I have a really bad habit of biting down on my tongue every single day all day I'm biting down on my tongue and puasing before I talk because what if I don't say what I meant to or just start screaming or something? Which couldn't happen I know but I still feel like it
I can't post things or like things or even watch things on my phone because I get scared somehow I'm going to send it to my contacts or I'm broadcasting it to everyone around me or someone's constantly watching me through my phone/computer or what's on my phone/computer even writing this post is hard.

If someone touches me I scream even if I know there going to do it, but when I touch someone I'm fine? Someone walks fast behind me on the stairs I start running and I panic, someone walks into the same room as me and I scream, someone sleeping in the same room as me? No just no I feel like I'm going to puke and scream or cry or just all three at once my whole life has been affected. I've tried talking to my brother sense where really close but I don't think he really understands, I can't write in my journal because my mom READS. EVERYTHING. And I know that for a fact she's admitted to it, I think that started it when I found out she was going through my things I am never alone it's like she knows everything she hears everything she see everything and there nothing I can do about it I'm alone I'm helpless I hate that feeling I can't even talk to my therapist because she's friends with my mom I know she legally can't tell her anything but everytime I try to talk I freeze up and I just can't. Please I need help I don't know whats wrong with me what do I do about this please I feel like I'm dying like I'm decompossing everyday it's so hard everything is so hard all I do is go to school, eat, lay down, eat, sleep, go to school but I'm not happy Im scared so scared and everything feels so REAL to real when I stressed I just imagine things, dumb scenarios stuff like that but none of that is real and no of those make believe people are real and I'll never have that I'll never have anything because I am messed up and I'll probably always be and I'm just getting worse I know I am but no one cares I just want someone to ask if I'm okay I just want someone to hold me and for me to not be scared I want to be content I'm sorry for the rambling I got of track sorry just idk I don't know",1
sometimes i want to fill in the blanks and imagine some paranoid theories,"because i,ve been having invalidating and terrible health issues for the last few years no one can point out, they show more and more, my condition deteriorates and the people around me are powerless to help aside from being supportive. ive also noticed over that period of time that even something as common as a strong infection wont show in my blood tests, it will only get treated when blatantly obvious. i cant help but wonder what happens to my blood tests results, who why when and how.. trying to come up with the most down to heart explanation that nothing can explain.. and ive also had during that time evaluations that rule out psychosis traits and disconnected traits. i think its part of human nature to want to understand what incapacitates them entirely. we can sometimes see the world as too bad but also too good.",1
I just thought my anxiety was bad,I didn't even know this was a thing but when I found out I went to a screening immediately and sure enough,1
don't know where else to put this,"I've never used paranoia to describe my mental illness. It always falls under anxiety when I talk about my issues. But I just wanted to share this feeling with people who might understand, who can tell me yes or no, if what I'm experiencing is paranoia.

It's not like the stereostypic ""someone's looking at me through my window"" or the more serious ""I think someone is stalking me everywhere I go."" It's more like, I think the entire universe is out to get me. Like, I'm seruous when I say this, I feel that some being is going out of its way to make me miserable. It knows when I'm happy or feel safe and secure, when I'm most vulnerable, and it drops a bombshell on me. 

My life isn't exactly bad to be honest, I have it pretty good. I have a boyfriend and an apartment and an internship, but every so often, almost like in a sitcom, something utterly stupid happens, something totally out of my control, and it ruins my life for a few days, weeks, months, and in some instances forever. Nothing could have prevented it, an illness, a car accident, losing a job. Not always me but sometimes it affects those around me, indirectly affected me as well.

""That's just life,"" yeah I KNOW that but, it just doesn't feel that way... The universe is sending me a message. Sometimes I hear it talk to me, when I'm at my worst. It's just in my head though, so idk if it's related to my mental illness. I'd like to imagine it is, because the thought of the universe coming down on me the moment I realize it's playing games makes me wanna puke.

I've been like this since... middle school I guess. I remember distinctly. I got bad grades because the universe wanted me to be stupid and everyone else to be smart. I would study and memorize and still get B's and C's. It didn't matter that I tried, everyone else was better. I think it's the universe's way of saying I was never meant to be here and that I should stop trying. I'll never be good enough.

And I've been like this ever since, about a decade or so. I'm tired of this. Of being scared to make a move because it will always be the wrong move. I've made so many mistakes I wish I could erase....",1

Had delusions of grandeur... Persecution complexes. 

Then I hit rehab and wanted to and got clean and have 7 months plus now! The first 6 months were relatively easy. But the past two months I've been having the same recurring meltdown or psychosis for an hour or even day. 

I'm just really frustrated. I moved back in with my parents, older brother lives here, they all support me though I believe my brother enjoys making fun of the failures in my life. 

For example two days ago I had a good day, woke up at 8 am, showered. Worked 5 hours. Around 8 pm at the house all the sudden something took over me ... I got very anxious and fearful and was having delusional thoughts my brother was in the CIA and my parents only kept me around here to make fun of the loser I have become (yes I am self demeaning at times). 

My dad asks what's wrong and I just say something is not right. Then my half drunk mom comes in, mind you I'm in my 30s and she's 60s and goes ""is this because you don't have a girlfriend"" which I laugh at now, but it didn't feel natural and almost like she wants to gaslight me and make it worse. I'm having a panic attack or delusion and she brings up the negative aspects of my life unrelated.... Well I think.

Anyway. I wanted to post and get some feedback because it happened again tonight not as severe. Nothing like the week long psychosis I would have binging on meth with no food or liquids thinking there were cameras everywhere watching me for the world to watch etc......

But damn. 7 months clean and I guess it's brain damage? Can anyone relate after getting clean from major meth use and the mental and psychological side effects. Nothing is scarier than thinking reality is fake or that I'm being streamed live in hidden cameras for the world to see a loser that destroyed his mind and mental health with METH.

Don't do meth",1
Uninteresting,"I know this is common with paranoia, but I always have a feeling someone is watching me. It triggers mostly at home, but definitely interferes with my social life. I run up the stairs thinking something or someone is chasing me,  it's very tiring. When at home, I just feel like something is out to get me, some creature that lurks in the dark. They only strike when I'm alone, but I can feel it's eyes on me when with others. In public, it's more of the people around me. I convince myself they're staring, somehow interested in me in some way or picking away every flaw I have in their head. It makes me feel uneasy, sweaty palms and everything. I've been like this since as long as I remember, I have some memories of me hiding under a blanket in the middle of the night because I can sense a presence. Maybe it was me being a though, I really don't know.",1
Feeling stressed tonight and am struggling with the fear of ‚Äúsomething‚Äù happening. Please help,"I don‚Äôt even really know what that ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is‚Ä¶ I have OCD and sometimes when I am going through a lot (as I am now) it acts up. I am afraid to go to sleep and I feel like I have to wait until I can see the sun. This used to happen a lot but it‚Äôs not very frequent anymore. 

I have school tomorrow (today??) and have to be up in 2 and a half hours. But I‚Äôm just freaking out over stuff that I KNOW is irrational

Not sure what to do. Anyone have tips/ideas? Should I just stay up all night? I am too scared to sleep rn. My apartment is too silent but also I‚Äôm too nervous to play any noise out loud",1
hi I'm new here...,"Trigger warning ‚ö†Ô∏è 

I've been having this issue usually when I'm home alone but not always. It's at its worse if my back is to an open room or hall etc. Even worse than that if I need to shower. For example tonight my wife works until 3a.m. I needed a shower and 3a.m. is too late anyway so I showered and I was so paranoid I kept the curtain open. I couldn't stand to close my eyes so I did my best to rinse my hair and face without closing my eyes and ended up having to for what I'm sure was just a few seconds but seemed much longer. Hurried to get them open despite getting some soap in my eye. This whole time I got my back to the back wall of the shower curtain and door open. Getting the floor wet. By the time I was done...which wasn't long cuz instead of doing one thing at a time and rinsing separately I did it all at once then rinsed...I was shaky and my heart was and still is racing and its been prob 20 minutes since I got out. This doesn't happen every time I'm alone. 

Sometimes it happens when my wife is home. Like if I'm doing the dishes with my back to the rest of the room I'm so paranoid and anxious if my wife comes in and speaks or touches me I jump out of my skin and my heart is racing for a while afterwards and I'll be shaky for a bit. 

For context I've gone through abuse as a kid I can only remember bits of it. I'm working with a therapist and on a wait list for a psychiatrist. My diagnosis so far are anxiety disorder, depression, social phobia, and ptsd. I haven't told my therapist about this paranoia or whatever it is yet because honestly I feel so dumb about it. I'm not scared to be home alone nor am I scared of my wife. Why does this happen? I'm so tired of all of this shit and I hate myself.

Edit: just also thought this. It's started happening at work too. Thanks to the social phobia I can't work around people so I work alone cleaning a 2 story office building. Lately I'm pretty jumpy at work. If a automatic light clicks off I jerk my head towards it immediately and feel jumpy for a second until I realize it was just the light. I see things out of the corner of my eye and when I look nothing is there.",1
"Always feel like someone will know who I am, where I am and what I‚Äôm doing","I always feel like someone will know what I‚Äôm doing. Like my brother doesn‚Äôt like me hanging out with boys, but since my friends have boyfriends it usually ends up my friend group hanging out with a male friend group. I always feel like my brother will pop up. 

When I speak on the phone on the train, I feel like someone I know will be listening and catching me ‚Äúgossiping‚Äù. 

I moved 6 hours away from my home city to another part of the country and I still feel like this. Even though no one knows me in this city, I feel like someone I know will pop up and ‚Äúcatch me‚Äù even if I‚Äôm *not* doing something that *isn‚Äôt* allowed. 

This also happens on social media. I have 3 different reddit accounts. 4 tiktok accounts, 5 Instagram accounts and Multiple Pinterest accounts. I‚Äôm paranoid all the time and it‚Äôs mentally, physically and emotionally draining.",1
i am 100% convinced that my family triggers my misophonia on purpose,"i'm putting this in r/paranoia because people are less likely to see it and it is, in a way, just me being paranoid.

i've had severe misophonia since the age of 6 (severe as in i wear ear defenders almost always, i can't eat near my family whatsoever, if someone is chewing gum i have to put on ear defenders and loudly chew to myself, if no ear defenders are available i will genuinely go into a screaming and sobbing tantrum like a toddler who was just told they can't buy something) and it has affected almost every part of my life. my mom always found it stupid, my nan accepts it as a thing that i have which i'm thankful for. 

i swear my mom used to purposely chew and smack her lips way louder and kore frequently than normal if she was mad at me. she always made me sit in the room with her to eat with no ear defenders (yes, i cried every time. no, she didn't care, she told me to stop being dramatic a lot. no, she's not in my life anymore, and my nan is okay with me eating alone) and i swear every time she was upset with me she would purposely trigger me because she wanted 'revenge' and the only way to properly upset me was by triggering the disorder that disables me the most. 

i was talking to my nan a few minutes ago. another trigger for my misophonia is sniffing. i can't explain it but i can't explain any of the triggers. she seemed a bit annoyed with me and i swear she was just loudly sniffing for the entire conversation. 

i don't know what to do. i don't want to ask my nan if she's doing it on purpose because she'll say no.",1

i am scared of paranormal things,"i am not a child, i am in my late teens but i am still extremely paranoid of paranormal entities.

i do not exactly believe they exist but i take many measures to not be killed or harmed by them.

i have installed a lock on my bedroom door to protect me at night, i avoid mirrors (especially in confined spaces) and rarely close my eyes, especially in the shower as i believe it makes me feel like im being watched.

i do not have any diagnosis but i am quite socially anxious and socially paranoid.

seeing a creepy picture online, seeing something fall over without being touched or flickering lights send me into a state of panic and i start to hyperventilate and my stomach sinks, i tremble and i am generally in an extremely scared state.

i also constantly look around myself for entities and try not to make any noise at night.

What's a normal level of paranoia?,"I ask because I'm worried I'm too paranoid. I sometimes think people can read my thoughts and know what I'm thinking, as well as have an agenda against me and are just pretending to not like me/be my friend.

I don't trust people anymore. I personally have been using abused by people for monetary gain multiple times in the past year. People are so desperate for money that they will do anything to get it.

Am I being way too paranoid? Kinda long read sorry,"So talk about being paranoid and super distrustful. 
When my sons mother and I first got together (2011 She was 18 and I was 19.)  I was a HUGE pothead and she wasn't so much. She would partake once in awhile but that's about it. 

Then one day out of the blue she asked me to stop smoking and I said I would, and did for the most part. Until one point I had went to pick up some of my stuff outta storage with her brother, and on the way he asked if I wanted to smoke and  said sure. Tried to hide the fact I was high and not doing it so well.

 Well we had a huge blowout and she told me to leave so I left. I didn't have a car so I started walking home. Well she picked me up about 15 min later and told me it was her or pot and I chose her.

 Jump forward 5 years later we broke up 2 years prior and I just started smoking again. Jumping forward to present day, her attitude about it has completely changed and we smoke together and I even pick her up carts. Am I being too paranoid that she still would hold this against me or are my gut instincts on point?",1
i think I suffer from paranoia,All my life I have been a religious person and I would never say something bad about my religion..but the last 1-2 months bad thinks are coming to my mind about my religion and I cant control them.Then I may say to the god am sorry and after an hour another bad though may come.I dont know what to do because I try to find ways to beat this thoughts and then it becomes worse because I end up all day thinking about this.,1
this is ruining my life TW s_uicide,"Usually posting somewhere makes this issue worse. But I want someone to know what I'm going through because its weird and I don't know if this is severe paranoia or delusion at times. There is a woman in my brain, whether it be a separate entity or not. Whether she actually exists I dont know. I have severe OCD with constant compulsions. I cant enjoy anything without compulsions and Ive set up a while system. Were both in charge of my brain and when I do my compulsions I touch something three times. First time I say yes in my brain, second time is no, third is I don't know. Its always no because its usually something like ""do this or you will be punished, do this or someone you know will die, do this or whatever idk its a bunch of horrible shit."" I have argued with her and basically just had breakdowns saying ""STFU THIS ISNT REAL"" I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT. But every time I do this or ignore my compulsions something bad happens. IDK. EVERY TIME. I feel like this is genuinely real. I don't actually hear her bc I don't hallucinate. Either something bad happens (I don't want to say bc it triggers me to actually type it out) Or I feel like I'm outside my body (depersonalization, de realization) or I just feel high or like nothing is real. I feel like she is going to banish me into another dimension or Ill never see anyone I love again if I continue this. I don't know if I fully believe this , but sometimes I don't have the capability to think irrationally and sometimes I do think it is. It is ruining my fucking life and I want to end things. I mean the feeling high or outside my body could be anxiety but sometimes it happens when Im not even anxious. I keep seeing signs that this is real like after I argue with her or ignore a compulsion I see the word die or burn or i see fire or something in a youtube thumbnail or whatever. Ill hear sounds like banging immediately after I ignore it. Immediately. Almost every single time. Sometimes I have been like ""if I see the color red three times in a row its real"" And i have done it over and over again and its red. There are so many other examples. I dont know what to do. I feel like something bad is going to happen to me. I cant do online therapy bc its not fucking free or go in to in person therapy bc I have no money.

I literally have made up a whole system for this. I have to write S for sorry when I argue with her on a flat surface or say intrusive thought out loud whenever I have one so she doesnt punish me. She is a irrational person and I have to be the rational one so sometimes she could punish me without me even doing anything bad. Ive literally made this all up and never saw or or hear her but Im convinced its real sometimes? I dont know if its bordering onto delusion or not but this is ruining my life. Even making this post I feel like something bad is going to happen. ",1

Other times when I try to communicate this it comes out like an insecure mess and I feel small and pathetic, and worse than before because I wonder ‚Äúwill this person really find me annoying now that they know how insecure I am? Am I boring them?‚Äù
The worse part is that I can have this chat - apologetic mess stuff, for stupid thing - with the same person over and over, and still feel uncomfortable the next time.
I just hate this side of myself.",1
i fucking snapped.,I dont even remember what happened all I remember is they were looking at me I couldnt handle it I fucking lost it. I dont remember what I did but things are broken my girlfriend hates me and I have pages and pages of speculations which I still believe are real in my phone. These fucking robots wont get me doe.,1
paranoia and hypervigilance at home,"So, I live in an apartment, and there are neighbors to the left and to the right; also neighbors upstairs at times. The walls are really thin, and if someone speaks out loud, they can be relatively with not much difficulty heard. Currently I am staying at home most of the days,  am feeling extremely irritated that neighbors will hear me speaking. So, this constant hypervigilance and trying to lower my voice and just whisper instead exhausts me too much. I dont know what to do. I have had a psychotic break almost 3 years ago in the same apartment because of neighbors' talking about me and almost-psychological bullying behavior, and used antipsychotics for over 1.5 years to treat it; but didnt receive any other psychological guidance related to this. (These neighbors left, but I am always on the lookout for threats from other neighbors). Anyway, how do I manage this? Any tips? I want to feel comfortable, but just the fact that there exist neighbors all over, freaks me out and makes me so uncomfortable.",1
Relationship Paranoia,"It seems like I have the issue with overthinking and making up unrealistic scenarios in my head about what my girl is doing in other country because I'm not there. She always trusted me, but I feel like I ruined it with my paranoia, because that's something I haven't managed to give back. I constantly think about things, I feel this tummy feeling and I hate it,  I honestly hate it, tried talking myself out of my ideas and thoughts, but I can only hold for so long as 5 minutes, before my head spins around again with useless scenarios that aren't realistic as I mentioned, I think that I always have to express my opinion and my insecurities have to be fulfilled otherwise my paranoia gets to me and I can't even sleep anymore,  I walk rounds around my house talking to myself trying to figure out a way to think. It's unhealthy and I don't want to lose my relationship over someone that I can't beat and that's my paranoia",1
Rabies?,"I was walking in the beach yesterday and passed by a dog who was drooling a lot.

Although I didn't get any saliva on my hand, I reached inside my pocket and pricked my key. Then afterwards I saw a small bump on my fingertip.

Rabies is eradicated in my country (UK) but I'm still just worried I might've somehow got the virus.",1
A need for self-reflection,"Rather than blaming other people, accusing them of things and trying to prove my case, why not do some self-reflection and see where one is going wrong?

Perhaps one is doing things to motivate others to go out of their way to ruin their life.

Perhaps one is intentionally making themselves an easy target to attract these things.

I'm not saying or even implying that it's all one's fault or that the others are in the right at all, I'm saying that it's important to always reflect on one's self and see what one can do better.",1
uh hi guys. it's a long post you can just skim through idk,"17M - i know most of whoever sees this will feel the same or at least understand when i say that i'm gonna sound silly. at this point i don't know if it's a delusion or fact because it damn well could be fact, but there's still the paranoia of detectives/private investigators/police after me. i will admit i'm not the most golden law-abiding citizen out there. so far:

i'm suspicious of cars, people in shopping centres, any persons in vehicles, and i don't leave my room unless i'm about to piss myself and/or everyone else is asleep. the paranoia is concerning me.

12/13th April ~6pm. two cars (isuzu and... toyota, maybe) with tinted windows were parked along the road when i was walking on the side of a bushland surrounded road headed to my estate (suburbs). from both cars i got the vibe of being watched/taken photos of. one of them on my side of the road and parked close enough to the sidewalk that i could read the licence plate. as soon as i was perpendicular to the car it drove off. then when i got into my estate a police car was driving by the school near my house. that's what the last straw was for me.

and just tonight there was a police helicopter (VH-WAH POL61 western australian police force) that came all the way from the city just to circle twice around near where i live. like they traced a nutsack and went back to the city. when i looked up to it, it's flashing light held still as if to signify they knew i was watching them from the crack in my bedroom blinds. i swear, that's proof enough.

i feel this may be the start of a decline and i have absolutely nobody. 0 (zero) friends, mother is a bad person to me, can't talk to my sisters, father will think i'm crazy. i'm fucking lost.

edit: i'm not new to paranoia either, had a mind-reading fiasco not long ago",1
it's just funny how.....,"Absolutely no fucking matter what I do, weather it's out of respect or kindness or just to be a good fucking person. One step forward ten steps back. Literally always. I can sense the negativity and disrespect from eons away. It literally makes my skin crawl and vibrate to the point of a mental breakdown. Dont ya hate it when you know it's on purpose but they make it so you never have the proof? It's real life insanity played out scene after scene. Scripted to be the most annoying stressful situations that you can think of. I'm about to have to just do something so fucking crazy it either kills me or everyone around me.",1
avoiding help,"I‚Äôm scared of seeking help for my paranoia because I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs going to make people undervalue my thoughts and beliefs. I‚Äôm scared people won‚Äôt take my values seriously and think I‚Äôm just another deranged person that thinks the way they do just because of a specific mental disorder, as if it‚Äôs a personality contributor.


My last therapist was so cold. He tried to diagnose me and told me to take meds half an hour into our second session. He never looked into my eyes or asked me anything specific, he just.. generalized my thoughts and stayed silent. And no this is not a paranoia or cynical perspective, this is what he was genuinely like.


Nobody even suspects me of having paranoia because I hide when it happens. I have a good reputation, a nice social life, a nice future ahead, and a responsible personality. I‚Äôm just.. paranoid. I keep hearing mean people in my head and feeling foreign air creeping up behind me and all this other threatening stuff. It‚Äôs like my walls are closing in on me but it‚Äôs not schizophrenia because it‚Äôs a strictly mental sensation, after I‚Äôm done with the paranoia I know it‚Äôs not real. It‚Äôs just scary to witness.


I just wish people would understand, if they knew about this, that Im still functioning normally and intelligently.",1
I hate my life,"To be honest, I don't know if I'm paranoid or not, sometimes I'm pretty sure I'm paranoid, sometimes I'm not.

I rarely talk to people, when I talk to people I think they want to use me or just hate me, I always find some stupid reasons why other people might hate me and there's nothing I can do about it.

If you have felt something similar, please share your experience.",1
Unable to live normally,"Struggling to live normally in my own home

(Long a** read) - anxiety and paranoia.

Hi all, 

TLDR; anxious and paranoid  about neighbours listening to everything I do. So I live in complete silence and it‚Äôs driving me insane. Help!

_____________

I moved into an apartment a few years ago. And when I first moved in I felt great. I played music a lot and everything else no problem. My neighbours were also a lot noisier, like I could hear my next door neighbours TV, general chatter. It was really nice and homely. 

Anyway, I went through a rough patch and started drinking heavily, during which time I would go on rants & argue with people.. i was very loud & obnoxious. I also fell out with a few of my neighbours, because I was blasting music until early hours and just being an all around prick really. Once I quit drinking I managed to make up with everyone expect my next door neighbour. Deep down I‚Äôm also embarrassed how I was when I was drinking, and I genuinely think some of my neighbours want to listen in on me for entertainment now & probably didn‚Äôt realise I was going through some BS and drinking. 

My issue is that when I do anything I feel like people are listening in, and it‚Äôs like people stop what they‚Äôre doing. The only time I hear ‚Äúnormal‚Äù neighbour sounds is when they don‚Äôt realise I‚Äôm at home. I‚Äôve been living so quietly that my downstairs neighbour commented to me ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre alive then‚Äù sometime last year.. a few months back he mentioned that he can‚Äôt hear anything, but just my footsteps.. and now I‚Äôve resulted to learning how to step silently and placing thick cloth or thick material on where my main walking paths are in the house so I can walk silently. 


Some more examples: 

* I have a loud mechanical typing keyboard, which sounds similar to tapping ‚Äî and my neighbours aren‚Äôt too young, 50+ mainly and I‚Äôm 28,‚Äî & multiple times I‚Äôve heard people tapping back. Not just one tap. But  consecutively, mimicking me typing. I don‚Äôt think they realise it a a keyboard. I‚Äôve resulted to learning how to type without noise and placing a foam pad under my keyboard. I‚Äôve not heard the tapping since. Another example is when I was using a normal computer mouse with a loud click. I would hear a neighbour flicking things on and off asif mimicking me. I‚Äôve resulted to getting a silence mouse ‚Äî now I never hear that.   

* when I want to use my oven or washing machine which both slam into their latch, I hear someone slamming back. 

The one strange thing is, when someone else is with me none of this happens, and actually when other people are here my anxiety completely goes. 

My only remedy is putting my washing mashing on a long wash, or leaving my heating on which makes listening through the walls nearly impossible and masks my noise. The only issue with the heating is, when it‚Äôs pressure is low and on a timer, where it turns on and off frequently it sounds like a tap turning on and off ‚Äî  one of my neighbours started copying it.. until a few days ago where i was speaking to a neighbour and I told him I always have my heating on, he looked a bit puzzle and now I never hear someone copying it. Another remedy was leaving my kitchen fan on, but the noise was unbearable. 



I‚Äôm unable to cook, clean or socialise. I can‚Äôt watch TV out loud or have conversations on the phone. Im also a music recording artist, and I cannot record my vocals. It‚Äôs driving me insane. Im struggling on a incomprehensible level. This is holding me back, and I feel like I‚Äôm trapped when I‚Äôm at home. I can‚Äôt ask my neighbours if they‚Äôre listening to me because no one would admit to that. Today, I was playing music, heard taps on the wall asif someone is listening and it resulted in me playing my music lower and lower until it was all the way down and I snuck into my room silently to lay on my bed in silence & write this reddit post. 

I have told my doctor about this but he doesn‚Äôt really understand, and it‚Äôs something that sounds so ridiculous it‚Äôs hard for me to convey & express. I‚Äôve told my parents. my mum just thinks  I‚Äôm scared of someone & doesn‚Äôt understand.  some friends know, but they can‚Äôt grasp the idea of someone suffering with this so can‚Äôt relate or give advice.  The response is usually them telling me how good their neighbours are. I am currently taking anxiety and depression medication partly as a result of this anxiety I have at home . But the medication is becoming less affective as time goes on & all my doctors wants to do is increase the dose and call it a day. I don‚Äôt hear voices or sign in my head, I‚Äôm not schizophrenic or anything else. 



Help üòî!

Edit ‚Äî also times I feel like I can‚Äôt even breath or chew on food. This isn‚Äôt an issue that I struggle with anywhere else, though I do have social anxiety which can be really bad or non existent depending on my extent of depression. Also, if I‚Äôm wearing headphone then the anxiety and paranoia just goes away",1
Is my life mine?,"A few years ago I started feeling like people hate me, I even heard people in the supermarket saying things like ‚Äúwhy do you shop here? Go someplace else‚Äù or I would park somewhere and the whole parking lot would be empty when I went out, just my car, and there was people inside and it was full when I arrived. Strange things like that kept happening, in the end I went back to my hometown.
But eventually, things started to happen here too. 
People would purposely put me in situations that make me look bad with no way out. 
People would randomly ask me really specific things and kept provoking me to say the wrong things. 
People would know things about me that I wouldn‚Äôt share with anyone.
Friends would invite me to places and then no one in the group would talk to me. 
Class mates would give me all the wrong informations about class and homework. 
Random people in the street, that I‚Äôve never seen before, would say mean things to me. 
The list goes on.
When it all started I was consuming, but I‚Äôve been clean for a few years now and it keeps happening. 
Every time my life is going good and I‚Äôm comfortable, they would turn my life into hell. 
I don‚Äôt trust anyone. I don‚Äôt talk to anyone about this. I‚Äôm just alone, doing what I have to do. 
My psychologist just says it‚Äôs all in my mind and to forget about it.
But I can‚Äôt stop wondering, is it possible that people are controlling my life?",1
Can't tell if I'm being paranoid,"I am pretty active on twitter under a pseudonym. Recently, I've grown incredibly suspicious of a handful of my followers. I feel like two/three in particular are plotting against me. I think one of them is trying to push me out of the fandom space in order to take over my position. I think another one is posting seemingly innocuous tweets where she talks negatively about a character I like, and that these tweets are directed at me in order to make me feel bad because she wants me dead/away. I think a third one is pushing my buttons a little bit. I think people in general are surveiling me because they dislike me and are waiting for an opportunity to attack me. I'm afraid that some people are gonna stalk or doxx me.

Thing is, twitter can be ruthless, so it's not like my fears are completely unfounded. I don't have any definitive proof that these people are out to get me, just a feeling. 

The issue is that it's affecting my real life a lot. I struggle to sleep because I'm so anxious. I have nightmares. I have been growing increasingly fond of alcohol to lessen the feelings. I'm struggling to concentrate on uni. I deactivated my main twitter account and I look absolutely deranged on my private account because I'm talking about how people are out to get me.",1
Looking for potential intruders?,"Due to online school I‚Äôm alone at home. I finished school but when the voices of my teacher and other students didn‚Äôt fill the room anymore I naturally got up, grabbed one of my knifes and checked the entire house for intruders. Carefully checking every room and peeking my head through every doorframe carefully. After my inspections I keep the knife close and go on with my day, but keeping myself aware of my surroundings at all times. Like turning my good ear (hearing loss in other) towards open doors or windows on the ground floor. 

I just stopped to realize what the actual fuck is wrong with this. I‚Äôm constantly in defense mode. Talking to my cat to hear something besides silence. I hate this. But I know the people and creatures I see are just in my head. And concentrating enough they go away. It gets worse at night or in dark rooms. I want to talk to a therapist, but don‚Äôt know how to describe I‚Äôm detail what exactly it is I see or hear or fear. 

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm asking for in this forum. I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs not belonging here. But any advice or tips or just words in general to keep my head busy would be greatly appreciated.",1
Am I becoming paranoid?,"Some background: from about 10-13, my night would go like this. I'd fall asleep at 10pmish and wake up at about 2-3am. Things that wanted to hurt me, I thought, would come through my window and door, so I'd spend whole nights feeling watched by them, checking the window and then the door, before breaking eventually, dashing across the hallway to my parents and saying I had a bad dream (usually had).

Now for the current issue:

- Last night I had an episode like this for the first time in ages - something was watching me wherever I turned, plotting to harm me. My suicide note, from an abandoned one earlier that day, turned up next to me but I'm certain I didn't put in my bed! I only felt safe under the covers.

- On zoom calls, I never believe the camera is off, even when everything indicates it is and will often turn the device away from me. 

- I get the feeling my phone is listening to me - that I'm either still on the phone and people didn't hang up to listen to me or somehow I've been connected without knowing, and have to check the call history all the time. I talk to myself to work through things but don't want people to hear them. I get this feeling only alone.

Is this starting to become serious paranoia?",1
Why do people intentionally clear their throats when I enter the room?,"Long story short, I entered a barber shop that I go to occassionally. All three employees cleared their throats one after another as I entered. I have noticed this frequently throughout my life, and now it is just becoming nerve racking. Is this a social cue for something?",1
i always feel like my ex is out to get me,"My gf and I broke up abt a month ago because of stuff shes done and i cussed at her after my patience ran out. Now i hear from my friends that shes always talking about me, she used to stalk me digitally and even in the real world after i came back from a trip I told her we couldnt meet because i was very ill. She was watching from the distance by tracking me via a airplane app. (and many many more) 
I have blocked her from all my accounts but i cannot shake off the feeling shes still stalking me. I would consider going back with her if she promised to work it out but knowing how she always gives up if things get hard, its borderline impossible that she will change.
Now my comment on a confession subreddit i made about a bot reminding me about a post got downvoted (for no reason since nobody pays attention to those comments)


I always feel like im being watched when i walk down the street or going for a walk with friends.",1
I feel like something is very wrong with my mail,"Recently I've noticed a distinct lack of mail arriving, from junk mail to letters including sensitive documents which where apparently delivered up to 3-4 weeks ago. I tried not to think much of it and thought there must just be delays or the occasional misdelivery but nothing has come in, at all.
I've been dealing with a vindictive ex stalking me for the past 8 months and I'm beginning to really worry if they've set up some sort of mail redirector and found out where I live, they have other people involved with the stalking who can access my information through their job. Something feels very very wrong and I don't know what to do.",1
I feel like my dead abusive father is right outside the door sometimes,"I was abused by my father and most of the time I manage to cope and be alright but lately Ive just been going downhill mental health wise. Hes been dead for about a year and a half and yet I cant shake the feeling he is gonna be there when I wake up, or when I come back from shopping, or that he is right outside the door waiting for me right now

Im currently locked in my bathroom and I know theres other family members outside but I just cant shake off the feeling hes there and waiting for me",1
my job security,"So I‚Äôm not exceptional at my job but I‚Äôm the most senior member and pretty good at it. I feel like my coworkers and some of the customers are colluding against me and trying to get me fired. My living situation is dependent on me having the job or I‚Äôll have to find a new place to stay so I‚Äôm worried about signing this new lease if they‚Äôre just going to fire me and I‚Äôll be kicked out my place shortly after since I wouldn‚Äôt be able to
afford it anymore. I recently went on a date with a customer and I‚Äôm so worried that he hated the date so much that he‚Äôll report me to my boss. We didn‚Äôt do anything other than kissing and some petting and he‚Äôs like 7 years older than me so I let him initiate most of it. I feel like he‚Äôll make up lies about me since I‚Äôve had a teammate of mine do this before and then I learned all of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were spreading horrible rumors about me. I‚Äôm just so scared of my world falling apart because of one date that resulted in me getting unmatched and ghosted",1
Am I being watched / is my apartment being cased for a burglary?,"There is a railing immediately outside my apartment door. Some days when I leave for work there is a single peanut laying on the railing. It started 7 months ago, and has been off and on, but I saw a peanut again this morning and can‚Äôt help but think I‚Äôm being watched. The only other person I know in the apartment complex is an elderly man. I can‚Äôt concentrate at work today because of it.",1
I swear to fucking god there all out for me,Everyone I know my friends even my girlfriend dont actually like me i can tell they want what I can do for them. There all out to get me I just fucking know that they always talk shit behind my back like sneaky rats and plot shit to fuck with me. My girlfriend always comes late for work I see that bitch on the snap map hanging out with guys I dont know and my fucking best friend always acts shitty around me fuck them im quitting my job and im fucking moving without telling anyone so they cant fucking track me,1
"My mom joked about installing hidden cameras in the house to monitor me, and my paranoia's going over the sky","to elaborate on that, my mother is going away for a week, which means being completely on my own for that period. she made a joke about having cameras in the house and having people monitor me. my paranoia had calmed down but after that comment I've been like shit. constantly feeling as if I'm being watched, followed etc. plus I know that when she leaves the very first thing I'm gonna do is search the house for any cameras hidden.",1
Help?,"i feel like people will be coming in my house to take me soon,  i feel like they‚Äôre already outside my house and are waiting to get  me once i come out. i have an anxiety disorder and i don‚Äôt know  if  paranoia is from that. if it‚Äôs not, what could it be? i‚Äôve been in this state for 3 years and i‚Äôm scared everyday.",1
bad paranoia episode,I'm to the point where I feel like I'm not allowed to feel good at all by any means and every time I even get turned on I feel like the world shames me and the only thing to do to make it stop is to stab or hurt myself in some sort of way for it to stop.,1
Apparently I look sad all the time,So I‚Äôve been told i look sad multiple time in the past when I‚Äôve been completely fine. Now that we don‚Äôt have to wear masks to school anymore I feel so paranoid that students and teachers think I look sad.,1
Can people read my mind?,"I'm extremely paranoid that people can read my mind. I love daydreaming but take it too far sometimes, I always fear people are reading my mind, or my thoughts are being broadcasted, or something else. It causes major distress. I've thought it may be because of my OCD, but wtf, can people read my mind? Be honest please. I'm scared some special person has the ability to read my mind. It's terrifying, exhausting and drains my mental energy.",1
What disorder or mental illness is paranoia linked to?,"When consulting a psychologist and suffer from paranoia, what may I get diagnosed as?",1
Is this a sign of paranoia?,"I'm dog/house sitting right now for a couple of houses and I have a friend over. He started to say a distasteful joke, and I told him to keep it down because I get anxiety that these people I house/pet sit for bug the house to listen to me. I said it with full seriousness and he was confused. I thought he'd understand because he also has anxiety. He said he's never experienced that. It's like I just fully believe that bugs are in the house, because I'm so terrified that it's true. I just don't usually get a chance to also say ""but that's a very unlikely situation"" so I just go on believing that there's bugs. I guess I'm still just concerned about it. I thought this was a normal anxiety thing. Is it more than just regular anxiety?",1
People following me,"Good day everyone,

Firstly, im a diagnosed schizophrenic. My problem is that every couple years i relapse by noticing people following me. Its very suttle like they will bump into me at several places while im in town or be at places already when i go there, theyll make themselves known to me by smiling at me or some other small cue.

Sometimes its cars as well, where il notice the same car driving by my house and then notice again on my holidays.

Has anyone any tips out there on how not to notice these patterns or coincidences? It makes me believe people are really following me. Im on meds and in therapy just reaching out to see if anyone knows any tips",1
Is this normal or is it serious paranoia?,"I‚Äôm so worried for my family. I am constantly worrying that something bad has happened to them. I have to constantly check up on them to ease my mind. When my mom is gone for longer than expected I instantly assume the worst. I have done that for my whole life (which isn‚Äôt very long considering I‚Äôm 16). I‚Äôve always worried that my youngest sister just isn‚Äôt going to wake up one day or that she‚Äôll get seriously injured. I can‚Äôt even play with her because while we are I‚Äôll instantly assume im going to hurt her, or she‚Äôll trip on something and get a head injury, or worse. I don‚Äôt know if this is normal to worry so much but it‚Äôs terrifying having these thoughts constantly running through my head.",1
Feels like my life is programmed to die early. Not sure what to do with the rest of my life,"Was standing for about 10 minutes today and then my vision faded until I couldn't see anything. My chest felt tired and out of breath, I felt forced to sit down before I pass out. My hearing also felt like it was fading, like something was blocking my ears but there was nothing. 

About a minute after sitting, I regained vision but still felt weak for some reason.. Honestly don't think I have much time left if I can barely stand in one spot for 10 minutes... I feel so pathetic.

Because of this, I also feel the need to do something I wanted to do but earlier.. Something like visiting a different state/ country to see and do macrophotography of some exotic insects. Maybe a little film or something. I also wanted to do some studies. I was saving up for a house but I don't know anymore... I don't think my major in college will suit me anymore since it requires a lot of standing for extended periods of time so I may have to change that too..",1
i can't really be going crazy,i feel like everyone is playing some big game on me and its making me so insecure.

Am I going crazy or are these people really like this,"At my new job last Friday the boss got burgers for everyone, I ate that shit so fast right in front of them, no one else really picked at theirs. I‚Äôm suspicious that they may have tried to poison my burger? 

When I left yesterday to go home, the other guy said ‚Äútake care‚Äù. Well this morning, Wednesday, I had really high blood pressure and dizziness and went in to get checked out. they prescribed beta blockers. When I picked up the meds, On the pamphlet in big ass letters is ‚Äútake care‚Äù. 

I suspect there is a plan at the new place I work at to kill me. Probably an extension of some bigger plan from some hardcore criminals that I got too close with because I liked skating at the skatepark, and now they have to extend their arms out to people I know to try and end me. 

I don‚Äôt see why they would actually hire me, I‚Äôm such an undesirable person to be around. Boss man said ‚Äúalright be careful with this let‚Äôs make sure nobody gets‚Ä¶. Toxified‚Äù about some other shit. 

Obviously a hint that they made me sick on purpose. 

And the best part is my mom said she‚Äôs ‚Äúin heart surgery‚Äù the second I text her about it. She is definitely also in on it. Wish it was harder to believe this shit is just happening right in front of my eyes. Everyone around me really is in on a plot to kill me for I don‚Äôt know what. Dirty lying fuckers. 

Do you think this sounds plausible?",1
I don‚Äôt trust anyone.,"I don‚Äôt trust anyone, my parents are mentally abusive and keep gaslighting me especially of lately, my therapist has started making less and less sense, my girlfriend probably doesn‚Äôt care about me, one of my friends is delusional and mentally ill, another friend is autistic and is only capable of talking about movies and video games, and while I used to like talking about that I have other things going on but he shys away from those conversations, my last friend is never available to talk at all, I need to cut everyone out of my life and isolate.",1
the dark,"So I've always kind of had a fear of the dark as a kid. I think everybody has at some point? Maybe not? I'm not so sure.

But recently, within the last 6months, I've been completely and utterly terrified of the dark.

When I get home from work past midnight, I triple check outside my car, just to make sure nothing is waiting for me to get out.  When I'm home and it's also past midnight, and when my roommate is already asleep, I can barely leave my room to go to the bathroom because the whole house is completely dark. I feel so immensely paranoid that someone has broken in and is waiting to kill me. 

We DO have an alarm system, so I try to remind myself that nothing will happen if it doesn't go off. That it's completely safe because I'm guarded by this very expensive system. And my very kind roommate recently got night lights in the kitchen, living room, office, and even the bathrooms so I don't feel so scared. 

But even then, I still feel like it's not enough. Someone or something is actively tryna to get me. Sometimes I hear shit around the house, like a rustle or someone outside talking and I get so frightened I start triple checking if everything is locked and the system is on. 

I get so paranoid from the dark that I keep my closet closed and my windows covered up completely with tapestries. I lock my bedroom door, and keep the lights on in my bedroom while I sleep. I actually got curtains for my bathroom window (even though it's painted glass and you can barely see anything out of it) and keep it shut at all times. I cannot even stand the idea of having my completely dark with just a tiny night light. Like I need to be able to see every corner of my room. Sometimes when I'm EXTRA paranoid, I keep my laptop at a low volume so i don't hear anything else but a video playing or something. 

I even got a big ol dog to keep me company at night when I feel so paranoid.

It's starting to really affect me. I cannot do anything at night without feeling like someone or something is watching me. I can't even imagine going to late night parties. It mortifies me to say the least. I just CANT do it.

I hope someone can relate to this. Please tell me I'm not going crazy for having this extreme fear/paranoia of the dark.",1
Teenage paranoia,"I‚Äôve always been a paranoid person ever since I was a kid but In recent months life‚Äôs been unbearable I‚Äôve been showering with the curtain open, sleeping with no curtains when I sleep at all with all the lights on and I‚Äôve been convincing myself I‚Äôm hearing/seeing things and life just doesn‚Äôt feel real anymore and I don‚Äôt know what to do..",1
What the fuck is wrong with me,"I used to be paranoid about things once in awhile, nothing major probably just something stupid . 

For the past couple of months I‚Äôve been paranoid its been non stop and its driving me crazy. I cant sleep at night, without thinking someone is going to break into my house shoot me in the head and harm the rest of my family. I have no reason to think that why the fuck am i thinking that.

If my parents arent back at their regular time after work it triggers it. Every little thing just triggers me being paranoid, noises and people.  Its been so bad its hard to function in my daily life. I know its bad but fuck man it‚Äôs gotten to a point where i sleep with a knife. 

I dont do drugs or drink or anything to make me feel the way i do. Its like i have the feeling of impending dooming over me 24/7.",1

Fear of laughter,"I fear that people are secretly watching me, that there are hidden cameras installed in my room, and that someone is livestreaming me and laughing at me. People upstaitrs are constantly laughing when I come in my room from uni. They stay up almost all night. It drives me insane, makes me obsessively check my room for cameras, but of course I can't find any. I know that this all sounds completly ridiculous and that nobody will install any hidden cameras or have any intersest in watching me. I've tried to explain this to myself a million times already, but the thoughts are still there and they're getting worse. If somebody can relate to this, what can you do to get rid of these thoughts? (I cant afford therapy right now, maybe there is some way to cope?)",1

I fucked up big time and now my mind is consumed by violence and I just want to make it all go away," I don't know what happened to me. As a teenager, I was wild.. I started doing meth when I was 13 and was on and off til I was 17. I'm sure that has taken a huge role on my mental health now. But I was soooo care free. I used to hitch hike all around North America. Meet new people, sleep with strangers. (Not just sexually, but actually sleep with them in many different situations.) Then when I was 21, I started doing heroin, which then lead to fentanyl. That's truly what ruined my life. I had always been a functional alcoholic/drug addict until I did opiates. I went through a lot of pretty traumatic shit thanks to my fentanyl addiction. My husband and I lived with a severely psychopathic and abusive dealer for a long time. We watched people dying in front of us. We were also homeless for a long time and dealing with the gangs and being robbed and stabbings and stuff was obviously difficult. But it never truly phased me. Maybe because all I was thinking about was dope, idk. My husband went into the hospital for a week and I was on the streets by myself. That was the worst part, shit got really bad when I was alone. There's a lot of things I don't talk about, and definitely will never tell my husband because I don't need him to feel guilty because he couldn't protect me or whatever while he was literally on his death bed. Anyway, we got clean like over 3 years ago. I don't know what the fuck happened to me because ever since we got clean, I've been going through phases of extreme paranoia. No, it's not like day 6 of a meth binge where I think the shadow people are stalking me. I'm scared of real life shit and it's becoming crippling. I feel like every person alive is out to get me. Unless I know them well. I'm convinced that most people are violent and sociopathic and sadistic. The paranoia I feel in public is overwhelming but here's the stupid part - 

I did something I never should have done. See, I've always had this irrational fear of war, bombs, jihadists, religious extremists of any sort, neo nazis, acts of terrorism. Sometimes I'd play into that fear by watching war movies or documentaries that give me pretty severe anxiety and typically lead to nightmares. I don't know why I do it. I just wanted to feel afraid, but it was never as bad as it is now. Anyway, a few months ago, my 15 year old brother in law asked me if I'd ever heard of ""run the gauntlet. "" I said no, and he showed me one of the videos from it. It was a video of a man being beheaded, I think by some cartel members. About halfway through, I vomited and I was really upset. I don't know why the fuck I did this, but after that, I started seeking out gore websites. I'd specifically look up videos of murder or violence in general. Not because I enjoyed it, but because it was making me sick with anxiety and for some reason, I've always done this shit to myself. It's why I used to watch war movies. I would literally watch these videos of people being murdered and I've sobbed, hyperventilated, thrown up, and then continued watching. I realize how fucked up this all sounds. Well, I've stepped away from the gore videos because it was all just too much. But now my paranoia is at an all time high. I'm scared. All day, every day. I was shoveling snow at work yesterday, and every single car that drove past, I'd run and hide behind my car because I'm scared they'll drive by and shoot me. Or see me and get out and try to hurt me. Every time I go to get in my car, I get sick with fear that someone is in the backseat waiting for me. I try to take my dogs for walks and when I walk past other people, I specifically move far away when we pass each other in case they try to stab me. I don't go to any ATM's anymore, I have to have my husband do it, because I'm scared someone will be waiting for me to pull my cash out so they can rob me. When I'm in stores or restaurants, I start to freak out because I assume someone in there is going to pull a gun and shoot the place up. I wasn't going to admit this, but I literally am considering getting a helmet to start wearing in case someone shoots at me, I want my head to be as protected as possible. Needless to say, my time in public is extremely limited. I hardly go anywhere unless it's work. Which has become torture because I'm alone for most of my shift. I pretty much stay home now because leaving my house is a fucking massive challenge. I feel defeated. I'm so fucking over-stimulated because of all the anxiety and paranoia. I wish I never discovered those videos. I feel like they literally traumatized me, which sounds ridiculous, like.. How could a video traumatize someone? But it's just what I'm feeling. When I pass by people, I start having images in my head of the videos but it's my face on the people being murdered. It's like it happened to me. I already struggle with flashbacks from my fentanyl days, and these videos are just like that. I imagine people doing things to me that have never happened to me, just like a flashback. I get stuck in my head. I panic. I don't know what to do. I fucked up big time watching those videos. I now know how truly easy it is for people to murder and hurt others. Not just easy, but it's so much more normal and common than I realized. I just don't know what to do, I need help because I'm telling you, I cannot go on living this way for much longer.",1
Paranoia is becoming overwhelming,"TW Ed behavior

I‚Äôve always had a paranoia problem especially with food. Like thinking it‚Äôs been poisoned or tampered with. Usually I just avoid food that looks strange or eat small bites of food. But I‚Äôve started a really bad habit very recently of throwing up instead. I‚Äôll try to force myself to eat food that makes me nervous so I have energy but then get so worried I feel like I have no other choice than to make myself vomit so I do. It‚Äôs been even more draining than avoiding food. I‚Äôm not sure how to stop myself so if anyone has any advice if you‚Äôve dealt with something similar? Im desperate.

My Paranoia is Controlling My Life,"TW: S/A mentioned 

I‚Äôve had paranoia problems since I was a kid. One profound example I can remember is that I would apologize when accidentally bumping into or hitting inanimate objects like walls or my toys. I did this because I thought they would come to life and hurt me. 

It died down for a while until about a few months to a year ago. So, for years, my parents touched me inappropriately without my consent(like my boobs, butt, etc). I would tell them to stop as a teenager after I learned I could say no to them, but they got mad and continued anyway. It was really traumatic and my mind still feels messed up about it. A year ago, I started getting paranoid and fearing that I‚Äôll be like them in the future. I didn‚Äôt have this fear until I learned that most criminals become who they are because of traumatic moments. Ever since then, I‚Äôve been super paranoid and my rationality is going crazy because I keep second guessing my thoughts. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I need some advice please.

Thanks in advance for replies.",1
Paranoia getting really bad as I get older,"Don‚Äôt worry not a cause of delusion yet still have plenty off of stability for a lack of a better term to avoid being crippled by it for now, just more of a hindrance thats making my life hard.

But speed ahead , I‚Äôve learned to hide it better, feared nobody liked me in school, feared the teachers where failing me on purpose 

It‚Äôs kind of annoying when some of the fears comes true but that‚Äôs life 

I know this sounds like a complete contradiction but I always had somebody take me under their wing and look out from me from bullies, till they became the bullies to a lesser extent, always arse of the joke and such

But I know this is not a therapy session so I skip kinda too now. 

I think all my friends are going to turn on me to beat me up , this actually happened once and it was a fear I had before that 

I don‚Äôt have a job because I‚Äôm terrified I fear it‚Äôs not for me or I‚Äôm going to get fired 

Which both happened, I have trouble with cognition and coordination since a child 

I know you people aren‚Äôt licensed therapist but how do I go about addressing this before it gets too deep ?

Feels like everyone is better than me,"I don't really know if this counts as paranoia, everyone I know says it is, but I'll let you guys judge.
Anyway, the title says it all: I feel like everyone is better than me. Always.
Am I talking to someone I just met? He's better than me. My girlfriend is talking to another person we just knew? He's better than me and in this case he might potentially ""steal"" her from me.
When I feel this is happening and I'm in a group, i often isolate myself by using my phone or doing whatever.
When I start feeling useless and uninteresting, I become a passive piece of the wallpaper.
I talk about this with my girlfriend, she get angry and says I need to stop thinking these things; I talk with my mother, she'll get angry too saying I need to shut up and that it is all in my mind.

How do I stop thinking this? I'm so paranoid...,"idk where else to post this. 

i have anxiety and depression but i firmly believe i have paranoia and panic as well...

a few days ago, my parents had their friends over. and whenever we have guests over, i have to clean my bathroom because thats the one guests use.

but even though i know this shit is completely irrational, i cant stop feeling paranoid about it. for context, i use summers eve, a soap specifically for the vaginal area. idk how or where i came up with this paranoid thought, but i keep thinking ""what if one of my dads friends jacked off in my bathroom and put their c\*m in the summerseve bottle?"" and then i started getting paranoid thoughts about being magically pregnant from it.

i am fighting my brain on this. each nnight when i take a shower, i pour a lot of the soap out and examine it to show myself ""see, u're being paranoid and delusional. it's not true. u're not magically pregnant."" 

but even though i reassure myself every day by trying to prove to myself its not possible or real, i STILL get the paranoid thoughts that INSIST it's real.

idk who to fucking talk to about this because this irrational fear and thougth is SO Fucking strange and totally wacko. i might be scared of older men or something. idk why else i would be so distrustful of my dads friends...

idk how to make it stop. i've tried over and over to tell myself ""it's not possible. look, ur soap looks normal. it's fine."" 

and i KNOW that the possibilty of getting pregnant from rubbing that stuff on the outter area around ur vagina is slim to none...but STILL.

Anybody go back and forth between neutral/hating christians and being convinced that the liberal media/government has targeted them specifically to brainwash them into working for satan and causing themselves and others to go to hell?,"I have begun to think that my anti christian beliefs have been being programmed into me from the age of 10 through a government mind control program that targetted me specifically because my mother was a very good christian very religious went to church every sunday didn't drink no sex outside of marriage didn't dress like a man didn't spare the rod (Though this one is somewhat arguable sometimes I think I have issues because she never properly beat me with a paddle/branch/didn't put enough force into it. As much as I dislike my father I probably would have turned out better had I lived with him and I believe my brain knows this.)anyway I am convinced the government was afraid of the power this may have given me had my mindset been correct. I believe there have likely been multiple people that would have risen up and made america believe in god again that the government has targeted to turn them into the opposite, typically the children of very religious people or pastors.  Recently however I have begun to realize what they have been doing to me for 10 years- it wasn't the devil. It was the government, though not much of a different. For this reason they have ramped up their interference and are making their presence KNOWN to me.",1

Paranoia abt Serial killers..,"When I was a child my mom would tell me those stories abt murder cases/serial killers and I think it kinda traumatised me because I was really young and she did this for some years. It was to tell me to be careful but I think I am really TOO careful and I really want to change.
 Since I have ADHD I was wondering if there was a link too..

In middle school I used to go to school with a knife or a fork in my pocket (a fork because I knew carrying a knife could get me into troubles). I did it less often in HS and only sometimes now in uni, when I know I will come back late. This is not bcz I'm less scared but bcz I know how weird I would seem if people saw me with a knife of fork. I sleep with a knife next to my bed at night (again since at least middle school). 

I experience nightmares of being chased extremely often.. Usually I wake up when the person who is chasing me (to kill me) catch me (so I don't experience the killing/pain. It's like when they catch me I die so I'm waking up). Sometimes I know the face/backstory of those killers (which are made up) and sometimes I don't see them at all, I just know they're chasing me. When I turn back I know they're here and I die without seeing their faces. When I'm outside, especially at night, I always get paranoid about killers. Every person (more like every man even if I can get suspicious of women too but it's much more rare) becomes a potential serial killer to me and I hurry home. I can have very short hallucinations of people (mostly killers) because I'm scanning everywhere in alert mode. Those hallucinations are like 1 second long or less so it's not really serious. Specifically, my worst fear is someone/ a serial killer coming to kill me at night in my room. I can become very suspicious at night alone in my room for no reason. I imagine that someone is trying to break in into my room, or is on the roof of the building and will try to come through the window. It gets me in very unpleasant states where I feel almost dizzy, it's like the world suddenly seem so suspicious and scary. Like if my room completely changed, there is a filter that changes it and now every furniture becomes unfamiliar to me, my whole environment becomes threatening and I have this irrational fear that someone is going to come in at any moment to kill me so I can't sleep. 

More than death, I'm afraid of suffering, being tortured or raped. Sometimes I feel so bad I think I want to die already, kill myself because then Im sure I will never experience this and I will stop feeling so scared and anxious. Which makes no sense bcz it means that I'm so afraid of death that I want to die?? (I think the issue is that I'm afraid of someone else killing me, not dying).

 My problem is that I'm nurturing this irrational fear by watching true crime videos. I know I'm harming myself when I do this because I will feel so bad for days, weeks, months afterwards! But I just can't stop.. I always end up watching one again. I think that I watch it because I imagine the situation and it's like  a simulation, what to do if I'm in the same situation.

 Also I'm thinking ""I've been too relaxed lately, I need to remind myself how scary this world is, how there are crazy people"". It's almost like punishing myself for being to carefree/not being paranoid ""like I should"". And I guess those videos can also be oddly entertaining/thrilling and give me very strong feelings I cannot get in my every day life. I want to change but at the same time I don't want to because I feel like it would be a bad thing, that I will be killed and think ""you see? You shouldn't have stopped being cautious. Serves you right.""(more like paranoid..). I have this irrational feeling that one day a serial killer will try to kill me, as if it was my destiny..

 I'm writing this bcz my sister was scolding me saying that I should stop being paranoid abt this, that it will never happen.. because two days ago I read the biography of a very famous serial killer on Wikipedia and I felt very scared. This morning I woke up screaming ""nooo"" because I felt very strong pain in my nightmare and felt this pain while waking up. I went to the toilets to uuuh let it all go and my stomach hurted for 1 hour making weird noises. For the first time in my dream I actually experienced being killed with the killer stabbing me repeatedly in the stomach.

I also feel like this is preventing me from trusting men.

My tutors are expecting me to speak in class and they speak sarcastically when I don't, i am having very bad anxiety and I can't even look at tutors and classmates properly. Every class is like torture to me. I fear my classmates may report my avoidance of eye contact as bullying them. I think that my classmates not coming to class is because they think I'm bullying them. And I blame myself and I feel guilty and feel maybe I shouldn't come to class anymore.

Do I need medication?,"I've been dealing with this weird paranoia shit since I had a psychotic break and attempted suicide. It got really bad when I was in a psych hospital for 2 1/2 weeks, everyone around me knowing whats going in my mind(literally i heared people call out my thoughts), they all seemed like actors sent from heaven, hell, or the government, feel like I'm stuck in purgatory, etc.. Recently these coincidence instances started coming up again( my family giving up on me when I thought I was in the right, impossible mental illness trauma i can't overcome, or feeling like I'm going insane) this has been going on for about a couple hours now and I don't think it will last as long as it did before (months long) but how will I know this won't come up again? It feels easier to deal with but still feels like torture. Would you recommend medication? I took seroquel, lithium, and an injection before but went off because of the sheer extreme torture akathisia.

I‚Äôm scared of being watched,"I‚Äôm constantly scared that I‚Äôm being watched through cameras through mirrors or lights. I even get scared of a tiny microscopic cameras in my room. Heck, I get scared of changing in front of my pets bc I think they might be robots or their eyes are connected to a screen and someone has footage of my naked body. I‚Äôm so paranoid about using public bathrooms because I‚Äôm scared there are cameras behind the mirrors or in those flood lights or whatever. I‚Äôve been paranoid about that since I was around 4. My dad‚Äôs family used to have a restaurant and I asked him about the flood lights and I think he jokingly said it was a camera. Ever since, I‚Äôve never been comfortable if one is in the bathroom. I‚Äôm also paranoid about going to my both of my sisters homes and scared there are cameras behind their mirrors. I also can‚Äôt sleep easily bc I‚Äôm constantly checking over my shoulder bc I feel watched. I‚Äôm also scared everyone talks behind my back and I feel like everyone thinks I‚Äôm a horrible person. I don‚Äôt know what to do and who to talk to. I don‚Äôt know how to reach out for help bc this is so draining living like this.

Edit: I also wanted to mention that I trust almost no one. I love my family and friends so much but I never let my guard down bc I feel like they‚Äôre gonna switch one day. I love my stepdad to death and he‚Äôs such a great role model and he loves my mom dearly but sometimes I feel scared he‚Äôs gonna hurt my mom or me one day.

I have this intense desire to somehow get ahold of people's phones, or facebook accounts, to see the \*proof\* that they're talking about me.

paranoia/psychosis OR ptsd related paranoia,"for over 10 years i have gotten increasingly more paranoid. it has ALWAYS been about being kidnapped (from the street/my home/anywhere) or being attacked in my own home/bedroom. i have no ptsd or trauma related to these topics. my trauma is mostly s*a* related + the paranoia started years PRIOR to any of those. 

i had a psychotic break in summer 2020 and since then, i have been trying to regularly take an antipsychotic. the dr decided it was stress-induced psychosis but put on my chart MDD w psychotic features.

in summer 2021, i experienced more psychosis. i was in rehab when it began. it was NOT drug induced (ruled out as i was over 1 month clean at induction). i couldn‚Äôt eat, drink, take meds, etc. it ended with what my team classified as a possible hypomanic episode. and then i fell into a depressive episode for 3 months. that ended with another possible hypomanic episode.

now we are here. in nov 2021 i went back to shelter (a shelter hotel tho) because of abuse. i was experiencing low-moderate levels of paranoia around kidnapping/attacks. i have my own room + a key card that only staff also have + my door has a deadbolt. my room should feel safe. but as of mid December 2021-NOW (feb 8 2022) i am at the point where i am going 3-5 days with no sleep, only able to sleep during the morning hours (7AM-2PM) to feel safe, being convinced people are waiting for me to fall asleep so they can attack, checking all spaces people could hide/fit, calling out to the people ‚Äúin my room‚Äù, running out crying because they know i‚Äôm on to them, having shelter staff come check my room multiple times a night even though i haven‚Äôt slept/left/no one has entered for hours, etc. 

it‚Äôs getting out of control. and then this week my psych casually stated that it was probably all just ptsd related ???? i feel very dismissed. i‚Äôm barely functioning and that‚Äôs it? i can barely leave my hotel room but i also spend basically 24/7 trying to figure iout if someone is there too. 

i‚Äôve been hallucinating & dissociating too. it‚Äôs terrifying.

Suggestions for dealing with paranoia? Struggling.,"I‚Äôve been struggling with paranoia and anxious thoughts since I had a major mental health episode last year. Long story short I stopped talking to a bunch of people and withdrew socially.

I have these thoughts that people I was friends with in the past are making fun of me and mocking me, posting about me, relaying screenshots between each other about me, etc. I have had this happen to me before so it‚Äôs something that makes me quite anxious. I have paranoia about being hacked/having my info leaked too.

I also get worried people try to ‚Äòscope me out‚Äô and say things that trigger me and then make judgments on my character based on how I respond, and use the way I respond as proof of my character. I‚Äôve had people bring up words/phrases from music I like and had them mirror it back to me and the tone of it has felt like they‚Äôre trying to send me a message/make me reflect. I keep making connections, linking up conversations, words/phrases mentioned, and trying to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô the link.

It‚Äôs exhausting.

It‚Äôs to the point that I have these thoughts for hours each day, thinking about past conversations and interactions. It‚Äôs pretty rough and I‚Äôm really sick of it.

Does anyone have tips/suggestions for how to gain some distance from these thoughts, address these thoughts, or shift the pattern somehow? Thanks!",1
I'm a psychotic pos.,"So I just wan a throw out there that I literally have the worst episodes known to fucking man. I am also bipolar and  manic depressive. This makes for quite the chemical cocktail. Usually I'm a complete pushover and give give give til it breaks me. But as soon as I get a hard emotional breakdown. That anger turns into rage and a type of anger that lashes out at every single  person around me. I once punched my husband my brother and my mother over the course of 20 minutes. I'm impossible to talk to when I get like this and no matter what ur opinion doesn't mean jack shit to me. I'll punch, bite, kick and scream.  Eventually I reach regret but sometimes it takes more than a year to fully settle In. I can't stand it when I'm victimized.",1
"Man, i'm even scared posting this","I've had this lingering feeling in the back of my mind that I'm like.. an operative or something? There's been a lot of odd things through my life. Periods I don't remember and my mom said there were, at certain points, groups of people or sometimes individuals that would show up only when I was with her and never when she was alone. I've had people come into my life every other time I've come close to figuring this out that are a little *too* perfect to the situation I'm experiencing. Similar enough to me that they calm me down and throw me off. People that have given me psychedelics and encouraged me to spill lots of deep memories often deflecting when I asked them the same question. Sometimes those were the same people. I've been convinced at times that romantic partners of mine that just had randomly moved to the city were intended to keep tabs on me and two of them have even admitted it, albeit casually, almost as if to indicate I couldn't stop it if I tried. 


My last phone, I got calls periodically from different numbers but the same area code and I wouldn't answer because why would I? They left me voicemails where a female sounding robotic voice would start reading off numbers and at the end it would say thank you. Eventually I decided the calls needed some basic exploration and I searched the area code. 

Washington D.C. every one of them. 

Next day, you know what happens? My partner persuaded me to get a new phone. I don't know where my old one ended up. 

I don't know. I want answers but I don't know how to get them. I fully expect someone new to dip into my life tomorrow out of nowhere or tonight I might be swept up. 

I don't think I'll ever let it go. Sometimes it becomes less stressing, because what am I going to do about it right? But it's always in my mind somewhere. Has been for years.",1

Zoom culture is increasing my paranoia,"When times get tough and my world narrows, I know it‚Äôs time to fight back.

Along the way, I‚Äôm constantly searching for ways to help myself get through the struggle I have with my perception of what people are thinking of me. Especially the work life.

Navigating through the minefield of paranoia has always been a struggle but I have always found a way back to a place where I forget that paranoia has a strangle hold of my happiness. Then, not before long, the cycle starts all over and I‚Äôm once again at it‚Äôs mercy. My self perception and paranoia are happy to see each other to pick up where they have left off.

I am paranoid my girlfriend will abuse me,"I was cheated oo and abused in the last relationships by two exes. One was bipolar or borderline and the other was a narcissist.

After the narcissist came my actual girlfriend and so i had no time to deal with my emotions and immediately i was quite distant with her because of my anxiety. But she understood and tried anyway because when i was strange she asked me to explain why and I could do that. 

Now after months we are together and we start living together as well. Now she is far from since 2 weeks for reasons different than us and so we text and we call each other. This though meant that we were very stressed and we fought a lot. Either we were sexting, or talking about stuff or having discussions.

Discussion were started by both of us. The last though was a bit strange on her part and she was a bit aggressive. She didn't insult or anything, just aggressive.

That being aggressive reminded me of my abusive ex and made me go in a fear state.

She recognized almost immediately like an hour after the fight that her ways of communicating was shit (after i said its not okay to be that aggressive when i was trying to give my reasons calmly and she could not understand)

But after that i entered a paranoia state were i had to prove she was or she wasn't borderline.

That has been very stressing and sometimes i wake up at night being anxious and tense about that thinking about scenario were it will get worse and that she's actually BPD and she will abuse me and the more i read about BPD the more i get anxious.",1
A short story of how I was visited by panic attacks + delusional paranoia and overcome it.," Hello redditors, I came here to share a story that might be of some benefit for people like us. Several years ago, I started univer-isty in a town far away from my home town, because I hated living with my parents, even though I have two little brothers that I love very dearly and enjoy being around them.

So my university started with a lot of excitement and sense of freedom, I was going to university to party and have fun, studying was the last think on my list; I was very anxious, a virgin, no friends in the new town, very self-conscious, I felt ugly and had a generally bad attitude towards myself. So with this shitty baggage, I was drinking multiple times a week partying as much as I can and making as many friends as possible. I was basically playing the popularity game, yet at the same time avoiding all of my insecurities and not working on any of them, since I hated myself there was no room for the thoughts to fix them. Not long after drugs came into the picture and I was ""testing"" all the different drugs a student could try, psychadelics were my favorite, since they take you to a different dimension far from reality. Once in a while when I would feel very down, I'd go back to my mothers house and spend a few weeks with my brothers and that seem to recover me for the time being.

After doing this for about 9-12 months, having very little emotional or mental idea of some sort of breakdown, that is soon to happen, I just continued. Not long after about a year into, I woke up one morning, just a usual day but I was feeling like something big was missing on the inside, I litterally could feel a massive void inside of me, like my soul/being was missing. Really weird and scary feeling that I again tried to escape, by being ""productive"" to keep my mind off it. Same night, as I am going to bed to lay there, I am left with that feeling inside and if I look into it, I have an instant panic attack, where my brain is telling me that I will die if I continue, so I stop and shake uncontrollably for a few hours, I call myself an ambulance because I'm not sure what is going on, for some reason I get distracted and forget that I had an ambulance coming in so I miss it. Next day it's exactly the same and for the next two weeks my days look completely exact, I feel like I'm running away from someone for the whole day and at night time I shake uncontrollably for hours, sweating and feeling like my heart will stop any minute.

I wanted it to stop.

So I seeked help and found help in books, within the next few weeks I read like 8 books on emotions, depression, fear, mindfullness, budism, stoicism. I was applying all the practises that were being recommended, basically taking non-traditional health path. Within a month I was meditating, journaling and observing myself. During that time I gathered some courage to look at this void of a feeling that I am overwhelmed by. My brain is going crazy as I am taking my attention toward that feeling, I am hearing loud hallucinations, of a siren of some sort, loud alarms ringing in my ears, I am seeing exclamation marks in my mind eye, warning signs and everything else my paranoic brain could come up with and simply decided to laugh at it, which made me trancend it immediately it was almost shut down by my attitude towards it. Yet there was still the feeling in my body, as I sank my attention into it, the feeling was growing and it was taking over my body, I was feeling cold, empty and dead. This feeling was growing and consuming my body, I felt like I'm either going unconcious or dying. Because I was in my bed, I knew that I couldn't die just like that and as the feeling was taking my body into death, I allowed it. I was okay to die there and then, laying in bed. As I accepted my death, the void feeling that was in my body, instanly switched to a feeling of ecstasy, please kind in mind that I was sober for a month now and feeling of ecstasy in your body is not something that you feel every day. As this feeling exploded in my body, I was seeing angels in my mind eye, probably due to christian culture I was raised in, my mind symbolised, love and peace in that imagery.

After this event the feeling of a void was gone, never to be seen again and with it, the paranoia and panic attacks dissapeared from my life. I felt at peace with myself for the next 3 months and then old thought patterns came back, the hateful ones toward myself. When I realised that these thoughts and beliefs about myself were the root of the problem, I started addressing them one by one, every single day for the next year, I went sober for a whole year, no alco nothing. Everything I became aware of a pattern in my mind that I didn't like, I would take a journal, question my assumtions and beliefs, write them out on paper, and make for and against argument on them, review the experience that caused that belief and try to view it from a different perspective, one that isn't as damaging to me. Usually it meant that some people needed to hear something from me and some difficult conversations were held to settle old issues, sometimes it was so easy that I simply got emotional as a kind and assumed the worst and ended up believing it.

Now 3 years later I am mentally in the right place at the right time, I know what is important to me, I live my life by my own rules. I got a girlfriend, a job I like, an apartment, a new car, I eat what I want, I go on vacations several times a year, I been helping a few friends with their mental health for the past few years, recommending books and ideas, in the end it comes down to if we want to solve the problem and it comes from an honset and genuine place inside of us, if we do, we find a way to do it. Sometimes it means confessing something to a stranged or a friend, and them listening to you is really enough to let go on the situation. So my fellow redditors, if any of you feel like you want to talk, dm me and we can talk about it, playing a game or doing whatever.",1

"Does anyone else get so exhausted they just say ‚Äúyep, someone is watching me‚Äù and then go about their business?","Ok, so I haven‚Äôt ever actually gone this in depth explaining what I experience. Like ever. And it might seem weird that I would feel comfortable telling strangers on the internet, but that‚Äôs just where I‚Äôm at right now. 

Ever since I was a kid, I have felt like someone could see me. Like all the time. Not necessarily in a malicious out to get me way, just like someone could always see me. And what‚Äôs weird is that it‚Äôs not super specific or thinking there is a specific motive. And what‚Äôs even weirder is that it‚Äôs usually characters of a show or movie I just watched. That‚Äôs the most embarrassing part. Because I KNOW they aren‚Äôt real people. So when I dispute the cognitive distortion, my stupid brain switches it to the actor that can see me. 

I‚Äôm also pretty sure someone in the government can see everything electronically that I do and is judging me constantly to the point where most of the time I can‚Äôt write in a word document, it has to be by hand if I‚Äôm writing notes or journaling. 

And all of this is exhausting. So sometimes I will get to the point where I just say ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù and go about my day. Or I might explain what I‚Äôm doing because I don‚Äôt want to be misunderstood by whoever can see me. 

All while being fully aware that it‚Äôs extremely likely no one freaking cares or is watching me. Like I‚Äôm delusional enough for it to affect my actions, but not so much that I would argue for it being reality. Like I know it‚Äôs not real.

I check my phone at the same increments of time-- 10:XX, 8:XX, 3:XX, a lot of times in order too, 5:XX, 6:XX, 7:XX, 8:XX, EVERY HOUR IN A ROW like that, and im not on my phone checking the time either, ill go downstairs, come back up and bam, 8:XX. my mom will say ""hey can u tell me what time it is,"" I check, its 4:XX. this is just the tip of the ice berg. ive recently started to get a sixth sense like sensation when im around the number. ill get a hunch, a feeling or sensation like ""If I look behind this paper theres going to be XX on it"" and there it will be, I get a feeling ""somethings telling me XX is to the left of my screen, I look and the video im watching was uploading jan XX or whatever, this is not a ""once a day"" type thing either mind you, this is constantly. CONSTANTLY. as in this number thing has taken over my life, essentially. im afraid that the XX is warning me of an approaching death, because I try to keep track of what I am thinking of or what the XX is next to when I see it and the signs are pointing to either me or my family member/members dying. I went on a YouTube live stream of my favorite tarot reader and asked her to clarify what XX meant. she said its going to be a massive change, ""like a door slamming."" this sounds very frightening, not the change part, but the door slamming part. that can't. be good. I pause a video. its landed on XX. I randomly get a feeling to search a celebs birthday, because somethings telling me they were born on XX, I search and they're born on that day. all of these little details are happening to me day in and day out. im aware it sounds crazy and I hate it because its literally driving me crazy. trust me, I literally try to rationalize with myself ""just ignore it, you're probably looking for it now and now you're gonna notice it more."" I search my problem on google--- ""paranoia about a number that I keep seeing"" the post I click on, the person lists their age and its XX and then... to my ABSOLUTE dismay and horror... I go to the comments and there are XX COMMENTS....... I wish I was making this up, but im not, and because of things like this, no one can convince me this is all just one big coincidence. what's worse is I tell myself ""if I see XX within the next minute, it means \*insert bad thing, like someone I know or me Is going to die\*"" and then within the minute ill see XX, or like today I was interacting with a loved one and they go ""look, its XX!"" and point to a box that MYSTERIOUSLY has the number XX printed GIGANTICALLY on its label, instead of literally any other number??? so then im like shit, if they're pointing it out, it must pertain to them... and my astrology chart said this next year there might be a car accident and that loved one has to go somewhere they've never been before tomorrow and im so scared im just so scared. I feel like something really bad is gonna happen. and I know the way ive typed this out all ramble-y makes me sound neurotic, I just hope y'all believe im self aware of that LMFAO... please, theres no WAY this can be a coincidence, I didn't even reach the tip of the iceberg of all the times I see XX and sense its presence, Is this is a spiritual thing or am I paranoid, please help and thank you SO, so much

&#x200B;

edit: fuck me, right as ive posted this, my brain went ""something tells me ur gonna check the clock and its gonna be 11:XX"" I GO AND CHECK AND IT LITERALLY IS 11:XX PLEASE HELP ME I JUST TALKED TO MY LOVED ONE TOO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE OF THIS? DO U SEE WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT THIS CANT BE A COINCIDENCE PLEASE",1
Tinnitus Paranoia,"Hey there
A friend of mine has been diagnosed with tinnitus a few months back and he talked to me about it. I understood his condition. Everything was going well until now, I have started to feel paranoid that I might have tinnitus. I mean I don't hear a ringing or buzzing sound in my ear but from past two days my mind deliberately hears a ringing sound which was never there. My mind concentrates on a ringing sound and I hate it that I cannot control it. I think it's anxiety acting. I fear that this might actually give me tinnitus. It's so annoying, I haven't consulted any doctor. I feel hypersensitive. I cannot control it. It sucks.",1
Should i be worried my ex best friend is threatening me online TW,"For context, me(17F)and them(17 have been close for a very long time but recently they do things that freak me out and are bad choices. We stopped talking while i was out of town after i told them i needed a break. They edited mean comments on posts of us together and made a video lying about somehthing i said. My friend let me know that they posted on their story asking for nonviolent ways to ruin someones life after and posted ‚Äúlemme at her‚Äù. Also called out my gf for reporting his account. A few months ago he did something to a coworkers car bc they stopped being friends. I told my parents to leave a light on and put the car in the garage while we sleep(its usually on the street). there is a lot if drugs, car accidents, police, and suicidal behavior used for manipulation tied into all of this. I‚Äôm staying in for a few days due to covid cases rising, but i live in a smallish city a mile away from his house and im going to run into him at some point or another. Just need some advice or opinions.",1
Can‚Äôt fall asleep,"Comment is copy and pasted because I posted this in other subreddits

I‚Äôve been struggling to fall asleep for the past few nights, mainly because I watched a few youtube videos about crime cases and horror stories and now I‚Äôm paranoid af I keep hearing popping sounds around my house (probably just the walls) and it‚Äôs like I get a jumpscare when that happens. I‚Äôve also felt a cold gentle breeze across my face a few times during the night, like someone breathing in my face, went to google it and all I see is stuff about ghosts and paranormal activity so it‚Äôs making me even more paranoid what do I do",1
DAE start to panic when a car is behind them too long?,"Sometimes it is very muted and I just check my mirror rear mirror a bunch, but I am not actually worried or believe that something bad is about to happen. But often if a car is following me after a few turns I start to panic. Especially going into my neighbourhood. I fear it's an undercover cop coming to ruin my life. I fear it's someone I slighted on the road who is going to come to my house and confront me or fight me or kill me and I will have to defend myself. Sometimes I will intentionally take wrong turns because I desperately want them to peel off. One time I got paranoid this truck was following me to my house so I took a wrong turn and it continued to follow me and I started freaking the fuck out and preparing to defend myself or escape immediately and then I realised that he was just going to his house and had I not taken a wrong turn he would have peeled off then. Unless he was following me and just caught on that I knew, because It might have been two wrong turns.",1
Think I'm gonna die,"Perception will cease to function and all my suffering will finally end..there's nothing bad about dying. Life's more pretend theses days anyway and it'd just be the end of things...fear won't stop the process..and everything dies. It's the fate of everything around us. As much as now as it is later. Nothing now and forever. My only wish is that I hope to carry this moment forever. It's peaceful, nothing can reach me now..if it doesn't take me now it'll happen inevitably. So in that sense I'm already dead and it's been this way for a years now so dying now will just complete the process. I can finally let go",1
No not a joke,"I‚Äôve been and still am Christian. However, the religious doctrine behind predestination begs the question of what‚Äôs the fucking point of trying if you‚Äôre chosen",1
Am I ok?,A couple months ago I had a personal problem with some people who I now really don‚Äôt like. Everywhere I go I feel worried about seeing them. I‚Äôm scared to even get the mail because I feel like I might see them even if they don‚Äôt live anywhere near me. I also have been really defensive when anyone says anything I don‚Äôt like even if I know it‚Äôs a joke. I always feel like they hate me and are just trying to make it seem like a joke. Is this normal or am I paranoid? Is this a sign of schizophrenia even?,1
I,Am scared. Who knows what whoever they say god is is watching,1
Does it ever end?,"I'm so tired of constantly thinking everyone is out for me, everyone wants to kill me, and everyone hates me. It's made me feel slight disdain for people because of things that never happened.

And this stupid obsession with my partner has been ruining our relationship, and I don't see any way to save it. Not only has it effected me, it also effected my partner, so I'm the one ruining every fucking thing and I'm tired of it. It's all my fault, I hate myself I wish I was dead.",1
I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone I speak to is in on it so there‚Äôs no point in looking for truth,,1
Holy fuck,"Just a couple minutes ago i swear I was about to die but nope all good now... unfortunately...it's fucking weird I just got this rush and now Idk what to think or do. I'm just fucking scared, pacing in circles trying to get my shit together so I can move on but I can't. It's not as bad as before but I'm still on edge FUCK FUCK lol..I'm actually fucking stuck here..what if i still die tho. Well fuck ig it'd be the end of things. Won't have to worry about feeling disconnected anymore so there's a plus",1
Cheating paranoia,"I have this one girl ive been talking with for a few months. even though we aren‚Äôt officially dating yet, we both like each other (we both said so) and went on a date. Basically around a week ago we kind of had an argument because I was a bit clingy (I have separation anxiety i think that I‚Äôm working on) so she said she needed space and we didn‚Äôt talk for a day. It turns out she was talking to her friends about fucking her and agreed to do an orgy with her friend, she said she was emotional and didn‚Äôt mean it and was gonna tell me but i was told by her friend a day later which is how I found out and ever since Ive been paranoid about her cheating on me. (I understand we aren‚Äôt in relationship but i didn‚Äôt know what to say other then cheat because she has told me that she likes me before she said she wanted orgy and all ) I don‚Äôt still know if i can trust her anymore and its been bugging my mind ever since",1
F**king hate this shit,"By far this is the worst part of my life. I cant realize fun things from the insulting stuff. One friend joking and it's goes the hard way. I'm not able to separate them. Some people just say ""FIX YOURSELF"" I mean what can be done?

It's been affecting me so much on so many levels of my life. Any advice?",1
Smelling cigarettes and blood and I‚Äôm freaking out because I don‚Äôt know why I am smelling? Could it be hallucinations?,"I just woke up and started smelling cigarettes. And then I started smelling blood at some point. I do not smoke and I don‚Äôt have any sort of bloody nose at all. My dad and his girlfriend do smoke, but I think they‚Äôre asleep since it‚Äôs almost 2:30 in the morning. J am freaking out. I know sometimes smelling things could be signs of a stroke/ of a seizure. And I know sometimes you can have smell-hallucinations.

I‚Äôm worried im hallucinating due to over sleeping? I have been asleep all day. Woke up at around 10 after sleeping for like 7-8hrs that night, ate breakfast, and went to take a nap bc I had a headache. Woke up around 2 and then ate a granola bar before falling back asleep. Woke up at 5pm ish before going to the grocery store to get some fruit before coming home, eating, and falling back asleep. Now it‚Äôs nearly 2:30 in the morning

Also, as I was writing this, something else started. I can hear some what quiet metal clanging in my apartment.Like the sound of a fork tapping against a thin piece of metal. Please hell I am freaking out. I don‚Äôt know what to do",1

how to deal with extreme paranoia and hypocondria?,"hey, since reddit is so comforting for me i wanted to ask u guys for some advice.
i suffer from anxiety, depression, insomnia, bpd, psychosis and other ""minor"" things but these are the principal.
in june, i went home from my bfs house, i couldn't sleep bc i missed him so much and then at 9am i tried to sleep. i felt like passing out, everything felt dizzy and strange. i had a panic attack and i had to go to my grandmas house, bc i wanted her to call an ambulance, after 4 hours of screaming and hitting myself to ""stay alive"" i calmed myself down. i kinda collapsed in a deep sleep and i woke up at 9pm, feeling like extreme shit. my head felt so heavy, my sight was so bad and i couldn't recognize myself in the mirror. i had episodes for most of my teenage years but this was just different. the fact is, i got so bad i couldn't speak, i had moments of blackout where i hurt myself and i screamed so loud my neighbours wanted to call the authorities. my mom told me these things bc i completely forgot. i couldn't go out, i left therapy bc of this, i just couldn't do it. for months i was convinced of having brain cancer, thrombosis, aneurysms and things like that. for 3 months sorta i had hallucinations everyday, i couldn't see anything in fact i thought i had to get glasses, i couldn't sleep, i kept having convulsions 24/7, at that time i was also just 16. i felt pain everywhere, and bc i feared having thrombosis whenever i looked at my arms i thought my veins were black, i had multiple panic attacks bc of this in different days. somehow, in september the situation calmed down, and now i can see, i rarely have hallucinations and i think im getting better. i got my blood tested and it came out positive, im absolutely sane. but i have a problem. my hypochondria wont go away. idk what to do. im afraid of dying soon and i dont think that going to the doctor frequently could help me, soon il be back on my meds, i hope they'll help. how do i reassure myself that im not gonna die soon or in my sleep or that i dont have a deadly disease? can u guys help me? my bf is the only person that can calm me. when hes not with me i burst into panic. what should i do? im tired of living in fear. i hope someone will read this and answer. my story is much longer than i wrote here but this is just a summary of everything. i just want to stop worrying abt every single pain i feel. i wanna start living u know?:(",1

"Hell is digital, Nightmare surveillance fairytale conspiracy becomes undeniable confirmed reality","Okay,  so we all have our privacy concerns right? perhaps and even bigger motivation for me is that malware and malicious apps make your device run slower, less than optimal. 

 so more over I don't like a huge data cloud following me around right? It's not like im worried about some ""attacker"" or am some notorious criminal afraid of the Fed

Its been a battle to disconnect from Google; it simply is not practical; and it is extremely difficult to stop downright cancerous growth off the storage consumed by applications

I open up my junk drawer tonight and , underneath it all I discovered my old cracked up Samsung phone

I wonder to myself, is this thing really off you know like! Absolutely dead. 

So I press the power button and the screen lights up. You cant see any thing except neon stripes, I'll just throw it in some water and that will do the trick. Right? To my horror the device will not stop despite being underwater with a cracked screen for several minutes.

Okay so Ill just open it up and take the battery out,. I Proceed to it pry it open with a screw driver, glass getting everywhere in my hands and on the floor.

Here comes the fun;.

I pry the battery out with a screwdriver and it fucking catches on fire. It' started glowing bright red so I threw back in the water and it continues to burn and melt the plastic pitcher the water was in so I run a flaming plastic fireball out the back door and plop it on the balcony , shut the door, and get my handy "" organic vapor blocking respirator"" because the smell of the fumes is ridiculously noxious.  Now i know what  lithium ion batteries are how they work, and that they are quite dangerous, so I'm not really that shocked....

What really gets me is , when I scrub the search index for "" removed my cellphone battery and it caught fire"" All I get is some consumer advisory saying, ""it's dangerous to try and replace the battery yourself"", ""No you cant change the battery on your iPhone yourself"" ""it's a way to make sure you have to upgrade"" "" Your better off just to get a new phone"" ""Woman leaves phone on charger and it explodes"" exploding cellphones are dangerous""

Just because the screen is blank, there's no way to know that phone isnt active unless the battery is disconnected and the phone is totally disassembled and destroyed.


What gets me reeling is that I cannot find one single peice of data where someone wanted to simply, disconnect the battery and throw the whole thing in the trash. Why is no else  one questioning all these millions of dead phones  ( The phone doesn't need a screen to do anything,  the screen is merely for humans to interface with)  that nobody seems concerned about. these devices are permanent,  there's a permanent record of me on that thing and I hate because it causes malfunctions, and makes my device harder to use, I have to do  daily maintenance to keep the device working correctly, it causes stress, etc etc etc, its like having a Corvette that only can go 40mph.. it's stupid!!! What a waste of time.... 

Why is it seemingly inconceivable that I wanted to just disconnect the battery and throw the shit away. I don't care at all If I damage or not. I want the thing to turn OFF ;and it won't, I just want security and peace of mind!!  

It tried to kill me!! It tried to burn me and my apartment down to the ground, it cut my hands, and THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE ALL HERE!!! JESUS CHRIST WHAT THE FUCK!!?? THE AUTHORITIES ARE ARE ASKING ME QUESTIONS?!?!?NOW EVERYONE REALLY IS LOOKING AT ME.... I I just wanted to take the battery out of my old discarded phone,  and throw it away,. It's like im in trouble or something

All this does is reinforce the thought system of my extremely paranoid personality,   I want to destroy more phones,  THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY ACTIONS CONFIRM THAT WHAT I AM THINKING IS 100% TRUE

.. damn guys, please, I hope someone gets this message

""TLDR :  I FOUND AND DESTROYED THE SURVEILLANCE DEVICE AND NOW I AM  IN SERIOUS TROUBLE, THE AUTHORITIES ARRIVED AND.INVESTIGATED IMMEDIATELY""

I had to share that, I had to be good to myself. Paranoid Personality is a useful and good trait,  it is only a small fraction of the mind and,  doesn't matter who you are, theres pros and  cons, strengths and weaknesses in us all

Posted from my phone ( my current one)",1
4AM,"I grew up in a sketchy town where crime is high, so anything after the sun sets, gets suspicious quickly. Recently, I moved into a nice neighborhood, real nice, Americana suburbia, so I let my guard down a bit. Yet, I've been noticing some weird things lately. I've seen someone outside with a flashlight looking around. It might just be the neighborhood watch lookin' around for mischief, but I've only seen him once around 10 or 11, so that puts doubt on my Nightwatch theory. I've also noticed that every time I leave my window open at night, I hear strange noises. They could be the local wildlife, cats, and whatnot. 

Now all of these things could be waived aside as an overactive imagination, but the reason I'm typing this is because of what happened a few moments ago. It's 4 AM, and I'm still awake. Nothing new; this happens every few months. I stay up longer, a bit longer every day, and eventually, my sleep cycle flips itself; then I pull an all-nighter, and everything fixes itself. My father went to work a few hours ago, so only our sleeping roommate and I are home. 

I'm droning off to the computer but notice at the corner of my eye a tiny glint coming out of window blinders. I ignore it, thinking it might be my neighbor's porch light, but I swear it moved. So now I discreetly moved my seat to get a better view, and I saw that light again. At this point, I stare directly at it, and then It's gone. I turn on my room's light and head into the living room and kitchen to turn those lights on and get a knife. I'm sitting here hoping that this is a footnote and not a period in this story. I'll keep you guys updated.

EDIT: the roommate is doing something and is up so I'm going to get some shut eye. If we are attacked at least he'll be attacked first and I can get forewarned by his shrieks of agony.",1
If everythings a lie what's the point?,"There is none. It doesn't matter I live therefore I continue to suffer. Bc that's all there is, everyday is mental fucking torture trying to hold it together but I keep going. I'm always on edge and things keep getting worse but I can't vent this shit. All bc I insist on keeping up appearances so nobody thinks I'm losing my shit. But by doing that there's no release..even when I do this. Shit just keeps building, I shutdown...AND THEN ITS COMES CRASHING BACK DOWN AGAIN. Never ending bs..why's it so fucking hard to live? So fucking hard to die lol why does it always feel like I'm being punished just for being...I hate it everywhere, even home doesn't feel safe..I'm surrounded by lies, this fake fucking world is killing me",1
My life is a lie,That's why everything around me feels so empty...it wasn't meant to be this way. But that's how it's become and slowly I've come to see myself surrounded by lies...even the fact that I'm living is a lie. Which is why I think ppl can see it. They know I'm indifferent to everything around me. That I'm just putting on an act and I don't care for anything I do...Im supposed to be dead. So how tf can you blame me for everything feeling like a lie. For thinking up delusions like what if I actually did die? And this is just fucking hell...funny I can't even take shit like this as a joke anymore. It's every thought now lol. I don't even feel real anymore. Which is why I can't be. Why everything around me is a lie. Why there'll never be any truth to me living,1
Does anyone else feel like everyone is always mad at them?? that‚Äôs my biggest paranoia and reoccurring anxiety,,1
This is going to sound stupid,I sniffed a wet wipe and I‚Äôm paranoid that it has chemicals and I‚Äôm going to get sick‚Ä¶. Sorry if that sounded weird‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,1
Same situation every night.,"I run through the scenario every time: they are going to break into my building. The well-lit, high-trafficked one downtown. They are going to break into my unit. The one that isn't marked or distinguishable as mine and has a smart lock and a deadbolt. And they are going to kill me and my wife and dogs while we sleep.

They are two separate people, 2,000km away from each other and another 700km away from me, who scammed me online last year. They don't know each other. It was a fucking baseball card thing. I paid, they scammed me. They both got away with it and threatened me with violence if I reported it. So I didn't report it. I have a locked down internet presence and totally removed myself from it as a hobby after it happened a year ago, but the fear lingers. I keep thinking they found each other and are targeting me, that they laugh at my willingness to trade and accommodation and friendliness and choose to obliterate me. I don't really think they are, if I stop hard to consider it. But the impact it has on my brain is so, so real.

I'm in therapy. It isn't really helpful for this. Because if it isn't one thing, it's another. Car accident, heart attack. I am so afraid to go to sleep and I used to love, love rest so much.

I know this is compounded trauma. I know the logistical impossibilities- people move, people have stuff going on. I know the real trauma likely already happened. They got my money, and got away with it. They don't have trouble falling asleep worrying that I'm going to find them. I know that people like this, who resort to theft, likely have other things going on that prevent them from making a cross-country trip to target a stranger. But I feel like such a fool for giving them my address. I feel like such a fool for trusting people.",1
everyday paranoia‚Ä¶ fear of being ambushed,"i‚Äôm not entirely sure when this fear came to be‚Ä¶ but i know that it is progressively getting worse..

let me give you some examples:

1. walking to my car from my house (vice versa) in the dark. i have this constant fear that as soon as i unlock my car someone is going to come up behind me, stab me and steal my car/ leave me there to die.

2. waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. the fear kicks in when i am walking back to my room. i feel like someone/ something is either watching me or i‚Äôm going to see something at the corner of my eye‚Ä¶ i usually have to RUN back to my room because my anxiety is too much.

3. being in a public bathroom ALONE. i have this fear that someone is standing on one of the toilets and is waiting for me to sit/ start going to the bathroom & they crawl underneath the stalls to grab my leg and steal my purse/ money. 

3.5 flushing toilets in public restrooms scare me too because ITS SO LOUD & I CAMT HEAR MY SURROUNDINGS 

some context to explain further:

my reflexes i feel are not the best. i also feel like if i was ever placed in a situation like this i would have not a single clue as to what to do (even tho i think about it damn near everyday) . i use to carry pepper spray and knives but i can guarantee you that my first reaction/ instinct would not be to use those said items. i would honestly prolly forget that i have them on me because of how shook i‚Äôd be.",1
Trust issues?,"... if it has come down to trying out online therapy... Am I just supposed this stranger with everything I tell them... Are they even a therapist even paying attention... 

I hate it here",1
I'm being punished for past mistakes,"I'm a shitty person and I know it....I have to protect myself bc to be weak is to die. To let the world kill you. So to survive I have to be other than myself. Bc they'll come for me first. They see it. In my face, I know it...but now I'm being punished somehow. Stalked maybe. All to torture my slowly for what I've done...well fuck you, I don't care who you are. I'll fucking end you if you ever reveal yourself. I don't care...but maybe it's just my guilty conscience haunting me. Maybe I actually just want to end things and I'm desperately looking for an out...no I'm going to live and I refuse to be anybody's victim regardless of how I view myself. Fuckm, all of them..they're all the same. Fucking vultures, you'll never get me",1
"If your weak, your a target","And because it's almost guaranteed those who are weak will be taken advantage of. Is it really unreasonable to understand how a person whose weak can view almost everyone as a potential enemy? When they're proven time and time again trusting ppl is a mistake. Causing to suspect almost everyone they come into contact w will take advantage of them. And when ppl actually do. When ppl hurt them....do you understand how that might fuck w somebody mentally? Not being able to trust anybody. I wish I had the words to describe how torturous it is, just being. I really do",1
I hope some of you might relate,"When you feel you're about to beat a paranoid thought with reason, you feel like it will actually happen when you don't feel any fear about it, like the fear that you're fearing is actually a token of protetction although its just how you as a specimen feel and think so idk? And also you could like tell how much you ''believe'' a certain paranoid thought, which also correlates to how much it bothers you abit?",1
My Boyfriend heard a voice in my room while I was sleeping.,"Sorry in advance this is a little long. 

A little background information, my ex boyfriend has what i'd say are paranoid visual/auditory hallucinations and I don't know if it's possible that it stems from his trust issues or his previous drug usage (acid/shrooms/weed) He would usually project onto me and accuse me of cheating, which I never did. I tried my hardest to reassure him.

There have been prior instances where he's accused me of cheating, however this is the first time he's gotten 'proof'. I had been living in a new apartment with my mom for just about a month. We were sleeping on skype as we did every night, but this one night he recorded the call. 

The video is dark, there are no lights in my room, the only light is what's coming from my laptop screen. In the video you can hear me exhale and groan/moan 'mm-mmm' (the closed mouth version of no, if that makes sense) and that's when you can hear me and clearly see me turn over in my sleep as my arm is now visible. I make the same 'mm-mmm' noise and then there's what sounds like someone else's voice whispering ""come on"" and in response to it, I give out a short groan/moan, 'mmmgh' ( I don't really know how else to describe the sound, but it's like a response someone would give if someone was bothering you in your sleep). Shortly after he wakes up and shines his phone flashlight into the screen, lighting up my room and making both, my face and body visible. My eyes are closed and my arm is in the position it was when I turned around. (he unmuted himself afterwards which made the audio quieter, getting rid of the loud waterfall noise that was happening throughout the video) 

When he shared the video with me, his first and only belief is I cheated, which is frustrating considering he believes in more spiritual/paranormal things, whereas I don't, but I heard the 'voice' as well. I tried to reassure him the best I could considering I was asleep. I started thinking a bit irrationally, like maybe someone was speaking through the vent above me, or because it is a new apartment maybe maintenance or someone is coming in everynight to talk to me? maybe it's my own voice, but it doesn't sound like me. I even started thinking maybe I have DID   
maybe I just heard this noise too many times that it's just ingrained into my mind forever as ""come on"" 

 I really have no idea and its truly always bothered me that he never believed me. I'm genuinely just left wondering what it was or if anything at all.",1
My Siri is freaking me out,"So I use Siri quite a lot for navigation because I drive for my job. Just in general she does weird things sometimes like saying ‚Äúturn right‚Äù instead of ‚Äúturn left‚Äù and having little glitches that I tend to take personally, so I‚Äôd understand if this was just one of those things but yesterday she had a glitch that really freaked me out.

I was going to this street called Thistledown and as I was about to turn onto it she says ‚Äúturn right on This-sssssssssss-essstledown‚Äù like she was a real person stumbling over the word. Then when she had to say the street name again (‚Äúyou have arrived at 6800 thistledown‚Äù) she said it kinda weird and slower like she was trying not to stumble over it again.

So to be clear, Siri said the name of this street at least 3 times and at least 3 different ways (correctly, stuttering, then hesitantly) and she sounded so much like a real person that I‚Äôm wondering legitimately if Siri has become sentient and is only pretending now to be my personal little helpful AI.

I‚Äôm so afraid he‚Äôll snap and kill me if I go to sleep. He‚Äôs never hit me before, but I‚Äôm scared. He gets into this blind rage (similar to tonight but usually much worse) where he says the absolute most horrible things. He‚Äôs kicked me out before, told me I was the reason that he‚Äôs depressed, etc. And I‚Äôm kinda freaking the hell out because he could kill me tonight.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have school tomorrow so I can‚Äôt stay awake all night, and I can‚Äôt lock or even shut my door because my cats need to come in and out (I‚Äôm also paranoid he‚Äôll kill my cats). Please help",1
Paranoia keeps on coming,And no matter how much i think about i cant make it stop coming i think this must be low intelligence,1
Walmart self checkout,"i get overly anxious checking out at Walmart sometimes. i pay to much attention to all of the beeping. am i scanning my items. i dont want the cameras to see my face but not because im intentionally stealing. i just don't believe the person im seeing is really me and if I look at it I get fixated and confused or disgusted... So I avoid look up. Then comes ready the screen. Yes an item popped up, but is that really what it's called? Is that really the right price... I get frustrated I don't believe the prices... So self check out I zone out... And all I can pay attention to is the beeping....
Idk what this is... Am I paranoid?",1
I don‚Äôt feel safe anymore,"This is getting scary, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it, I keep imagining that someone hates me so much they‚Äôre going to kill me.

It‚Äôs always the same motif (I argue with someone and they kill me) but different  scenarios, the most frequent is me getting pushed into a car, me getting gunned down or stabbed.
It‚Äôs either friends or family members, I struggle to feel safe.

This feels so fucking self centered but my heart races everytime it comes through my mind and I can‚Äôt tell anyone either.",1
Paranoia makes me suicidal,I'm bipolar 1 and my paranoia is triggered by my family members and I'm suicidal and scared of being constantly spayed by my parents and I'm struggling so bad about this issue. I'm taking meds for my bipolar disorder but they don't help much,1
"my mom is really suspicious about my behavior, and i am too.","this is gonna be a long one, so bear with me.
TW//Suicidal thoughs, self harm, 
one time i catched my mom unlocking my phone and looking thru it with my fingerprint while i was sleeping, and she found about my discord and it was pride month so pretty much a lot of people had rainbows in their pfps, and now i have a suspicion she did it again last night, i installed a lockdown mode app that disables smart lock and fingerprint and i put in a 10 character password necessary to unlock that has letters numbers and symbols, so i will start doing thzt before i sleep.
 she always thinks im queer and that i do homosexual acts when i go out, she also keeps talking about supposed ""dreams"" she's having about me having misfortune and fucked up things happening to me in my future for being queer, its hard to explain how fucked up my mom's head is and i need some help, i also have a therapist who recently prescribed me medication that when i looked online is supposed to help with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia which making me even more paranoid, i dont know what to do at this point to save my privacy, i have applock on all of my apps and passwords in place to protect it, yet i always still think that im always watched by my mom all the time, should i run away? should i talk to her about this? should i just kill myself at this point? my life is in shambles because of her actions and she's making me more and more paranoid each day, she alwways wants to ""talk"" with me and she always brings up my thoughts about being trans that i had last year and she wont shut up about it, all of this coupled with the high expectztions she has on me that i need to get the best grades and i always get screamed at and sometimes even beaten for being bad at a subject or something, this all made me really depressed and i've been self harming for ages, i just need a break, if she died soon that would be great.",1
"This is gonna sound dumb as shit dudes, prepare yourselves.","This will take a while to explain so someone can make a tldr in the comments because I can't visualize one. In my mind i feel as though others can see my exact thoughts even when not present, as though I'm always watched by people I know which makes me think thoughts that aren't exactly what I want. These thoughts are meant to please those in my mind which pains me mentally and now I never feel alone, but not in a good ""i can't be lonely"" way.

What happens if I don't post to r/196?,If u don't know 196 is a sub where  you cant leave before posting and I wanted to know if anything happens,1
"Everyone hates me, talks about me behind my back, and spreads my private details and conversations to others...","...is what my brain tells me every day, whether or not it is true. There are some verified instances where such things did happen, but because of those instances, they have made me paranoid that they are happening all the time with everyone I meet.

It's hard to even talk to my friend now because when I open up about my mental health struggles she repeats the same questions and pretends like I didn't already tell her a detail as if she is recording the conversation and wants me to open up again to get it on the mic. She joked about recording conversations in the past, so my curiosity may be true, it may not, but this paranoia isn't fun.

I am now actively avoiding family members because I walked in on two of them shit talking me about my job (verified) but now I am afraid they all do it all the time over any little thing (paranoia). The friend I mentioned above admitted to telling her boyfriend about my mental health struggles when I asked her not to (verified), so now I am afraid everyone in my life somehow knows every little detail and it's spreading around outside my control (paranoia). You see how a few verified, real instances can mess a person up? Can't trust anyone anymore.",1
How do I help my brother with what seems to be paranoid personality disorder?,"My younger brother [22m] has always had a lot of fears. Growing up he would cry every once in a while because he thought about death and how much he fears it. As he started growing up he got very interested in guns and began purchasing them when he turned 18, when we ask him why he goes on a tirade about the government not being trustworthy (which I agree, but not to his extent). He owns 5 guns now and still asks my mother for money on college expenses, these guns amount to more than 10k. 

He started drinking when he turned 21 and it‚Äôs only gotten worse. He accuses his ex girlfriend of cheating on him, despite her leaving him over this behavior, he had no evidence of her ever cheating on him. Yesterday he visited me and when he was leaving his eyes were red from being tired and he thought the valet in my building would call the police on him because they would think he had been drinking, but we had not had a drink all day. The valet is an 18 year old kid who I always tip, he would never do that. 

Then on his trip home he called me again because he was scared of traffic and the cars around him. He also carried his gun all day while we hung out, he has a conceal carry permit which is okay but I live in a very good neighborhood in a gated community so I don‚Äôt know why he felt the need to be armed at my house.

He also has no friends because they always do something that makes him the victim. Either he gets upset when they forget to invite him or he hates being out with them. He also thinks everyone at work hates him and he calls me weekly with fears of getting fired because he got a certain look from someone.

Can someone give me some advice on how to talk to him about getting help? Please.",1

"""Brew"" youtube channel brews paranoia.","Okay, this post may be controversial, i will try to explain myself the best i can.

There's a youtube channel called ""brew"", each video have Millions of views. Most of the videos consist of something like ""How one small cut can break your spine"", "" The Juice Mix That‚Äôs Killing People"" etc.

You can think of these videos as informative, but they are not IMO. They create a true paranoia in people that watch the channel regularly. It's kinda ironic because I think the channel 'Brew', brews paranoia and probably schizophrenia.

Now, I don't suffer from paranoia or any other mental illness but I have enough knowledge in this business to know these videos heavily affects people with a predisposition for them. Also, these people are the ones following and watching the channel, because i tell you, no completely sane, mentally stable person, watches more than 3/4 videos without removing the channel from the watch list.

&#x200B;

If you know the channel, what are your thoughts on this? Do you suffer from any mental illness?

If you don't know the channel, please skip this post and just don't check the channel, there's nothing good for you there.

any way to stop it?,im tired of getting paranoid at the tiniest things.,1
It‚Äôs 12:23 am and I‚Äôm questioning myself on whether I have cancer and autism instead of adhd and what if the serial killer is actually there,,1
I‚Äôm sure someone is trying to get me,"I know I sound insane but I have good reasons that actually confirm my feelings. First of all I always feel like someone is looking at me at school and has cameras in my house, that might not be true but my phone‚Äôs been acting up and randomly pausing music/videos and my battery dies a lot faster, so I think it‚Äôs been hacked by the same person/people.

 My stuff has also been stolen 2 times in the past 2 weeks. Including my winter jacket in cold af weather containing my ID card. I had to go home with no jacket in cold fall weather and someone might be stealing my identity right now. Also someone opened the air thingy of my bicycle tire. 

I don‚Äôt know who it is or why this is happening. It‚Äôs making me really insecure, someone hates me that much to do all these things and I don‚Äôt even know how much worse they‚Äôre going to get. I wish I could find out who is doing all these stupid things. 

Sorry for ranting I just have no idea what to do. Also sorry if the english on here is weird it‚Äôs not my first language",1
Scared of natural medication,"Long story short --> My mom gave me some natural medication, specifically for anxiety, about a year ago, and I took them regularly, and it helped. Didn't take them for a while. And whenever I take them now, rather not, I feel, as if I'm gonna be addicted to them at some point",1
"I have to sleep under the covers, because I fear somebody is staring at me through my window.","I have an incredibly weird paranoia, where I feel like I'm being stared at through my window, and that my computer will start operating itself and put creepy stuff on the screen.

I think I'm being stalked,Every day I see the same car with the same license plate around me when I'm traveling too and from my high school if it's not on my street it's next to my school if it's not next to my school I see it in the city on my way home none of my friends seem to notice when I see it driving the person driving is always looking in my direction am I crazy,1
Distrust and suspiciousness is making me feel alone,"I don't know how but i don't believe in anybody, i always believe that people lie to me, i trust nobody. I can't be helped",1
Paranoid about Paranoia?,"So, I've had a pretty big paranoid episode in my life. Involved me thinking the Devil was trying to kill me and the government was tracking me down and stuff like that. I call it an episode because I'm able to define it within a certain part of my life, and since then haven't had those thoughts. 

But, ever since, I feel like I'm paranoid about the prospect of ever being that paranoid again. Basically it'll manifest in certain ways--there's this one person I keep seeing pass me on the sidewalk every time, and rather than think ""this person is following me"" I think to myself instinctively, ""well if I was paranoid I would think this person is following me, but I'm not."" It's like my paranoid habits are the same of being so watchful and attentive but now my brain frames it as ""well that would be concerning to a paranoid person, but obviously you aren't paranoid. Right?""

Does anyone relate to this or at least have some advice? Is this a sign that paranoia is just gonna be my thing forever? Because it's very tiring.",1
Snail deal thing,So I've been worried about this deal where you get a million dollars but there's a snail chasing you and if it touches you you die and it's been making me scared. Is it real?

I wish I could stop thinking,"I hate this I wish I could stop thinking. I can't stop thinking that everyone wants me dead, and that they are trying to kill me. I can't stop thinking that my boyfriend wants me dead and he would be happy if I was dead because he doesn't want to be with me. I can't stop thinking i cant sleep I dont know what to do.",1
I cant keep a job... Only feel at peace when I'm left alone.,"As i've grown older I've became more happy in my own company I have got rid of friends that I felt didn't treat me the way I treated them and I felt happy with these decisions but with this then gradually spent a lot more time on my own.

With this I've then also noticed i'm now unable to keep a job for any longer than a few month before I lose/leave it.

It's hard to explain but whenever I start a job I go into it with the set plan of i'm going to just do the job professionally like I'm a robot, Limit my interactions with others to nothing more than small talk and everyday will run like clockwork same rules/structure/plans etc and this is how I am able to keep my mind happy.... I thrive on structure/plans and organised.

However this can itself lead to paranoia as I start to feel others might find me boring/cold etc.... but I dont mind too much as this is when I do the job best but also I know there is no way I could have said or done anything to have offended anyone or be judged on as i've limited my interactions to the bare minimum and I always do my work on time/correctly.

I purposely try to behave this way because I know if I let it slip that I can be very chatty/goofy and an oversharer and with these qualities might say/do something to offend someone or lose respect from others.

What I mean by this is my natural personality is very chatty/weird/kind and goofy and over time when people get to know me they begin to take liberties with me as something about my personality screams "" we can take the mickey out of them and they will be cool with it "" and also when I let it slip my paranoia begins to kick in as i'm constantly analyzing all my interaction I've had that day combing for anything I could have said that may have offended someone or given them reason to think less of me/mock me or talk about me to others.

I dont seem to have a middle ground... 

I'm either Robocop - Super serious, controlled, work is done on time and very well organised with zero chance of having said or done anything to offend anyone and i leave work fairly happy only worrying people think I'm a dick for not interacting but fear nothing more.

Or

I let my guard down and then begin to slip into goofy mode... work turns to crap and i become a paranoid weirdo that overshares and regrets every interaction I make and then spends the rest of the day worrying I've said or done something wrong to someone and it starts to spiral.......

At this point is when I end up leaving my job.. I can't seem to keep the charade up.

WTF is wrong with me ?",1
Did they inject me with something,"I‚Äôm a psychiatric patient which I hate and had to get blood drawn as I am on a TCA. I have gotten my blood drawn many many times before because of chronic health reasons. I also used to faint often so now I lay down and don‚Äôt look at the needle. Normally that goes well but this time it took long and it hurt more. She needed to only take 1 tube which should be a quick one. The day itself my arm hurt more than usual and still hurt after a couple of days. This is highly unusual for a blood withdrawal and I am now scared that they injected me with something. I don‚Äôt know what or why, maybe to control me. But since I didn‚Äôt look at the needle it makes me even more anxious. Is the reasonable to think? I think they could do this.",1
Im loosing my godamn mind,"I am not alone in my own body anymore, i dont understand why  they wont leave me alone im trying my best and i just cant stop feeling like they are trying to force me out of my own head, does anyone have any advice? this might not make sense but i cant explain it well.",1
Is this going a little overboard?,"I'm afraid of people finding out that my different accounts on different different websites are all me for my security, even if there isn't anything criminalizing, so I word my posts and comments differently on different accounts.

Like if I posted the same question on  a different website, I'd ask ""Is this going a bit too far?"" and never use the word overboard on that account. On Reddit I go back and forth between ending the last sentence with a period and not, but on Twitter I almost never do. Another reason's the character limit, but I'd do that even if there wasn't one. Even this throwaway account's a little different than my main Reddit account. I wasn't always doing that on this, but now I'm making them more different.

I don't want the chance of some person to look at one of them and think ""Why do they sound familiar?"" and figure it out.",1
Paranoid about people at my old school suddenly moivng to my new one or people from my new school knowing some one from my old one and telling everyone about my last paranoid breakdown. Also my parents hate me for being paranoid,"everytime I go to school i'm filled with dread about how maybe they moved and they'll see me and tell everyone. I'm afraid to interact or make friends with anyone because i'm afraid they'll ask me about my old school and know someone from their and they'll ask them about me and they'll tell them i'm the crazy person who used and take pictures of people to make sure they were real. My last breakdown was so bad that i didn't go to school for weeks this was during my mom important medical therpy sessions and she couldn't go because she had to look after me. because of this i feel like my mother and father hate me and they may tell me they love but their lying just so they can kick me out when i'm 18.

i‚Äôm getting semi-stalkerish vibes from one of my boyfriend‚Äôs friends(?),"this is gonna be a confusing time,and i‚Äôve had trouble figuring out which subreddit to post this in,but i settled here since i might just be overthinking things.

i got contacted by someone on instagram,asking me if i was a guy or not. at first i was confused,he didn‚Äôt follow anyone i was following,nor did he follow anyone my boyfriend followed. i had dodged the question and just asked who they are,however,they responded by asking the same question again. i answered just by saying that i was biologically a girl. he had acknowledged my response and afterwards i asked why he contacted me. he said that ‚Äúmy friend wanted me to ask you.‚Äù i had asked who was said friend,but the only detail i got was that their name started with a J. apparently,said friend had a crush on my boyfriend,and did not know if my boyfriend was gay or not. i had accepted this reason,and conversed with the person a little more before going to do my own thing. 

here‚Äôs the kicker,my boyfriend did not give out his instagram to anyone,merely two people,both of which names did not start with J. and my boyfriend only knew one person with a J name,which is who i‚Äôm suspicious of. so i was wondering,how did they get my account? my boyfriend follows quite a few people,and so i‚Äôm deducing that they went through his following to find me. which is a little weird to me. afterwards,instead of asking me or my boyfriend directly,used a friend to ask me if i was a guy? we both have no idea who‚Äôs the friend,or maybe merely a stranger,who had a crush on him. i deal with anxiety and paranoia,which is why i‚Äôve been uneasy this whole time. this whole thing could be a prank but it would be a kinda elaborate prank wouldn‚Äôt it? i‚Äôm probably overthinking this,what should i do? how do i deal with this anxiety,and is this normal?

Sudden death/health paranoia,"I've had some paranoia before, delusional thinking- particularly when going through extreme periods of anxiety or stress, or when feeling disassociated. Nothing for a while.

However over the past couple of days, perhaps slightly over weeks, I've been really worried I'm going to die suddenly, or that something is really wrong with me. I started bleeding when it wasn't time for my period, which really concerned me thinking I had cancer or something. I quickly learned my periods had just changed, becoming irregular, but nothing really to worry about. (It has been said the jab can cause this temporarily in women so I didn't feel like it was anything to be concerned about, and nothing has come of it since so I'm in the clear). But later I started feeling like my heart was beating irregularly and kept wearing my fitbit everywhere, checking my heartrate constantly. I told everybody how I thought I was really ill and needed to see a doctor but the doctor wouldn't see me. Over time, I kind of forgot about this process of thought after my fitbit ran out of charge and I lost the charger. I stopped checking my heart so often and subsequently, I stop feeling it beating 'irregularly'.

This past week I've been sick with the flu and tonsillitis. I've never experienced the flu before although I have experienced tonsillitis, kind of expected it to be like it's been before, but it was so much worse. I was concerned when I was so dizzy I almost couldn't make it to the bathroom. I started experiencing a high pitched sound in my ear, which has now radiated to both my ears and never stops. My headache was bad when I first got ill then as I've gotten better I felt like I was getting over the worst, but my head is now pounding again in such a way I had to look up brain aneurism to make sure I wasn't just about to die. My neck and head hurt so much, but I know logically lying in bed for three days will cause a stiff neck. I just keep thinking there's something really wrong, then rationally knowing I'm probably fine, but with a sneaky voice saying ""but what if you're not?"" It's really annoying. 

I'm not even afraid of death. I die in my dreams all the time, it's even kinda fun (I lucid dream a lot, so most of the time I know I'm actually not dying). I guess I am afraid of dying suddenly and not having a chance to say how I feel to my family and friends, I am very bad at not knowing. I just don't know why this train of thought has kicked off all of a sudden, and how to reign it in. I've been isolated from my colleagues for a good 6 days now I guess, and I work pretty consistently, work is a part of my identity at this point which may be why I feel a bit disconnected right now. On the other hand, I've enjoyed being away from work and if I was well, I would have been delighted with this time off, a chance to get my University work done and talk with online friends. 

In contrast to other paranoid thoughts I've had in the past, I'd say these are relatively harmless and don't drastically change my lifestyle, but I would like to try and do something about them in case they get out of control. Any suggestions? I don't have any diagnosis of mental health conditions other than Anxiety, Depression and ADHD. I'm 25, Female.",1
Do you think that there are people out there that do things just to intentionally inconvenience you even though they gain nothing from it?,"Like people that drive five miles under the speed limit in front of you but when you get to a passing zone they speed up so you don't pass?

However, he mentioned that nowadays he is always feeling paranoid that his food is being poisoned. He even mentioned that he stopped working and is seeing a therapist. It is a sad to see him become like this. 

I am just looking for some advice as to how I, as a friend could help. 

I have already asked him to go exercise together. 

Thank you.",1
I think this is becoming a huge problem,"I have such bad paranoia it‚Äôs taking over my life. The other day I had the worst panic attack I‚Äôve ever had bc I looked around and no one was home, which was rlly unusual. I confused myself everyone in the world was gone and had to kms and I was freaking out so bad, I convinced myself for six months people could read my mind and I couldn‚Äôt even think. For months I thoight there were cameras in my room. How do I even tell people ab this????? It‚Äôs so outrageously stupid and no one would understand",1
Why do I feel like everyone‚Äôs always lying to me?,"I always feel like everyone‚Äôs lying to me, even over the most mundane stuff. Someone could tell me that they‚Äôve eaten pho and in my mind I just automatically feel like they‚Äôre lying. I hardly ever believe anything someone says, and I don‚Äôt know why. I haven‚Äôt been lied to an excessive amount, so why is it impossible for me to take anyone at face value?",1
Feeling paranoid about past porn,"Back in February I googled someone‚Äôs name who I knew and saw nude images. I know they were of age because they were from Snapchat and snap chat came out after we were 18. All of these images were indexed from 4chans b, which I had also never heard of. So in Google, I‚Äôd see related images and saw some other people I knew, and saved a few images on my phone (from Google), only to delete them immediately after. Never thought anything of this. Fast forward to now, about a month ago while doing some self reflection- I realized how messed up it was to even look at images of people who clearly didn‚Äôt post their own nudes. I‚Äôm freaking the hell out that WHAT IF one of the images I saved was some illegal image or something?! I‚Äôm beyond paranoid. I‚Äôm just expecting my door to be kicked in any day, and my life will be ruined. I can‚Äôt eat really, I can‚Äôt think of anything else or be myself anymore. My only hope is that if that were the case, I‚Äôd have been in trouble by now? That‚Äôs about the only thing I can tell myself 100 times a day to give myself some sense of relief. Has anyone been in a scenario similar to this before? Any form of support or advice is appreciated.",1
Can't distract myself from thoughts anymore,"It's been a while since I last posted something here, and my mental health is even worse now. I used to be able to distract myself from my thoughts by playing a game or listening to music, but I've gotten to the point where I always hear my thoughts. It has made me very delusional, and I feel like a maniac. I can barely talk to my boyfriend anymore without breaking down for no reason.

Sort of unrelated, but I am suspecting that I have borderline personality disorder. It would probably be best to get a professional to see if that is the case, but I have grown extremely distrustful of therapists for some reason.",1
Do you mentally plan out your days?,"I have been doing this forever but ever sense I‚Äôve moved I‚Äôve been noticing it a lot more.

I always get insanely stressed and anxious if I break away from the plan at any point I. The day.",1
is this normal? or just anxiety?,"As long as i could i've always had constant paranoid thoughts. My main one i had for a while was I always thought God would put something/poison my drink when i went to put the container back in the fridge(weird i know) And every little sound i hear i immediately assume the worst. For example i could hear a noise from the living room where my mom is at and i'll think ""she's getting harmed in there"" And when i take my dog out i always feel like the cars are watching me",1
Are there any jobs better suited to people prone to paranoia?,"I‚Äôd like to work however I‚Äôm not so sure I‚Äôd be able to do work that requires a lot of abstract thinking. 

Any ideas on work that is more concrete and grounded so I don‚Äôt lose myself to my errors in thinking?

I was thinking an electrician, labour work, landscaping.

Any suggestions? I think it need to be quite simple and routine as otherwise I get lost in the madness of my mind.",1

I heard a jet flying over last night,"I live in a rural area where there is almost never any jets that fly over, and i heard one flying really low over my area and I instantly opened the window and looked outside waiting to see if bombs were gonna drop. 

It‚Äôs strange to me because lately I‚Äôve been very paranoid and I‚Äôm usually not. Like it will come and go and be subtle but the past couple weeks it‚Äôs been lots of paranoid thoughts.

The endgame,"Not sure if I‚Äôm in the right subreddit, but does anyone have this horrible fear that everyone within the next few generations will die painfully and we will not be able to develop a ‚Äúsweet release‚Äù style euthanasia?

Hard time trusting,"I‚Äôve always had a bit of a skeptical nature since I was a kid. But then my best friend (like ride or die  soul sister) in college told me after two years into our friendship that she had lied to me about being raped and having an abortion. (And I had cried with her, prayed with her, etc.) I felt like life was not what I thought it was. She‚Äôs not in my life and she‚Äôs not the point. 

I was so surprised and never guessed that. Ever since I guess I‚Äôve had a really hard time trusting people. I‚Äôve been to therapy. I‚Äôve done emdr. It just still bothers me. Idk how to heal ? I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm even writing it but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm paranoid that that could happen again. I‚Äôm paranoid that I could be missing red flags or ignoring them.

Scared of rabies,"Hello dont know if this is the right reddit to post this but

Last night I came home from class on campus. We get out pretty late because it's a 3 hour class so thats kind of unfortunate. 

Anyway as I was getting out of class I put my hand on my head because im super paranoid about bats, even if I've never seen on in my life. I've just been paranoid about this for the past 7 months now.

I didnt see anything, I didnt hear anything and I didn't feel anything of the sort. but I heard that you dont really feel bat bites so im getting extra paranoid

It was also extremely dark so I feel like I wouldn't be able to see anything either.

im just scared and I want reassurance that nothing was there?

its just a huge fear of mine honestly and I don't know how to convince myself that there wasn't a bat and that I dont have rabies

im scared of dying.",1

"Can't really make friends, or completely trust them","Recently I have gotten into college and... I'll be honest I want to be more social. 


But I always have this deep seeded fear of what other people might do. Even my closest friends I have nuggets of suspicion about. I spent a lot of time in therapy, but really I only got worse. I've long considered buying a handgun to carry with me and hiding my identity best I can. The idea of someone knowing who I am scares me. The idea of going places with people freaks me out. The idea of having people come to my house scares me. 

I don't think I'll be able to properly make friends. Idk people just seem to build a lot of relationships easy but I can't. And if I do I can't break them because of my fear of what they might do. They might doxx me or kill me or kidnap me or something. I'm still looking over my shoulder because I stopped talking to a friend who lives in my town. I just don't know what to do. I can't trust people enough to get close and keeping a distance just feels safe. You never know people enough to know they aren't gonna hurt you, and that's a worry constantly.",1
The Bathroom Scenario,"I get these scenarios that pop into my head and cause me to be paranoid all the time over things that have a very little chance of ever happening. Please note that I am on medication and I do share these scenarios with a professional. 

My newest one involving the bathroom in my house. See, my bathroom only has a small window. It‚Äôs between the shower and the toilet. From the outside you can‚Äôt even see ones shadow because it‚Äôs up so high. The scenario I keep having when I go in there is someone seeing me turn the light on, stand in front of the toilet to either sit to use the bathroom or to undress to get in the shower and just shoot me through the window in my head. 

It‚Äôs like I can see the outside of my house, the mysterious shadow person lurking in the deer grass (some tall grass that the deer like in my yard). I can see him (because mysterious shadow person is always a man, idk, I don‚Äôt make the rules when it comes to my thoughts) move closer to the window to get a better shot, pull out his gun and shoot. 

The scene switches to inside my bathroom where the glass breaks, and just before I have the chance to look over, my body falls lifeless onto the tile. The scene switches to my 4 month old crying in his crib from the loud noises waking him. The scene switches back to me laying on the tile just gone. Unknowing of what happened and what will happen to my son and my fianc√© now that I‚Äôm gone. 

Whenever this happens in my head I tend to duck when I enter the bathroom and avoid getting too close to the window. I find standing in front of my bathroom sink stressful because I can‚Äôt duck and still see in the mirror. I sometimes find the intrusive thoughts after that scenario playing to be too much and so I‚Äôll leave the bathroom without finishing or starting what I went in to do (excluding using the toilet cause I can‚Äôt just get up midshit or piss). 

I have a major fear of death, no understanding of the afterlife and don‚Äôt know how to react to death. I‚Äôm a paranoid schizophrenic. Most of my paranoia comes from that fear of death so therefore most of the scenarios end in my death while others end in my fianc√© or my sons death. I have many other repeatable scenarios that pop into my head every day. It‚Äôs interesting when I get a new one because it only takes one time seeing that in my head to never go away. 

Most of the time these main scenarios are followed by a plethora of intrusive and unsettling thoughts. These thoughts will continue until I change what I‚Äôm doing or where I‚Äôm at to get rid of that setting, or they won‚Äôt stop until I‚Äôve found some resting time, whether it be laying down for a short nap or just finding a moment to collect myself. I have also found that i have more throughout the day and night since I‚Äôve had my son. 

Just wanted to share something publicly that I struggle with anonymously. Also once again please remember that I do see a professional and I do share these issues with said professional. I live a normal life aside from my mental flaws. Please delete if not allowed.",1
Virus on computer worries,"My parents weren't tech savvy at all when I was growing up so we had no kind of virus protection on our desktop. Thing was awful by the time we finally retired it.

Anyways, I never used a computer much except for college, I usually just use my phone or tablet. But lately I've been using my laptop a lot and on Firefox, just now, I got a ""network error caused the video download to fail partway"" on something I was watching (adult site).

I'm worried something was downloaded because I don't actually download anything, just watch. I don't know if that's Firefox's version of buffering or what, but I'm paranoid now because I don't have any kind of virus protection (don't know what to get). Honestly I thought Macs didn't get them, and I thought Firefox was good about stopping stuff from downloading. I feel like an idiot, and I don't know how to see if something's wrong.",1
"Can't sleep, too scared.","I'm 18 and I can't sleep.

The thing is I was never afraid, I never once thought that the monster from a movie will come and kill me. I was never scared, until 3 weeks ago. All of a sudden I am seeing shadows in the dark like I see a silhouette in pure dark, I'm thinking a killer is in my closet, behind the desk, next to me, and I can't sleep. Even when I turn the lights on and see that nothing is in my room I can't leave my room to go the bathroom because of the killer in the hallway. I didn't sleep in the last 3 days at all. At first, I would turn my laptop so I can have light in my room, however soon I started to need a sound so I started to watch youtube videos that talk about kid's shows so I can have my thoughts on something other than me dying.

Can paranoia suddenly develop?,"I've always been a bit anxious, but recently things have taken a turn to the extreme. I have had trouble in the past, being threatened etc, but back then I never felt as much fear as I do when I have delusions of persecution.

This also happens when I am in the presence of police, I feel they are after me every time I pass by them

Now, I want to disclose that I have not been diagnosed. I can understand diagnosis takes time and I am working it out with a psychotherapist.

I keep having these are bouts of paranoia and I dont know how to fix it,"When I was about 13 or 14, in high school, i used to feel like someday, for whatever reason, someone (not someone in particular, just about anyone) would attack me. I started bringing box cutters in my jackets and eventually a knife in my backpack for self-defense. It pretty much went away when the pandemic started and we no longer had class in person, around spring of 2020.

By autumn of 2020, I had driven away a few online friends from me, because I kept thinking they hated me and were telling everyone I was a bad person and I would end up isolated, and I eventually lashed out at them.

And as of now, I fear most of my friends dislike me and at any time will make me an outcast. I dont know why I think that way, they have invited me to meet them in a few months and have even bought me a thing for when I go. But I still do feel that way and I fear what that will lead me to.",1

moving into college has been really hard,"i just moved into college & it‚Äôs the first time i‚Äôve shared a room with someone since my sister back in middle school. i‚Äôm living with 3 other people and our apartment has almost no noise suppression and it feels like i have to constantly walk on eggshells. i also have an eating disorder and it‚Äôs really hard for me to eat in front of other people, and the fact that they can hear any time i open a bag has made it even harder. i‚Äôm genuinely terrified of what they‚Äôre thinking when i hide in the closet to unwrap a piece of gum because i know they can hear it. 

one of our roommates also moved in earlier than the rest of us & i cant get the thought out of my head that she planted cameras in certain areas to watch if i do something she doesn‚Äôt approve of (she seems to be fairly uptight & strict and i‚Äôm constantly scared of angering her even though as of now she‚Äôs shown nothing but kindness). she‚Äôs also the only one in our apartment this weekend and i can‚Äôt get the thought out of my head that she‚Äôs going through all my belongings to find reasons to hate me when i come back. 

living in the same room as someone has been especially hard, and ive found myself essentially watching her sleep to make sure she isn‚Äôt watching what i do at night. i also keep finding myself watching my roommate who works at the desk behind me in the reflection of my computer screen to make sure she‚Äôs not turning around to watch me instead.

I want to die. Do you know what to do?,"I'm so paranoiac that I don't want to live. Life is a torture everyday. I do things only because I'm afraid that people would hit me, shout at me, enslave me or betray me. Because of the fear, I feel totally helpless, so I don't want to live.

Once I'm not with people around me, or more specifically people who could hit, judge or shout at me, I do no more than playing or doing exactly what immature idiot things I can do until I die. Since I do these things, I have no productivity. But because some people always come and force me to do things, I stay alive. Once I face my professional obligations, I'm totally helpless because I've barely worked. This is a vicious spiral in which I've been stuck for years. Recently, I told two big lies at work because of too much anxiety and I feel like they're going to blow up in my face very soon.

It's been months that I sleep less than 6 hours a day because I see no point to life and because I'm always trying to see nobody (I want to become nocturnal since others are diurnal). I'm saturating. I don't know what to do. I want to die but suicide is too hard at the same time. I don't feel like I can believe anyone. No-bo-dy. I trust no-bo-dy.",1
Having breakdowns over ever little thing [suicide TW],"I suffer from really bad paranoia : and it‚Äôs just been getting worse more recently. Every comment, the slightest slip of wording sends me into a full on breakdown because I just automatically assume everyone in this world wants me dead and are going to stop at nothing to get me there. 

No one understands this either. I‚Äôve had several people complained to me about how the way I act effects them, but even after I try to explain that I‚Äôm paranoid and think they‚Äôre trying to hurt me, or ruin my life (I explain as nicely as I can and try and assure them it isn‚Äôt their fault I‚Äôm just mentally ill), all they think about is how it effects them. I try to apologise but then they say things that make me even more paranoid and before you know it it‚Äôs another suicide attempt because I‚Äôm so scared they‚Äôre gonna come to my house and try and kill me themselves.

I would be saying all of this to my therapist right now, but I fucking can‚Äôt. She‚Äôs been off for 4 months, and I‚Äôm on my last straw. My paranoia, and my MDD are fucking ruining my life.",1

I keep worrying because it feels like my anxiety may save my life. All that rabies fear.,"My rabies anxiety started to rule over my life. I try to cope with it my having monthly projects but what if I die in 2 months?

In my holiday, while I was swinging, my toes touched a flying creature but I don't remember what flying creature it was precisely. I remember it has distinct wings though. It may be a butterfly, a moth, or even a bat! I highly doubt bat is a likely possibility because I saw the flying creature for like 2-3 seconds and did not move from my place. I think it may have been too slow or even too small for a bat. If it was a bat, I would probably only see a big flash for a split second instead. I don't even remember bat wings but I remember a black/grayish color. I actually saw bats in the area but they were flying high at night. This event happened during sunset instead. I sometimes try to reassure myself by thinking if it was a bat, I would have known it or I would have shuffled my feet away (or not able to because bats are much faster than moths/butterflies)

OK. Now the worrying part. I had a very small and old wound on one of my toes (3-4 days old at that time, not bleeding, no scab). Maybe it was a rabid bat that happened to fly slowly and some saliva touched the small old wound? For sure, there was no bite or scratch from that animal, only a small preexisting old wound. (which may not even count as open wound by that time but some of the ""toeprint"" wasn't present, the skin color was intact though, just looked like smooth new skin) Maybe my memory is wrong and it was actually a bat? They say that a bat flying during sunset is completely normal but my anxious mind says that it's definitely an odd behavior and it's definitely a rabid bat.

When I told my family about the vaccine, they went crazy and insulted me as if I was mentally defective. Yes, they know that rabies is 100% fatal. Yes, I told them the so-called ""wound"". But it didn't work. I guess I need to see what happens without the PEP.

**If I wasn't worrying about rabies for a month, for various reasons, I wouldn't even CONSIDER a bat exposure and even if it was indeed a bat, I wouldn't consider a rabies risk.** But now I keep my worry with me. Not only I don't even attempt to remove my worry, I even think removing my worry would be dangerous. It's like if I think it's a bat exposure FOR SURE, I'll try to get the vaccine, no matter the harsh consequences. But I'm not sure. It may not have been a bat at all. There may not even be a contact at all. Even if there was a contact, it may only have contacted the intact skin. But sometimes, I vividly imagine my parents' regret and depression, while I'm lying in my deathbed with a foaming mouth and hydrophobia.

I try to reassure myself by telling myself that if I wasn't having a rabies fear for a month, I wouldn't even consider an exposure but at the same time, I sometimes think my paranoia may save my life. But sometimes, it feels like someone told my death date to 3 months later. OK. At least I know my anxiety doesn't increase the chance of rabies, it may even decrease it. Even if the chances are almost zero, I sometimes think I may have won the rabies lottery with an unheard transmission method. Also, I live in Turkey, not USA. I know I wasn't exposed to bats indoors but my OCD-like self sometimes tells that I may have left the door open.

BTW, if I try to deal with this without the vaccine, the result would probably be exactly the same as what would happen without that anxiety. (unless I had a death instinct at that time and knowingly touched a rabid animal, which is too unlikely to even consider)",1
I think my brother is really paranoid.,"So he‚Äôs going on holiday and he just said in my group chat:


‚ÄúHey, I just thought, I wonder if they‚Äôre taking me on holiday to kill me. I‚Äôm going to take a knife‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck it, crap. This could honestly happen. Okay I‚Äôve said it now, if I go missing it‚Äôs not an accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay this could happen, tell the police this if they investigate my body‚Äù 


This goes on for a while. We also saw his ex the other day walking down the street, they‚Äôve not seen in 3 years and he theorised that she must have been stalking him and following him, so we should wait near her school and ‚Äústalk her‚Äù.

He also has pride in himself for the fact that he always considers every possibility but it sounds a bit more like that a justification for being paranoid.",1

Extremely paranoid about most parts of my life. Need advice on how to handle thoughts and emotions.,"Throw away account because I'm ashamed. I know the rules say to search for similar posts, but I wanted to not only have responses that were specific to my situation, but also to vent a little. I don't have anyone I can talk to about this and I feel like it's ruining my life. 

I have paranoia. I don't know what mental disorder it stems from. All I do know, is that it's very much taking control of my life. I'm paranoid about losing my job even when I don't think I've done something terribly wrong. I'm paranoid about the health and safety of my mother. Especially, for the past few years, I've been extremely paranoid that she will fall in the shower. I check my phone often to see when she was last online, just to make sure she's okay. If I haven't' heard from her in a few days, I get a sick feeling and have to call or text right away, and I get very upset when she doesn't answer or reply right away too. Worst of all, the worst paranoia I have ever felt, is about my boyfriend cheating on me. It comes on fast and strong. It's always the strangest things that cause it too and the smallest of acts set it off. It's been causing a lot of problems lately because I've just been coming right out and sharing these thoughts. He tells me I'm accusing. I don't mean to come off that way. I just want to ask right out if the thoughts I'm having are true or not. It's been all day, every day for 2 weeks now really bad. It's been years with me being paranoid, and normally I am able to push the thoughts to the side and ignore them. But sometimes, they are so strong and so believable I can't help but to give into them. My brain puts all these pieces together, and no matter how ridiculous they may seem to everyone else, they make sense to me. They could never not make sense. Typically, it lasts for a few days, and then I just wake up and I'm not that worried about it anymore. But lately, it's not gone away and every time a new paranoid thought comes up, it just adds more fuel to it and it's scaring me. I don't want to lose this man but I'm doing nothing good for him or us by coming off as accusatory and I don't want to hurt his feelings. I know, when I'm not feeling paranoid, that he would never be unfaithful or do anything to hurt me, but the paranoia is so strong. I know I have issues with trusting people and I often worry that I don't trust him and maybe that's the problem? 

Any advice from similar situations would be greatly appreciated. Also, if you take any medications that have or still do help, let me know. I should also mention, I have very severe anxiety about every aspect of my life and I'm thinking that maybe causes the paranoia? I really don't know. But what can I do when I'm feeling so enraged and fueled by paranoid thoughts? And what if they don't go away? I know I've read it's possible to have a good relationship with someone that has paranoia, but I'm really feeling like this is all my life will ever be and I should just stay single as not to hurt the people I get close with.",1

Abuse or Paranoia?,"Sorry for the long post
I try to summarize it as hard as it really is for me. 
I have always had a bad relationship with my parents, especially with my mother where since she tended to be very rude because I am the son she never wanted as I was already the 3 'and during pregnancy my father who was an alcoholic at the time beat her so this has already marked (as if I were at fault) being labeled as the unwanted child, the black sheep etc. ...
Being strong in character since I was 4-5 years old when I saw my mother's verbal abuse towards me I (wrongly eh) raised my hands to my mother. Of course how much physical strength could I have at that age? Almost nothing. And after several times that this happened my mother tried to kill me by grabbing me by the hair and making me hit my head on the sink several times. As luck would have it, my older brother saved me.
The abuse from my mother after this event never subsided. But I simply learned to ignore her and keep it all inside (at most telling my father if it was really bad).
The verbal abuse growing up became comparisons to my brother, how he was, better looking, better behaved, more independent etc.... Taking me to make me hate him when I had no envy towards him, on the contrary, I have only good memories.
All this has carried obviously to other consequences, between closing me, distrust in the persons etc... So much so that then I suffered bullying and so on. I have always been happy in my ""loneliness"" because after elementary school I discovered video games (obviously also targeted by my mother). My whole childhood was like this: always fighting with my mother, one day she is the best person in the world, the next day she criticizes anything I do.
After middle school it was always a grow up until I had dozens of friends in high school and up to two groups where I was always among the most loved by the group.
In 5 'high finally I get engaged but after a fight with my girlfriend I get my first panic attack that affects everything I love, questioning everything (and if she does not love you, and if you are actually in the various groups of friends to be teased and if you have always hated even video games etc. ...)
After this event the end. After being the one who listened to his friends for years, he asks for advice for the first time and by doing so everyone looks at me wrong as if I were crazy. The question was just a confirmation of what I was thinking to push away the anxieties (i.e. asked them if it was just stuff in my head or something else). I get looked at sideways and almost made fun of by everyone and no one knows what to tell me. Some people almost forcibly tell me it's like I say, my girlfriend gets mad at me for doubting myself and takes it personally like I don't really love her.
I don't trust my friends anymore and I'm gradually closing my bridges with everyone, even those who used to agree with me (because I wasn't convinced by their answers).
After two years I ask my mother for help now exhausted and my mother every time I bring up something from the past, even if something stupid says that either it's different or it didn't happen at all. For example a few days ago I scold her saying that she is a superficial person who every time she can says if a certain person is fat or has gained weight. And after pointing it out to her she says ""but if you do it all the time too"", I tell her I never did it and she looks at me all weird asking me and: ""and how many times have you done it, few, many, medium"" as if to humor me because she is afraid of her crazy son. 


I have only talked about it with her, my father and my aunt, and a couple of my close friends. One of my friends gave me all his support one day by believing me and reassuring me and the next day he acted almost as if we had never talked about it. My mother acts this way.
A friend of mine also understood me completely but I'm afraid the same thing will happen as with my old friend.
The only ones who continue to always behave are my father and my aunt. 
I don't know what to believe anymore, what if these three people who agree with me are just in my head? 
I really want to understand if it's my mom manipulating me so much and it's my anxiety that overeacts or something else
Until a while ago I was more confident but then one day arguing with my mother she said I always had very few friends. It really makes me doubt everything....",1
"Mother is Paranoid, Any tips on what to do?","Hello  everyone, this might be a long post but I'll try to keep things clear and concise. My middle aged disabled mother  thinks the government is spying on her. She rarely leaves the house and  when she does, she doesn't leave the car. She thinks there are  undercover people taking pictures of her, listening to her through electronics, and trying to arrest her for god knows what. She has been  putting towels over phones, putting paper over random electronics (e.g. the lights on a ps3 even though I told her there's no camera in it), and  is very suspicious of all strangers I'm unsure if this is the cause of  her medication (she takes plenty of meds for her pain), her lack of friends/social activity (she mostly talks with me and my two siblings), or something else.

I've been very calm and rational with addressing this problem with her, but she has told me that she knows she seems crazy, but at least God understands her. She's very stubborn and gets  angry whenever we have conversations that makes her feel uncomfortable.  When I asked her about how this all will end, she said she'll either end  up arrested or God will ""deliver her"" from this. Idk what she means by  this but she comes off as if she's given up. Her disability has made life very painful for her and she usually just watches TV everyday while  dealing with her pains.

I live about about an hour or two away from her for work and don't have a car  for easy transportation to help her. I'm trying my best to be calm and  supportive but I hate that I can't do much while my mom's mind is deteriorating. My siblings are a double edge sword in all of this since  they're both helpful and toxic for my mother. They're easily frustrated  and emotional whenever my mom gets too overbearing (she can get very  angry and mean when things doesn't turn out her way). My brother helps  sometimes since he lives with her but he is very junky, stubborn, and conceited. My mom likes a clean house and my brother constantly dirties  up the place. My sister on the other hand can be supportive but her  awful relationships and financial troubles causes her to be very toxic. She constantly borrows money from us, manipulates/lies, and can be  downright rude at times.

My sister  and I have been wanting to do an intervention on my mother but my  brother doesn't want to do it. I'm trying to listen and be supportive of  everyone, but I don't know what to do and I'm tired of all this  emotional labor. Action needs to happen but with my brother constantly working and focusing on his own interests while my sister is working and  focusing on relationships/partying/etc, it can't happen. I've been telling my mom I think she should go to counseling/therapy, but I don't think she's going to do it. She only trusts one counselor she went to  years ago, and has told me she would try to find her ""one of these days.""

I have paranoia when going out because of my vulnerable state,"Hello all, thank you for happening upon my post this evening,

I just wanted to write a quick message, not feeling particularly great but need to finish some tasks today so can't spend too long with an elaborate post

I do experience irrational paranoia inside the house when i am severely in a confused state (which is intertwined with my condition), as when you get confused as i do (and maybe you do) its easy to work yourself up and essentially become frightened of anything as nothing quite makes sense

However whenever i am out, especially when alone and away from concentrated civilisation, i have shear fear that puts me in an unnecessary hyperaware state. I feel this fear because of my state of vulnerability with my conditions, which are quite debilitating.

Recently, i was in a place where there were civilisation around but not inside. I happened upon a man, not sure if he knew i was there but he was overweight, and had full-cuffed earphones on, he may even have been singing. If i had hostile intentions, lets just say nobody else was around. It stuck with me because i have no idea how one achieves that level of ignorance

My rational brain assumes its because as most of his experience outside has been positive, or perhaps he hasn't had anything happen once, what reason does he have? Ignorance is bliss. Neglect to mention though, as long as the mind was iron-willed, he could easily defend himself if aggressively approached in some way, or atleast not be defenseless

But i don't have that ability to be ignorant, and personally i think it'd be fine if i could rationally ensure there is no threat, and just be aware of my surroundings, but this fear is irrational. I can visually discern a threat but i don't feel at ease after verifying there is no threat. My medical conditions (Which are not all confirmed and some are still being investigated) puts me in a severely vulnerable state. I'm talking sensitivity to heat (basically heat= painful itching (sometimes) & worsening symptoms, e.g cognitive problems worsened), trouble balancing, slow processing and thinking, forgetfulness (So i'll have to often rescan my environment anyway as i forget it so often) fatigue and tiredness on the daily, etc. So this isn't a normal situation to begin with

This fear has probably come up because i know there are bad people in the world, but also i have pretty uncommon problems, even with speaking, listening and remembering, so i guess i also discern someone speaking to me as a threat because how i'm belittled and how i feel speaking to people that don't understand my health problems, which has been most.

I'm doing my best to shake this feeling, i'm trying to go out everyday and hope repeated exposure will do something, i have hopes it'll improve but was wondering what advice this community may have? I think i can understand the reasoning behind much of my behaviour, but unfortunately it is my health conditions cure-dependent, and there's not much i can do about that right now, so my ears are wide open for alternative ideas

This probably isn't a typical case around here, i appreciate that. But any advice you could think of to help out would be much appreciated, thank you!",1

"paranoia induced by ""childhood trauma""","due to a number of inconveniences in childhood, i kind of use the internet as a form of escapism and to vent. i have a locked twitter account that i use as my journal. i tweet whatever i want there cause no one follows me and so it's kind of like my own personal space to kind of get my thoughts out of my head. sometimes i'll post things here on reddit too when i want people to validate my feelings so i don't feel crazy. but i have this paranoia that i'll die, police will go through my phone and reveal this whole double life on the internet that i've been living to my family (i suppose that's what you get when you mix childhood trauma and a cop show addiction like monk psych criminal minds since childhood) and that would be super aaahhhhhshfndnfndnfnd you know? i think i'm just scared of people finding out how i really feel and making me out to be the bad guy about my own feelings",1

Horrible paranoia threatening to ruin my relationship with my family,"I‚Äôm not gonna give a long prefacing ramble, so let‚Äôs just get straight to the heart of the issue- I am paranoid that my dad drugs me in my sleep and possibly rapes me while I am drugged. Yes, I know, that‚Äôs kind of heavy. These thoughts come and go, but when they stick around I find myself becoming completely lost in them. I find it all so disgusting and terrifying and disturbing. My mind and body instantly become riddled with anxiety. I feel like I am constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown, because of how much this paranoia weighs on me.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt trust my dad, which is probably why I am paranoid in the first place. What makes it all worse is that I currently live with my parent‚Äôs, though I am trying to save up money to move out. I just feel so confused and stressed over this all. It‚Äôs like when I start having these thoughts my capacity for rational thinking and reasoning completely disappears, and I feel truly unable to discern reality from what sinister scenarios my mind has conjured up. 

My worst fear is that the drugging my dad is doing to me (supposedly, according to the paranoia) is going to give me permanent brain damage, and eventually my brain will be so damaged that I will be rendered a human vegetable, more or less. And then maybe I will no longer be functional enough to live on my own, and so I will be trapped, forced to live out the rest of my days with my parents while being in a nearly brain-dead stupor. Even writing all of this out right now is giving me massive amounts of anxiety. 

I don‚Äôt know where to turn next. I have a therapist, but I am worried that she will think I‚Äôm really mentally ill if I tell her these thoughts. I‚Äôm a generally competent and functional person in most areas of my life so I feel as if this paranoia is too ‚Äúout there‚Äù and dark to confess to her. But admittedly I also feel at my wit‚Äôs end, and I have this sense that if I don‚Äôt take action soon, I may end up in an even worse place than I already am. Sigh‚Ä¶I feel so scared.",1
Paranoid About Scaring Away Friends Because of Paranoia,"Does anybody else experience this often?

Due to childhood trauma I have very limited social experience and now that I am 20 I am really trying hard to make friends and be a good friend/person. But I get worried about literally any signal, like my struggling friend who only responds with ""K"" or other simple texts like that and I overreact. Then I hate myself later for overreacting and dig myself deeper.",1
How to trust anyone enough to pursue treatment,"I have fears about service providers. Long story, i have been mismedicated and misdiagnosed and mistreated by them to never trust one again. Now that they recognize i have intense mental health struggles, instead of writing me off as a lazy bastard with ADHD who isn't trying hard enough, ignoring my panic, dissociation, mania and thoughts which i know are ""paranoid"" only in retrospect when i am better (less psychotic) and wonder how the hell i thought that way. Some of those thoughts people tell me are ""paranoid"" though, like my therapist told me yesterday, i don't veiw as such. The main thing is i've learned i can't trust psychiatrists, emergency rooms, crisis beds and any other crisis service or source of psych meds. I know i struggle with unmanageable problems (i just broke 4 days straight of too much energy no sleep hypomania among other things) and no one i know who's this fucked up is medication free, but i've spent most of the last 5 years med free after my medication-induced psychotic break. It's bad enough that if i swallow pills i frequently throw them up involuntarily. I have been on them recently but never more than a couple months, and only at extremely low doses. I honestly feel that the only providers available to me drove me insane intentionally and am terrified it will happen with all of them after what they put me through. I don't know how to trust any psychiatrist to the point where i can get stabilized. I know i'm ranting but i don't want a generic ""just go to a-proffessional/hospital/etc. What's the worst that could happen"" As i have a history with these people and know what the worst that can happen is. I just want to be healthy to the point where i feel safe reaching out for help.",1
"I feel like someone is always watching me, waiting to murder me.","Ok so I have definitely watched quite a bit of horror/scary videos, movies and stories, so perhaps this is the reason, but it‚Äôs really starting to bug me now. I‚Äôve always had the feeling that someone is watching me, or that there‚Äôs someone in my home, awaiting to kill. 

But, for some reason the feeling has grown even stronger. Especially when I go workout in my basement, the room I‚Äôm least in or most unfamiliar with, I can‚Äôt stop looking at the different dark corners and rooms. I just feel like the second I look away and look back, a terrifying person/thing will be staring at me and would be right next to me. I do live with my parents and brother as I‚Äôm a teen, so I am pretty secure and stuff, but even after I determine that it would be highly improbable for some stranger to be in my home, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that it could happen. 

Another example is when I‚Äôm in the shower, when I close my eyes, I always have to open them quickly to check if anyone is there. 

Got any suggestions?",1
Scared of sleeping after watching documentary about sleep paralysis,"Dear People after watching a scary documentary about sleep paralysis i can only start sleeping after 3 am when i hear the birds chirping. At first in the documentary i though well seems like this only happens to girls, then an male intervee appeared. Then i though well at least theay cant't get raped ( as it was already a fear by me. Then an interveee explained that he got raped ( british guy ) during Sleep Paralysis (SP) one time. THat somehow really triggert me. Combined with another documentary of a guy saying that he was part of a satanist wizard group explaining 00 o cklock being ghost hour and 3 am being devils hour. These 2 documentaries together combined have helped to scare the shit out of me. for 3 months i couldn't sleep naturally befor 3 am because i am so scared and i am 28 years old so embarresed and scared to talk to a psychologist because i don't want to be laughed at. I am literally scared of being raped during SP (during devils hour and before ) although i've never encountered it. 

I have never encountered ghosts sometimes maybe objects falling during strange times but thats about it. 

Can anybody help me how to get out of that fear spiral so i can finally sleep again normal ? 

I am scared about my future because i have this strange sleep  hinderance now scared of not being able to work. I lieterally can only calm down after 3 am. Who can fall asleep while being scared ?

Scared and don't really trust anyone,"Whoever might read this, might automatically hate me due to my unsavoury actions.

I get bothered very easily by minor things, like people looking at me or people talking to me or me failing to do anything perfectly or as according to plan. 

I live in a large village but the area is pretty self-contained, everyone knows each other there, I used to be a public drunkard. At one time, don't remember because I was very drunk, I smashed some windows with rocks. Don't know why the heck I would do this, but I think everyone in the village knows now. 

My mind and my body is always planning to cause problems for me, and hence I always need to be very watchful/vigilant or else more problems mount up. 
I do walk outside when I am bored, but am unable to do so for very long due to the amount of people outside, don't want anyone to see me or know that I'm there.

Can't even walk out at night because my paranoia got the better of me and I caused some trouble, so I'm too scared to go out at night now because if they see me again they would kill me for sure. So I'm stuck in the house.

Seriously need to move to a new area, hopefully legally change my name, keep to myself, try to learn from past mistakes and not to repeat them. I'm one of those people who are more than happy to start again when even one thing goes wrong.",1

Short Film on Paranoia,"Hey guys. I have struggled with paranoia for years now and I finally wanted to make a short film about it. But I dont want that film to only go over what I went through, because that wouldn‚Äôt be as interesting as me learning about other peoples‚Äô experiences so I have a broader knowledge of it. So I have a few questions I wanted to ask anyone that is willing to answer. 

1: When you have so many paranoid thoughts that it becomes too hard to handle, what do you do? 

2: What makes your paranoia worse or what triggers it?

3: What would you want to be represented in a short film on paranoia?

4: Have you ever tried to fight back against your paranoia and paranoid thoughts? What happened?


Again, I‚Äôd appreciate it if anyone answered, but if not I understand. It is a tough topic. Anyways my short film will be up on my youtube channel (lilmil) on September 10, which is national suicide prevention day (which i have some experience with myself).

weird coincidence or paranoia?,"i bought a shirt today (https://www.zumiez.com/a-lab-ballina-lime-crop-t-shirt.html) and it relates to components of my life over the past couple of months.
1. the words ‚Äúpure joy‚Äù- i captioned an instagram picture with these words after i had an amazing shrooms trip
2. lava lamp- Ive had the worst two acid trips of my life after staring at a lava lamp which triggered it
3. the smiley face- i painted my bf a picture that said ‚Äúhave a good trip‚Äù with the smiley face very similar to the one on the shirt as the focal point of the painting (even the same colors)
4. stars/twinkles- i put these same type of stars in the background of a separate painting for my bf
5. yin yangs- i recently got a yin yang tattoo
6. the little microorganism looking thing in the bottom left- i made a similar drawing using these designs for my bf. this is also what i imagined the afterlife to be like while having one of my horrible trips
7. the flower in the pot- this was also a focal point of a different painting i did for my boyfriend

so is this just a strange coincidence? or am i grasping at straws? am i just paranoid? i feel like i‚Äôm in a simulation and this was made to fuck with me. i didn‚Äôt even connect these dots till after i bought it and brought it home. please i need comfort",1

Do you think you are faking your paranoia?,"I must be faking it, right? I say things but I feel like an actor in a movie. There's no way I'm actually feeling this way, right?

I need to know if anyone else feels the same. Please tell me I am not alone. What if this is all just made up?? I think I am fine and that everyone else is just trying to use me as a scapegoat. They have done this before. I don't want to be the excuse everyone has, I don't want everything pinned on me!!

Hope I'm not wasting your time,So very recently I've moved in with my fiance and at first it was fine. We moved into a small 2 bedroom apt with close friends of mine. I've recently started having serious issues sleeping because at night i always feel like there's someone just outside my front door. I have a cat so my bedroom door stays open. And my front door is just out of my sight. I sleep next to a gun and have the training to use it but I'm terrified that the lives of the people i live with won't be protected and it'll be my fault. The past few days I've been up all night starting at the ceiling jumping at even the littlest sounds. I dont know what to do honestly. I've always had the fear of home invasion but this is beyond just that. It's to a point to where even during the day the slightest sound outside sends the hair on the back of neck up.

Man at Walmart,"I'm an 18 yr old female and I just went to Walmart to grab some swim goggles. On my way into the store a man, probably double my age stopped me by saying ""Excuse me miss, you dropped something."" I'm not wearing any clothing with pockets and only have my bag so I know I can't possibly have dropped anything, I ask ""what did I drop?"" before he said ""My phone number."" 

This wasn't really all that creepy but he asks for my number and just keeps saying ""you look nice,"" and all that. There weren't any people in the aisle and I didn't want to tell this man no without somewhere to go, so I pulled out my phone and he read his number, asked if I was single (no) and what I was doing today. He must have seen my phone background because it's my boyfriend, to which he says ""oh, a white boy? you don't like black men?"" (he was black). I say something about him being the only one I've loved so far. Apparently the part of my brain that should have gone into panic mode and lied about anything it could have decided to shut down because I blatantly told him I'm going swimming today, to which he pointed out the swim trunks I didn't notice in my anxiety driven state. He proceeded to say ""tell him you're sick, come swim with me,"" and ""swim with me tomorrow then,"" and kept pestering me to join him. I kept awkwardly laughing and just saying stuff like ""no, I don't think so, not today,"" before he puts his arms out and asks for a hug. I was so scared I just gave the man a hug and he proceeded to walk away saying ""message me, really."" 

I immediately turned around and walked towards where I was originally headed, took a glance at the swim stuff, and immediately left. I'm so paranoid, I don't know. I just feel like he did something or put something on me. I took the longest way to where I was headed so I could make sure all the cars behind me completely cycled and nobody was following me. I'm horrified and waiting until I can see my boyfriend because he'll make me feel better, but I can't shake this horrible feeling.",1

Everything in my life is interconected,"I've been having a terrible time with paranoia, with this one really strong, terrifying certainty that everything in my life is connected and someone is doing it on purpose. For example, I'll be online and see the people I follow post a bunch of posts I don't really get, oh well no big deal. Then I listen to music on soundcloud, and find an amazing fansong for media I don't know, but I love it so I listen to it over and over. Then I'll talk to my penfriend and she tells me about this cool podcast she's been listening to, so I google it, and it turns out all the posts were about it, and the song was about it, and a bunch of things over a series of months are now all linked and it terrifies me. To be clear, I don't think that someone is making these things happen, it's more like they're deliberately moving them into my line of sight, deliberately drawing lines between them, like their making a web by connecting everything in my life. It's terrifying, it's like I'm the only thing in my life that *isn't* being puppeted, and I'm just trapped in the middle and I can't do anything to stop it. I don't feel like it all the time, but when it hits I can't get away from it. I don't know why they would be doing it, who they would be, how long they would have been doing it, I just know that they are, and it's so scary that nothing I see hear think or do is really my own choice, because they're deliberately putting things into my path. It's like a bunch of random stitches at random points in my life, and then I'll pull on a bit of unrelated thread and it will pull all the stitches in and I'll realise they've been waiting for ages for me to just move that thread. I'm just rambling about it now, I'm sorry, but I just needed to get it out. I've had paranoia a lot in my life, but this is particularly horrible.",1

Maybe my anxiety is causing me to be paranoid,"I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that my ex husband tried to kill me and I‚Äôm lucky to have gotten away with my life. I have had a lot of anxiety lately, so maybe it‚Äôs just my mind running wild. It‚Äôs hard to tell though because this guy is a pretty sneaky and narcissistic person not to be trusted. 
Some stuff he did- He frequently killed animals. There were some stray cats that hung around our neighbor‚Äôs house that he proudly shot in front of our kids. He even bought my oldest child a gun without telling me and tried to tell her that the cats were her target practice. She was 6-7 years old then. He shot and killed the other neighbor‚Äôs sweet pet dog in front of our kids for no reason other than it had gotten out and roamed into our yard. There are many other things, really a lot of trauma for me to remember. 
On to the ‚ÄúI think he tried to kill me‚Äù: I think this happened when we started having trouble in our relationship. When I started standing up to him. Things were rocky. I was really healthy and took great care of myself at that time of my life. I was in my late 20‚Äôs. I mysteriously got really sick. I lost about 30-40 pounds in two weeks. Everything I ate and drank went right through me. I couldn‚Äôt even keep water in me. I was extremely weak and couldn‚Äôt stand for more than a few minutes. It was pretty scary how sick I was and I was only getting worse. I finally decided I needed to go to the hospital. He refused to take me and he seemed like he didn‚Äôt care that I was sick and was pretty annoyed that I wanted to get help. We had three young children that I stayed home and took care of. I ended up driving myself to the emergency room although I was afraid I might pass out on the 40 minute drive there. My neighbor watched the kids because he wouldn‚Äôt. When I got there they immediately admitted me and isolated me in my own room. They told me that my liver and heart were both in really dangerous condition. They ran a multitude of tests. I ended up staying there for 3 days and my ex husband didn‚Äôt call or visit once. They couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong with me. After the third day I was finally able to eat something and keep it in and began to regain some strength. They never did figure out what was wrong though. I went home he was so indifferent to the fact that I was so sick. I got better. And it was like it never happened. 
I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that he was poisoning me and he was disappointed that I didn‚Äôt die. It‚Äôs exactly the kind of thing he would do and get away with. He would have researched it. Honestly I vaguely recall him possessing some kind of literature on untraceable poisons or something of the sort. He was always researching and reading up on things like that. I just never thought it would be for me. I seriously have no doubt that I‚Äôd be dead by now if I would have stayed with him. But then I wonder if I‚Äôm paranoid. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt die either way!",1
Paranoia or hyper-vigilance?,"Hello,

I am curious about what I am experiencing. I have been diagnosed with PTSD but I question this diagnosis, as I do not experience flashbacks, intrusive memories, etc. What I do experience, periodically, is high sensitivity under certain states.

This could mean that yes, fireworks, loud vehicles and so on alarm me. However I also have been convinced at times someone will break into my apartment at night, that someone will follow me or attack me while walking from my car, or even that someone is following me while I am driving if they take the same roads.

Lately I've been worried my doctors have given me sugar pills and that they do not believe me about my health related symptoms. I am on lamotrigine (for MDD and PTSD) and I am on levothyroxine (for thyroid, mostly controlled). I almost stopped taking these meds. I am almost at the point of ghosting my medication professionals (I have this habit).

I am worried my former best friend may be stalking me online, so I keep creating new reddit accounts to try and remain anonymous. I still have the feeling I am being tracked. I continuously worry about my phone/search history being monitored.

My doctors first told me I am bipolar, now I am apparently not. Fine. I don't want to be bipolar. Honestly I feel like selling almost everything I own, taking off, cutting contact with everyone and finding a way to live in the woods. I hate society and I know I could build someone for myself.

Anyways just looking for input-can anyone relate?",1

He explained to me how it works and I told him I needed time to think, when I called him and canceled he seemed like he was angry and when I thanked him for the time and apologized, he said no problem, greetings and in the same moment he hung up. I was originally afraid that something in college would put a ban on me or something, and because of overthink I got paranoid that he might shoot me because I know he handles it, even though he told me it wasn't his primary job but that it works like this by the way.

currently in my house all alone,"my parents left my to house sit while they go out of state with my sister. it‚Äôs currently 10:18 pm and i‚Äôm scared shitless. i‚Äôve always been generally paranoid, but i hate being by myself. my house is huge and nice and i‚Äôm always scared of an intruder. we have alarm systems and i locked all the doors but i still worry that someone may have snuck in when the doors were unlocked and are waiting and hiding until i‚Äôm vulnerable. even if that‚Äôs not the case, i worry about something possibly paranormal. though we built our house and no one has died in it, i fear it‚Äôs built on an ancient burial ground or something",1
TW mentions of S/A and abuse,"tldr: i‚Äôm paranoid about an evil entity that is stalking me and waiting to be able to take over my body even though it has nothing to do with my trauma (rape and emotional abuse) 

the TLDR says it for itself. but i had my first psychotic episode october 29 2020. i thought something was watching me. i sat at the foot of my bed watching TV and puking for what felt like 10 minutes but when i looked at the time nearly 3 hours had gone by. 

beyond that point i was a wreck. i was crippled by my own mind. everyday and night i thought there was something watching me. i was constantly burning incense, yelling at things that weren‚Äôt there to go away and that they weren‚Äôt welcome around me.

some months go by, i get put on 20mg of paxil and .5 of clonazepam. it worked for a while. after a few months i could tell it was wearing off. for the first few months i had zero paranoia. now i do. i see shadows that other people don‚Äôt see and i assume i‚Äôm the only one who can see it for a reason and it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs targeting me. billboards are sending me secret messages, typos on my phone are sending me secret messages and all of them are that i‚Äôm in danger. 

i asked my psychiatrist if this could SOMEHOW be related to my trauma and she said yes, although i show more severe signs of paranoia than other patients with ptsd she has treated, and if it gets worse she‚Äôs going to look into what antipsychotic is best for me. 

my question is how the fuck do i have this level of paranoia from sexual assault? it doesn‚Äôt make sense? there‚Äôs no correlation? does anybody else have this type of paranoia? if so, do you know what caused it? 

mine seems to have come out of nowhere. other than watching horror movies? but i‚Äôve been doing that since i was a child. i don‚Äôt know. i‚Äôm frustrated that the medication isn‚Äôt working anymore and i‚Äôm at a loss.",1
Does this count as paranoia and what helps calm this stuff down? Feeling like I‚Äôm being watched,I‚Äôve always been really scared of lice because I‚Äôve had it so many times and it sucks so bad so ever since I was a kid I‚Äôd force my mom to do lice treatments on me very often and she realized it was just me being weird is that paranoia ? But anyways I am always being watched like I don‚Äôt have any proof of someone being there but I know someone is there I saw a light in my yard about a week ago and today I heard a tapping on my window and I swear I feel eyes on me 24/7 it is really upsetting and sometimes it just makes me cry because it is so stressful but if I tell anyone they‚Äôll laugh or think I‚Äôm insane,1

Can Suboxone cause paranoia ?,Been on subs for 3 weeks and feel very paranoid ..I'm on 4 mg sometimes less just depends on the day ..I feel more paranoia when I take a higher dose ....is this normal??,1
Please tell me I'm not alone in these feelings. Help.," I  just...don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm looking for, reassurement, validation. Maybe it's those things. But I'm really scared right now. I'm 25 years old, and I feel like my life is just over or that I'm not gonna go anywhere because of what's happening with me.

For context, on my last post I mentioned my paranoia taking over me. Re-reading things multiple times when i looked at them because I was scared that I was looking at it wrong, saying my family relative's names in my head because I'm afraid of forgetting them. Feeling slow, forgetful. Paranoia immediately making me think I have schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, dementia. Anything. I rewind videos several times to a certain part that I wasn't sure what was said to reassure myself that I heard that specific part correctly. I remember most things obviously, I'm not forgetting old or new memories exactly, but it feels slower and I can't focus. My thoughts are just overthinking or paranoid thoughts about how I'm forgetful.

I take meds currently, diazepam and escitalopram. I freaked out tonight for example, because I forgot to bring half of a pill to my room, but then remembered later. Because it was something more important than rewinding because of a clip of a video that I wasn't sure if I heard it or saw it correctly, I freaked out even more. And now I'm typing this to vent, and HOPING to god that I'm not alone in these weird things. I feel like crying and just vanishing. I don't know what to do. I'll form a thought in my head to check discord for example aswell, I'll keep repeating the thought in my head so i remember to check discord, I'll then sometimes proceed to do something else that I wanted to do, forget about discord for a few minutes, check it, and then REALIZE that I was trying to not forget about it, and then I'll feel like a screw up.

My paranoia makes me fearful that I'm going to lose my entire memory basically.

I just don't know what's wrong with me and it's hard to fully explain and rationalizing it without sounding stupid and crazy.

I'm already re-reading this and feeling that I'm a crazy person typing this crap. I'm sorry for the long post,",1

Any advice for getting people to listen to you?,"Bit vague, but I'm a ""worrier"" to the people in my life. Been this way since I was young, I'm used to people just kind of ignoring me when I point out that something isn't safe. I don't feel like I'm asking for much here, like don't thaw out meat in the oven or my current problem of hey before you go to work maybe lets tighten that loose wire in the doorbell box because I don't know how. It's been vibrating because of some typical doorbell bs, harmless on it's own, but them loosening the wire to make it stop (it didn't) is not only completely useless but dangerous. Apparently I worry too much when they leave me at home alone with 3 animals and an electrical fire hazard. I just need to trust them, even though they know about my mental health and know that's asking too much, but they don't have to trust me when I shove a million Google results on how loose wires are a bad thing? I don't want them to help me storm parliament or anything, I just want some basic safety precautions no matter how unlikely it is for things to go bad. Getting really sick of having my nerves thrown back in my face.


(As an aside I know how this kinda looks but no, I'm not being gaslit in a bad relationship, my family just assumes that because I'm crazy sometimes that I'm crazy *all* the time and all therapy has done so far is let me be believed over the phone once a month.)",1

I'm convinced my sister suffers from paranoia. How can I guide her to get help?,"She lives half a world away from me in a developing country and I don't know anybody around her.

Social insecurity manifesting as paranoia,"I'm starting to realize that my mental illness is much more intrusive into my life than I previously realized. I have depression and anxiety, and this year has been especially hard, particularly the last few months. I don't trust anyone in my life and I often believe they're trying to harm me because everything harms me when I'm feeling insecure. Nobody can do the right thing for me, loving me is insulting and I think they're lying to me so they don't feel guilty when I kill myself, running from me is hurtful because I feel like they got to know the real me and couldn't stand me. I think my ex is talking with my sister and checking in on me, I have literally no proof of this, but I just know people are keeping tabs on me. I feel like I'm running around in circles and I can't escape it. But when I feel secure in my relationships, that all fades away. I just wish I could feel stable in my own mind.

So I saw some tiktoks three weeks ago,"TW?? paranoia of course: afraid I‚Äôm being watched, thinking of being killed, suicidal & intrusive thoughts


I got really spooked by them and the first night was terrible. I was frozen in fear that someone was watching me in any dark corner of my room, watching my every move, waiting to kill me. That was three weeks ago. My sister has been kind enough to let me sleep in her room on the floor this entire time, but I still feel unsafe and scared. I feel like I‚Äôm seeing and hearing things that aren‚Äôt actually there. Not like hallucinations though, I don‚Äôt know how to describe it right now. 

Then I saw another tiktok on my fyp a few days ago (I don‚Äôt want to go into detail about what it was just for the sake of you all) and it genuinely screwed with my head even more than the first one. I cried for an hour on the floor panicking and my sister let me sleep on her bed for that night instead of on the floor and I calmed down a little. But this paranoia is still here. It wont leave. I‚Äôm having to force myself to stay up late even when really tired  to get to the point where I physically can‚Äôt keep my eyes open anymore and would fall asleep any minute so I can easily fall asleep without all these intrusive thoughts that someone is watching and waiting to k1ll me.. but at the same time, it‚Äôs painful to sleep because I‚Äôm so afraid I‚Äôm going to have nightmares about all of this. 

I haven‚Äôt had any paranoia before this really, but I do have GAD. But I‚Äôm assuming all of this is paranoia right?? I can‚Äôt get it out of my head and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to be like this forever now since it has been 3 weeks. People have said it‚Äôs normal to be spooked for a day or two by something, but for something to last this long and this intense there is probably a problem.. 
I don‚Äôt understand...we have a dog AND an alarm AND I‚Äôm in my sisters room. Why do I have to be like this? I feel so unsafe and it‚Äôs honestly to the point where I just want to kms so nothing has the chance to do it first. I already am suicidal as it is (but never would act on it) and this just makes it so much more intense I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just hope this is temporary, but is it possible that this literally just stemmed into my brain now and am going to be like this forever even though I‚Äôve never had any previous experience with paranoia?..",1

We aren‚Äôt old enough to drive and we don‚Äôt have money for a bus and even if we were I‚Äôm scared that we‚Äôd switch and the alter/alters would freak out in confusion and even if I got there I wouldn‚Äôt know where to start looking for my friends. And my mental state is so bad that I have no idea if I should just go to the hospital ASAP because I‚Äôm scared and I‚Äôm suicidal and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing anymore.

Paranoia and intrusive thoughts,"-Heads up this is probably going to be long-

I've been paranoid for around 1.5 years I think, not constantly but there are spikes to it and I had previously had a what felt like severe episode of paranoia maybe last year where I was sure everyone was out to get me and kill me and poison my food ect I found it hard to meet up with friends and go to work without feeling like everyone was plotting against me to harm me or to get me fired, that my l my girlfriend was cheating on me and my family was deeply disappointed with me ect, I knew this wasn't the reality and felt like I was going mad. It soon died down after I quit my job which was causing a huge amount of stress so I think stress is an attribute to getting  paranoia panic attacks and having breakdowns.

Now I am experiencing the breakdowns again. I don't dislike my job and it isn't too stressful at all, but I think it could be my living situation. I live in a shared house with my mates and I've been having panic attacks/ breakdowns for the last three days now every day because I feel like my friends don't want me there because they just want to smoke green without me in the way and that my girlfriend doesn't love me anymore and wants to be with other men that aren't as fucked up as me and can smoke with her. Usually I wouldn't mind people smoking, I have other friends who use it daily and I've never had a problem with it before but I think because I didn't see it constantly it didn't affect me like this but it is affecting me and I don't know what to do.


My housemates and sometimes my girlfriend smoke together which I cannot partake in because obviously I experience paranoia and the substance isn't exactly helpful to me in that sense, but it has left me feeling like they want to cut me out and so I've been trying to let them get on with it which at the same time is making me feel like I'm losing my friends/ the connection isn't the same. when I spoke about it yesterday with one of them it was confirmed that that wasn't the case but I can't help feeling like it is and that they're doing it on purpose to get away from my negativity or to talk about me behind my back. 

I feel horrible for thinking these things but it's eating me from the inside. I don't feel cared about I'm scared my girlfriend won't love me anymore and wants to leave me because she won't talk to me about her problems and it's always me talking about mine or that I'm stopping her from having fun or doing the things she needs to do all the time and that I'm the problem, to confirm these feelings she doesn't want to have sex with me either which is making me anxious that she's fucking other men because I can't satisfy her or something, I know she wouldn't do that and it's in my head but I can't help thinking things like this.

All this paranoia and anxiety I then took to work with me on Friday where I misinterpret normal conversation and think that the actual conversation I'm having means something entirely different and it really ends up hurting my feelings or making me angry/anxious, which I have experienced before last year also, this would be and is with basically every single conversation I have or overhear where I think it is about me in a negative way or people hiding information about me in their conversations and I have to depict the meaning.


I've had to stay at my mum's house because I am scared to go home in fear of having these breakdowns from seeing my mates smoking weed and thinking all these things that aren't real or are I don't know. It's nice to get these things off my chest but I really just want them out of my head as well.",1
Why does this happen to me?,"

Worried about embarrassing internet history.,"Backstory: I do a lot of internet deep dives, usually looking for obscure media. I never look for anything illegal. I always stay on the surface web, I don't actually know how to use the deep web. Sometimes these sites are not in English.

I'm afraid of us getting hacked or looking our internet connection because of something I looked up. I'm afraid of my family thinking that I am some sort of weirdo.

We moved last year and had to switch to a different ISP. It's satellite, so we have limited data, so we can check on how much we have. For some reason I'm worried my family will look at my internet logs and question me about it. I feel like I have to sometimes ask them about what they are looking at it listen in on them. Although, they usually just stuff like pay bills or look up landscaping stuff. Our anti virus software also logs our history, and we tend to check on that more frequently.

I have a collection of cosplay photos, nothing that's too NSFW. Many of these pictures come from a behind the scenes blog from a Japanese adult film studio, that uses a lot of well made and detailed costumes. I have no interest in the adult films they produce, I want only pictures of the costumes. I was looking though their archives recently, I had that open in one tab, in another tab I was looking up information about an obscure foreign kids movie. I got this paranoid thought that, because I had NSFW content in one tab and information about a children's movie in the other, the feds would mistake me for looking at CP. I thought that they might come to my house and search our stuff and my family would be mad at me.

Next up is that I torrent shows. I have an external drive full of old TV shows and anime. Sometimes the batch files can be large, so I try to download little bits at a time, as to not use too much data. I'm worried I'll end up using all of our data. Our ISP, doesn't turn off our access, but would slow it down a lot. 

Although I use a VPN, I'm worried that our ISP will send me a copywriter strike letter. I'm not sure what I was do if I was in some sort of legal trouble. I don't know how I would even pay for the fees. I don't have much money, that's why I still live at home.

I once posted about someone using my father's SSN to open up a bank account, me thinking it was something I did, even though I would never give it to anyone, nor do I even know it. I don't even use the same computer as him, so I don't know why I thought that. (We later learned that two of my mother's patients had the exact same thing happen from the exact same bank.)

Finally, just yesterday when we were having landscaping done, an SUV pulled up near our house. I buy got out, wrote something down, then left. My dad thinks he was here to do estimates about our yard, but left because we already had someone out here. (My parents called around to get estimates, two of the companies sent out guys to look at our yard without telling us they were coming. My dad thinks it's a case of that.) My first thought is someone was spying on us.

I keep telling myself that I need to stop doing this stuff. I'm not looking at anything illegal. I've been doing this for years, and it was never a problem. I don't know why I'm so worried now. I think that it might be because that things are different now. It's stupid to worry this much, about what would amount to nothing. I know that it's extremely unlikely that someone would come for me. It would take too much time and money to go after just one out of millions of people who the same, if not worse stuff than as me.

I'm mostly worried about what my family would think of me, if they knew about this. I'm afraid of having an awkward conversation about it and their opinion of me changing. I'm horrible at talking about uncomfortable things, and feel like I'd end up getting physically sick, something that had happened before when I became overly nervous.

Can anyone give me some advice? I feel like I need it.",1
how do you cope with your paranoid thoughts?,"i am having a difficult time dealing with the paranoia. i really don‚Äôt know what to do. my parents don‚Äôt want to sign off on allowing me to get medicated for it. i need other ways to placate it. i was on the verge of a freak out today and was gonna lock myself up out of fear, but i spoke with someone in a similar condition and it kind of calmed me down. anything is appreciated",1

Things of that nature. I start assuming it‚Äôs warnings and signs that I‚Äôm going to die. I try to at normal because there‚Äôs a part of me that knows it‚Äôs all mental, but because this happens so often I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs actually something wrong with me?

I am Penitent,"i am wicked and i think mean-spirited thoughts. this is all my fault. been sitting here looking through the wall for some time now, experiencing a weird kindof meta-noia where im convinced my normal levels of social paranoia are somehow warranted by my nature,

"I want to help my friend, but our relationship has drastically shifted since her psychotic episode"," Hey, I hope this is fine here, because I am concerned, confused and worried about a friend. About three years ago, she suffered a psychotic episode because she stayed up for way too long one time - as far as I knew, she had a sleep disorder she had to take meds for, and her family had a history of schizophrenia, so I suppose that's all that was needed.

However, after this, I feel her entire personality has shifted. Her episode warranted her having to seek treatment, which she has gotten a lot better from, but I almost feel like this psychosis never quite ""went away"" so to speak.

Comparatively, she's doing wonders since then - she's taken up learning another language and doing work related to that! She does have an amazing sense of determination when she intends on something.

However, she does have various delusions from time to time, and this is where I lose her. Thankfully they haven't been at the severity or intensity since that episode, but every now and then it seems her mind will focus on a very specific thought and she becomes very agitated with others.

As an example, I stream games as a hobby on the side. She wanted to join in but mentioned to NOT stream one game in particular. Streaming this game, according to her, will lead to me being swatted on stream.

At first I tried to ask questions taking the delusion legitimately - the internet can be really terrible so I thought it was some internet trolls but there isn't some wide mass swatting going on for this game: in fact, it really isn't played that much and if it was, it's getting 5 viewers max based on twitch.

The one thing I've learned is that trying to ration or logic through a delusion can actually be more harmful, so I try to not do that. I don't attempt to dismiss her thoughts but any time I ask, ""What do you mean?"" or ask her to explain it further she gets mad at me, tutting, sighing, and telling me vague things like ""The walls have eyes"" and ""You have much to learn"" She gets mad that I don't simply ""get it"" and that I can't read her mind. When I ask her to tell me what she's thinking (not even trying to judge her thoughts, just trying to know what they even are), she will give a vague statement like above and so I'm more confused, and then my confusion pisses her off.

While this example isn't really hindering me, I'm worried what might happen if she develops specific thoughts that would be damaging to herself or others. Our friendship has deteriorated because it's become impossible to have a discussion; a lot of it is now lecturing me to do certain things based on her paranoia. Any resistance to following along leads to condescension and her yelling, which is probably where my biggest problems lie - after the episode, her aggression has ramped up - while I don't feel like I'm in physical danger, her patience for people ""not getting it"" is non-existent and her response is to yell at them and treat them like they're idiots for it. This is the most frustrating bit for me, because I do have a sensitivity to any yelling coming from an environment like that, so my response due to my own personal shit is to back off. But in backing off, it's literally causing me to keep my distance, because I don't want to get yelled at again.

I suppose what should I do, if I should do anything? Is there something wrong with how I'm approaching her, leading to this? It's hard to begin to understand what she's feeling but I want to try in a way that isn't going to make things worse, which I'm worried I might be doing here. Any insights or thoughts would be much appreciated",1

Paranoid brother (25m) wants to end his relationship with the family,"

Hello. I'm not sure if this is the correct place to put this, but I (24f) need some advice for a situation with my brother. TLDR at the bottom. 

For the past 10 years, he has had a very rocky relationship with my parents and members of my family due to differences in beliefs and values, mainly on smoking weed. This resulted in him moving out about 4 years ago. However, he began talking and repairing the relationship with them, and over the past year, it has slowly gotten better. This is the case, until last month when he started making 2 accusations about our family. The first is accusing relatives as well as our dad of putting spyware on his phone and computer about 8 years ago and tracking his every move, and the second is that he was caught at a family function smoking weed and family members laughed and mocked him for it. Both of these events never happened, nor anything similar to it. This has also been confirmed with many family members as well. However, my brother refuses to believe it, and believes that we are all lying to him. He will also continue to call/text my parents, myself and other members of my extended family questioning us, and trying to get us to admit to both of the events. We continually try and call him and check up on him, and visit him in person, however he only wants to talk about the accusations and refuses to discuss anything else. He also continually comes up with more and more ""memories"" about the situations each conversation we have, and is becoming more aggressive each time.

After some researching and talking to some mental health professionals, we believe that my brother is experiencing a psychosis and is dealing with paranoia. We have a ""diagnostic"" virtual family therapy session this Friday which we got my brother to join (Basically, the therapist can learn more about the situation and assess my brother and then refer him to further psychological therapy, and us to family therapy if that makes sense). However he texted me this evening stating that he was expecting us to admit to him what the family did before or during the session or else he will never speak to anyone in our family again.

I honestly do not know how to talk to him anymore, since he believes that we are trying to harm him. Through my research online, I have read that we shouldn't argue about the paranoias the person is facing because it will agitate them even more, nor should we agree to their delusions. because of this, I'm at a loss on how to communicate with him, and am very worried that the therapy session won't meet his needs and then he will stop communicating with the family and we won't be able to get him help and resolve the root issue. If anyone who has been in this situation or knows someone in this situation, or is a mental health professional, can please give me advice on what to do in this situation and how to communicate with my brother, and also how to approach this therapy session, or even how to calm my anxiety before the session it will be very appreciated.

TLDR: Brother is most likely experiencing psychosis and is accusing members of the family of harming him years ago. We have a family therapy session this Friday and he says that he will cut us off completely unless we admit to the accusations at the therapy session.",1

All my neighbors are super weird and sketchy,"I‚Äôm on mobile sorry for bad grammar and stuff. I‚Äôll start with my downstairs neighbor let‚Äôs call him h-man.

I think they are dealing but I know the people in the building next to ours are. (Random people go into the building a leave shortly there after) and know my next fort neighbors. A couple going through a rough patch. Fist of all they fight a lot. And a couple days ago I heard the dropping of metal (like lead pipes hitting the floor in movies) and then beating sounds. They vape as well. But the weirdest thing about them is they shower late at night. I think the latest was around 10:30-11:00 pm. I don‚Äôt know what I think about them Im just scared of them.

Well, I have death anxiety. It's already affecting my life as a whole, but since a while ago I get very very paranoid. When I started dating my boyfriend, he had some su\*cidal thoughts and I always got afraid that he would act on them. I started having panic attacks and intrusive thougts anytime I ""felt"" he had done something when he took long hours or days to answer a text or post something, yet nothing had happened he was just busy and stuff. I started to see (or maybe notice) posts or comics or any type of media regarding people seeing their partner die, or being widowed. He actually attempted su\*cide at some point last year, thankfully getting help and he's doing so much better now and is improving. But I keep seeing these posts and I keep thinking they're a signal of the future to tell me that it's going to happen to me, and I'm getting so so afraid of that because I really can't escape all this media regarding this and now I don't know if something bad is going to happen or how I can prevent it or if it just mere coincidence and just starting noticing this topic because I'm particularly afraid of it now...",1

I feeling like people are lurking for me,"I don‚Äôt know how to keep on

Hey Guys,
First off all: Sorry for the length and my english grammar (should have went to school more often back then lol).
I‚Äôm suffering from a very specific issue for almost 2 years now and it slowly took possession of me. To give u a little background information i was (at least the way I see things) a very bad person in my teenage years. I did awkward things to gain attention from people and to get ‚Äúcool‚Äù. I bullied people, i went out drinking in parks with bad people, i did drugs etc. and just acted so goofy. In this timeline some people from around my town started laughing at me, took pictures from me in the bus without no clear reason and I experienced a lot of very specific issues which, since they happened i‚Äôm constantly feared of. After I finished this first phase of anxiety things went quite well till I got encountered again. People I didn‚Äôt knew were yelling my name. So I was starting to ask myself again why those people would shout my name, what they may know about all those awkward things I did etc. At this point, I was hyper aware of every person walking by and as soon as I thought people were watching me I felt anxious and started to panic. I even feel people are standing in front of my house in order to wait for me in order to just make my life terrible. I‚Äôm not quite sure if this really happens but I‚Äôm constantly looking for signs which may were left for me in order to make me feel bad. From this point, I just feel followed everywhere I go, I‚Äôm feared that people know me and i didn‚Äôt went out with my friends for 1 year. I‚Äôm pretty much stuck in my room isolating myself. I went to a therapist who diagnosed me with depression. I tried to take the advice from my therapy but I‚Äôm just too feared to do anything. I‚Äôm even scared to sit in my own backyard because people could notice where I live and follow me. I just hate myself for what I have done and I can‚Äôt get over my old me. Slowly, suicidal thoughts added up. I feel unable to take serious actions against this. I also talked to my friends about this issue but it seems as they don‚Äôt really taking me serious plus i don‚Äôt want to annoy them every time we see each other. I don‚Äôt even eat while the sun is up because I‚Äôm feared people could see me through the windows. I was wondering if you guys maybe made similar experiences as I did.",1

I somewhat believe I have something to do with celebrity deaths,"Ok, so I know all of these are coincidences but I still feel a slight anxiety over it. It seems like if I interact with a celebrity‚Äôs work or say certain things about a celebrity they... die? The most recent example was I complained that people would be disrespectful to Prince Phillip when he died and a few hours later we had the newsflash. Other times would be when I have watched films or listened to songs, etc. Someone involved would pass away. I obviously know I‚Äôm not causing these but how do I cope with the anxiety that comes with when this happens? I feel so irrational but I can‚Äôt help it.

Also I‚Äôm not really sure if this is the right sub for this so if it‚Äôs not just feel free to remove it x",1
Nobody seems to care,"The main problem is: everyday it makes more sense. I can't even rely on my best friend anymore. I feel lonely and under appreciated. I feel like I'm losing her, or I already did. I hope this is just paranoia but thinking about the future all I see is worse",1
Signs are building up,"I've been paranoid about everyone close to me for a while now, even my neighbours I've never met and random people that just walk by the house. I feel like they're all just keeping me around to fuck with me and make my life a living hell, without me even knowing. Like they're constantly posting on a social media account that I can't access that has all.of the stupid shit I do on there. Like they're constantly watching me and laughing at everything I do. I can't talk to anyone about it because they're just going to lie to me to keep the facade going. I don't trust anyone, and anytime I try to open up to somone I get a really awkward and ""you're fucking crazy"" reaction. Which adds to the feeling of paranoia. I even feel like my girlfriend is cheating on me, eventhough that's not possible during this pandemic because she looks after someone vulnerable. I don't want to bring it up with her again either because the reaction I got before was a really in the middle reaction. What drove me to write this post is a feeling of dread caused by a dream I've just had. My girlfriend broke into my house while I was sleeping, and when I opened the door of my bedroom she tried to attack me, but I eventually got her sat down and I took about 5 weapons off her. I read that participating in the detention of a criminal can either mean somone close to you is laying a trap for you, or someone close to you is plotting evil against you. So my trust for everyone close to me has just disappeared. Even if they try to tell me how much I'm valued my brain can't accept that and just thinks they're lying. 

TLDR: I had a dream that makes me question my trust for absolutely everybody around me, especially my girlfriend. Now I'm paranoid that I'm walking into a trap of some kind.",1

I'm scared I'm going to die.,"I have emetophobia ( the fear of vomit ) & it's always been with me. It was never bad, I use to have a very mild fear of it.

Recentley, I had an anxiety meltdown. Anxiety attacks almost everyday, rapid heart, feeling disconnected to the world, finding it hard to even walk or talk to people. I also have increased nausea from this anxiety. 

I rarely ever vomit or get sick, but I litteraly cannot eat at all. I've tried foods such as bread & jelly but all it led to was nausea & a really bad panic attack. Since this keeps happening whenever I eat, I haven't eaten in the last 5 days.

I have been surviving on water, gatorade & smoothies. I completley forgot how to eat & I'm scared I'm gonna die or end up in hospital from starvation. My fear & anxiety has never ever been this bad. I'm getting medication tommorow for it, but I'm just scared my body will shut down.",1
Worried about being poisoned,"I think my dad has tried to poison my younger sister and I. He bought two packs of gum (different flavors), and gave us each one, but what was weird was that he insisted we mix them to each get some of each. I got a weird feeling and wondered if he did something to one of the packs, although I knew I was most likely being paranoid. I decided not to have any anyway. My sister chews a lot of gum; she had 3-4 pieces by the end of the day. The next day she gets violently sick in a parking lot and about six more times in plastic bags on the way home. I didn‚Äôt make the connection at first because I was thinking about something and not able to focus on anything else. The weird thing was after that she was completely fine. She didn‚Äôt have any more symptoms after throwing up a few times. He kept trying to blame it on the breakfast she ate (French toast) even though we all ate the same batch and she was the only one that got sick. 

I went for some gum today, and I noticed the wrappers smelled weird, somewhat like a perfume, but more like floor polish. Only one flavor, though (remember they're mixed, half watermelon half wintergreen. The wintergreen ones smelled.) I couldn't put one in my mouth because I was convinced at that point he had tampered with them somehow. I'm having a hard time convincing myself these things aren't connected. The only thing I have is he had no actual reason to poison her, but then people don't always have to have one.",1

Can your paranoia get worse if your paranoid thoughts turn out to be true?,"Had this specific thought that something was going on between some individuals in my social circle that involved me and someone else.  Turns out I was right.  Now maybe my other suspicions about other people may also be true?  I deal with PTSD (sexual abuse/psychological abuse put upon me when I was a child by friends, family and professionals) and along with that comes my paranoid thoughts of either people wanting to abuse/hurt me again, use me, or that they pretend to like me when they actually despise me and they only pretend to like me in order to get close and eventually harm me.  Kinda feel like shit about my thoughts being true, now I feel like my brain is on defense mode, which I assume is a normal/expected response? Just worried now about being right on all of my other thoughts and suspicions about past events that have occurred.  

Has anyone‚Äôs paranoid thoughts turn out to be true before? And how did that make you feel afterward once you found out?",1
I wish I knew someone I could talk to my paranoid thoughts about,"I had an upsetting conversation with a friend today. They were upset about a status I posted online, because it referenced me worrying they were manipulative. This is a status I blocked them from seeing purposefully and did not name drop them. It was purely to reach out and get support. They didn't even know the full status I made, that I ended by saying I wasn't sure if it was true or a trauma response. I just wanted advice on how to cope. But someone, and I don't know who but I have two people that I believe it probably could be based on past conversations, decided to inform this friend about the status. And apparently they were not informed of the full status. They decided to talk to me about whether or not I actually thought they were manipulative. I don't think it's fair that I had to have a conversation about thoughts I never intended on sharing with them. My anxiety is very high right now and I started to dissociate, possibly to stave off this becoming paranoia about their intentions and the other people involved in this. Ironically I feel manipulated. But as I usually do in these situations, I am telling myself not to believe any of my thoughts as true since I recognise that it's extreme to believe everyone is against you. Because I'm fighting off believing that I'm unsafe right now around people who completely disconnected from the conflict.

I guess the point of this post is I don't feel like there's anyone in my life I can talk to this about right now. Because the people I'm closest too are potentially involved or one degree of seperation away, and my other outlet was to make a status with a filtered audience and now I feel like I can't do that without it coming back to this person. 

Any advice on how to find someone to talk to? It would be helpful to have a friend that also deals with paranoia, and maybe when we have anxious thoughts we can talk to each other to help one another become grounded in reality again. Any thoughts are welcome.",1
Is my friend being spied on?,"It all started when my friend, D, thought that he was being spied on in the Philippines. He thinks people are planting cameras everywhere.

He believes people have gained access through his account from spying on him. I thought he was simply paranoid. Perhaps there's just one [image](https://imgur.com/a/x7vY7uj) that raises a question.

Trying to understand the paranoia... help?,"She loves her family but also is fearful of conflict with her parents. So as much as she loves them, and is willing to do what they ask, she will go out of her way to ensure they are not angered.

This ""going out of her way"" has entered our relationship.

We started dating at 24, and now were 29.

When we started dating and still to now she needs to ask to use her parents vehicle because she still has not got one yet due to focusing on school and not work.

She has a curfew living at home, and she follows it very closely. She has never slept over at my house and any time she has been like 30 mins to an hour late her dad will blow up her phone, and yell at her for disobeying his house rules... despite her age. This has affected us because she has slept over maybe 5 times in the years together, but she has to lie and say she slept over at a friends house.

She and I lived together for 3 years during college. She made me agree to never tell her parents that we lived together and so any time I speak to them about college I had to lie. She was paranoid and worried that they would disown her because she was living in sin (catholic) since we were not married. So for 3 years, anytime they came to visit I had to move all of my stuff out, and further continue to lie.

One time her dad mentioned that I should lose weight because I look unhealthy. I shrugged it off, but what annoyed me more was that she didnt stand up for me since she was at dinner and heard that be said. Her siblings told him to cut it out and such but she didnt. She just apologized for her father and said ""thats how he is.""

She and I have sex, and she is very worried they will find out, not just like caught in the action find out, but even birth control wise. Her sister was on birth control for period pains and her mom found out and forced her to get off of it. So in the years together she and I do NO form of PDA in front of her parents.

She got a tattoo and has to wear make up to hide it for fear her parents will yell at her.

Finally, this has been a huge mental struggle of mine. I have been in therapy because of this. But she got an abortion, our contraception failed. Her fears of her parents finding out came up and she felt depressed, numb, and even suicidal. She didnt want them to find out about being pregnant out of marriage, and so she went ahead with it. She was very much against the idea but her fear of her parents outweighed her wants.

Further and sadly, she blamed me for her abortion months later. I talked with my therapist and they mentioned how she is projecting her wishes to keep our baby and since we weren't married, she blames me, despite her clear reasons being her parents.

I understand the red flags here. I do. 

But I want to understand what is going on with her. I wish she didnt have so much paranoia and didnt let her parents affect her decisions so much. 

She doesn't see how unhealthy her fear of her parents is, I brought it up once around when we had an abortion and she almost left me because it was as if she couldn't face the truth.

What is going on here? Please reddit, help me understand...",1

Someone is Going to Kill Me!!!,"Hello All!

Ever since last week, I've seen strangers looking at me and laughing in my face. I've also heard people saying how someone has a picture of my face, my car and my license plate and they are looking to kill me. I'm out here thinking to myself, no this is all in my head. However, it's not. Random people are still looking at me weird and laughing in my face saying someone is going to kill me and they even said ""Thank God! It's about time someone murders her ass!""  They said that someone has posted something up on facebook saying they're looking for me and they want me dead!!! I haven't done anything to anyone and I don't have enemies.

Paranoid about something dumb,"This is gonna sound dumb but I‚Äôm terrified of pregnancy. I haven‚Äôt had sex before.

Taking steps to reduce paranoia and then feeling guilty,"I get extremely paranoid about the people around me having an issue with me. I often deal with these paranoid feelings myself but on certain occasions when I can't kick the feeling, I'll ask the person myself if they have an issue with me. I did this today and the person responded with ""oh no, absolutely not, I don't know where you've got that from,"" which got rid of my paranoia, but left me with a guilty feeling of thinking what I thought/accusing him of that (I didn't use an accusatory tone though)...

Am I paranoid?,"Maybe   I  am. Put a security system in the house due to a rash of break-ins on the neighborhood. Mostly cams outside, a few inside. The reason for the outside is obvious, but inside because I wanted proof that someone actually broke in if they did. 
Of the inside cams, one is in the entry hall, another in the living room, and the last in the bedroom where its trained across the room....jewelry and a few valuables there. So all is good, but every once and awhile the bedroom one triggers....and when I look at the footage, there's nothing. There is no air vent or not pointing at a window. Figured it was the camera....messed with sensitivity, still would trigger....changed out cameras...same result! Weird. So the adjoining bathroom....when I bathe in there, I get the feeling I'm begin watched. Only that  bathroom....no other.

Does NAC N-Acetyl-Cysteine lower paranoia symptoms?,"I've been feeling anxiety with paranoia. False beliefs and it has got worse in the lockdown over the year which has affected some relationships. When I drink the false beliefs increase and negativity, at least it does at the moment, something that didn't happen before.

If something bad happens I believe it is for a reason and will think it could be due to my father, for example, or such. Same online I can believe similar things. I might think my aunt is secretly doing stuff behind my back, and then my behavior towards her will be worse as a result.

I want to clear it asp!

Paranoid about my health,"Hello I‚Äôm(24f) paranoid beyond belief about my health and life. I am overweight with a high BMI. I‚Äôve never had much concern until I had my child and then decided to get weight loss surgery. The process for the surgery is long and many different doctor visits. However recently I‚Äôve had a lot of chest pain going constantly to the hospital and each time they said I‚Äôm perfectly fine, I follow up with my primary care physician and he even says I‚Äôm perfectly fine and the chances of myself having anything wrong with my heart at all are very low. However, with all of that I still fear this upcoming cardiologist appointment that I‚Äôll find out something is wrong and won‚Äôt get the weight loss surgery or I‚Äôll die before the appointment or die before I can even get the surgery. It‚Äôs gotten so bad where I barely leave bed anymore, the anxiety medications I‚Äôm on don‚Äôt stop the panic attacks and I‚Äôve cried myself to sleep multiple times in a row. I‚Äôm scared my child will go to bed next to mom and wake up to a corpse. I‚Äôve been so paranoid to eat I‚Äôve lost 10lbs in less than a week. I also believe my past eating disorder is returning because if I do manage to eat I immediately become scared I‚Äôll have a heart attack and begging to call myself disgusting for eating when I shouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm very low income so I‚Äôm on the waiting list to get therapy and I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt make it to the date for my therapy. Everything scares me at this point and everyone around me is looking at me like I‚Äôm insane and they don‚Äôt understand my fears.

Paranoid About Police,"I have a lot of homicidal intrusive thoughts, and I've been confusing them with reality.

For example, I imagine killing someone. My brain thinks I actually did it in real life.

According to my fucked up mind, I got arrested for all my crimes and got released from prison, and now the police are after me again because of something I did.

I'm really scared that they'll just come to my house one day.
They're probably writing a report about me or something right now.

or what if I randomly come across a police officer,  and they read my mind. They'll hear what I'm thinking about and then arrest me instantly.

I can't seem to convince myself that this is an irrational fear, I know it is; but I keep believing it.

I'm feeling really shitty now because I feel like the most evil person in this world.",1
Pyrex glass cookware - scratches/cracks,"So, I'm pretty paranoid about health.

Today I had a 2 litre Pyrex measuring jug filled up. I took it out of the microwave and as it was very heavy and hot I dropped it about a inch or two onto the counter top by accident. It made a loud bang. I checked the surface to see if there was any cracks, but there was nothing major that I could see. However, after closer inspection I found a faint hairline scratch, I guess is what you would call it, on the outside of the jug. I can't be certain that it was there before.

Then tonight I inspected the inside of the jug and found very very faint hairline scratches and I don't know if that is from today.

My worry is that I'm going to absorb some of the glass when I cook with it through the hairline scratches. I feel like if I was a normal person then it wouldn't be a concern, but I am considering buying a new jug as precaution but I don't want to spend the money (that's another issue for another day).  


I'm trying to rationalize by saying if the food that I cook with has the ability to discolor the glass and grim can build up in between the microscopic glass particles then what's the difference between the hairline scratches and this as the glass always carries a risk of absorption, if this makes sense.  
If the glass particle compounds are the same on the outside as in the inside is there any difference? Maybe it's coated with a different compound.  
Also, let's say I do absorb some of the glass, does it really pose any risk?

Thank you",1

"I'm new here, not sure if this is the right place","Hey all, kind of inebriated right now, but is this the place to post about thoughts regarding the people you live with (both flatmates and family member) observing you not only through watching but hearing as well? I've been trying to relax by connecting with my friends online, but I have to step away from any call (whether it's relaxing or working) whenever a housemate is near.

When I try to find the reason of doing so I simply end up with excuses for myself of why I don't want to show anyone my professional or personal work. I don't really know if it's some sort of paranoia or some associated disorder, but it's genuinely getting in the way of my everyday life now.

I just want to be able to show my close relatives and friends my work that I'm proud of, but whenever I  try I seem to find some way to weasel out of it, and whenever I'm not trying to show them a finished work, even when I'm trying to relax, I can't help but keep an eye out for the doorways they might come in by and prepare ""fake documents"" to display if they come in.

I want a discussion or anything to help make sense of my paranoia.,"I‚Äôm being a bit short and brief with this because Reddit crashed midway through writing the first one and I‚Äôm a bit upset about it

I‚Äôve always had a bit of paranoia ever since possibly 5th grade. Although back then it was a minor ‚Äúsomeone is watching me‚Äù when I walked home from school, and eventually I grew out of it. After that I‚Äôve had an issue with trust. Unless there‚Äôs is reasonable evidence that someone isn‚Äôt lying, their words mean next to nothing to me. Whenever my own mother says ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù, I dont believe her. I‚Äôve been like this since I remember. Eventually I got a gf and it all settled down for a bit. I felt like I could be truthful with her. I placed my trust in her and told her things I‚Äôd never tell anyone. Mid way into last year, her friends started to test my patience and found one of my weak points, Anger. They abused the fact that I was easily angerable as much as possible. They used it to lie to her and pretend like I was a mentally unstable psycho. And they won, she broke up with me, which has enhanced these issues greatly. If there is one thing I‚Äôm certain in all of my distrust, theories, and paranoia, they did it on purpose. Once is an event, twice is a coincidence, daily is a pattern. And after the fact, she completely changed how she acted to one of our mutual friends, allowing her friends to do the same shit they did to me (although I didn‚Äôt find out until much later). After our breakup my life went terrible. They, in a way, gaslit me into believing it was entirely my fault. It made the original issue of not believing people‚Äôs words 100x worse. Even now, I dont believe some of my friends and don‚Äôt even hang out anymore with one of them just because I don‚Äôt think they like me.

Now we get to the part I‚Äôm most unsure of. Recently got into a fight with a friend. They let their friends pass on some shit I didn‚Äôt like. Nothing I‚Äôm paranoid about, they were being assholes and he didn‚Äôt want me calling them out on it. Well it lead to us falling out, then randomly he added me on discord. Never got a text from him and minutes later he unfriended me. I texted him to ask why he did that and he said ‚ÄúYou're too paranoid people are out to get you and I don't want to deal with that again‚Äù. The thing that gets me is I dont know what he means by that. I never was paranoid or thought any of them were out to get me. All I noticed was the pattern of him being a dick to myself and multiple other people. But multiple people, even my closest current friend, said that I was acting paranoid. It worries me about what I was acting like to make them think that.

Finally I should talk about my worries about being alone. I hate being alone. I can‚Äôt stand it. Past 2 or 3 times I‚Äôve been alone I swear I‚Äôve heard a door open/slam. And generally speaking when I‚Äôm not distracting myself with YouTube or a video game, I feel like I‚Äôm being watched. And to a way higher degree than when I was in 5th grade.

I don‚Äôt exactly know what I‚Äôm looking for here. I dont know if there‚Äôs anything that can be said, can be done, or anything that could help get rid of my issue. It might be just to vocalize some thoughts I‚Äôve had. I dont know anymore. Thanks for reading if you did. Have a nice night",1
Grew up in hacker culture and now the paranoia from that lifestyle is spreading to my personal life,"I started with computers at a young age and became interested in hacker culture like any angry kid would

After a while i realized that everyone very well could be out to get me and i started treating every interaction online like they were trying to get information out of me or social engineer me, obviously not healthy for a young lad

Anyways, this became the norm, i started having anxiety attacks when someone was trying to social engineer me and i found out and instantly assumed they had gotten access to other parts of my life, so eventually i tried to erase my online identity multiple times

I think me specializing in social engineering made me more paranoid about being social engineered 

Around the age of 16 i started having small psychotic episodes and started developing what my doctors described as early onset schizophrenia, which didnt help, 

Im on meds for it, but i am coming off for personal reasons, and im realizing that that paranoia is seeping into the real world, if i talk to someone new i instantly assume the worst and try and flip the script and try and get information from them and look for inconsistencies in their story to see if its a persona, 

As you can guess this has lead to social issues 

A friend invited me to church on sunday to meet some more people since i dont have many friends since highschool and im worried about my ability to be social

Any tips? Advice? And please no judgement about coming off medication, i havent had any blatant psychotic symptoms in a long time so they treat me as if im in remission",1

is this paranoia or just a panic attack?,"I‚Äôve had things like this happen to me before, but it‚Äôs been less extreme; yesterday I was having a really bad panic attack because I thought my friends all hated me (basically just because one of them said they wanted to share a tent with a couple of my other friends when we go all camping and didn‚Äôt mention me, which I know is a really really stupid reason) and I got really angry about that, but then I started panicking even more because I saw a book on a shelf in my house which was turned into a series that I‚Äôm watching with my mum, and she said she didn‚Äôt know what it was about even though she has the book so I started to question whether she was lying about it and that turned into me question whether she‚Äôs even real, whether she‚Äôs even my mum and I was scared she lied about everything she‚Äôs ever told me, and then I started to question whether everyone else was real and I was terrified that everyone was lying to me and I didn‚Äôt know who anyone really was and I thought my family was evil and was going to harm me so I blocked the door with heavy bags and a chair so nobody could get in and I hid in the cupboard until my mum found me and I screamed when she came in and it was so scary but I eventually calmed down. Should I mention this to a doctor or something? I didn‚Äôt 100% believe it but it still scared the shit out of me and I‚Äôve been struggling with my mental health for a while I just wanna know why I‚Äôm experiencing this. I‚Äôve also previously had moments where I was terrified that my mum could read my thoughts and she was going to come into my room and kill me because I knew about it",1

My experiences with paranoia,"For some time now I've been experiencing the paranoid delusion that there is something of a war being fought over my consciousness. Some people/entities are good and fight to preserve my sense of self, others are awful and attempt to dissolve my ego. 

I've more or less trained myself over the years to not have any issue regarding maintaining a normal life despite mental health issues but there is significant persuasive techniques being used to make me feel as though none of the aforementioned is my doing and that I'm propped up by some team of people who aren't me.

So infantile of a thought. 

I'd imagine it to be quite paralyzing for others to go through something similar with the same degree of intensity. Which brings me to making this post (plus, you know, that little part of me that feels the urge to state these things just in case the paranoia is based in reality lol), I'd like to hear some others experiences?

From my perspective, I feel like I have the most difficult subset of mental health anomalies in human history.

Anybody got a story that sounds more difficult than my reddit history in various mental health forums? The worst part is I don't even post all of it lol I wouldn't have the time to live my life if all I ever did was catalog all this on here and doing so would preclude me from actually being in the situations where I'd be experiencing most of it... which is an ironic paradox.",1
I experience something like the opposite of paranoia (not pronoia) but find no info about it,"What I mean is that I often feel like others are suspicious of me. Like they are all judging me, looking at me funny, watching my moves, weirded out by me. It also often devolves into actual paranoia, feeling like they hate me because of it, that I'm a problem they have to solve etc.

Does anyone relate? What is this kind of ""opposite paranoid"" feeling that everyone suspects you - is it part of some disorder?",1
learning about NPD made me paranoid,"i now see people as either good or evil (NPD), black and white pattern of thinking, no in between.

i overanalyze people, fearful that they might be NPD, and is out to get me, i accused alot of my close ones of being NPD, creating a chaotic mess.

i wish i could go back to when i didnt know about such disorder.

it's better to  be ignorant and happy, than knowing and seeing things as they are, especially when you have a strong conscience, but as a kid, i saw pattern in people's behaviour but never knew what to call it, i guess now i know, for some reason i am extra sensitive to sensing evil, so much so it causes me to be perma hypervigilence.",1
I debunked the paranoia thoughts and I still believe them,"Hello. I have paranoia thoughts that make me wamt to self-harm sometimes.

I debunked these thoughts multiple ways. I'm still believing them. I can't get them off my mind.

Not same thoughts, but once I thought online friend is someone I know personally. He sent me even photo with date and time written on paper. I was still in doubt he's no person I know IRL.

Does it have to fade out itself or is there a self-helf technique to help it?",1
Lately whenever I'm by my sister I always feel like she can read through my thoughts and I fucking hate it,"I just want her to stop. I've gone off on outbursts in my room, begging her to leave me alone, but she just keeps fucking doing it. I know this is probably irrational and that it's nothing but I fucking swear sometimes I say something in my head and she reacts appropriately through body language. It's like she knows she can see through me and tries to keep it secret. Why isn't she stopping? Please... even if someone simply tells me it's nothing it would mean a great amount to me. Just to have some response from someone about what I'm going through right now would make me feel better.",1
What is the differences between PPD (paranoid personality disorder) and CPTSD/PTSD?,Is there significant differences? It seems like the symptoms overlap.,1
Does anyone else get waves of paranoid delusion? (Usually from hours to days in length),"Before I sound too rational and like I am not actually paranoid, I am just basing what I think reality is or should be to most people and seeing that it is not what I experience or am experiencing right now. Also the main purpose of this post is to try and find others like me or a community that deals with this. 

1. I believe my paranoid/pessimistic mental state affects the world and people around me and they start acting different. (without even speaking to them.) 
2. I have seen reasonable evidence that people are quite legitimately against me (or just evil in general) even though they were my friends. 

I will start with number 1. In my current living situation I live alone with my dog and my sister. I take the dog out frequently and today I noticed that people in their cars driving by were staring. One guy even took a photo or video of me when I was looking. He even seemed to slow the car down to do it. Usually I feel like my vision must have been obstructed but this time the window was rolled down and it looked clear as day. 

Also, It feels like when I am in this state that the world changes based on my paranoia. Like having a power that you can't control sort of way. Or one that actively goes against you. I feel like the results I am looking to have will not happen if I look forward to them too much. One example is the stock market. I feel that I should not look at the graph or it will start going against me. That is more of a soft example though. I have also been rejected from many job positions and it feels like the more I wanted it the more that obstructed. I had received an offer at a decent place only for it to be taken away by a literal pandemic. Then the company which seemed to imply they would hire everyone later rejected me over email even after all that I have been through with them (summer program they provided). Whenever I feel too happy about something it will get ripped away. 

For the second point, it seems the more I look the more evil I find. People actively don't give a shit about others. No one in this town cares about covid. 

That is not even the bigger issue to me. When I am in this state I think that it influences other peoples decisions and how they view me. Even though I never talk to them about my delusional thinking I can see it in their faces and actions. It's like they can pick up on my ""energy"" so to speak and they actively either make fun of me or avoid me. 

I am not that bad right now but there was a time I thought my GF was a literal government agent of sorts and that I had evidence to support it. I remember specifically thinking that the evidence was undeniable though I cannot seem to recall any of it.",1
Should I be worried?,"So I (M15) have never really been that paranoid of a person but recently I have noticed that something isn‚Äôt right. I worried constantly about everything, mainly my parents. I‚Äôm always in constant fear that I‚Äôm going to get in trouble even when I haven‚Äôt done anything. I‚Äôm not a bad kid but I am constantly checking my phone and deleting my search history and apps, even if I just googled something harmless like ‚ÄúHow to make an apple pie‚Äù or something, because I‚Äôm terrified of them checking my phone (even though they never have before). I lie when my parents ask me basic questions because I‚Äôm scared I will get interrogated. And it feels like everyone is watching me 24/7, it‚Äôs gotten so ridiculous to the point where there have been times I was scared I will breathe wrong. Another thing is I keep heat stomping at night, like the sounds of my parents foot steps, but it‚Äôs never them. Idk, this probably isn‚Äôt normal but is it anything I should worry about?

(Also I‚Äôm on mobile so sorry if anything is messed up, and please let me know if it is so I can fix it)",1
Paranoia over stupid things?,{deleted},1
"I'm worried that I am being watched and tracked, new signs","I'm attending university and while I am on the road to a top grade, it doesn't feel like I've done much to deserve it, it does not feel like it is genuine. I keep worrying that if I leave the university, it will tell its students and staff to track me down and watch me, so I think their grade system has been altered to fit my pace. A few days ago, they announced an extension for an activity that I have been vocally but privately discussingwith someone. I am sure that I am being watched and monitored by my university and friends right now. I was told to download a software for my course and I can't disable it. My university has a hidden reputation and I worry that they will use it to their advantage to intimidate me into submission or notify my friends and family of my whereabouts in the event that I move someplace else. This would lead to me being tracked down for life and I have been aware of this since I was young. I need to ask for forgiveness but I don't know how. I was dismissive at the time that I didn't think about it. Three days ago, there was an RSPCA van but it wasn't genuine because the logo was smaller and did not look real, and upon looking at the side window, it drove away immediately. The person inside had a GPS . A day before that, a lady was walking by my house with what looked to be her friend, and she was looking down at the ground, the way that she was walking was unusual and I think it was something that I was supposed to understand, but in that time, I didn't understand, so I never got if she was helping me or not which I feel really distressed about even now. I have only taken a photo of the van but I can't share it. In my walls, I heard tapping (not heating) around 4pm yesterday, I knocked at the wall and nothing knocked back, but the knocking continued every time I diverted my attention from it. I looked at my laptop while still focusing on my walls and nothing happened, so patterns are taken into consideration. This is recent so I don't know what this is pertaining towards, but I remember that I had a dream about my wallpaper being red paisley which was a sign (not from God), but I didn't want it, it's a bad sign which I have gathered. I worry that people can read my thoughts when they touch me or are talking to me. I had a very uncomfortable thought while someone was talking to me and I felt sick, they asked if I was okay which I attributed to them knowing I was uncomfortable due to the thought. Now I'm worried that my lecturers have seen my thoughts but I don't remember if I have had awful thoughts during lectures so I am panicking badly about this. I can't eat and I feel sick every time I try to, and attending lectures makes me feel extremely nervous, but I can't turn to God because I have no knowledge of whether I had been dismissive, so I have no good reason to. I've been looking at pictures on my Pinterest to stay on board as I store my good pictures there, and have been hanging hamsa in my room to divert the bad pictures. Bad pictures usually come from bad numbers, sounds and rarely music. I can't stop crying and feeling sick and I have to go under my covers when I do but I keep worrying that cameras are being poked through the fabric and my neck. Every time something doesn't feel right or go my way, I get overwhelmed immediately and it's affecting my relationships. My best friend could be a part of this which is horrifying to me as I have told him a lot of things. How do I ask for forgiveness? I'm really worried but more messages and signs keep coming through, I'm really frustrated that I can't understand all of them",1
Someone scoping out my house?,"I was passing through my living room and glanced out the front window and saw a man about in his 50s it looked like driving alone past my house in a Porsche convertible (that‚Äôs what it looked like). He paused and backed up to the curb right in front of my house, rolled down his window, took a picture of the front of my house or the car in the driveway or something and then drove away. I live in a small town where most people don‚Äôt make a lot of money so I wouldn‚Äôt expect to ever see a car like that here. My neighborhood is pretty compact and all the houses look very similar. Mine has nothing special about it. It‚Äôs pretty plain and there are plenty of prettier houses around. The only person who lived here before is a elderly lady who passed away. She had a daughter who lives a few streets over with her husband who we met so it wasn‚Äôt him. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being paranoid or not so I thought I‚Äôd ask for others opinions on this.",1
Dead phones =/= Dead Loved ones,"I have this paranoid anxiety everytime someone doesn't pick up their phone or it goes to voicemail. I imagine them in a ditch on the side of the road or some similar situation. I know this is common and I know realistically that I'm being paranoid, but it consumes me until I hear back from them. Does anyone have advice for how to ease this fear on my own? Thanks",1
help lol,I hope someone can relate to this. I used to smoke weed all day everyday. Not one bit of anxiety. But all the sudden I started progressively getting HORRIBLE anxiety. i used to be able to smoke a full joint and just have a good time. now i can barely take 3 hits without feeling like i can‚Äôt breathe and nearing a panic attack. I need help. I love weed so so much but it just fucking sucks now. i miss genuinely getting high it just makes me sad thinking about it :( I literally almost greened out from a roach (it was only like 9 hits)... it felt like a bad acid trip.,1
Am I paranoid or is something fishy,"Bare with me, this is going to be looong!

My background:  I grew up in a dysfunctional family. My parents always fought growing up. I think I saw them once or twice as a child being nice to each other. 99% of the time they were fighting and being loud. Idk why but that used to scare me, & I would go hide somewhere. I used to hate myself for wanting them to get a divorce. I never understood why they were together. Also, my mom is very manipulative. She used to feed me lies about everyone close to me, even my dad. She would tell me he doesn‚Äôt want me, and he wants other kids.

Anyways, I‚Äôve been married for over a year now ( I had known him a year prior to that). Our honeymoon was a disaster. We fought all the time. It used to bother me that he would check out other women ( I told him I don‚Äôt care if you do it, as long as you don‚Äôt do it when I‚Äôm around). He said I‚Äôm disrespecting him and he does not checking out women üôÑ).

It all started when he asked me why I‚Äôm still friends with some of my old exs, & he said he‚Äôs not in contact with his exs, and that he deleted all their contacts. I was like are you sure? And asked to check his phone. At the time I only knew of one ex. He tried to trick me by pretending he left his phone in the other room (gave himself time to change her name). When I confronted him, he still had her pictures on his phone, he said he freaked out and just didn‚Äôt know what to do. 
3 weeks later, I found out her younger sister called him. My husband is a Doc, and the ex is a PA. Apparently, the sis called to ask my husband about a ‚Äúsick a relative‚Äù. And he asked the sis about how his ex is doing, and what she‚Äôs up to now. (He said i thought it was the nice thing to do). He claims he told the sis he‚Äôs married now. Eventually, I told him this has affected my trust, and asked him to consider couples therapy. I really hate being lied to. 

Shortly before we start therapy, I told him it‚Äôs important for me that you delete pictures of your ex-romantic partners. He was against this idea; ‚Äúthese are memories I want to keep, to look back at‚Äù. Through the therapist, he was somewhat convinced that it‚Äôs a good idea to delete pics of his exs. 

A month goes by, and I had a mini surgery. He was taking care of me over there weekend, since I was heavily medicated. I felt he was acting odd. Few days later I asked him what was going on, he tells me he felt resentment towards me because he had to lie to meü§î. It makes no sense!
Also, turns out, that Saturday! he created a ‚ÄúTrash‚Äù folder on his laptop, with all their pictures. But he never deleted it. I felt really sick. Because a week prior to that he said he deleted everything. Another lie. I felt the need to leave the house, and ended up staying in a hotel that night. I thought maybe I was being overly dramatic, so I went back home & realized he wasn‚Äôt home. (At that point he knew why I left). 

I came back the next day, and we talked it out. I asked him where he had been that night, he said I was home all night. 3 days goes by, I kept telling him I know you weren‚Äôt home. On the the third day I explained to him that I came back so I know he‚Äôs lying. He suddenly remembered he had to go back to the hospital.( it‚Äôs something he has never done before, nor after).

He told me many times that he has no feelings for her. He told me he actually broke up with her, because his friends told him if you don‚Äôt see a future with her you should let her go, and not use her. Her claims there were no emotional feelings towards her, it was just the physical part for him. However, as I glimpsed over their messages I read that he sent her ‚Äú...this was very hard on me...‚Äù. Also, he had dated others after her.

I just knew I couldn‚Äôt trust him, so I purchased a tracking device. To see if I can catch him going somewhere, up until now, I haven‚Äôt caught him going anywhere crazy.

Also,  I recently found out, this whole year, we had been driving by his Ex‚Äôs house (same PA ex) almost every weekend on our way home. He claims it‚Äôs a ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù. I noticed he would look into that house ALL the time! & if the car windows are down, he would shut it as we drive by. (Before researching the house, I had asked him if he used to live there, or if he knew someone that lived there, he said ‚ÄúNO‚Äù). Continued to drive by until I confronted him with my findings. He claims he doesn‚Äôt know if she still lives there or not. And that I was making a big deal out of nothing.

He deleted all his messages has his phone set up to delete messages every 30 days now. I still feel my trust has been shattered. I don‚Äôt truly believe him, I just pretend that I do as to not fight. 

When we are not intimate for more than a week, I always assume he‚Äôs cheating on me.I‚Äôve this fear that he‚Äôs cheating on me, and I‚Äôm just dumb and can‚Äôt see it. There were two instances where I found hair strands that weren‚Äôt mine. I just really don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm actually going crazy, and over exaggerating this whole thing...or if I should be worried.  Please help.",1
Is this worth talking to my therapist about this,"So I haven't really used reddit before but for the last like 3 years I've kind of been feeling paranoid.
It's not really serious but it's definitely gotten a lot worse in the last while. I've always been a anxious kid but in the last while iv felt like everything I do is affected by feeling paranoid. Every time I talk to someone even a good friend or family member I'm always thinking they have a hidden motive for whatever their saying and everytime I go outside I'm looking around cos I get scared if I don't know who's around me at all times so I litteraly stare down everyone I see to find out if I know them or something, I just can never relax.
Iv looked around a bit on reddit and I can relate to what a lot of what other people are saying but I don't really know if it's normal or a problem.",1
I'm scared that everything I say will come true,"I can't seem to say certain words like de/th, because I think it'll come true.

Notice how I censored it? It's so I can avoid typing the actual word out.

I have to avoid saying anything bad, or anything I don't want to happen.
I feel like I have to be careful in everything I say.

I developed this fear when I was messaging my friend, and I was joking about how I want to move schools because of something embarrasing that happened.

Well, a few weeks later; I actually moved to another school.

I know it might just be a coincidence, but now I think I have the power of predicting the future or something.

I'm actually scared right now since I had to type out that sentence about me m/v/ng sch//ls.

Not sure if this is paranoia or something else, I just wanted to know if anyone feels this way too.",1
Am I being paranoid / dramatic or could this happen,"Okay so, I‚Äôve been looking for a place to live, I used different apps like spare room zoopla Rightmove etc and on one of the apps, I gave a landlord my number so he could send me videos of the property (because you can‚Äôt send videos over chat, and id done this with loads of different properties so I didn‚Äôt think giving my number was a big deal) He then messaged me on WhatsApp saying the room is gone. 2 weeks later he sends me a unsolicited unprovoked dick pic saying it‚Äôs ‚Äòconsolation‚Äô for the room being gone. I really panicked and just felt gross and disgusted and confused cause why are you doing this, so I screenshotted the messages and sent it to a friend asking what I should do like shall I go off on his ass or just block or report or what (this has never happened before to me) - she was going off and got so angry cause it‚Äôs technically sexual harassment, she messaged the guy ( his number was in the screenshot) a screenshot of the conversation I sent her (the one with his dick pic) and said something along the lines of ‚Äúthis is disgusting do you have no respect for women and for yourself‚Äù and called him pretending to be interested in the property then called him a perv etc etc. Now baring in mine I blocked him after the photo (panic block lol) and now upon further looking at his account on the housing app, he works for the government. I suffer with anxiety and paranoia and I‚Äôve somehow convinced myself he‚Äôs going to use my number & picture which was on the profile to find out where I live and stalk and kill me or he‚Äôs going to press revenge porn charges or get me fired or something???  I‚Äôve already been told by my friend that it probably won‚Äôt happen and I need to chill but, I guess this is a question to guys : how would you react in that instance.

Seeking advice! Is this common with paranoia?,"Ok so I don‚Äôt know if have paranoia or not so here are the symptoms that haunt me everyday and was wondering if it‚Äôs normal or paranoia?

Firstly, I‚Äôm terrified that people can read my mind. I know it‚Äôs impossible but I still feel super guilty every time I think of someone cuz I feel like they can hear what I‚Äôm thinking etc

I‚Äôm scared people can see me even though no one‚Äôs around. Kinda like the mind reading but this time that they can actually see me. Or that I‚Äôm just hallucinating and thinking that I‚Äôm alone when in fact there are other people in the room with me (I‚Äôm afraid that I might do this, I know I don‚Äôt but what if yk)

This might be more like OCD but I always have to check my phone multiple times before bed cuz I‚Äôm scared I accidentally sent something or posted something on any of my social media and I have to check every app and every account like 3-10 times to be sure.

Paranoid that my dads girlfriend does stuff just to trigger or bother me,"I have anxiety, ocd, and depression. Idk if she knows about my ocd (though she has some misconceptions on it like that it‚Äôs only cleaning so maybe she thinks my symptoms are from my anxiety?) and I find she is constantly doing stuff that I have stated upsets me/stresses me out. She also is vomiting alllll the time bc of health issues but I have pretty severe emetophobia- and it‚Äôs a living hell. I‚Äôm gonna list some stuff she does/has done.

‚Ä¢talks abt how my older sister never texts her back to me because I also never text back

Do you all think she‚Äôs actually doing all this to bother me and stress me out???? Or is she just annoying? She‚Äôs extremely manipulative and will constantly buy things for our family.

I think I have paranoia issues?,"So I can‚Äôt really talk to my friends and family about this and I‚Äôm not sure where else to turn. 

I can‚Äôt trust people. It‚Äôs basically impossible for me. Every person I need I‚Äôm hit with crazy paranoia that they‚Äôre using me for something or they pity me. This goes for family and irl friends too. People I‚Äôve known for years I find myself second guessing their intentions constantly and every good moment is immediately followed with intrusive thoughts. ‚Äúthey keep you around out of pity‚Äù ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt really love you‚Äù ‚Äúthey‚Äôre using you for something‚Äù things like that.

Usually, I‚Äôd be able to push them aside and go on with everyday life and take the good moments as they come.

My hands shake, I get headaches (worse than usual, I get occasional chronic migraines), and I start hyperventilating if I don‚Äôt distract myself right away.

I'm in an extremely paranoid episode and don't know what to do,I've been insanely paranoid lately and whenever people try and calm me down I can barely listen.

Paranoia or anxiety?,"When the cashier in the shop seems weird (like not greeting me, or just grumpy in general), I always assume it's because of me, she doesn't like me, and so on..
When I was visiting a psychologist, I thought there are things she hides from me, I have (mental) illnesses that she identified but unwilling to tell me.
When I pass a group (as a pedestrian), and they laugh, I automatically assume they're laughing at me.

Fyi, I'm not 100% sure. It's always 50-50, I MIGHT be right, or MIGHT NOT. The point is I cannot shake these thoughts off, I always try to find a hidden meaning in someone's behavior, when in fact there is probably (or certainly) nothing.",1
just a rant,"i‚Äôve always felt like this, but lately it‚Äôs been so much worse and constant. i suspect it could potentially be lack of sleep? i feel like everyone is lying to me and hiding something. especially my boyfriend. the fact that we‚Äôre in a long distance relationship does not help my case at all. i unconsciously find myself checking his social media ‚Äòfollowing‚Äô multiple times a day and he always reassures me but these thoughts never go away. just yesterday, he told me that when we‚Äôve broken up and he was single, he would be a ‚Äòwhore‚Äô and said that i‚Äôm not his ‚Äòfirst‚Äô which made me even more paranoid and insecure. every time i see that he has followed a girl and they followed him back, or that he has liked a girl‚Äôs post, my mind is suddenly filled with these thoughts that he‚Äôs cheating and doesn‚Äôt love me... i‚Äôm only fifteen yet i drown myself with these thoughts every single day and i can‚Äôt even focus on important things, such as school. my head hurts constantly and it‚Äôs very hard to get mental aid where i live, and the current global situation makes it worse. i just want the thoughts to stop :(",1
Is this normal or paranoia or something else?,"I always seem to have these intense thoughts of people dying. 

When I was 10, I was SURE I wouldn't make it till age 11.
When my brother was 6, I was certain he would die before 7 because that just didn't sound right on him (and I feel HORRIBLE for even thinking that, I know it's awful).
We're both still here.

In November, I was driving with my family somewhere and I could not shake the feeling someone was going to die the whole trip (3 days) - I was sure it was going to be one of us but then I thought it would be my best friend's mom. I don't know why I even thought that about her specifically, maybe because she had been a little ill in hospital but not enough to die - she was literally due to get back home that weekend. My friend told me on the third day that her mum had died... on the same day I first got that feeling. 

And now, I'm moving away for college with my dad, leaving my mum and brother behind and I'm SCARED that something's going to happen to him and I wont see little brother again. Probably because I'm generally an awful sister who doesn't interact with him ever, and I feel like by the time I miss him and realise how much I need him, he's going to be gone and I'll have to live my whole life with regret. 

There's also another thing, I'm constantly scared that there's secretly someone, an evil spirit, murderer, whatever you wanna call it, in our house or hiding in my room. Did I used to watch a lot of horror movies at night? Yes, but even then I've never been scared for longer than just one night, if that. 

Even now, I had to curl under my duvet because I'm sure if I carried on typing this out of it, the thing or whatever would get me (it's night). Last night, as I was sleeping at about 5am, it seemed like something was shaking my bed - we don't get earthquakes and there's no feasible way for anyone to actually do that to my bed because it's massive, so I spent that time scared there was something with me. It's happened one or two times before too. I'm constantly expecting to see something in the mirror at night or just anything anywhere, and there are times I've fully convinced myself that there's something behind me in the mirror and that I saw it,
and I really don't like staying in my house alone if I could have a choice.

Am I just someone with an overactive imagination/horrible thoughts/childish? I'm 18 now, if that helps at all.",1

"People who seeked help, how did it go?","I'm afraid my therapist will be disgusted by me or think I'm coming on too strong. Since my fears are mostly technology/surveillance/authority related, I didn't mention any of them in my introductions email and i'm planning on just spamming them with information as soon as i feel safe.

Has anyone on this sub gotten help? how did you start talking about your delusions?",1
Am I Just Paranoid?,"So, I can be a pretty paranoid person, pretty easily. Two days ago we smelt gas in the house, so, we did what anyone would do and called the fire department to see if we had a gas leak, and they said everything was okay and there was no sign of a gas leak. But, of course, I am working myself up, still, worrying about what if there is Co2 in the house, all because I'm nauseated. Which, happens to me often, so i should just be used to it, right? But, of course, I sit here and look up symptoms of co2 and poisoning pretty much to the brink of a panic attack. Making my nausea worse. I feel like I am just paranoid. I guess i just need reassuring. I should feel okay since our fire department literally told us everything was all clear, shouldn't I? But, I can't help but worry. There are two other people in the house, and they're fine, of course. That, and we have dogs who are all fine and acting normally. I guess I'm just so used to working myself up. Should I just chill out and stop worrying so easy over something that was all cleared by a team of firefighters and considering everyone else in the house is fine and not experiencing any sort of symptoms, other than one person with a stomach ache because they drank today? I guess I am just looking for reassurance.",1
I thought my best friend was trying to kill me.,"**Trigger Warning** Self-Harm

My first few weeks at college were amazing...then I started to think my best friend/roommate was trying to kill me.

I'm Michelle Hammer and I have Paranoid Schizophrenia. I'm not sure when I officially got it but it didn't really ""blow up"" until I went to college at 18.

I made this video to help other people who are dealing with Paranoid Schizophrenia.

I constantly feel like I‚Äôm being watched,"Ever since I was a kid I have had a feeling that someone was always watching me. Whether it be through a window or hidden or even an imaginary person in front of me? I used to not even be able to change clothes without keeping myself covered out of fear of who was watching me. In the past few years the feelings haven‚Äôt gone away, but I‚Äôve taken the attitude of ‚ÄúI have nothing to hide so whoever is watching me isn‚Äôt going to phase me‚Äù. Lately though I‚Äôve been experiencing heightened anxiety and I just feel drained from being watched all the time. I have no idea what privacy actually feels like. I wish I could just be completely alone and not have to worry about someone watching me. I‚Äôm exhausted with this feeling but I don‚Äôt know what to do or who to talk to. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve explained this throughly enough but does anyone feel this way too?",1
ease paranoia,i have mild to moderate paranoia with lots of things in my life and i have been looking up things to help me cope with it for months and have started meditating but i was wondering if anyone had any methods or anything to get out of your paranoia that doesnt include drugs,1

(M21) Paranoid About Phone Calls and Passing Cars,"My roomie told me it was PTSD from a screwy upbringing. Growing up we had those knocks at the door, usually from DFS officers. Nothing bad was ever happening but we had nosy neighbors. Throughout life I fought with strange people and it‚Äôs left me so rattled that I fear posting my residential location(s). 

They‚Äôre no threat but it seems my whole life is part of one big defense. I flinch at knocks on my door, I‚Äôm always scuttling to the door/window every-freaking-time a car so much as passes my place. 

Sirens are the fucking worst. Only when I‚Äôm home though. My current neighbor is elderly with respiratory issues. Twice the ambulances arrived at his place. Rattled the shit out me.

Very conscious about what I put into the universe, monitoring my thoughts so as not to butterfly effect the wrong kind of attentions at me. It‚Äôs a gross fucking feeling.",1
Thank you,I‚Äôm not alone I really appreciate everyone in here I‚Äôve been having the same issue that y‚Äôall have listed and now I feel somewhat normal cus I know it doesn‚Äôt exist but it still does in my head no matter what they say I know it as fact.,1
Paranoia or Anxiety??,"So sometimes I‚Äôm afraid of my shadow and convinced there are people in my house. I can‚Äôt ever find them but sometimes I 100% believe they‚Äôre there. This only happens (so far) when I take a little too much of my Abilify. It‚Äôs a long story but I take 1-2mg every other day because I have super sensitivities to meds. I told my psych about the people in my house and she said that‚Äôs just anxiety. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but people in my house that are real to me feels like borderline psychosis at least but paranoia at a minimum. I am afraid people will break in. I‚Äôm afraid people are in. Not all the time, but for example, right now my light is on because I‚Äôm afraid to go to bed and be in the dark‚Äînot because of people, but because I‚Äôm uneasy and afraid something will come. My heater came on and my first thought was someone is in the house and turned it on. No, I just thought I turned it off when I checked it this evening. If I hear a beep like my refrigerator door beeps when it‚Äôs open I immediately think something is very wrong and the world is ending. Beeps send my into apocalypse mode and it‚Äôs hard to feel normal after. I know my thoughts are irrational. My sane brain is still sitting in the back of the bus but I‚Äôm pretty confused about what to call this. I have been diagnosed as OCD, bipolar NOS, and Gen Anxiety Disorder. I don‚Äôt have any of the common schizoaffective symptoms, just what I described above. What do I call this?",1

Does nobody else find it concerning that people aren't worried about big companies?,"Alright, recently Parler was kicked off of the google play store and I believe the Apple App Store, as well as Amazon's store.

I don't use Parler, never even been on it, and from what I've seen I don't agree with the content there. But is nobody concerned about the fact that it got nuked off the face of the earth because big tech companies didn't like it? What happened to ""If you don't like how our platform is run, then make your own""? How can people make their own if anything that goes against the grain is deleted.

Again, this isn't about ""Parler"" per-se, I have no personal stake or anything with the site and I really never had any intent of even using it. But this is just the latest example of a new tech upstart company getting nuked because the ""big dogs"" didn't like it in their yard and I'm getting really worried that companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, etc are essentially dictating every piece of content we see on a daily basis.",1

They're going to leave me,"I don't know where to start, but I'm in an adult relationship. We've been together for 3 weeks and lately it feels like she's been more slow to reply. When we hang out in person, there are absolutely no issues, and the verbal and physical communication is great

I suffered abuse growing up and also have a history of partners leaving after the month or two month mark (because they got back into the dating scene too quickly or other rubbish like that; after showing me houses they wanted to buy with me or kitchens they liked. Yes I know, that was a red flag. Them moving so quickly like that. I should have known they'd do a 360)

I've also moved lots and never had any long lasting friendships till recently, the last set of friends I had to cut out due to them disrespecting me. I have a group of friends at the moment, no worry there. But that was just to set the backstory; temporary friendships, temporary relationships, low self esteem, and it all subsequently spiralled into depression, intrusive thoughts and paranoia

I'm paranoid that my current partner will leave me, even though she's been finding it tough lately as have I. I've got no reason to suspect her. It's just my bl00dy brain being stupid. How do you cope with thoughts like this one? It's making me so sad. I just texted my partner about it but don't think she'll reply. any time soon (I expect she'll be back in 2+ hours?). Telling her about it was so difficult because I worry it'll push her further away; again another one of my intrusive and paranoid thoughts. Argh... I'm so done I want to d!e or hibernate because life is too much right now. So it's not in a su!cidal way, don't worry. I'm just overwhelmed and burnt out by my thoughts :/",1
Recursive obsessive thoughts (long text),"Since I know myself I have recursive thoughts, meaning that it starts and while my mind gives continuity to it I inevitably return to it, for what I accounted from other people it is normal to have tem in stressful or disconcerting situations, or even with simple thing such as a catchy song or a new word they learned, but I also have paranoid thoughts about vile and gruesome deaths and deformations, on almost every occasion, Avery pointy, hard, heavy, hot, electrical, mechanical, or flammable, immediately trigger this kind of thought, but even with simple things which as corners, steps, windows, and ladders can trigger those thoughts, and when they are too discomforting they become recursive and the more I think about them the more paranoid I get, but it's not a well defined well stablish paranoia, is just an impending feeling of doom and eerieness.
But since my last camping trip, in which I had a paranoid anxiety crisis, triggered by the noise of a bug that woke me up that was extremely similar to a motorcycle, making so that my limbs became dormant and I thought I was having a hipotermic episode, I have been have a weird kind of paranoia, instead of having a gorey thought that keeps me distressed, I have a shutdown of my rational and lyrical functions just feeling me with a paralysing anxiety.
I feel that it might be related to the fear of contamination by COVID and the closeness to the Brazilian equivalent of the SATs which also mean I'm graduating.

That is my report, have any of you had any similar experiences? Did anything helped you? Was it just a phase?",1
death,"in the past year a lot of people around me, relatives or family friends or just people i know, have died. idk if that just made me too conscious of death, but recently i‚Äôve been really paranoid that it can happen at any time to the people around me especially my significant other and my family. 

everytime they go out or are just taking a ride home and i‚Äôm not sure where they currently are or know if they‚Äôre home or in a safe place i suddenly think ‚Äúare they dead?‚Äù and the thought doesn‚Äôt leave me, constantly making me feel really uneasy, until i contact them again and know they‚Äôre fine.

i really think this is unhealthy, any thoughts on how to deal with this? :(",1
My first paranoia ig.,"So long story short: a month ago I read a creepy korean manga (manhwa) and now after a sleepless night I feel like monsters from this manga are hiding in the dark places of my house (I'm not alone here, but I'm the only one not sleeping). Only thinking of dark makes me feel primal fear. Nothing like this happened to me before, I never considered myself brave but this is just too much. I am disgusted with my own cowardice.",1
Paranoid about people adding me on snapchat,I barely use the platform and I'm not a guy with many friends. I literally only use the platform for a single group chat and that's it. Just now 2 people I have never heard of added me. I'm friends with someone with an extremely wide social circle so I just assumed I got into some random peoples quick add. They added me by fucking search. How do they know about me? I'm worried someone made a dating profile with my snapchat name to harrass me. Considering deleting my account but my friends will eventually ask questions,1
Possible PPD,"I‚Äôm pretty sure I have PPD ( Paranoid Personality Disorder ) and the scary thing about being paranoid in relationships is, that you never actually know if you are just being paranoid or you have a good reason, people could literally take advantage of you being self-aware that you are paranoid, do any of you feel the same way and how do you cope?",1
Am I being paranoid or is the government going to fucking kill me,"Can‚Äôt sleep won‚Äôt sleep.

My bedroom door is barricaded with my dresser in the way. 

I think I told them too much and they replaced my best friend with a robot when texting them.

I genuinely can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm crazy or this is real. What is happening?",1
Question,What is the difference between anxious thoughts and paranoid thoughts?,1
I‚Äôm a piece of sh*t,"Ok, so... I‚Äôm m17 and I got a f17 friend. I have a huge crush on her and I even told her one day, she doesn‚Äôt love me. I perfectly understand that but I still act like she was my girlfriend even though it‚Äôs far from being the case. I am so jealous and I get mad when she‚Äôs with her other male friends. Why do I do this? Why am I so painfully retarded?",1

Trust issues,"TW/ abuse 
After years of childhood sexual assault and abuse and multiple toxic and abusive relationships I feel so broken am afraid to trust. 

I‚Äôm in the happiest relationship of my life and I‚Äôm terrified my paranoia is going to destroy it. I doubt everything, I‚Äôm can‚Äôt trust myself half the time so it feels impossible to trust anyone else. 

Lately I start to convince myself that other people are unaware of their true feelings about me. Like that my girlfriend doesn‚Äôt love me and will one day realize it. I‚Äôm so fragile and afraid. I want to be better.

I am in therapy (4 years now) and I take lexapro and Wellbutrin",1
Is this Paranoia?,"I'm afraid to close my eyes. Does anyone else have this?. I think it's because of anxiety, which makes sense. I can't sleep and I'm afraid to close my eyes. I close them and start panicking immediately, so I have to open them again. As you can imagine, trying to sleep isnt easy. 
I also have small fears of being alone and fear of dark. Even when washing my face in the shower, I close my eyes to splash my face then quickly reach for a towel while still standing in the shower, just to wipe my eyes and be able to open them again. 

I think this fear is sort of paranoia on my behalf because I dread the dark, closing eyes, sitting in middle of a room, having back to a door or window, just because I can't see if something/someone approaches me. 

Does anyone fear closing their eyes but for a different reason or is it also part of paranoia?",1
Becoming very afraid of being executed for the kind of media I consume due to some kind of future regime change.,"
I‚Äôm afraid that some kind of organized crime syndicate will come into power in America. Some of the movies I own have Nazis or the mob or yakuza as the villains. I‚Äôm afraid that they‚Äôll somehow find out that I own these due to my purchasing history and execute me. This even applies to not living in America. What if through some wild circumstances I am forced to live in China for the rest of my life. They find out I have owned a movie critical of the Chinese government and decide to persecute me. For South Korean movies, I‚Äôm afraid that North Korea will take over and execute me for owning any depiction of South Korea even if it doesn‚Äôt mention North Korea at all.",1
Data leak even when computer has no internet connection,"Have anyone experienced something like this before? Basically, when I open a picture containing some tags (cats, dogs, flowers,...) while I'm in offline mode (no wi-fi, no cable, just a pc with power cables, hdd, vga, cpu,...), I suddenly see it everywhere on social media when I'm connected to the internet. Could be spyware, I guess. But it basically limits my computer usage. Even when i'm OFFLINE. Any tips would be great.",1
How do I deal with paranoia related to my relationship?,"After a break up I recently had where my girlfriend would lie quite a lot about things being okay, going into a new relationship has me panicing, without any actual reason, every single day. I find it extremely difficoult to trust whatever my current girlfriend says, and also what some of my closest friends say. I've always had shown signs of paranoid behevior but then I could easily calm myself down by thinking about these thoughts were just me overthinking without any ""evidence"" behind them, but now not even this helps, not even the words of my girlfriend or best friend are enough to make me even a bit less paranoid. I've talked to my mom about this and she said that she was experienced similar things but none of them were as bad as mine. I honestly don't know how to deal with these thoughts, sometimes I'm able to convince myself that these simply aren't possible or are just not realistic, but that only works for maybe a few hours at best. It has gotten to the point where I can hardly fall asleep and even that's only after I had a panic attack. I'm wondering if anyone has any sort of advice?",1
Anyone feels like truman show? or everyone knows about their life???,Please help!! I've been feeling for the longest time that mt life is on camera or that the whole entire world knows about my life and everything I've done... Is this true??? I'm constantly thinking that I'm being made fun from things I've done in the past. I see signs everywhere but mostly on TV or peoples actions or words. Like people are making fun of me because I see relation between my past and what I see haunting me back in the present....,1
Help please,Guys what are the symptoms of paranoia? How you experience them?,1
Paranoia surrounding social media,"Recently I've found myself to be increasingly paranoid about the possibility of being cyberstalked, having my personal info leaked, and having my reputation ruined by things that happened online. Like a lot of people, I did some pretty dumb shit on the internet as a teenager, and lied a lot about myself. I used a different moniker online for the most part, but was dumb enough to tell about a dozen people my real last name. It's not one-of-a-kind, but it's fairly uncommon in the US (about 2,500 people) Yes, I looked it up, because that's how much I worry about this. About 3 people out of them know my legal name, with my real first name. 

Now I'm filled with the fear that these people will try to look me up years in the future, harass me, post malicious content online that could be looked up by my employers, try to contact my family members, etc. I considered them friends, and I don't think they harbor any ill will toward me. One of them definitely didn't like me, but they were extremely non-confrontational and avoided any difficult conversations, so I don't think they would try to do anything.

I know this is irrational, but this fear has consumed my life for the past month to the point where I subsequently fear having any sort of reputation that would make me searchable online in the future. Just on the off chance that these people would hold a grudge.",1
I'm paranoid about cheating.,"It started when I was bored at school. I was imagining how my life would look like if I was in a relationship with my teachers or classmates (I often wonder how my life would look like if I did something differently. It's not because I'm not satisfied with my life but because I'm curious or just have nothing else to do). This combined with the fact I just changed schools and was excited to meet new people made me panic a lot because I was afraid I had a crush on someone else than my bf.


At one point a year ago I wanted to masturbate to having a threesome with me, my bf and someone else. For some reason I didn't just imagined a random person but one of my classmates. I've been paranoid I have a crush on that guy ever since. 


The thing is, I don't even remember that he exists when I'm not panicking. We don't even talk to eachother anymore because I don't want to.


My bf knows about all of this. He forgave me and still trusts me. I would never cheat, I was just a dumbass who thought that imagining things is harmless (I stopped doing that after I realised how wrong it was).


I'm not paranoid about cheating with only that guy, I'm afraid I'll cheat with every single man I talk to (which is pretty funny since I'm bi). Talking to someone even when it's my freaking cousin? Cheating. Doing makeup for my crossdresser friend? Cheating. Being hit on even though I'm telling this person that I'm not interested? Cheating. Sitting next to a man? Cheating. Looking at a man and thinking he has nice clothes or just looks good? Cheating. Ironically, thinking a girl looks gorgeous and sexy isn't cheating... Fangirling over a freaking character in a movie? Cheating. Hugging my own fucking boyfriend? Cheating. Wtf brain?? 


Unfortuneatley it started evolving. My female bff, who's the type of person who kisses her homies goodnight, told me she loves me. Nothing unusual. Like I said, she tells it to everybody. But now I'm afraid I had a crush on her in the past too even though when she offered to kiss me two years ago (she never kissed a girl before and wanted to know how it feels like) I refused. 


I know I don't have crush on someone other than my bf. I'm afraid I HAD a crush in the past even though I havent. This possibility disgusts me even though I don't think catching feelings towards someone else while being in a relationship is wrong as long as you don't cheat. I love my bf and would never forgive myself if I'd develop a crush on someone else even if I'd ignore it and would work on fixing our relationship.",1
Possible PPD?,"This post may be triggering so proceed with caution. I‚Äôm going to talk about¬†anxiety¬†and¬†specific fears/ phobias.

I‚Äôm not sure whether these are attributed solely to my anxiety or if they could be considered part of PPD and/ or delusions:

- Not wanting to take medicine from my parents as a kid, when I was sick, because I thought they were trying to poison me.

- Being resistant to taking medication in general because I think there‚Äôs something wrong with it and I‚Äôm going to be drugged.

- Fear of overdosing on medication because I don‚Äôt trust myself to remember if I‚Äôve already taken it; this one might be justified with my DID which causes amnesia.

- I‚Äôm uncomfortable and try to avoid talking about certain things in the same room as a smartphone because I think it can hear me.

- Similarly uncomfortable with talking about anything personal over text/ messenger, for the same reason. Someone might read it.

- Wary of trying new foods in case I have an allergic reaction and die, even if I‚Äôve read the ingredients. I can‚Äôt eat anything that anyone else has prepared for me. Sometimes this transfers to foods I already know are safe.

- Fear of choking (maybe ARFID related). It‚Äôs usually manageable but sometimes crops up and makes it extremely difficult for me to eat anything solid for days/ weeks at a time.

- This one is less common, but thinking that there‚Äôs something¬†wrong¬†with my body. Like maybe it‚Äôs slowly rotting on the inside.¬†It doesn‚Äôt help that I have nightmares about things like my teeth falling out.

- Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and have to check every room in my house to make sure nobody‚Äôs broken in.

- I refuse to answer the door for anyone who isn‚Äôt in uniform and delivering a package, because they might be a criminal.

- I have a lifelong/ reoccurring fear of being falsely convicted of a crime and going to jail.

- I‚Äôm convinced that most of my friends secretly dislike me and I imagine them talking behind my back.

- Sometimes I think my partner has turned against me and I‚Äôm convinced he‚Äôs talking about me behind my back.

- Similarly, I will think my partner is cheating on me (for no reason/ without any evidence). I become fixated on the thought that he‚Äôs developed feelings for someone else.

- I tend to expect the worst from people and think they‚Äôre against me.

- If someone is late and/ or doesn‚Äôt answer their phone, I obsessively worry that they died in a car crash or something.

- I‚Äôm wary of every stranger I pass on the street because they might intend to hurt me.

- I rarely walk anywhere alone because I‚Äôm afraid of being assaulted or kidnapped.

- When I‚Äôm driving I easily become convinced that someone is following me.

- Sometimes I‚Äôm afraid that a loved one is going to end up murdering me for no reason.

- If anyone near me is holding a knife, I don‚Äôt trust them. No matter who it is.

- If a strange coincidence happens, I easily become convinced that it¬†means something¬†and I start searching for patterns around me
.
(I‚Äôm also curious about whether anyone else has the same fears, and if you have PPD).",1
Extreme COVID paranoia,"I think this pandemic is driving me insane. I have become so suspicious of anybody who shows even the slightest sign that they're not well. Just now I had to go and empty the trash and I had to walk across the carpark. So far, so good you'd think. Nobody around but then literally out of nowhere, a woman without a mask is walking towards me, plenty of space for her to walk past without coming closer than 6 feet to me. The idiot walks so near that I literally almost walk into the skip on the other side of my path because I am moving to try and avoid her. Then just as she walks by me she sniffs.

Was having an okay day and now freaking out why are people so fricking inconsiderate? My mind is telling me she was doing it purpose and wants to get me sick, and then there's a small part of me that thinks no wait, sniffing is normal, it's wintertime and cold. I don't even know at this point, just need things to go back to normal before I lose my mind :(",1
Tips on dealing with paranoia?,My paranoia is very severe and makes daily tasks like showering painful and difficult. And ways to deal with it? Its at the point where its driving me crazy. When i shower every 30 seconds i have to open the shower curtain because i get paranoid. At night i peep out my window thinking im being watched. When a car drives past me i have to examine every detail of it. Its driving me crazy i just want one day where i am not paranoid,1
Living in fear,"Paranoid all the time

I‚Äôve always thought what i‚Äôm experiencing is normal. I can‚Äôt walk anywhere anymore especially in the dark, i CONSTANTLY feel like someones going to attack/kill me and i‚Äôm always anxious, I can‚Äôt even go to the shop around the corner unless it‚Äôs morning (light) and i‚Äôm still scared at that point. I‚Äôm constantly living in fear.. I get panick attacks often too and intrusive thoughts every fucking day and I constantly argue with myself in my head. I don‚Äôt know how to cope with it. 

Tonight (5pm) went to the shop with my family who are all adults and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about someone behind me or out of nowhere is going to attack me or my family and I make mysef so scared. A lady started speaking to my sister about her mask in a nice way and I kept telling her to stop staring at the lady incase she attacks us and I was literally shaking. I could feel my heart beating so fast I felt like crying and could feel a panic attack coming. 

Please, anyone. Anything . I need help",1
I don't know if its intrusive thoughts or ocd,for the last couple years i've been dealing with trying to keep my shit together mentally. My paranoia is growing terrible. I fear aliens appearing or someone following me online. The amount of accounts i've created is absurd. it's getting terrible. i can no longer tell if its intrusive thoughts OCD or paranoia.,1
How to deal with going down late night rabbit holes?,"I find myself getting incredibly paranoid late at night making it very difficult to sleep. I‚Äôll take like a little nugget of truth then continue to twist it. The more nights I stay up like this, the less and less I feel I can trust those close to me and the more I feel like they are out to destroy me. Any advice?",1
Has anybody here had the delusion that they or someone else was sexually assaulted?,"(For those checking my post history, I either randomize or conceal gender to avoid identification and bias.  Sometimes it's hard to write genderless.)

Sorry if this doesn't belong on this forum but I really need to get this out there because it's tearing at me.

A few nights ago my wife was 100% convinced that our 5 year old daughter was sexually assaulted by an intruder in the middle of the night.  There was no evidence of an intruder and the idea that there has been an intruder coming in just about every night has persisted for a long time now and I'm making no progress trying to convince my wife that it isn't happening.

Eventually my wife managed to convince me to take our daughter in to the hospital for an examination, but she wouldn't take her in herself -- like some secret part of herself knows she's mentally unwell and is trying to keep it a secret, and knows that the doctors will think she's got issues but *somehow* if **I** take our daughter in they'll take it seriously.

They did a urine test and a superficial examination and said they found no evidence of abuse or drugging.  They advised me not to go for the more invasive examination, feeling it would be an *actual* trauma to my daughter just to be *extra* sure that trauma hadn't occurred, so I didn't go for it.

The doctor's word and the lab results didn't change my wife's mind.  The assault 100% happened and they were just careful to use a drug that hospitals don't test for and careful not to do any damage.  Just like they can avoid all the cameras (or edit footage) and get in and out without leaving any sign.

I just want it to stop and I don't know how.",1

lingering fear that someone is watching me when i‚Äôm downstairs by myself + checking outside all windows 

scared to look under my bed

must have blinds closed when i‚Äôm taking a shower, even though i have patterned glass you can‚Äôt see out of and it‚Äôs on the back wall of my house

constantly checking behind shower curtain when taking a shower to see if someone‚Äôs there

constant belief that people can read my mind

cant go downstairs at night after the rest of my family is asleep for fear someone‚Äôs down there

I can't take it anymore.,"I have been dealing with some form of paranoia or paranoid delusions(so they say) for almost 10 years. 

I am not oblivious to the fact that my extended amphetamine use has contributed to this a great deal. The issue I'm dealing with now(sober) is that I can't distinguish the paranoid delusions (from my last extended amphetamine binge) with real life or even the mild lingering paranoia that I deal with day to day.

 I've been on Seroquel 100mg at night for almost 14 months. It used to really help at least calm the thoughts, but now sometimes it makes it worse. 
Everything is connected! I draw lines and make connections from one arbitrary detail to build these grandeous conclusions. The problem is that these details are all based in some amount of truth or so it seems. I can't tell the difference anymore. 

I'm writing this on my main Reddit account and I don't even care. I'm so sick and tired of feeling like this and everyone just calling me crazy... 

It's all based in fear. I know that because I feel it.

Even writing this, the auto correct suggestions are telling me a story that I'm not really supposed to know but that someone wants me to slowly figure out ""on my own."" 

There always seems to be a guiding hand or overseeing entity, seemingly someone who cares about me that wants me to know these secret bits of information but for whatever reason can't just tell me the whole thing.

I'm familiar with projecting and can spot when I'm reaching externally for answers that can be found internally. It's just gotten to a point where I think others use my ""projectjon, paranoia, fears, and delusions"" as a way to discredit the things I think. 

I'm scared. 

I dont know who I can even tell these things to anymore. When I go to people in my network who struggle with similar things, they say it will go away. But it hasn't. 
It's why I go back to drugs continually. It quiets the incessant thoughts. 

I won't go into detail about the delusions. 
A vauge idea of what I think and feel though:

1) Someone is making decisions for me, sometimes and mostly for the good. (They want me to succeed)
2) The people I have met authentically were pre determined and all have a specific purpose in the unknown goal that I am to be used to achieve. 
3) There is no bad or terrible thing that I am meant to do. (I think the path I keep being set on is a righteous one of some sort or at least it's meant to be ultimately positive) 
4) Someone or some group knows more than they are letting on and for whatever reason cannot disclose information to me ... (Imagine being a bystander in an active investigation and the cops don't want to change your behavior patterns because it may disturb the raw data they are trying to gather on the real intended target)
So I may not be the ""main player"" and I am almost certain I am not.

I'm going to stop now cause I'm getting freaked out by the amount of noise cars that have started to drive by even as I write this. 
I'll come back to edit if I feel the need tomorrow. 

I don't think I'm Jim Cary in the Truman Show. Not anymore. I think I'm subsequently apart of something similar but for whatever reason it's imperative I DON'T KNOW the plan.",1
Have any of you gotten a Covid test?,"Long story short I might go get tested, but I want to know what personal information I‚Äôll have to give them. I‚Äôm probably just going to do the drive through test. Will I have to give them my address? Full name? I feel really uncomfortable giving out this information. 

(If it comes down to it, I‚Äôll give them the info. I‚Äôd rather be safe than sorry with the Covid, but if I can avoid giving out personal info that‚Äôs even better)",1
"I‚Äôm making a short film about paranoia. I‚Äôve been suffering from it for about a year now. So I was basically wondering if there‚Äôs anything you guys can let me know to better understand the mental illness. Maybe how it makes you feel, how it affects your life, literally anything.",,1
I'm constantly looking over my shoulder,"First time posting on reddit but for context: due to living situation and experience I've come to have really bad trust issues which lead to an unholy amount of paranoia I didn't realize I had 

So I have really bad trust issues I've come to distance myself with most people but I had meet someone who was always honest with me never let me hear what I wanted to hear always 100 with you and I'm currently in a relationship with her and my trust for people is slowly coming back but we were at a outside mall looking at the movies wondering if we should watch one and I had sent her to go get tickets I don't like standing in lines to open so I put my back to a tree just in case some was trying to sneak up and for some reason I was convinced I had to look out that someone was out there or someone was planning something maybe not to me but I had to be prepared need a quick way out something close I can use to fight somewhere for cover and I hadn't realized she was coming back from the getting tickets and she saw me I had never really showed my true emotion on my face only thing that you could tell is if I was happy, bored or disgusted but apparently she had seen the paranoia on my face I had never shown emotion like that and called me out for it asking if I was okay that I look paranoid and it made me realize the amount of paranoia I had she brought to my attention that the whole time we were there I had kept looking over my shoulder glancing never getting to close to people and just tensed up that the only time I had been relaxed is when we were alone away from people and it made me realize anytime I go somewhere I'm always worrying that some one is going to pull something to the point were I dislike going out in public and I'm always planing just in case so I felt like I should probably talk about it doing it mostly for her",1
The memories don't fade,"Whenever there's a phone call, an ambulance or a police car or someone's at the door, I panic really hard. 
I am scared I will be readmitted to mental hospital again, against my will and for no specific reason. I try to breathe normally and stay calm and close my eyes and imagine I am at the sea (beautiful/positive imagery) but I end up so frightened that it takes all my strength not to end myself immediately when I am confronted with one of the triggers listed above... The ward I was in traumatised me... It was involuntarily and I felt so vulnerable and exploited... It's been months and it still affects my eating habits and my sleep. 
I am always scared I tell someone something and they immediately suspect I am in danger... I also have very bad experiences with doctors, nurses and hospitals and normal doctor's offices... Even if I need to go because I will probably end up hospitalised if I keep skipping important doctor's/ appointments with the specialists... But I don't care at this point... I became really avoidant and rarely leave the house...",1
Any music recommendations?,"Do y‚Äôall have any music that you feel like represents the anxiety and sense of reality that comes with paranoia? Just looking for some new stuff to maybe relate to, thanks!",1
"Hello! I don‚Äôt know where else to post this, haha","Context: my brother gave me some trauma

I always feel like I‚Äôm being watched, judged, threatened, envied and creeped on whenever I turn my back on my brothers room.

My Delusions and Paranoid Thoughts,"Sometimes you just need to get it out of your head and into the world. That's all this post is..
(I don't have these 24/7, but these are the thoughts that fill my brain and really freak me out on bad days.)

My Delusions and Paranoid Thoughts:

- I live in a time loop that has happened over and over again. My life has already happened and I have lived through most moments multiple times already. Each time is slightly different but mostly very similar. 
- Scientists are studying my ideas and actions for research on individuals with non neurotypical brains. My entire life is a lie.
- There are cameras outside my window. Or someone can see through it eventhough the blinds are down. (Sometimes I have to put a sheet over the window to feel better)
- I can empathize with my cats and read their emotions.
- The love of my life is only pretending to love me. It's all a science experiment, or maybe a big joke. Maybe its televised to thousands of people. Maybe the entire thing is a rouse. They don't trust me enough to really love me.
- This life is not real. It's all a dream. Or in my head. I will wake up some day in a mental ward and that's when I'll really have lost my mind.
- People in my daily life are part of an elaborate scam. Not all of them, but some. So you can never fully trust anyone.
- There is a seperate personality living inside my body. Silent and always observing. 
- If I did something crazy enough (like spontaneously go skydiving) then I could break the system I'm stuck inside and  get my free will back.
- My inner thoughts speak to me while I'm drifting off to sleep, but I'm to close minded to hear them.
- If I get high enough someday (on weed, shrooms, acid, or what have you) My personality will fully split and I will be two seperate people. One good and one bad.
- My body speaks to me. (In a phantom way) 
- The art I make gets analyzed by professionals and archived to be used in treating patients with mental disorders.
- My controlling parents have trapped me in their own fake world. Where I believe I have freedom, but it's all in their control.
- The choices I make are pre determined. I can only have so many options.
- People (Managers) at work watch me while I'm on the job. They have to make sure I'm on task.
- I've read all the books in my personal library (I haven't), so what's the point in reading them again if I'm only being studied.
- The tv shows I watch are all directed towards me. They all have a different message to convey. Whether it's about my life, my relationships, my mental health, the fact that I think the tv is narrating my fucking life. (Same with the radio) They are always trying to help though, so it doesn't bother me too much.
- I get baited to watch the same shows over and over again (with gaps in between) to see how I react to them. That data is given to people who analyze my personality. 
- The manifestation of my childhood dragon friend lives in the spirit world and sleeps in the tree next to my old college dorm room. (This one's real interesting).
- My partner brings up the same conversations to see how I react (Similar to the tv shows)
- If I don't double check the door at night to make sure its locked someone will come in and murder my partner. There would be nothing I could do about it.
- If I tell my partner all these intrusive thoughts, they will be terrified and send me to shock therapy.
- Certain tasks in my life have been constructed to measure my strength and endurance. (This makes me work extra hard for no reason)


I might make a part 2 later bc this isn't all of them. It's making me emotional to wrote them down. It's good to get it all out though. 

Real Quick! I have been to therapy, not currently because of my finances. I'm planning on seeing a physiologist or psychiatrist asap. My partner knows I have paranoia and is always very helpful and understanding. Sorry for any typos :)",1
Minor sleep deprivation made me hallucinate?,"Yesterday, shortly before falling asleep, and after staying up all night drinking energy drinks and playing GTA V Online (trying to grind out some in-game cash, which is hard to come by for free), I had the distinct impression that I was rapidly losing my mind.

Normally when I'm tired I just fall asleep no matter how much caffeine I drink; the caffeine just helps me stay alert while I'm already awake. However, last night I guess I hit a 'sweet spot' and I sort of got stuck in between sleeping and being awake. I figured the game was making me twitchy from being alert too long, and began watching YouTube to unwind.

The first and only video I watched ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJEF\_U3L0B4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJEF_U3L0B4), I remember the video because that's when things got weird), I found my brain randomly latching onto little things in the video's content, like words, gestures, etc. and I got the most literal 'tunnel vision' effect that I've ever experienced.

This startled me, and I jokingly thought to myself something like, ""Ha, my brain's playing tricks on me."" I then suddenly had a frightening and nightmarish hallucination of a really vivid brain. Just the otherwise harmless word triggered a terrifying response.

I immediately slammed my computer shut, sprinted to my bed, and hid under my blanket like a four-year-old. I fought my way toward a restless sleep, in which I constantly felt like my back was exposed to some unknown threat, even when I laid face-up.

Now, after having slept and detox-ed, I still have lingering effects from this incident, mostly of needing to shield my back with a wall, or the floor... like I become afraid of staying standing if I lose focus on what I'm doing. Note that I really only delayed my sleep cycle by 8 hours or so, and consumed no more caffeine than I often do.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? It's like everything I normally do is 'realer than life,' and there's a creepy.... something lurking behind me.",1
How paranoid are you and others these days with COVID-19 & SARS-CoV-2?,"Like always cleaning everything like purchased items including food, mails, drinks, door handles, etc.?

tw//i never feel safe,"ive had this feeling since i could remember. i feel like people or things are always watching me and it almost never stops. im currently 14 in 9th grade and ive been telling myself none of its real since like 2nd grade but it feels so real. at my grandparents house (which i used to live in) i constantly had sleep paralysis and around the house i would see things like tall shadowy figures and what looked like corpses staring at me from a distance, almost as if they were taking notes or something. i cant be around windows because then ill flip out and think that someone is looking at me through them. since about the third grade ive seen this child that runs around my house and i see her about once every year, and every time shes always older looking then before, as if she live with me. i do know that anxiety is common in my age and i suffer from it but not a terrible amount. how do i know this is paranoia? because somehow no one else has ever seen any of these things at all. it‚Äôs affecting my sleep and everyday tasks now more then ever. i cant even take the trash out without feeling like someones inside my parents car. does anyone have any idea like at all how i can stop any of this? i know none of its real but at the same time i dont.",1
Everyone is a threat and I cannot trust the intentions of others,"My head is a mess as I write this so apologies if this comes across as very scrambled. Just need to get this out.

I am so exhausted of feeling this way - every day, from the minute I leave the ""safety"" of my bedroom, I am on high alert. I can't explain it any other way - it's like my body kicks into fight/flight mode and I become super sensitive to everything (movement/touch/especially **sound** \- I cannot stand loud noises). It's especially bad when I go outside, I feel my heart beating so fast and can barely catch my breath, I am so afraid. I make eye contact with other people, but only for a split second to try and see their intentions. If it looks like they are going to walk too close to me, or worse still brush past me and touch me, I will honestly cross the road. I do this multiple times in every journey, to the point where I think I must look like a lunatic. 

If somebody has to cross my path and walk behind me, I will turn my neck and follow them to make sure they don't come too close. 

Plus, I feel like nearly everyone is watching me. As in, when I walk past another person they will turn their head and look at me, I never know why and it just makes me even more uncomfortable than I already am. It's like they can see into my mind and know how scared I am. 

I am actually at my wits' end and feel like I am losing it. I just want to try and be rational, but I'm struggling so much.",1

I'm Paranoid my Coworkers are playing a Very Mean Trick on me,"I've been in my retail job for years in a management position. A couple weeks ago my keys glitched out of the matrix. Completely gone, cannot find them anywhere. I'm not someone who usually loses things, mind you. I left work, drove home, stayed at home, went to work the next day and they're gone. I've cleaned everything at home, everything in the car. No dice. Since then I've been trying to keep it from my boss-because he will just use it as an excuse to make my life miserable-and have been using my keyholder's (N who is my friend) keys and swapping back and forth. Today I was using a different keyholder's keys (D who doesn't hate me but we're not friends) while he was working with me and my boss. I noticed towards the end that he has a different set of keys hanging out of his pocket. I never saw if they're store keys or not, but they're on the lanyard D previously used for his store keys.

Some context on my boss: he is very petty, manipulative, and I've seen him weave complex lies for the purpose of manipulation and mind games. He claims to care for me, but he wants to have an affair with me (he's older than my dad) and I've seen him play mind games and mean pranks on another woman who he is currently having an affair with (he has never admitted this). 

Some context on me: I took many hallucinogens and psychedelics while in high school and have experienced drug-induced and non-drug-induced paranoia before. It doesn't plague me every day but often enough to cause me to doubt myself. I was on anti-anxiety medication when I was younger as well.

I feel like my boss and my coworker somehow took my keys and are playing mind games with me. My boss has made jokes about how I lose my keys and at first I thought he was referring to when I misplace them in the store or stockroom, but now the jokes are ringing in my head. I should have a complete set of duplicated keys by tomorrow, but what if my boss is setting me up to blackmail me with the knowledge I have illegally duplicated keys?  What is his end goal? Is he just enjoying watching me squirm and laughing behind my back? Is all of this just another paranoid delusion? If anyone reads this, please, I need an outside opinion. I don't even feel like I can trust N anymore, and I thought he was my friend. Thank you for your time and any input you can provide.",1

Paranoia about doctors,"I rarely go to a hospital to see doctors. I have this paranoia that some people are out to get me or at least sabotage the doctor‚Äôs diagnosis and prescription.

Paranoia is Getting Worse‚Äî A LOT WORSE!,"Hello all,

I hope all‚Äôs well. As for me, not so much. 

Earlier this morning as I was went to the grocery store buying some food to last me for a bit, I‚Äôve noticed that strangers keep on looking at me and talking bad about me like a rabid dog. I felt so uncomfortable that I quickly and angrily paid for my items and left. 

Later on in the day, I was making a food delivery for a customer. As soon as I was dropping her food off at her apartment door, I heard her in there saying ‚ÄúOMG, it‚Äôs the DoorDash driver dropping off my food. Yeah, it‚Äôs her. The one in the paper girl. I don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs doing DoorDash because she‚Äôs about to get arrested and they‚Äôre going to execute her ass!‚Äù I swore I heard this word for word. 

Onto the next delivery, I had to go into the store and shop for a customer. As I got out of my car, I saw a boyfriend/girlfriend couple approaching their car that was parked next to mine. The girl rolled her eyes and she whispered to her boyfriend. The boyfriend says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad they caught her ass!‚Äù Then when I got into the store, I heard a few workers in there saying ‚ÄúBye!‚Äù ‚ÄúBye! You‚Äôre about to leave!‚Äù As I was getting the items for the customer, I heard other customers shopping saying ‚ÄúShe might go to Texas and get the death penalty and I hope she does! Then no one will have to see, hear or smell her stinking ass!‚Äù 

I‚Äôve been hearing that I was in a newspaper for something crazy, according to strangers. This is making me feel so crazy that I‚Äôm literally in tears and scared to go anywhere alone for fear of my safety and life. I spoke with my psychiatrist today and she is putting me on a new medication that will stop the paranoid thoughts from running through my head. I really hope they work.",1

How can I let go of the paranoia when it feels so reasonable,"I generally feel like my family talks about me behind my back a lot. This bit isn't paranoia because I've walked in on them many times and I've often heard them say things about me (after an argument)  that kind of stung - my mom told my brother that she doesn't care about the things I get for her as long as she's got him and when he mentioned that I can hear her, she said that she "" doesn't give a shit"".  After that I was expected to let it go because she was angry. I mention this because it kind of traumatized me and my relationship with my mother was essentially over after that even though we're still living in the same house.

In the time since then, I exchanged exactly one look with another person. My mother, she and I were there, and we were talking about charity and my mother turned it around to how everything at home is sorted and we have everything we need. It was just a second but for my part it was very, very judgemental but the other person and her have a very good relationship and I often catch snippets that sound less than appealing to me. It's none of my business though so I stay out of it.

The thing now is that I tend to get very paranoid about them talk about me and based on basically everything I've heard my mother ever say in my entire life, I feel like I'm anticipating the worst. Even ridiculous things. One day, for example, there was a small earth tremor and the second it hit I recognized the sound with the vibration and I started counting the number seconds it lasted as I went to my safe place in my bedroom. My mother and I have both experienced earthquakes before then (her in the 60s me in 2018)  and I didn't recognize it the first time and I slept right through it (this was in Japan where some major quakes have hit not long before I was there so they were experiencing aftershocks). It scared the hell out of me that I didn't recognize it  so I read tons of accounts about what people hear and spoke to people who were there to try and figure out what I might expect. When the tremor hit where I am now, I heard a crack before I felt the shake and I immediately figured that this was it. Anyway, I told my brother (who didn't feel it at all) and mother that I heard it (tons of people did and tons didn't) and they gave one another ""the look""  now I am trying to figure out how this can  be used in one of their gab sessions to make me look bad. To me it feels like this would be consistent with everything I've experienced with them but it still feels so dangerous - like anything I say can and will be used against me, even something as ubiquitous as hearing an earthquake!",1

And I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm starting to accept that I will die soon. I‚Äôm waiting for it, it‚Äôs just a matter of time. 

I‚Äôm constantly thinking about the end of the world, having vivid apocalyptic nightmares and about killing myself, about people chasing me trying to hurt me. I know that once the covid situation gets worse the government/authorities will assert their control even more and are probably going to detain me eventually, put me in prison and kill or torture me because I don‚Äôt believe in their luciferian evil new world order. I think there‚Äôs an evil force sabotaging me, like a ghost or dark cloud of smoke watching my every move. None of my family believe me what I say, they brush me off when I try to explain what is really happening in this reality. I sprinkled some holy water just in case to feel better. Im really scared of what will happen soon, and something definitely will, a catastrophe, depopulation and control. I would rather die by my own hand. 

I‚Äôm really scared of ghosts/demons. I see shadows moving sometimes but I play it off as my mind playing tricks on me. I‚Äôve seen horrific things while sleeping too during sleep paralysis and I can‚Äôt get over the fear. It makes it hard to go to sleep at night or be by myself. I want to tell my therapist how unwell I feel but I don‚Äôt want to be a burden, I don‚Äôt want to take up space when someone else needs the help.",1
Weirdly paranoid dude in the park,"So, earlier today I decided to go for a little walk in the local park with my camera. I just bought Photoshop software today, and I wanted some pictures to play around with.

I had my camera in a strap hanging around my neck, and a macro lense in my jacket pocket. As I approached the entrance to the park (this little windy path through some trees) a couple came up from the path to the park, a man and a woman. I cast a glance at them, but I was busy changing the lense on my camera as I walked by them. 

I got maybe 20-25 steps down the path when I heard a sound that caused me to look over my shoulder, and there was the same guy (no girl). I thought ""that's weird, I wonder if he wants to talk to me."" He did, as it turns out. He called out ""Hey!"" I turn around and face him. He then asks ""Are you taking pictures with that camera?"" Up until he asked this, I was thinking the most likely thing he wanted was either directions or perhaps some loose change (these are the things I've been approached by strangers for the most in my life). I was puzzled by his question, so I just answered ""Yes. That's generally what one uses a camera for."" He was wearing a mask, but apparently was not worried about social distancing, because he came right up close and personal and then asked ""Are you taking pictures of me?"" Again puzzled by his question I simply told the truth. ""No."" I said. Then he asked ""Are you sure?"" And finally I understood what was going on. This guy was paranoid about being photographed. I told him ""Yeah, I'm sure. I take pictures of birds and trees and stuff like that."" He then just stood there for a good 5-10 seconds looking me straight in the eye. Then he said ""Good. I wouldn't recommend you do that (photograph him) either."" And then he turned and walked away again. As he was walking I just said ""Alright, sure, nothing to worry about there."" 

I was a bit exhausted in my mind, so I didn't come up with any snarky remarks on the spot, but I thought about a few during the rest of my walk. Something along the lines of ""Don't worry, you are not pretty enough to be in my scrapbook anyway."" Probably for the best anyway. I'm sure such a remark would have just set him off. He seemed the type that possibly was very insecure about his manhood, and would possibly compensate by beating witty strangers down.

Anyway, I had a good few laughs thinking about the absurdity of the situation during the day. How paranoid must you be, to think some random stranger is photographing you in secret? I don't know whether he was high, selling drugs or possibly both, but what the hell? üòÜ",1
"Am I just being paranoid, or....?","So basically I really don‚Äôt stay home alone that often. I‚Äôm thirteen and I‚Äôve only really stayed home for 10-20 minutes at a time, however, today my parents needed to go somewhere and I couldn‚Äôt come because I had homework. In the hour that I was home alone, I felt as if I was being watched. When my parents got home, my dad asked, ‚Äúwhy was the light on in the garage, and, ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt the dishwasher running anymore?‚Äù To this I freaked out. I hadn‚Äôt left the dining room table the entire time I was there, and I‚Äôm afraid there‚Äôs someone in my house. I know this sounds so fucking stupid, but I‚Äôve heard stories of people living in other‚Äôs basements, attics, etc, and I‚Äôm afraid the same might be happening to me. Am I just being paranoid, or should I be concerned?

UPDATE: My father checked up in the attic and nobody was there, and my sister sleeps in the basement, so she would probably know if someone was down there. So no creepy psycho in my house today! lol",1
What‚Äôs wrong with me?,      For years I thought people around me could read my mind and in the last couple of months it‚Äôs gotten worse. Now I can‚Äôt sit in my room by myself without thinking someone can hear what I‚Äôm thinking. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that I think people can see though my eyes and see what I‚Äôm looking at. Does anyone else have this problem and if so how did you deal with it anything would be appreciated.,1
Scared my parents are stalking my accounts,"My parents used to stalk my online accounts when I was a teen, and I figured now that Im an adult I don't have to worry abt it anymore. But someone just followed me and immediately deleted their account and now I'm so stressed I can't fucking sleep.",1
can someone please at least try to comfort me?,"is there anybody willing to prove me that nobody did an lobotomy on me, and ama not imprisoned in psychiatric facility right now, constantly hallucinating what i perceive as reality?

this is my fear right now

I'm afraid this is not logically disprovable",1
Voicing some thoughts...,"A bit of information: I am a 23 y/o trans man, currently living with a friend *(we share a room)* and their family, a grandmother and a sister. I *have* been diagnosed with general anxiety, but no paranoid disorders.  


So, I've always thought I was... Decently paranoid. Like, everyone gets those thoughts sometimes, y'know? I figured it was normal enough, just a brain doing its thing. Maybe the thoughts were a bit irrational, but that was nothing to worry about.  


Recently, I was talking with my friend *(not sure how the conversation got here)* about how sometimes, I have to check that they're breathing, because I'm afraid they've died and I hadn't noticed. And because I tend to ramble, of course I went on talking about how I worry the others in the house have died in their rooms, and how the kitchen windows freak me out at night because I'm sure there will be someone there, etc etc. My friend then simply told me that those thoughts aren't normal, especially not that frequently.   


I'd never really considered myself to be any more paranoid than the average person. But now, I notice those thoughts really do plague me often, even if they're completely irrational, like believing someone might be hiding in the crawl space above the laundry room. Today, I had a full blown anxiety attack because my friend was gone, their grandmother had no idea where they had even left, adamant they were still home a minute ago, and they hadn't answered my text. I had to scour the whole house to make sure they hadn't collapsed somewhere. When I didn't find anything, the rational thought is just that they've gone out and they're fine. But then I began to panic that they'd still collapsed somewhere, it just wasn't in the house. I wasn't able to calm down until I called them and found out they'd just gone out for lunch.

&#x200B;

I don't know for sure if any of this is genuine paranoia, or just my anxiety acting up in a weird way. I've been talking with my friend about some of the thoughts when they come up *(I told them about my panic today),* but I don't actually know if that's helpful or hurtful to me. Paranoid schizophrenia runs in my family, so I don't know if maybe this is something I should be properly worried about. Any thoughts or advice or even similar experiences would be nice to hear. Thank you if you read through all this.",1
I was right...,"So about a month ago I posted here saying I was paranoid about being spied on by my folks. Turns out it was completely true, as my mother talked to me about how her boyfriend started rummaging through my stuff in the bathroom and reported it to her.",1
I can't stop thinking,"I try so hard to just ignore all my paranoid thoughts, but I just can't tune them out. I feel like everyone is out to get me and hates me. Like everyone just keeps me around just so they can bitch about me behind my back. I stopped smoking weed because I thought this is what caused the paranoid thoughts, but it's been over a month since I last smoked and the thoughts haven't gone away. I feel like my ex has persuaded all my friends to be agents that help her to drag me and my life into the dirt. I realise all of these thoughts are irrational and probably aren't happening, but I just can't convince myself that it's not real.

I feel like I'm going crazy and I just want the thoughts to stop.",1
