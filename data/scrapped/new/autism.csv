"I got abandoned by my family after surgery, Am I missing something? NSFW","So we're struggling to approach a subject with pretty much anyone including our psychologist. 
I'm trans and had surgery last January, and had 2 revision surgeries after that. 
My surgery was on the mainland and I live with my parents on an island, during that first surgery, I had nearly bled out, (we missed a medication that contained aspirin as it was labeled ASA and we had no idea what it was.. And why we keep saying surgery is not something to take lightly) 
I spent two weeks in the hospital and need 4 units of blood to be brought back to baseline (there's 10 units in the human body) and in that time the only ones who were ever in my hospital room were my boyfriends, the two guys flew from the opposite side of the continent from a diffrent country to be with me for surgery. 
And not a single family member came to see me, when 10 years ago I was the first responder to my grandma's heart attack, and my family members flew to see her in the hospital. 
I feel like I'm missing some social que or something that might explain why no one from my blood family even bothered to show up.. Like yes it was covid, but I was allowed 2 visitors at a time, when asked about it I got told they couldn't afford to take a day off (when they're now taking 2 weeks to go see our grandpa in a different part of the country) 
Is there something that I could have done to been abandoned like that?",1
I hate being in school,"There was an incident in my Food studies class a few weeks ago that has left me upset enough to skip the class for my own mental health as I no longer feel comfortable or welcome in the classroom.

I was working with my friend (17M) in class when another student (17F) who we were not working with put pepper into our bowl.

For some context I (16F) am autistic and have severe sensory needs that makes me react to tastes, texture, smells, etc.. Pepper is something I am unable to cope with as it freaks me out and I have a minor allergy to it.

I rightfully got upset with her as I was never asked if she could add anything into our food(and I'm allergic), so I freaked out and yelled at her. I admit I might have overreacted but at the moment I was panicked and confused. The yelling got my teacher's attention and she got mad at me for swearing, which I understand but I felt targeted as she was only telling me off and not the boy‚Äôs in my class who were saying things much worse than I had (calling each other the c word and a range of slurs).  
It was getting really Loud to the point that I was on the floor in tears trying to calm myself down, when my teacher loudly exclaimed to me ‚Äúthat is verbal assault and I'm going to have to send you out‚Äù I took off my apron, left the school and I went home.

I purposely missed my food studies class for about a week as I didn't want any more conflict, But I did show up today.

I pulled the girl aside and I apologized for yelling at her and tried to explain that I had sensory problems and that I was allergic to pepper and her adding it without me knowing really freaked me out, but she rudely cut me off saying that she didn‚Äôt care and that It was my problem not hers.

I then tried to explain how putting things in other‚Äôs food is NOT ok and that even if she had asked my partner, she should have also asked me as it wasn‚Äôt JUST his food, to which she just said I was overreacting and ‚Äúyou should be grateful I even tried to help‚Äù I was calm the entire time and I was trying my hardest to not sound like I was blaming her, as that wasn't my intention, but It was at this point I got fed up and just let her go as she just wasn't listening.

I then tried to talk to my teacher and she just pushed me off and wouldn‚Äôt listen to me so I gave up and went to the library and did work for my art class.

I still feel really bad and I understand that she has the right to be upset, but I feel like my need's aren't being taking into consideration and I don't know what to do :(",1
"my special interest has been the holocaust for over five years now, and i don't understand why people think it's bad.","**DISCLAIMER::: i realize the title seems misleading; i meant i don't understand why people think my special interest being the holocaust is a bad thing. please stop commenting about it üíîüíî**

ever since i learned about the holocaust in school, i've been really interested in learning more about it. i have countless books on it, ive seen many many MANY movies and documentaries, and i've been to the museum about it in DC a couple times since i live (sort of) close by. i feel like i can't ever tell people about it though, because they always look at me weird :(
to me, it doesn't seem like a bad or ""taboo"" thing to be interested in, i just see it as educating myself. of course, i understand that the holocaust was awful, but i'm not agreeing with or condoning it. its just,,, genuinely interesting to me to see how one person could cause so much damage and change the mindset of literally thousands and thousands of people around the world. plus, it directly ties into another special interest of mine, which is history about war, mainly the two world wars and the french rev. i wish i knew how to convey that message to people so i could tell more people about what i know :(( idk i just wanted to rant about this subject because i dont!!!! understand!!! why people think it's wrong to have the holocaust as my special interest!!! and it makes me upset!!",1
"I am so so sad, my favourite shoes I‚Äôve had for almost 4 years have finally broken",They‚Äôre nikes and the air in the bottom of them has popped so now it‚Äôs hard to walk in as the other one is fine,1
Feeling like I need to justify my autism,"In conversation I mentioned my autism and one of the women was like ‚Äúno, no you‚Äôre not‚Äù in a suppressed voice. 

I ended up explaining that as a man in my 50s I spent a lifetime learning how to human and that it‚Äôs a conscious effort. How I am around her isn‚Äôt ‚Äòme‚Äô. 

Reviewing the encounter I wish I‚Äôd have said something better and not felt the need to justify why I appear ‚Äònormal‚Äô to her.",1
I miss my bird,"This is Buddy, he was my therapy bird, and emotional support animal. My grandma gave him to me when she went into the hospital for surgery to remove some cancer, worried that if something happened to her I would be alone. 
I got him when he was just under a year old, and he thought me so much about body language and indeed he made me feel like I had someone, especially after she passed away, I coddled Buddy like my baby. 
whenever I was upset he'd always crawl or fly up to me and fluff up just comforting me.
I ended up entering a relationship with someone who was unstable, I would clean his self inflicted wounds, watch as he physicality fought with freinds, but when he reacted violently towards his cat I had to end it. During the break up he threatened to set me on fire, and stole just about everything I had. 
I had severe problems after that, I had to move back in with my parents and couldn't really communicate what was going on, and when they started trying to change how I interacted with Buddy I started to shut down. 
They removed him from my room, got upset because he wouldn't shut up.. Really he was screeching because I wasn't around. 
And eventually they said I wasn't taking care of him to their standards and said I had to get rid of him. So he got rehomed to my sister and died less than 6 months later. 
It broke me...as John wick said ""[he] was an opportunity to greive unalone, and you stole that from me, killed that from me"" 
I miss him everyday.. And the place were staying doesn't allow animals.. And a therapy or emotional support animal isn't protected by the disability act.. 
He thought me about gasses, specifically Teflon, which made him sick and I had to rush him to a 24hour vet. 
He died when he was 6 years old.. 
The oldest cockatiel died when they were 30.
He could tell when I was anxious.. When I was stressed, angry..

I wish my mom was mature person.,"When I got bullied/ostracized in elementary school, my mother said I'm embarrassing her and I need to be fixed. I was ashamed and sorry for her.

After I learned that my mother didn't had a best school experience, I realized this wasn't about me but her. She was so self conscious and worried about how other moms perceive her. She wanted to be seen cool, and to achieve that, she needed me to be hang with mean girls.

When I was young, I thought my existence was deeply wrong. I still do. Gotta fix this thinking.",1
Too nervous to date,"I am 29 F and honestly I get way too nervous to date that it‚Äôs caused me to isolate myself big time. 
I have tried the dating apps and usually as soon as I match with someone I get too nervous to even talk to them or don‚Äôt know what to say (I HATE small talk) & then the idea of dating and getting to know someone also makes me cringe. The whole small talk thing is just so awkward. If they‚Äôre not outgoing the convo is usually a dead end to be honest. 
I don‚Äôt leave the house other than for work. & won‚Äôt date anyone from work. 
Sometimes I get super sad to think about how alone I really am. & to be honest I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll find anyone that loves me even if I tried. 
I wish I could just like meet someone like every other girl or actually meet someone from an app.. actually have conversations with people and make them fall in love with me instead of being so fucking weird and awkward. 
I am an attractive person‚Ä¶. I feel like that will just dwindle away soon because I‚Äôm getting older and I‚Äôve spent all of my prime years being a recluse in my house. üòï",1
Lectures on how I spend money,"So my sisters used to spend their money on expensive alcoholic drinks during parties every weekend. My dad was like that too as a teen. Now my sisters still spend it on makeup, skin products, food at an expensive cafe/restaurant, etc. Can you imagine how much money that costs if you do that for multiple years? Probably thousands. But that‚Äôs just what they like so it‚Äôs fine, right? It‚Äôs normal, right?

And I? I don‚Äôt drink alcohol, don‚Äôt go to parties, I almost never wear makeup (and the makeup I have is multiple years old lol), I can‚Äôt handle most skin products because my skin irritates very easily so I just gave up trying (I only clean my face with cold water now) and I don‚Äôt like spending a lot of money on food. But I buy one figurine of $600 and I get lectured? My dad got really mad at me. Like seriously? I spend my money on something that will last me a life time or I might even be able to sell it for a lot more money in the future and that‚Äôs wrong in their eyes? I‚Äôm 22, it‚Äôs my money, and still people bud in because they would‚Äôve spend it differently. They don‚Äôt understand that I have different priorities than them. I don‚Äôt lecture them for spending their money on things they like. It‚Äôs so annoying.",1
"Sick of reading """"Being neurodivergent is not an excuse""","I'm so fucking tired of people seeing neurodivergence as a mental willpower thing.

Our brains have physical structural changes. Phineas Gage had damage to his prefrontal cortex and became an abusive swearing alcoholic with impulse issues. 

Individuals with parkinsons have problems with the substantia niagra, they can't just stop shaking, even with medication.

These fucking people like to think that mental = you can control it. 

Not every neurodivergent person is the same either. Congrats your neruodevelopment doesn't impact your ability. 

I can sit in a loud fucking room 24/7 and I'll still be fucking in pain, I can't control that. 

I can however modulate by wearing earphones, etc. That doesn't make the pain go away though, it just helps alleviate

Modulation are tools that reduce the overall but will not fix the entirety. So yes, Neurodivergence isn't an excuse, it is a state of fucking being. Eat shit you ableist fucks.",1
"This is autism adjacent but im out of options when it comes to therapy, i have no friends to discuss this with either. Im too poor to afford quality therapy in cali. I feel unfixable and like a purposefully broken toy. My story is of nihilism, Neglect and a destroyed mind","Is it time to give up?, a thought ive had since age 6. Is it time to give up and jump into the street or similar methods. im too poor to afford quality therapy and all the places ive been too near me have been wildly ineffective in treating my ASD level 2, ADHD, OCD and Medication resistant MPD. Im probably gonna end it soon, im entirely unfixable unless i become rich enough to afford real therapy. My entire life has been a terrible Cycle of emptiness, neglect and loneliness. I grew up in a extremely poverty struck home with a emotionally wrecked and distant single mother. ive
been through everything from intense health issues to emotional issues
and ive decided life isnt worth it anymore, im an unfixable broken toy
and my circumstances are unfixable as well. when your poor and disabled
in california your given an insurance called medical. its horrible and
useless. your a second class citizen to doctors and hospitals. especially mental health. heres my detailed my 4 experiences that made me come to the conclusion of i wanna die soon. 

My first stint of therapy was at Choc Childrens in socal, from ages 5-8 is when i started to become extremely depressed, isolated, lonely and suicidal. the gap between social and intellegence bassed development which was later to be found
out caused by my autism was getting noticable. the reason i wasnt diagnosed till 3 years ago was beacuse i was racially profiled by my GP who said all my issues were because of my i tensive seizures as a kid and that because im black i couldn't have autism ot similar learning disability. i had said i wanted
to commit suicide to a teacher in 2nd grade and i was forcibly made to see a childrens therapy place in my area of South socal. the place was terrible. i was treated like a second class citizen and discrimated for me being poor and a half black mix. i was never treated properly and was passed around by multiple therapist who just played stupid board games with me.i hated it. nobody really cared they just babysat me for a paycheck. this is around the age when i began to develop extreme nihilistic ideas from reading books and watching internet content. Nihilism explained my existence it gave it reason, my entire life is suffering. I have nothing and will always be poor. in my early life i had a shit ton of health issues like seizures and breathing issues. this created an even larger social and Self suffering divide. i was divided and pitied socially like a kicked dog. I was never able to be ""friends"" everyone thought id give them seizures since i had experiance one in 3rd grade in class due to my epilepsy and extreme stress which come to find out are autism related. My life hasnt improved at all since i was younger and has continued to snowball so 8 year old me turned out to be correct. 

Elementary public School Psychologist - from ages 9-12 i kept myself closed off from others. My inability to make friends continued and i became even more depressed and nihilistic. spending hours reading philosophy books trying to figure out why im forced to suffer this terrible existence. which eventually led to buddhist ideas and to this day i've never found an answer on why my life sucks and i was cursed to suffer. in California schools your required to do mental health checks yearly and i answered truthfully on mine was forced to do multiple appointments with the school psychologist. she was terrible, just another worthless shrink that made me fill out paperwork for her and i
was never actually cared for or treated. just fill out this questionnaire and ill give you SSRIS that are complete BS and dont work for you at all. my social life became even harder the older i got. i drifted so far away from my age group in terms of interests and social skills i became an outcast. The ""weird fat kid"". Ive continued to worsen as i age in terms of physical and mental health. 

western youth services - at age 13 i was forced to go to a place called
WYS after my first major suicide attempt. i was referred there since
they were the closest place to me that took medical, boy was that terrible. they somehow where even worse then my previous two experiences combined. Terrible unresponsive psychologists, terrible therapists and they actively emotionally abused me. they gave me more ineffective drugs and treated me like a nuisance rather than a patient. most psychologists just gave me SSRI'S and told me to fuck off. nobody cared
for me, my family didnt and neither did the shitty workers. my depression became even worse and i began to develop violent thoughs of revenge and bitterness began to develop in me. mI wanted to kill my family for neglecting me, i wanted to kill my bullies for making fun of me and i wanted to kill my psychiatrists for not listening to me. i became even more nihilistic and had began to Self harm more extremely 

After that stint i was out of therapy for 2 years, i had only one attempt and my nihilism worsened. I was socially ridiculed more than ever now as i reached junior high. this when i noticed major declines and more bullying. Between stint 3 and 4 in late 2021  after a i had a hard head injury i was seen by a neuropsychologist that diagnosed me with autism,ADHD, OCD, and MDP and advised me to see a Therapist and psychiatrist. she was incredibly surprised i wasnt diagnosed with autism before. she said after talking with me for 10 minutes she knew. She was astounded nobody noticed till now. Its kinda hilarious guess racial discrimination and all that really does exist when it comes to autism in black men. Previously between 3 and 4 and the autism diagnosis i wanted to re enter therapy and was subsequently put on a 2 year waitlist between late 2019 and early 2022. In mid 2022 i began my 4th stint back at choc

choc stint 2- from age 14-16 i i was placed on a two year wait list to receive treatment after my 3rd suicide attempt in 2019. 2 years passed then COVID hit then it got extended to another couple months even though i had another attempt in the mean time. A TOTAL OF ALMOST 3 YEARS TO RECEIVE GARBAGE TREATMENT. i was treated like trash by choc again. i started back with them in mid 2022 and its been terrible. the therapist was a step up and my best to date but the Psychiatrist was terrible. Dr ngyuen fucking sucks, how can you take pride in your self as a dr when you actively miss appointments and flake on patients a bunch. Hes no showed us 8 FUCKING DIFFERENT TIMES. since ofc hes a telehealth only dr, but thats not all oh nooo he was fucking garbage at treating anything. he gave me 10 different SSRI/SNRI/SDRI combinations all to do fucking nothing since im medicine resistant and we told him that from the start. hes also completely worthless in terms of treating ADHD as its one of my biggest struggles and is actively ruining my life. his treatment plan is the exact opppsoite of what your supposed to do for ADHD. hes insistent on treating my depression first which basically means ""heres a new SSRI go away"" each session. hes also shown some very racist and discriminatory actions towards me. im refused adderall because i have an ""addiction risk:"" due to my socioeconomic status and my race. This recent stint has solidified in my mind that my only relief is death. i have no other option. this place was my last one that my insurance covered.

I bet nobody read all of this, but i just wanted to rant today. My psychiatrist flaked on our appointment today and i needed to get this out. i have no hope for my life and actively want to end it soon. lk the whole ""its so over meme"" but my life feels like it literally is unless i
win the lottery. Im too poor to afford anyway out of my living hell and
i cant work.i have no options. i have no other therapy options or ways to fix my mental or health disabilities. I just need to end it now",1
Psychiatrist ASD assessment,"24 F.
I‚Äôm gonna try and keep this short. 
First of all I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm autistic or not. I had part of an autism assessment with a psychiatrist today but had some technical difficulties so it was cut short and they want me to do another appointment at the end of the week. At the end of the appointment they said they are not sure I meet the threshold for autism but have some similarities so they want to talk more. 

To be honest I‚Äôm not 100% sure myself if I have autism. And I don‚Äôt have a problem being diagnosed, I actually want to know for sure!
I can relate to some things but totally can‚Äôt relate to other things. It was actually my elder sister‚Äôs idea that I get an assessment as she feels i‚Äôve exhibited  autistic traits since childhood and autism/adhd runs in the family. However some of my family members think I‚Äôm not autistic and just have lack of confidence, anxiety issues and say I‚Äôve been coddled by mother too much. So it‚Äôs very confusing for me. 

The reasons I think I could be autistic:

I did not speak as a young child except to my mother, when I started infant school age 5 teachers were concerned because I wasn‚Äôt engaging and I wasn‚Äôt making friends. Eventually I did make a friend thanks to help of my mother. When I started secondary school I managed to make a couple friends and then was suddenly introduced to a group of friends. I never kept in touch with friends from school though and I never felt that close to them. It was almost like we were just acquaintances more than friends. I was bullied at the end of high school by one of the ‚Äòfriends‚Äô in the group and then I just distanced myself from everyone and became a loner. Still in adulthood I have a heard time talking to people, I get super anxious and feeling like I can‚Äôt get the words out. I am not very social with family members, I feel like an outcast, I don‚Äôt know what to say or how to engage. I was diagnosed with social anxiety when I was 18 and tried CBT therapy but that didn‚Äôt really work. I‚Äôve been on different antidepressants and they also haven‚Äôt helped for the anxiety. My anxiety has gotten to the point I find it hard to leave the house by myself, I don‚Äôt go anywhere unless accompanied by my mother, I don‚Äôt take public transport anymore because I get anxious and worried about not finding my way around. I don‚Äôt have friends or a social life.

I failed in school. I was in the lower sets for all of my classes. Again I found it hard to engage or ask for help. I feel like classroom environments, the noise, distractions, constantly observing myself and trying to fit in made it hard for me to focus. I pretty much remember day dreaming and zoning out in all my lessons and wasn‚Äôt able to process or take in what the teachers were saying. I had some support from a supply teacher but it was never 1 on 1 so it wasn‚Äôt that helpful. 

I enjoy alone time, I prefer being at home on my own or with my mum. 
After socialisation I need alone time to recoup. In some social settings I will even try to remove myself by leaving early or going to a more quiet place away from others. 

I did not enjoy school, hated getting up in the mornings and still do. My mum used to bribe me into school with food or saying she‚Äôll treat me afterwards. I never had tantrums or anything I would just look grumpy and be cold in mood. 

I enjoyed some imaginary games with friends as a kid, I feel like this was because there was less pressure to be social if that makes any sense?
I also preferred games were there wasn‚Äôt a need for much communication involved. 

Sometimes when there‚Äôs loud noises or if someone next to me is taking loud I cover my ears with my hands instead of asking people if they can talk quieter. 

I have found it hard to keep a job. The longest was a week. My last job was night shifts at a warehouse, I purposely chose night shifts hoping there would be less people but I don‚Äôt think that made a difference. After 3 10 hour shifts I quit. I physically felt unable to keep up with demands and was falling behind. I did enjoy elements of the job and if I were able to only do those things and not the others, I probably would‚Äôve stayed longer. I also always feel a pressure to make friends with colleagues and don‚Äôt want to be left out. I feel like I‚Äôm the target of bullying or judgement if I don‚Äôt make friends. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs such an important thing for me to make friends and be liked at work. I guess it makes it more enjoyable for me. 

Reasons I think I might not be autistic: 

I have never had / have no special interests or obsessions. When I told the psychiatrist this I could tell they were taken back and probably expected me to at least have 1. 

I don‚Äôt have any attachments to physical/material things. Apart from my phone and tablet, but that‚Äôs common in this generation right? Using my phone and tablet is my hobby I guess you could say. 
If anything, I would probably say I‚Äôd get more attached to people than to things. For instance I‚Äôve always had a close bond and attachment to my mother, I stayed friends with the same person from primary school into secondary school because it felt familiar and safe. Age 5 I had the same friend till adulthood. 

I have never had / don‚Äôt have emotional outbursts. I hold my emotions in and then have a meltdown when I‚Äôm by myself in my home. 

I don‚Äôt think I have many sensory issues. Strong / bad smells are main ones but again that‚Äôs ‚Äònormal‚Äô right?

I don‚Äôt have picky or disordered eating. I‚Äôve always enjoyed various foods. 

I feel pretty good at telling how someone is thinking or feeling by tone of voice, body language, behaviour. 

I get sarcasm mostly. 

PS. There‚Äôs so much more I could go into but I wont lol. 

I mean if I don‚Äôt get the diagnosis, what do I do? Do I accept that I‚Äôm not autistic? Should I still say that I am because I can sort of relate? Do I seek another diagnosis?",1
Will I always be outcasted from my peers?,"Hi, I don't normally post on Reddit, and I haven't posted here before, but I can't sleep and would like to talk to someone about this. I am a highschooler, currently, and I've noticed, especially during highschool, that I've felt more and more isolated as I've gotten older. I feel almost as if while everybody around me is maturing, I am staying the same. My mind is stagnant.
I don't know how to make friends. People don't talk to me if they don't know me, and I feel I speak confusingly and weirdly, frustrating the people who do know me and aren't super close with me. At this point in time, my only real close friend is my girlfriend of one and a half years. I'm perfectly content with and appreciative of her, but I often feel alone when she isn't there. I see others interact so easily.
Sorry if this is confusing, it's mostly a rant. I just want some others' experiences so I know what to expect in life, I guess.",1
College essay writing is so irritating,"in my ap lang class, we‚Äôre writing our college essays and we keep being asked to think of ‚Äúour experiences‚Äù and ‚Äútraits that describe us‚Äù. I hate when I‚Äôm asked to describe myself because I don‚Äôt know how. I don‚Äôt remember any experiences in my life unless they were extreme. I‚Äôve always wished I had a robot by my side to tell me who I am so I don‚Äôt forget. I need someone to tell me what I like and what I‚Äôve done, and to remind me of my life, because it‚Äôll take me like 30 minutes to think of just a few things. It‚Äôs really annoying that I have to write my whole essay about an aspect of myself and it has to show what type of person I am. I don‚Äôt know what type of person I am, and I really don‚Äôt know how to demonstrate that in some stupid essay.",1
Is anyone else tired of career suggestions that involve spending time with pets? I hate animals,"They smell and drool and make me itchy

I'm starting to think that my mom believes that being neurodivergent is a choice and/or something that can be cured/fixed.,"I want to start by saying a few things. I genuinely don't understand my mom or what could possibly be going on in her brain to make her think and act this way. Also, please don't comment anything like ""why don't you talk to her about how that makes you feel?"" I can't. she doesn't ever listen to me and brushes off my feelings all the time. Either that or she'll somehow turn the blame on me and make herself the victim of the situation, claiming that I don't understand her struggles, or that I'm just trying to accuse her of false things to make her look or feel bad, or go on about how she could never make me feel that way because she ""loves me"".

so, back to the original point of this post. 
i have diognised ADHD and suspected/undiagnosed high-masking autism. 
damn near every single time I try to bring up something that I struggle with or cannot do (because I'm neurodivergent), she always says something like ""you just forgot how to"" or ""you need to teach yourself how to do that"" or even ""just ignore it"" ""just stop.""
one of the main things is that I have time blindness. she just keeps telling me to learn better. and then she guilt trips me and lectures me about how if I don't learn to manage my time better, I'll never get anywhere in life, that I'll constantly be losing jobs and be excluded from social groups because I'm always late. great. thanks for that, mom. 
I cannot control my time blindness. time feels very different for me than what most others feel (I think). 5 minutes can feel like 1. 2 hours can feel like 30 minutes. I cannot estimate time or how long something will take me. that is not something that my brain do, I cannot fix that.
I also struggle to complete and turn in homework on time. she just tells me to stop doing that and try harder. that I need to ""stop making excuses"" and ""stop using your ADHD as an excuse, it's not"". she's right, it's not an excuse, it's a reason.
another time I recall is when we were out somewhere, it was outside, and there were powerlines over the place. my biggest sensory issue is auditory, mainly loud and/or high-pitched sounds. The powerlines were buzzing, they were so loud and bothered me so much. I could hear them no matter where I went. I was starting to become closed off, visibly upset, angry and irritable. my mom told me to stop just ignore the buzzing and just ""pretend"" to have a good time and stop wrecking the mood for everyone else. she even got mad at me when I tried putting in my headphones and listening to music to calm myself down. 
another time, when i was having a meltdown over a ""prank"" that she pulled on me. she refused to apologize, turned my lights on, made me take my blankets off my head and take my headphones out. she got really angry and told me to ""get over it"" and ""stop living in the moment"" or ""stop feeling bad for myself"". 
this has happened a few other times recently. she said the same thing to me both times. one was me telling her how I cannot recognize my body's signals (such as hunger). the other time was when I told her that I struggle with volume regulation and often talk too quietly without realizing it at all. she told me that I just ""need to learn that skill"". I just wish she would understand that I can't. my brain doesn't work that way.

another thing, I feel like she tries to ""relate"" to me but it just comes off as ableist to me. there's been several instances where she has said to me ""I get distracted sometimes, I think I might have ADHD too."" 
I'm like 90% sure she doesnt, but my dad does (diognosed), so I know that's where mine came from. 

I'm just fed up with this.",1
I need to get put in a psycho ward (mentions of death),"Hi I'm a 14 yo (m) and I know I'm exaggerating a bit much, the other day I was sat doing my thing when my cousins mum txt my mum saying I had txt her mean shit like very mean shit, now I had many proof that i didnt, proof: phonenumber of the texter,  shown my mum my phone to prove I didn't delete msg anyways it was my friend (I found it quiet funny tbh) anyways the part where I think I should get therapy or som shit is I hate my cousin and when she accused me I shouted for about 30 min that I was gonna go round her house and slit her neck open and I even bought my self shit to go do it balaclava and a fat fucking knife. Plz help me leave a comment or smth the for listening.",1
i feel like no one understands me and it‚Äôs so isolating,"whenever i try to convey how i am feeling on a matter, the other person almost never fully understands or comprehends how i feel because they have never experienced it themselves. 
even my boyfriend who knows me better than anyone struggles to provide emotional support with issues because he has such a different perspective and experience with them. 
i was trying to explain to him how i find working full time at minimum wage jobs incredibly emotionally distressing and i couldn‚Äôt understand how he happily worked as a waiter full time with no affect on his emotions or overall mental state. every time i have tried to work these minimum wage classic jobs that teenagers work it inevitably ends in a depressive or even suicidal episode for me. he was trying to comfort me but was just saying things that, whilst they were meant to be helpful, just reinforce how little he understood what i was going through.  i feel so alone and broken, i can‚Äôt understand why trivial things everyone else seems to be able to do fine just completely disable me.",1
Feeling alone and jealous of my little sister,"I don't know how to make friends, I can't work and couldn't continue school after I finished middle school so I don't even know how to meet people. 
My sister kind of always looked up to me when we were younger, she's autistic too but needs less help than me. We're very close and I love her. But now she's 17, unlike me she overcame her school phobia and goes to high school, she makes friends here and I'm so proud of her. But oh how jealous I feel, I worked so hard to get what she currently has but I couldn't do it. Last year we went to our city's pride parade together, and even though there were mostly 15 years old here and I didn't feel like I belonged, I was looking forward to go with her this years as well. A few days ago she told me she was going with her friends and ofc I'm super happy for her but now I feel even more alone.
I don't want to feel sad and jealous, I just want to be happy for her. I want to go to the pride parade with friends and have fun. I ended my only friendship because it was a toxic one and I want to have healthy relationships with people but I'm so anxious about going anywhere. I do have a list of places to go and I'm not going because of that !

i am not human,"my whole life, i have struggled to relate to humanity. i can‚Äôt maintain friendships. i crave the fictional depiction of romance but can‚Äôt maintain it irl. i have violent and cruel thoughts about the people who wrong or slight me- most of which are intrusive but some are very real. when someone is telling me about something they are excited for i could usually care less. i am hyper-empathetic for whatever friends i may have but everyone else might as well not exist. i am annoyed by most people talking, when they step to close to me, or when they try to understand. I heavily relate to the ‚Äúcold gaze‚Äù monologue in american psycho- even though i know i‚Äôm not a sociopath‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just that every word, every EXPRESSION that i make is. scripted. planned. carefully calculated. no one would ever know i‚Äôm autistic if i didn‚Äôt tell them. i hold proper eye contact. i speak clearly and smoothly. i smile at the right times. i laugh at the right jokes. i‚Äôve been called ‚Äúquick witted‚Äù. i know EXACTLY how human interaction works yet it will still forever be foreign. don‚Äôt let them see how picky of an eater you are. don‚Äôt let them realize that you‚Äôre on the edge of a panic attack because someone looked at you funny. i am not human. i‚Äôm not supposed to be here. i only continue to exist for my cats and the clear nights where i can go outside and look at the stars that i could have been born on instead.",1
I can't deal with loneliness and feeling like a failure,"24F. I have always been the weird outcast. Spent all my school days just getting laughed at by other girls and getting picked at. I was always alone. I've never had a best friend. My parents are super toxic and conservative. They are Indian Muslims. I'm not saying all Muslims are bad people but my parents and my community sucks. They have been forcing me to get married since I was like 16. My father is abusive, my brothers misogynists, and my mother is a narcissist with victim complex. I had a job for three months after graduating but the environment was really toxic and I was recovering from a traumatic event so I had to move back home. I have no skills and no idea how to move forward. I am trying to upskill but some days or entire months I get so paralysed by depression. I need therapy but my parents won't let me. I'm an adult but being a woman in this community leaves me with no control on my own life. 

I have been going to the gym. And I made a couple of friends. I mean I thought they were friends. I talked to them about normal girly stuff and I tried really hard to not be weird. But I guess it didn't work. I heard them laughing at me and once I tried really hard to understand their body language, I realised they find me weird and don't want to talk to me. This literally triggered me so much.

I have to much empathy and I cry about everything. Any time I see someone sad or hurt I break down. I have so much love to give to someone. I so desperately want like someone to talk to who won't judge me. Even when I have things I want to share with like my mother, I suppress them because she will just make me feel childish and stupid for it. 

I don't know what to do. I am struggling with the thoughts of ending it all but I can't let someone else be responsible for finding me yk? I won't do anything. I would like advice on how to deal with all this and be okay with being utterly alone and move forward. I hate that humans need companionship. What a faulty design.",1
Can I just vent about my little sister?,"I‚Äôm older than her. Like about four years older than her and she talks to me like I‚Äôm a child, she always has ever since we were kids. She‚Äôs 18 now and I‚Äôm 22 and if she isn‚Äôt infantilizing me, she‚Äôs straight up ableist with no way around it.

Everyone makes excuses for her, I made a post not long ago because I had an argument with her, got overwhelmed and she mocked me for it and I‚Äôm the one who got lectured. 

Today I had an appointment with my therapist who told me I should get my dog certified to be an assistance dog and when I saw my sister I told her about it. My dog is really intelligent he learns so many things easily and she told me he‚Äôs too stupid and would never be my assistance dog and then proceeded to grab him to get him away from me.

I‚Äôm not leaving the house for a while, as you probably know the economy is ass and I especially for autistic people who aren‚Äôt hired at jobs so can‚Äôt save up to afford an apartment, plus I‚Äôm still in school. So I don‚Äôt know what to do when I‚Äôm being disrespected like that.

I think what hurts most is that at her job she prides herself on ‚Äúbeing the one knowledgeable about autism‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing the most accepting‚Äù. But when it comes to me, I‚Äôm the annoying stupid childish sibling who says weird things and doesn‚Äôt have any real friends. I‚Äôve tried so hard to be a good sibling to her, I was like three years old when she was born and I already wanted to be there for her and care for her I actually remember that because that was such a strong emotion. So that makes me extra sad that all her life she never wanted to have anything to do with me, would always break my toys and say mean things and I would get yelled at just for slightly raising my voice. 

She only cares about autistic people when they‚Äôre her eight year olds gymnasts who she can boss around to do whatever she asks them to. Oh they‚Äôre so cute because they give her hugs and they‚Äôre tiny children with no agency! I guess adult autistic people aren‚Äôt as cute and are just stupid and annoyingly dysfunctional so they don‚Äôt deserve respect!",1
Neurotypicals ask dumb questions.,"Have you been asked a dumb question by a neurotypical that you don't understand why anyone would ask?

"Have you ever seen a piece of media that was made with good intentions, but somehow desecrated one of your special interests?","I have. In animation class in my second last year of school, we were watching all these environmental animations made my previous students, and I give them all credit for having good intentions, but one of them was WAY too anti-steam train for my liking. And yes, steam trains typically use coal, but they're rare in present day and, from my understanding, most coal pollution now comes from places like factories and power plants. Go after present-day fossil fuel pollution, not my number one childhood interest, please!

The first train in the video was a photo they'd found online and, instead of white steam, it was emitting black smoke. Believe it or not, it got even worse during a stop motion bit with wooden toy trains. Duke from Thomas made a cameo, and James the Red Engine‚Äôs tender was used as one of the wagons when he wasn‚Äôt even there. This might sound okay, but not when you realise the landscape turned desolate halfway through the train's journey, making me feel even more like my love for the environment meant nothing if I liked steam trains too. To someone who cares about the planet but also grew up loving steam trains and the Thomas franchise, it legit felt like watching a church burn.",1
I had a cringey moment with my class partners,"I was going to home after class with some of my partners, until one of them started mentioning a religious institution that allows parties and making friends. However, it comes with a twist: To make dates with the guests of that place.

&#x200B;

He even mentioned it being like a sort of religious Tinder and i instantly interpreted it as a ""place where you can have sex"". So i said what i thought to my partners: They screamed saying ""whaaaaat?"", with a mix of surprise, laughter and rejection. I wanted to re-start the chat after that and i was overlooked by everyone, where they were all talking without me.

&#x200B;

I said it because i really thought he meant that, so being judged by them made me feel strange and sad. Besides, since it's a religious place, saying it (the sex part) made me feel even weirder than usual.",1
i don't want to be autistic anymore,"I hate my life, i just spent it being a loser and messing up social situations, and just overthinking every social situation that i have been through.

Changes at work setting me off,"I recently got a promotion at work. I work at a childcare for a gym and I got promoted to a supervisor which means more pay and I get to work at the front desk and greet parents and take payments. I really enjoy it because it gives me a break from the back with the kids. However recently they let us know they we have to train the childcare workers on what we do. We have to teach them to look up memberships and greet the parents and kids, and they have to do it for a full hour while we work in their place in the back with the kids. It‚Äôs stressing me out because this ain‚Äôt soemthing they‚Äôve done before and it‚Äôs really stressing me out because working in the front is my outlet at work and if I‚Äôm giving it away it throws off my expectations and schedules and I‚Äôm just really scared and don‚Äôt know what to do.",1
the good doctor makes me furious!!,"i've had an issue with this show since it came out. it's not a good portrayal of autism/the struggles of autism at all, and what infuriates me the most is how shaun's actor (freddie highmore) is NOT AUTISTIC!! he says he prepared for his role by ""talking to people in his life with autism and watching autism documentaries."" it wouldve been so much better if the writers or actors were actually ND. plus, the whole plot of every episode is:
shaun had a bad childhood. and hes autistic with savant syndrome. his coworkers think little of him because hes autistic and constantly doubt everything he says. fast forward near the end of the episode and turns out he was right all along! and then repeat that for six seasons across anywhere from 18-22 episodes per season. another issue i have with it is the whole attitude of ""autism is a superpower!!"" that goes on through the show. for instance, because shaun has autism he can.. visualize things?? like, he'll stare off into space and information/diagrams of the human body appear around him? üò≠üò≠
plus the whole viral clip of him sobbing and having a meltdown about not being called a surgeon is PAINFULLY IRONIC considering in another episode he continually refers to a transgender patient by their assigned gender, despite having it explained to him several times..
i could complain and rant about this show for HOURS!! it makes me so mad and annoyed to see autism portrayed in such a harmful way. autism is NOT a superpower, the entire show just gets autism all wrong, and when it's shown to tens of millions of people, they're all going to think that's how autism works. it doesn't just give you innate abilities to do stuff, it's a lifelong struggle to be seen as normal and it's exhausting.

I don‚Äôt feel like myself after a change,"I‚Äôm a 40 year old woman. I tend to feel like an alien when trying to fit in with society anyway, and recently had an experience that really showed me this.

I was at an appointment and when talking to the receptionist, I noticed she had shaved her arms. After that I began noticing it in women and realised I did not, and had never, shaved my own arms. I started obsessing over it as something I should do, did I miss this in my ‚Äúwhat women should do to be accepted in public‚Äù repertoire, is anyone noticing my arms are different, etc.

So, yesterday I finally shaved my arms, and I hate it. I don‚Äôt feel like myself anymore. It feels like my arms are not mine. I covered them today but the second I rolled my sleeves, there they were, being all wrong. I had a bit of a crying fit about it before realising this is not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, and I‚Äôm never going to be normal as much as I try to mask and pretend I am.

I feel like I get more upset than I should be about things.,"
I feel like sometimes I get overly emotional about some stuff. Like usually I feel indifferent but then something upsets me and I feel like I‚Äôm going to have a tantrum. But I also know i shouldn‚Äôt be *this* upset about it but I still am. 

For example just now, I showed my mom a drawing I did. She says it looks nice but asked about a part of it, and I said well I was trying to make it in a similar style of a show I watch, and showed her the reference. 

This caused her to believe I ‚Äòcopied‚Äô the drawing (Doesn‚Äôt help they had a similar hair color and style) and she says ‚Äòso you copied that drawing‚Äô 

this made me irrational angry and upset, I almost want to cry. 

I hate that she always says and assumes I trace and copy my drawings. I hate my drawings being reduced to just ‚Äòa copy‚Äô. I worked so hard on it and I feel like it doesn‚Äôt matter now because she claims I copied the drawing. 

And I know it‚Äôs dumb to be this upset but I am and I wish I wasn‚Äôt.  I can‚Äôt think about anything else other than this now.",1

My life is fucked,"I (F22) was diagnosed at 10 with ASD (they called it Asperger's syndrome when I was diagnosed.) I'm now questioning my diagnosis. Something very very traumatic happened to me as a child and since then I have had trouble socializing with others and making friends. I'm not progressing the way my peers are, even my autistic peers. It's like my brain has been numb for the past 15-16 years. I'm not ""gifted"" nor am I ""intelligent"" I never had trouble socializing before what happened to me. I didn't have sensory issues before that either. I can't stop thinking about my childhood. How I wish I would've just fucking stood up to the piece of shit, who was my abuser. I feel disliked by everyone, even other autistic people. I haven't contributed anything to this world, all I am is what happened to me. I have nightmares every single fucking night. I've been used and abused by NT people my entire life. ""Awk it's just Claire. She's daft, she won't know we're taking the piss out of her."" But I do know and that's what hurts so much. I pretend to be oblivious. I don't want to remember what happened to me again. I just want to be free. Free from pain, free from suffering. I don't go out, I don't do anything. I'm just a shell. I was born nothing and I'll die nothing. I don't want my parents or siblings to have to take care of me in their old age and I want to free them from the burden. All I do is stim all day and smoke. I'm bored out of my tits constantly but I can't work or anything because if I get another flashback it'll set me off for the full day. I failed as a human being.",1
I've decided to diagnose myself,"I'm new to this community so idk if people have a big problem with self diagnosing, I know some communities don't have a problem with it, but if you do then let me just explain first.

The main reason I'm decided to diagnose myself is because I'm in the military. I've tried to pursue a legitimate psychological diagnosis but if I was really certain about doing that and it turned out to be true, that I really am on the spectrum, then I'd be put up for a medical board and might get separated. I can't afford to get separated right now.

I do still feel weird about diagnosing myself, I've never been much of a gatekeeper when it comes to anything really, not even mental health, if someone says they think they have some mental disorder or some sort of neurodivergence then I don't discount them, but I always tell them that nothing can take the place of an official diagnosis and I encourage them to do that. If they keep doing, just going full-on self-diagnosing and telling people about it and whatnot before they have a real diagnosis then it feels weird to me. I don't plan on telling anyone though, I'd like to tell my mom or dad but I feel uncomfortable telling them something like this so matter of fact when I don't have a professional opinion to back up what I'm saying, part of me knows they're just not going to believe me and tell me I'm wrong. Even so, knowing that I'm not going to tell anyone and I'm just keeping this to myself, I still feel weird about it.

I've been feeling a lot better though, it feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. There's just all sorts of things that've been happening in my life since my earliest memory and none of it ever made any sense, I always felt awkward and weird and I thought something was wrong with me and it really just made me feel awful. Ever since the idea came to me that I might be on the spectrum though, things have just been lining up and making a lot more sense. I try to be as conservative as possible when I try to evaluate whether something ""sounds like autism"" or not, but I'm still biased and I'm not a professional so I'm not saying it with such a high degree of certainty, but it's a really fitting explanation.

It just feels nice to not feel like such a freak or such a terrible person anymore, I feel like I understand myself better now. It used to be that I'd say something weird (apparently) and people would react negatively and then I'd feel bad because obviously I must've  been inconsiderate or stupid or mean or something else, but it didn't feel that way to me so then I felt even worse for not realizing I was being so terrible. Now it's like that feedback loop has finally stopped, I still feel a little bad but now I just feel alright accepting myself for all the weird things I do or say and it all makes sense. I know I'm not a bad person, if I say something that might be inconsiderate of course I still apologize, but now I just don't beat myself up about it because I know I'm not a bad person, and really that's because I've come to understand how I think and feel through my limited research. It feels really good, my self confidence is on the rise for the first time in years.

So yeah, I'm diagnosing myself. I just wanted to get it off my chest and explain it to a community that might offer some support or advice because I haven't told anyone in my life. I hope nobody tears into me.",1

My parents genuinely don‚Äôt understand autism and it‚Äôs infuriating,"I just want to preface that my parents are in no way abusive or bad people and they try their best as parents like any parent does, however I‚Äôve come to realize they don‚Äôt understand certain parts of my autism and even though I try to explain the things I do they don‚Äôt seem to understand.

I am a diagnosed autistic and I have been in services like special education and ABA therapy since I was young, however my parents didn‚Äôt really do any research outside of what professionals have told them and the basics and I‚Äôve had to teach them about meltdowns, stimming, masking etc and it‚Äôs exhausting. I am no way insinuating my parents are stupid but it‚Äôs low key kind of exhausting teaching them about things they honestly should‚Äôve already known about. I‚Äôm convinced they think autism is just little quirkiness with your brain but otherwise your like everyone else, which is not true. 

They think things like meltdowns are like toddlers having a tantrum and deny I have sensory issues at places like school and church and that I need to grow up and deal with responsibility. I get overwhelmed quite easily and I can meltdown and start crying and when I start I can‚Äôt stop and it takes me a while to calm down.

The friendships always go well initially , As I tend to only befriend other ND people so we click very well. But I can never maintain the energy needed to keep it going. I am the ‚Äúsays hello every couple of months‚Äù friend except unless you reach out first, you may never hear from me again. 

My ex would belittle me for it, tell me I needed friends to be a functioning member of society, told me he found me less attractive because I didnt go out and do things with others like ‚Äúnormal people do‚Äù and that he couldn‚Äôt be my friend because he was my boyfriend. But I was happy being who I was. I was content with myself. & I did go out, just by myself. 

I realize now he was full of it, as my current parter is my best friend and has never made me feel like I needed to change any part of myself.

growing up with an autistic parent,"please be kind to me. I don't know if this is the right place to say this.

I'm neurodivergent but allistic. my mother is autistic. people talk a lot about allistic parents with autistic children. I rarely see anyone talk about what it's like to be allistic with an autistic parent. I'm not here to spread hate. I just want to share my experience.

growing up with my mother was very lonely. it often felt like she was in her own world. she never hugged me as a child. she often neglected me in favor of her special interests. when I cried, she would remain completely silent. once, I told her through tears that it felt like she didn't love me. she walked away without a word. 

when allistic parents have autistic children, they read books on autism. they talk to child psychologists. I couldn't do any of that. I was just a child. I didn't know what autism was. all I knew was that my mother acted differently from other moms. I'm not a kid anymore. I read about autism sometimes. I understand now that my mother didn't like me crying because it was a form of sensory overload to her. I understand now that she didn't like it when I interrupted her special interests because it wasn't just a hobby to her. I understand all of that now as a grown-up, but that matters little because child me didn't know any of that. I go to therapy once a week now.

I second-guess myself sometimes. maybe she did love me. maybe she still loves me, in her own way. whatever it is, I don't understand it. I don't know if I ever will. she doesn't like talking to me. she tells me to stop talking when it doesn't interest her. she turns away from me and engages in her special interest. I don't know if she knows it hurts me. it's hard communicating with her. she doesn't seem to have any interest in me. I see posts sometimes, by autistic people talking about how much they detest allistic people. I wonder if that's how my mother really feels about me. 

I don't know where I'm going with this. I'm not saying autistic people have to conform to allistic standards. I'm not saying autistic people shouldn't have children. I'm just sharing my personal experience. and if you have a child, please just tell them you love them.",1
Just need to get this of my chest.,"I just wanted to share my thoughts about a mater.

So I have for some time suspected that my brother might be autistic but I have never said anything untill recently when I told my mom. 

She later brought it up whit one of his teachers but she said that he didn't have autism and just imitaded me because he sees how our parents treat me. (Probably refering to my meltdowns)

The thing is, most of the reasons I suspected he was autistic is other things, for exampel 

‚Ä¢ He has special intrests that he always talk about and he plans his free time around it and gets uppset when he can't prusue it.

‚Ä¢ He always want to know exact times when stuff is happening.

‚Ä¢ He also is wery precise with how mutch money he has left of his weekly allowance he has left after buying candy. (We get our allowance on saturday and tend to buy our candy before we get the monet√§ra so we only get what is left after we have bought it.)

The point is I see where his teacher is coming from but there are somethings that I don't see how he would imitate from me. (For example his special intrests is formula one while mine is books and cultures.)

I just needed to get this of my chest, and this feels like the best place to do it.",1

I don‚Äôt know how to properly communicate with others, nothing i say ever seems to make sense to others. Everyone always thinks im lazy, insensitive and overall don‚Äôt care. I seem like such an obnoxious shit person, im so goddamn annoying. I have no idea what actual true success feels like, just ‚Äúthats good enough i guess‚Äù. Im never good at anything, only terrible or alright but nothing worth raving about. 
I cant hold a job long enough before being fired or quitting for being miserable. I barely graduated high school then ghosted community college because i cant even handle a cheap liberal arts degree. 
I don‚Äôt ever feel like i belong anywhere, i hate myself and this all feels like a pimento or something. My brain is broken, i hate being here and living like this but theres not much i can do about it. Im stuck with a piece of shit brain forever",1
Hyperfixations - Rant,"My current hyperfixation is Hamilton which for anyone who doesn‚Äôt know is a musical about the founding father Alexander Hamilton. 

This is a problem because I listen to the songs and watch the film every day on repeat and I keep finding out new things about it, but there‚Äôs nobody irl I can talk to about it because I live in England and not many people are interested in the American revolution, my friend doesn‚Äôt like it and my mum is getting sick of me talking about it. I really wanna sit down with someone irl and just talk about Hamilton and sing the songs from it with them but nobody‚Äôs interested. Talking about it online doesn‚Äôt work as well as irl. If I quoted it nobody would get the reference, if I started talking to anyone about it I‚Äôd either get ignored or told to shut up, I just don‚Äôt know what to do. My mum thinks I‚Äôm just an addict but I don‚Äôt think she understands hyperfixations even though I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs also autistic to some extent, she just refuses to get tested for it.

Idk what to do :(",1
I need help with burnout,"Ive been feeling extremely brunt out these last couple of months but im at my breaking point now. I can barely do anything in school and i just want to cry every single day because its so bad. My mom dimisses me when i tell her i cant go to school and she makes me feel horrible for not going, and that i wont be able to get into a good college if i dont start doing my work, but i _need_ a break, i cant take it anymore

Please help me i dont know how to stop feeling so goddamn burned out, i try to relax and not put expectations on myself, but my mom is constantly nagging me and i cant tell her how much it affects me without her lashing out and saying that she also has autism and that she is ""fine"" (she very clearly isnt)",1
i hate being over empathetic,"I constantly shut down if someone tells me they were rude / mean to someone even if the other person deserved it. I constantly think about the other persons reasons (again, even if I know they‚Äôre a bad person) and i dunno. I just feel so upset like the person did that to me?? Is that? I don‚Äôt even know? Like my mum will tell me about how she told her ex boss to go fuck himself (he was horrible) but it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs directly told me to go fuck myself?? does that make sense??",1
I don't think I'll ever be able to live on my own,"\[tw: mentions of suicide\]

i'm 18 now, turning 19 in a month. i don't feel like an adult, let alone a functioning one

im currently in university, but it's horribly overwhelming. everytime i'm on campus i end up getting overwhelmed and having to go to the bathroom to cry or have a meltdown. i need to bring my sweater and headphones with me otherwise i start bawling and become non-functional when im outside. i regularly get overwhelmed in public and end up just crying for no reason

i don't know how to cook. or clean. or even sweep the floor. going out of my room is a struggle. even making a sandwich is too much for me sometimes. one time when i did manage to make one, the butter i'd put on it tasted wrong and i had a breakdown. i know this makes me sound extremely privileged, but i grew up with a domestic helper doing everything for me so essentially ive never lived independently.

showering is also near impossible for me, i can only force myself to after weeks when my hair gets horribly greasy and gives me awful sensory overload. i dont think ive brushed my teeth in two or three years either because of the way it feels on my gums

i don't mask well. everytime i talk to nt people, im just dead silent with a poker face. i can talk to people like waiters or cashiers but even then my speech is incredibly stilted and awkward. talking itself also feels physically painful sometimes idk hwo to describe it. the only thing i can focus on are my special interests. everything else feels impossible. it's cliche but i really cannot even begin to understand how im ""supposed"" to act. i can be quiet and not stim in public but that's it. and half the time i do stim at home i end up injuring myself out of my control

and whenever i think about living on my own i start breaking down. i don't think i can do it. i'm convinced im either going to die in my parents' house or end up committing suicide in some way

whenever i hear about autistic adults who can function independently and just require a little structure  in their lives or something i get really envious. i know it's not a competition but i feel like im mentally 12 years old at all times and i don't know how to take care of myself or do anything by myself; even my younger brother has told me i act ""so autistic"" and he ends up taking care of me a lot of the time",1
Sister in law says my voice is annoying,"My partner recently told me that my sister in law is glad I don‚Äôt hangout at their place anymore because she thinks my voice is annoying. She says I have a baby voice and that she can‚Äôt stand to listen to it.

Now I‚Äôm super self conscious and think I‚Äôm annoying. This whole week has been ruined by knowing that my voice is annoying to other people. I don‚Äôt even realize what I speak like.. so I don‚Äôt know how to stop it. Stuff like this really gets to me.",1
I'm worthless,"Life is too fast for me. It is hard for me to learn for highschool. I have no friends that want to talk to me. I am scared of social interactions. All the people of my age have friends, girlfriends and a lot of fun. I do not say that I want that, but I really want someone to speak to.  I am good at finding details, making bracelets, building with lego from my imagination, and more but all of these are worthless for other people.  When I want to speak to my parents about mtly special interests they do not even hide the fact that they are bored.  I hate that I am slower than everyone especially at learning. I feel dumb when I am with others. I do not have time for ky special interests. I have dark thoughts. I want to take a pause from life, but this is not possible. I just want to sleep for days until I'll feel better. I am scared of everything new. Everyone around gets their driver's licenses, and here I am scared to the thought that I have to drive a car. I feel like my brain is going to explode and I can't cry to relieve some of the accumulated stress. I want to stim, but for some reason my brain makes me feel like I shouldn't do it, and I am also faking all my autistic traits. I hate loud cars. I hate the high pitch sounds made by cars when they brake.  I want to sit in total silence with my thoughs, but I have two brothers and a sister that constanly make noise. I use my over ear headphones but they hurt after a while. Time moves too fast.  You don't have to read all of this garbage, but I want all of this to end. I am going insane.",1
I can't ever have friends.,"I've actually had lots of friends, while being bullied. All of them, short lived or long lived eventually ended because my behavior drove them away.

I feel so burnt out. I‚Äôm 28 and work part time as a teachers assistant and can barely handle the 15-20 hours that I‚Äôm currently working per week and feel like I‚Äôm failing everyone around me. The collective sound of all of the students in my class yelling/speaking and the constant arguing makes me want to break down and cry. I‚Äôve become quiet, distant, bitter, and have to take several bathroom breaks a day to press my knees against my chest and rock back and forth in an attempt to recover some level of peace. 

I want to be kind and patient with myself but I usually just ended up calling myself lazy and unproductive and a waste of space.

Haha why are people like this,"(TW: brief mention of H/tler)

(Warning that I swear a lot here. Usage of ""haha"", ""lol"", or ""lmao"" don't mean I find the situation funny. I just use humor to cope. And disclaimer: I don't care if you disagree with my political opinions. That's not what this post is about. This is about my friend being a shithead. I mention politics purely for background info.)

(And this is hella long.)

I've made a post about this person before, but I'm talking about a very close friend, like sibling close, who I've known for almost six years.

And she's super ableist. In a particularly obnoxious, irritating way.

I could ignore it at first, where it was annoying but not blatant. Usual stuff, like throwing around ""autistic"" and the r-slur as regular insults. Laughing whenever she saw the word autism like a fucking five-year-old or something. Clear lack of education stuff, which is annoying but not harmful.

It's just gotten worse, though. To be clear, she's conservative. For me, that isn't an automatic friendship-ender (though it depends on some specific opinions), but she's only gotten more extreme (she's a borderline Hitler apologist now, gotta love that /s).

We are basically complete opposites politically, so she rarely talks to me about politics, immediately shutting down any discussion when it starts heading in the direction. I realized she was doing this, so I told her that I didn't care what her opinions were (since she made it clear that she hates being belittled for said opinions). This isn't entirely true, but I wanted to be able to have open conversations with her. Didn't see why they needed to get heated. I was mistaken, of course.

Anyway, this eventually led to us having, obviously, a heated discussion. I didn't instigate it; she just started airing some of her opinions out, and I just responded. She does this with one of my other friends, who doesn't interact with her at all, so the discussions never advance from simple one-sided rants. In retrospect, this is what I should've done. I made the mistake of engaging.

She was driving and started the conversation about abortion. She's pro-life. I'm pro-choice. Again, complete opposites. We were throwing pretty stereotypical internet talking points out at each other until I eventually started asking her when, if at all, she would be open to getting an abortion.

And this is deadass what she told me. The only scenarios where she would get one or be okay with others getting one:

1. Significant evidence of a poor financial situation.
2. R@pe.

And here's the real banger:

3. If the child is mentally disabled.

So of course I ask her to back up on this point. For reference, she's always confused Down syndrome with autism and uses them interchangeably even though I've told her multiple times that they're completely different disorders. She basically says that, if the child was diagnosed with autism and/or Down syndrome prior to birth, she would abort it because she ""doesn't want it to suffer"".

I told her that the child suffering wasn't a given, and that she wouldn't know whether the child would be incapacitated pre-birth. I said that she prob knows autistic people without having any idea, because a lot of them are able to blend in with society (i.e., mask or not have stereotypical autism traits ‚Äì which would apply to me, esp in this situation). Then she dropped this incredibly shitty line:

>Well, people with autism can't communicate **like normal people like you and me**.

This left me completely speechless. I was able to keep myself calm (since I wanted this to be a level-headed discussion, and she was driving, so yelling at her could be a bad idea), but this fucked me up. I've never told her I was autistic. *This* is why. She's so fucking uneducated and careless that I was able to fly as a somewhat quirky allistic under her eyes, while she spews shit like this about other autistic people. Like seriously, what the actual fuck. I may be overthinking this, but doesn't the whole idea of aborting a mentally disabled fetus sort of reek of eugenics thinking? Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the idea of being completely prepared to raise a child, then aborting when you discover it's autistic or has Down syndrome seems completely fucked-up to me. Just because you ""don't want it to suffer""?

Like *wow*, what a kind-hearted martyr we have here. Saving this poor, defenseless autistic child from the world instead of trying to improve the world for the child. That makes sense to me. That's convenient! /s

I almost can't handle it anymore. I'm trying not to make a big deal out of it, but it's just becoming dehumanizing to hear this kind of rhetoric from her (or anyone, for that matter; this coming from someone I considered a friend just makes it that much worse). I have made multiple attempts to try to educate her about what autism really is, but she refuses to improve or even try to understand, seeming content in living in her own bubble. And that's acceptable, because her opinions are accepted in certain communities. And that shit is insanely frustrating.

We're probably growing apart as friends. But that idea doesn't scare me anymore. I feel disappointed. I wish it didn't turn out like this, and that people were more open and accepting in general. One of the most infuriating things about this friend is that she is in full belief that she's an incredibly open-minded and nice person and can't fathom why anyone would be uncomfortable around her. Like seriously, dude, some self-awareness would be spectacular. Get off fucking Instagram reels and Fox News and self-reflect for once, man.

(For the record, I have friends that are not like this who I've told I'm autistic. And they were completely normal about it because they're not fucking obstinate.)

TL;DR: Realizing my long-time friend is a completely ignorant idiot.",1
This pisses me off,"Why is it that when we‚Äôre unable to do something due to burnout, people assume that we‚Äôre totally able to just push through it and get it done? On the other hand, when we want to/do something that we‚Äôre capable of doing, we‚Äôre watched like a hawk or seen as incapable??

Literally no in between.

Example: My dad told me the day after that there was a dance at the school he works at. When I asked him why he didn‚Äôt invite me, he said ‚ÄúYou would‚Äôve been too overwhelmed.‚Äù

I LITERALLY WENT TO A CONCERT LAST SUMMER AND WAS JUST FINE!

Also Dad: *Yells at me to get ready for a dinner he literally just decided to take us to out of nowhere and keeps yelling at me as I‚Äôm getting ready, causing me to shut down and scream due to YOU GUESSED IT, SENSORY OVERLOAD, then proceeds to make me feel like shit about it*

I feel like people take advantage of me because I am nice,"I just lost a bunch of friends for various reasons and I‚Äôm realizing I have a pattern of letting people use me or not realizing and then they discard me when they‚Äôre done. I get a lot of positive attention from strangers because I am conventionally attractive, but then nobody seems to care about my feelings or the things I like. They project their own desires and feelings on me, and then when they‚Äôre done or they realize I‚Äôm not a typical person with typical interests and personality traits they don‚Äôt feel the need to treat me with basic decency anymore. And sometimes in a really cruel way. 

For example I recently had someone who I thought was a friend essentially say that now that she isn‚Äôt attracted to me romantically anymore (probably because she realized I‚Äôm a little to weird), she doesn‚Äôt want anyone thinking she still is if we hang out because she doesn‚Äôt want that to get in the way of other people being interested in her. It made me feel completely objectified and undervalued as a human. 

I try so hard to be kind and genuinely bring positivity and joy into the world, and I know I‚Äôm not perfect either, but the constant rejection is starting to get to me.",1
The most unbearable part about jobs are the coworkers,"It's often not the things I have to do that set me off, but the co-workers I'm forced to work with.

Just a harmless vent to get something off my ASD chest.,"When I took my exam to get my driver's license (early 90s), they were using computers for the first time so software and graphics were primitive. The passing score was 18 out of 24 and after every question, the system would tell you if you answered correctly or not.

Question 1, good answer. Question 2, good answer, Question 3... 4... 5... 10... 15... Question 17, good answer, all good answers. I come to question 18 and I know if I get this one right, I'm home free. I answer, hit enter, good answer!

As it was programmed with proper manners, the system would inform me that I have enough correct answers and that the test was done. Congratulations, you passed.

I go to the counter, get the paper copy of my results :

**Result : 18/24 - PASS**

I went back to the counter arguing that this was wrong. That I did not get 18/24, I got 18/18 and the paper should reflect that. ""Why do you care? You passed. It doesn't matter"". ""It DOES matter because 18/18 means I absolutely nailed the exam because I was prepared. 18/24 means I barely passed and one more wrong answer and I would have failed. There is a HUGE difference"".

They couldn't change the paper of course, and my parents never believed me when I told them the computer stopped at 18 because I had a perfect score up to that point.

So if you were a programmer in the late 80s, early 90s and you programmed the software for driver tests in Quebec at the SAAQ, know that your shitty code changed the course of my life.

Edit : I'm being dramatic a bit, but it is something that stayed with me for quite a long time and me not being able to get over it was another hint that I was not like the others.",1
"Sorry, let me turn my sensory issues off today","Rant because Jesus, I need someone to understand.

Mother‚Äôs Day was a nightmare for me. Usually, my family is very understanding of my needs as an autistic person, and will happily accommodate them. For example, going out to eat at restaurants and bars can sometimes be very challenging for me, so they‚Äôll bring me home food or let me step outside if it becomes too noisy.

However, for Mother‚Äôs Day, everything was off the table. I left college that morning with my mom (she picked me up since I don‚Äôt have a car on campus) excited to spend the day with the family. My family agreed to go to a bar during the day that I know I usually have issues with, but they said w e wouldn‚Äôt do anything after, so I decided to go to make them happy. Sure enough, I had to step outside in the last thirty minutes because I couldn‚Äôt handle it. I‚Äôm visibly distressed and telling this to my family, who just tell me to ‚Äútough it up‚Äù because we‚Äôre now going to another restaurant that‚Äôs known for being crowded and loud for dinner. I ask to go home, offer to pay for my own Uber (we all drove together to the place), but I‚Äôm yelled at and told to toughen up again.

Sure enough, we get to the restaurant, and I‚Äôm immediately struggling. I was curled up in a ball with my hands over my ears trying to not have a meltdown because it was too loud, too hot, and I never had a chance to recover from the last place. My grandma snaps in my face to get my attention and tells me ‚Äúto sit normally and just be quiet‚Äù to not ruin this day, especially after my mom drove all the way to my college just to get me. That sends me over the edge so I leave, sit outside, and just cry. My mom followed to yell at me, and that was it. I spent ninety minutes sitting outside sobbing because I was having a meltdown and nobody cared since ‚Äúit ruined Mother‚Äôs Day.‚Äù My family didn‚Äôt even check to see if I wanted food or tried to help me calm down. They didn‚Äôt do anything they usually do when I have sensory issues. They‚Äôve never even seen me get to this point because they help me out of it most days, so this was a low point for me.

I just got home and went to bed without eating. Now, it‚Äôs the next day, and I don‚Äôt even know what to expect. I‚Äôm considering buying a train ticket back to my dorm a few days early (I‚Äôm not fully moved out yet since my job requires I help with closing) to get out, since I don‚Äôt want to spend the next few days living on thin ice. I thought it would be common sense that I can‚Äôt just stop being autistic and turn off my sensory issues on holidays, but I guess it isn‚Äôt. I literally did everything I could, I tried to communicate multiple times that I wasn‚Äôt able to do this, and now my family is mad at me for having a meltdown that could‚Äôve been easily avoided if they listened.

Sorry for the vent‚Äî I just needed to scream at something.",1
"Damn, I always thought I was excluded from friendships but turns out I miscalculated how close people are to each other.","Like whenever friends would flake on me all the time, ghost me, not invite me to friend group hangouts, I would always be devastated. This keeps happening to me all the time, and due to being bullied and made fun of for being ""weird"" growing up, it hit really hard.


I recently found out one friend group I'm in, where I thought everyone was hella tight knit and close to eachother... was actually very casual and not close at all. And I realized that a lot of people I thought I was close friends with viewed me as acquaintances. When I go into friendships I look for people I can have really deep connections with, and it has never dawned on me that other people just want someone to have fun with. 

This is so weird to me, but that doesn't mean that it's not normal. It's just different from what I want. They aren't villains, and I'm not an underdog, we just want different things. Still weird to me how people will talk about their deeply traumatic childhood to people they only wanna go bar hopping with, but then again, alcohol can make people spill these things out.


Anyhow, I mention all this in here bc apparently it's a thing with a lot of people on the spectrum; we want an almost soul bounding connection, not just with a romantic partner, but with our friends. And those not on the spectrum seem cool with spending a lot of their time with people they don't really care about all that much. Weird to me, but who am I to judge?

Honestly, knowing this is making my life a lot easier. Now I don't perseverate over why I wasn't invited to the pool party, if I'm a horrible person, or if they are evil and untrustworthy. I just move on.

Friendship issues - am I overreacting / any way I can make myself feel better?,"Hi all,

Hoping for a bit of a sanity check here / maybe some advice. If not, just venting and hoping someone can relate!

I'm having a bit of an issue with a person who I regard as my best friend. This is 100% an issue of my own making, and I doubt she's even aware of the fact that I'm upset. To be clear: I don't think *she's* done anything wrong, but I'm struggling with my own feelings on something.

I'm identifying this as an autism issue because I have a really REALLY strong sense of injustice/when something's unfair, and this is exactly what is eating at me.

Might require a bit of a long explanation, and it's a bit specific, so please bear with me!

So, background, this story involves two friends - names changed because I'm grouching about them on the internet, lol. We have Anna (my 'best' friend who I've known for 15 years) and James (a more casual friend to us both). Both me and James work in the music industry: I'm a photographer, he's a journalist. Anna does not, but she's a music fan and goes to a lot of concerts.

I introduced Anna to James about 6 years ago. Over the last 2 years, she's become closer to him than I am, because they live near each other, and hang out quite often. 

Last weekend, James got married. Anna was invited to the full wedding, but I was only invited to the evening party, so I felt a bit left out over that - I know weddings are difficult and friendships are like this, but it was eating at me a bit. And then, later in the evening, I found something out that really upset me.

In a couple of weeks, there's an awards ceremony happening. James goes to a lot of these sort of things - he's been working in the music industry for way longer than me, knows everyone, and gets invited to everything. But something very special happened for me this year with regards to these awards: as a 'music industry professional', I got invited to join the voting panel - to be one of the industry people who nominates bands for the awards. As a consequence, I too got invited to the awards. This was really important to me, because I've *grafted*: I've spent over 15 years working my way up in the industry, worked hard, networked my ass off, and to finally get recognised as a 'music industry professional' and get invited to something like this was a huge milestone for me. I'm quite insecure about my work and I finally felt like I'd 'arrived'. I was so pleased for myself.

There was a catch. Even for invited VIPs, tickets cost nearly ¬£200. Granted that came with free drinks and hospitality and perks and such, and it really is a proper thing like any other music/film awards ceremony, but, still... ouch. I'm not exactly rich at the moment, but I justified it on account of the fact that I've been working my way up to this point for years. I deserved to go. So I paid, and I told James that I was going. We talked about it quite a bit, and he sympathised about how much it had cost me.

James, meanwhile, applied to cover the event as a journalist. This isn't quite as plush as it sounds - he'll have to work for most of the night, interview bands and stuff. But he'll get in for free, or for a small mandatory donation.

I also told Anna that I'd be attending. I told her how much it cost. And her immediate response was, ""oh, I'm 99% sure I'll get a free ticket.""

There's a backstory to this. Quite often James gets 'plus ones' - when he gets free tickets as a journalist, he gets an extra ticket so he can bring a friend. This isn't typical for a music journalist, but can happen if you ask. (I rarely get plus ones because photographers don't typically get them). And when James gets a plus one, he often offers it to Anna, because she's usually available, likes going out, and enjoys a free gig ticket.

So when she said ""oh, I'm 99% sure I'll get a free ticket"" I knew what she was thinking - somewhat arrogantly, she was assuming that James would have a plus one. Considering the fact that they were charging even invited industry guests ¬£200 to attend, I told her to manage her expectations - I really doubted that there would be free tickets for many people this year.

And then, on saturday night, I found out from a mutual friend at the wedding that Anna was going to this awards ceremony. James had a free plus one, and had offered it to her. Neither of them had told me.

And I was extremely, perhaps unreasonably, upset. I was *really* upset. And angry. FURIOUS, out of nowhere. I didn't really say anything and held it together, but when I got home that night I ended up in tears.

I wasn't sure why I was so upset, but after a bit of introspection, it's the sheer injustice of it all. On top of the wedding grief (the fact that she'd been invited to the whole wedding and I hadn't, which knocked my self esteem) it was a huge, overriding sense of - *she doesn't deserve this.* 

It's the music industry in a nutshell really. It's not what you know or what you do, it's WHO you know, but it's the fact that a friend who hasn't grafted like I have (OR like James has!), who doesn't even WORK in the industry, gets into something like this for free. Meanwhile I, having worked my ass off to get to this point, had to pay ¬£200 for a ticket. After all the stuff she's got into for free thanks to James, it just really, really got to me.

If you're still with me at this point, can I get some feedback? Am I overreacting? I know I probably am. I haven't spoken to James about it, nor her (she still doesn't know that I know!) but it's absolutely eating me alive. I'm furious. It's so unfair.

I don't think I even wanted James to offer me the ticket instead - I like knowing that I worked for my ticket and I'm attending off of my own hard work. I'd just rather he'd offered it to anyone other than my 'best' friend who doesn't deserve it. She knows that I've paid ¬£200 to attend, and she's going to be so smug, because she always is when she gets into things for free, and she's used to that now thanks to James. 

I'm pretty sure that most people would be like ""eh, that's just the music industry, that's just life"" but I'm really struggling with this. It's really affected my perception of both of them and it's turned what was a special event for me into something that I don't actually want to go to any more, because it doesn't feel special now. I'd feel better if she'd told me, I'd feel better if she was excited and shocked and grateful, but she hasn't even said anything. It's just standard for her - another free ticket from James.

Am I being totally nuts over this? Would anyone else be this angry too? Am I the only one who thinks this is the unfairest thing in the world?",1
my dad‚Äôs autistic traits sometimes clash with mine lol,"One of my dad‚Äôs most noticeable autistic traits is that he can‚Äôt stop talking, and he doesn‚Äôt realize when people aren‚Äôt paying attention or aren‚Äôt engaged in his conversation‚Ä¶ So he‚Äôll just keep talking. No matter how many times you give a half-hearted ‚Äúmhm‚Äù he‚Äôll just keep going. 

Sometimes it overwhelms me, and I feel like I‚Äôm giving every sign possible that I‚Äôm not focused on the convo: not staring at him (which doesn‚Äôt work for obvious reasons), clearly being on my phone, playing a video for myself (it‚Äôs usually already playing when he starts talking), even wearing headphones (also usually on when he starts talking)! And since I‚Äôll be playing on my phone, him talking starts to overwhelm me because I‚Äôm not good at multitasking. I‚Äôll be trying to focus on my phone, but he‚Äôll keep talking and it gets me so overwhelmed that I want to cry from stress.

Anyways, I know this is clearly a communication issue‚Ä¶ I just feel bad telling my dad that I‚Äôm not paying attention to what he‚Äôs saying. I‚Äôll have to get over it eventually lol.",1

Perception of reality falling apart at 18 years of age: the story of diagnoses that came too late üòé,"So, folks, apparently I'm not just quirked up and eccentric and a little bit bad at knowing when to make a joke. 

I am an 18 year-old man (of the younger variety) who recently took time off from college because of mental health concerns. In the time I've been off from school, I've been doing a great deal of therapy, as well as psychiatric evaluation/screening.

The verdict? I somehow have made it this far in life without any doctors managing to diagnose me with GAD, ADHD, or ASD. It's kind of a lot to have thrown at me. (Not to say that this is, like, a *wildly* late diagnosis. I know I'm not the only person to experience this sort of thing.)

My entire life I've excelled academically (despite being incredibly slow at reading, writing... all that stuff), enough so that I got into a fairly prestigious university. The theory among my current clinicians is that my above-average academic performance offset any concerns of psychiatric disorder.

But here I am, as an adult, learning that I'm not just quirky with it, I in fact have a brain that does not socialize, learn, etc, as do the brains of most people.

Recently I've been feeling more alone than ever, as a result of the realization that the diagnosis makes sense. I'm not simply silly/eccentric when it comes to dynamic social situations, I literally just don't know how to navigate them. I don't have much experience of forming meaningful, long-lasting emotional connections. It's hard to feel like my entire understanding of reality and self has been turned upside-down. 

I don't anticipate this gaining much traction, but for anyone who has read this far, thank you. And for anyone who has read this far *and* can perhaps relate or impart some advice... well, I'd love to hear from you.

Cheers.",1

Boyfriend Trying To Help,"he's amazing, he tries so hard to make me feel comfortable in social situations and doesn't get angry when I'm too nervous to go somewhere. a couple of nights ago, we got into a dumb argument that we're over now but during it, i felt the overwhelming anger and panic and i started to rub my arms (pretty hard but it isnt to harm myself just something i do without thinking when im stressed) and he noticed and grabbed hands and told me it's okay. but it made me even more mad because i wanted my hands back but he thought i would hurt myself (which i wasnt) but the anger was really bad and thats the only thing that makes me calm down. i stopped talking and he got upset over that. obviously he wasn't trying to make me feel like that but it still made me have that gross feeling of being babied and treated differently.

Unfair/Hypocritical female aspies,"I have seen posts online that only confirm what I was fearing: a fair number of autistic women hate us autistic men. I wanted you guys to know how unbelievably heartbreaking and degrading it is for them to make generalisations such as ""most autistic men are creeps"" who ""harass and stalk women."" On one post, there were literally a thousand upvotes. Now imagine going through your whole life being called a weirdo and a creep. Why would you even talk to people? This causes many autistic men to just not speak and keep their mouths shut throughout teenage years and young adulthood - a key period for social and romantic skill development through trial and error. When they finally go to college and the workforce and try to get romantically involved with women, they end up demonstrating these traits of poor social development. On top of immense levels of bullying and rejection, we are now ""mostly creeps and weirdos who stalk and harrass women?"". The fact that they blame us for this shows how unbelievably un-empathetic they are towards us. Imagine I make a post about how from my experiences with autistic women, I feel like they are extremely dull, boring and creepy due to their poor posture, lack of social skills and weird, obsessive and clingy behvaiour. I would get downvoted to hell and people would call me out for making generalisations, even if I made the statement ""this doesnt apply to everyone"". It is so unbelievably unfair. I hope the women who made and commented on those posts get banned.",1
I love learning but I failed high school because of my autism,"What the title says. I love learning. I like science and geography and I'm obsessed with history. I love textbooks and documentaries, taking notes and writing essays and always having facts to tell people. I don't mind sounding like a nerd - I really, really like learning. But that's why it makes me so sad and frustrated and angry that I failed school. I officially dropped out about a year ago but I haven't attended since S3 (9th grade). I hate that my school ruined my education. I'm so smart and I'm capable and I really WANTED to learn, but they refused to accommodate me or listen to me or treat me like a human being and now I'm fucked with no qualifications and no idea what to do with my life. I don't know if it's wrong to blame them, but I tried my best - like really, really tried - and they shot me down every time. Yeah, other disabled students do learn from home, but you don't need that. And yeah, other disabled students do get support, but you don't need that either. Your meltdowns and panic attacks are just overreactions. Though we're constantly saying you're capable and full of potential, we won't let you take the exam because you won't pass. It doesn't matter that you studied at home - if you wanted to study at home, you should have asked to do home learning. Oh, you did ask us and we refused? That's because you're not disabled enough for home learning. But you're too disabled to take the exam. None of it makes any sense. I know I couldn't have passed my math or my English, but I studied every damn word in 3 different History textbooks and I know for a FACT that I would have passed that exam. I just wanted one qualification in the thing I love and they denied me that. And if they'd let me do online learning like a few others did, I know I could have passed other classes too. For the few months we did online learning for COVID, I did really well.

School sucks for everyone, I get it, but neurotypical people get to complain that algebra is useless and the cafeteria has terrible food and they don't want to take English for 4 years. I just wanted them to consider my needs for 5 minutes instead of brushing me off for years until they presented the choice: ""Attend every class full time or drop out at 15"". Why are those my only choices? That's not fucking fair. Who are they to decide who's autistic enough for support? I'm fucking autistic. I shouldn't have to look like this image of autism they have in their head just to be treated with the empathy everyone else gets. 

I don't want to sound... ungrateful? I know I'm more privileged than a lot of other people are. I'm just so frustrated that I have all this wasted potential that I know I could have fulfilled if they'd let me.",1

Recently getting fed up with autism content on Instagram. CW: abuse mention,"I know that there are autistic people who have had abusive parents/family or have went through abusive experiences (I have myself), but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very good to make this generalization that all misunderstanding of autism is or has resulted in abuse.

Person: ‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt look autistic!‚Äù

Me:I learned against my own will how to hide my entire being at a young age as a result of chronic, repetitive child abuse, emotional neglect, bullying, ostracism, and social isolation simply because l'm autistic that lasted for over a decade, causing me to involuntarily mask on a daily basis and become a bitter, confused dissociating mess of a human shell who for a long time believed that there was something horribly wrong with me as an existing human being and couldnt comprehend that I was just different and that there was actually nothing wrong with me and I never came to terms with it until early adulthood and that is why, my friend, I don't look autistic to you

Everyone, and I mean *everyone*, grew up and was harmed by the result of living in a society built for neurotypicals. Including our parents, family, and the other people around us in our everyday life. So, maybe, we shouldn‚Äôt vilify people and essentially call them *abusers* for not knowing how to help us in a neurotypical world.

I'm just so angry rn. I may never let him walk anywhere by himself again. Not to punish him but for his safety I don't want people hurting him. Ugh I just can't freaking stand people anymore.

I don't want to be on my deathbed regretting not being young, wild, and free. However, I struggle to act my age. For example, I've always hated cake because it's too sweet and now I'm at the age where I should love to party and drink but I'd rather stay indoors. When I do go out I struggle with what to wear. I dress too professional or conservative for the setting. And don't even get my started on the dating scene. I'm ready to settle down and want to date to marry but we're in the causal era. It's very frustrating and I wish I could just enjoy the ride like my peers but I can't. Everything is serious, I need everything to have an end goal or a plan or I get anxious. Am I alone?

Communication is so frustrating,"I hate it when people misunderstand me in conversation and assume the absolute worst. This happens too often on social media, when I'm just trying to discuss something with someone, and maybe I say too much or something, or maybe it's simply the fact I don't completely agree with them idk, but it appears that they assume the worst of my intentions because they either insult me in writing or they block me. 






Today it happened again. There's an autistic content creator I've occasionally watched videos of and I saw a video from her about ""autistic coded"" robots and other non-humans. I tried to discuss it with her. I asked her if she feels that the term ""coded"" implies intent because I feel it kinda does and I am not a huge fan of it because of that because we're not in the creators / artists / writers brain so I don't think we can know their intentions for certain unless they've outright said they intended for a character to have x trait. I didn't attack her for saying it. I asked her whether she feels it implies intention and said why *I* don't like it. I then said that I think in some cases robots / non-humans with autistic traits do come about for the reason she said but also offered another reason I think it happens too - which was coming from experience because I literally write about fictional robots myself. And she blocked me. I was just trying to discuss it with her. I had no bad intentions and definitely didn't want a negative interaction with her. 








Its so frustrating when this shit happens. I just have a lot of thoughts about things and I like to discuss things, and when people actually discuss things I'm interested in with me its awesome. But it also at other times results in people misunderstanding me and getting angry or blocking me on social media. It really sucks and makes me feel bad, especially when it's someone I've had positive interactions with before.",1
Does anyone else struggle with not feeling loved or cared about from a parent/guardian/family member/etc.?,"Hello everyone, I(21F) have been diagnosed with ASD since I was 5 years old. Along with ASD I have: Anxiety, Chronic Depression, PTSD, and ADD.

Ever since I can remember I've always had a strained relationship with my mother(neurotypical) and I've grown up wanting nothing more than to feel loved, cared, respected, and listened to by her ever since I could remember. As time went on, I slowly came to realize she was never going to, at least, not the way that I wanted her to. I wanted her to say, ""I'm proud of you,"" ""You're doing a great job,"" or even ""I love you,"" but she never said anything like that. Not unless I said ""I love you"" first, she half-heartedly said it back. She's the type that if you don't meet expectations, she belittles, shames, and berates until you have a breakdown. 

The worst part?

Every time I tried to leave the situation to calm down, she would follow and keep going. 

This is what it's been like recently: I got a new job(all by myself might I add, super proud of myself) - I was a CNA at a local hospital on 12 hour night shifts, but got a new job at a pediatric clinic that was days and a nice 8-5 - and recently I've noticed I get sick really easily. I got sick with a throat virus that the doctors couldn't do anything about, but let it take its course. This morning- after almost 2 weeks off from a fever coming off and on- I got really excited to go but had a low-grade fever(99.4¬∞F Oral), so I had to call out. My mom woke up and saw me home, came to me in my personal space without any warning, took my temperature and said: ""You're lying, you should have gone to work, your being lazy and I hope they fire you because I know I sure would if you were my employee."" (Note here, she's a high-ranking person in my county's health department).

She took it 2 hours after I had taken Tylenol and Pepto bismal to help(Note: my stomach was upset because she made me eat food that doesn't settle well with my stomach) She claims I'm recontaminating myself by staying locked up in my room and having the germs all over my bed spread. I don't think she's wrong, but her words recently have made my depression so horrible that I thought about getting their gun and ending it all.. I haven't had those thoughts in so long, and it really hurts to be having them again all over just because of a few words she's said. Before anyone suggests I talk to her: I've tried. All my life. Therapists, other family members, and friends have all told her to be a little nicer, but she never changes, and she probably never will. 

At this point, I'm mostly staying home because of my depression kicking my ass but I'm regretting staying home because of her treatment towards me. I have nowhere else to go, very little money since starting the new job, and feel super alone through it all since I'm the only person in my family diagnosed with ASD and have a difficult time reaching out for help because whenever I tried when I was under 18, my mom would step in, threaten that the police would take me away(a giant fear of mine she knew all about), and she would never come back to get me.

I'm really at a loss of what to do or what I can do.. I want to go back to work because I absolutely adore and love my job, but I fear I will get fired if I'm gone for much longer. I'm terrified of losing this job, I'm scared of what my mom will say/do to me if I even try to bring up my depression, and.. I'm just scared of everything right now. 

Thanks for reading this far, I hope you guys are having a good day/evening/night, and I hope you're taking care of yourselves. I'm willing to hear any suggestions ya guys have. 

Thank you again. ü§é",1

"Please, please stop making fun of Shaun from ""The Good Doctor"".","If you are unaware, there are multiple clips of Shaun circling around online, mainly of scenes of him experiencing meltdowns. These clips are posted with the intent of completely mocking the character, or to be used as an example of ""how not to write an autistic character"".  


I have also seen posts of this nature in this subreddit before, but from a more ""critical"" perspective, basically claiming how Shaun's autism is offensive/unrealistic/horrible representation.  


Yes, it is a doctor show. Yes, there are elements of the show that may be dramatized or ""cringey"". Yes, it is not going to be a 1:1 representation of the real world or whatever.  


But please, please consider before you make fun of this character, remember that MANY autistic people are ACTUALLY like him, or experience things similar to how it is depicted in the show. You can find plenty of people in this subreddit who really relate to this character, and autistic people are coming forward about how this trend is making them feel extremely alienated and disgusted with themselves. 

I know people are going to say ""but non-white-male autism is poorly represented"". Does the media/system favor white males? Yes. Is there a systematic prejudice against women and POC? Of course there is. But autism is autism, and you don't have to be white or male to relate to this character from an autistic perspective. You do not have to be white or male to have uncontrollable meltdowns with speech loops, or to talk the way he talks, or have the social style that he has. Just because he is is a white male does not mean that his autistic traits are made up out of thin air. So when you're claiming that his meltdowns are ""clownish"" and ""a mockery of autistic people"", what does that imply about the people who actually have meltdowns like that? Sure, we could use more diverse representation. But how does that logically condone the bullying of this character? How does that condone saying that his (very autistic) traits are not autistic?   


If you don't relate to him, that's fine. If you don't like the show, that's fine. But please do not mock him simply because you don't relate to him. I don't even really like the show. We need to remember that this is a spectrum condition and there will be people who present differently than you. That does not make you any less autistic, and it doesn't make Shaun's traits any less autistic, it just means you are different people with different symptoms and needs. We are alienating a part of our community by engaging in this bullying of traits. Thank you for coming to my TED talk lmfao.",1

On being mocked by my brother,"I have a younger brother, who I like to describe as the most neurotypical neurotypical that has ever neurotypicaled, and I often get this feeling that he doesn‚Äôt respect me. I mean sure, ostensibly there‚Äôs some degree of sibling rivalry, and I get that. But on the other hand, he‚Äôs generally quite dismissive towards me, which is something that a lot of people have pointed out, including his friends (one of them literally said ‚Äústop being so mean to your brother‚Äù).

The problem arises when he decides to mock me. Him being NT, he never really gets enthusiastic or talks about things in the same manner I do, which I‚Äôm fine with, but at the same time when I do want to talk to him, he can be quite mean at times. There‚Äôs this one thing he does where he makes fun of my stims (which I didn‚Äôt even realize were stims until relatively recently, because I didn‚Äôt know I was autistic), and it hurts that he makes fun of something I can‚Äôt control, something that keeps me grounded. The problem is, my parents aren‚Äôt that much supportive either, since my mom denies any possibility of me being autistic, so I can‚Äôt explain it in relation to that. To them, it seems like I‚Äôm being petty or overreacting when bringing it up, which is why I try to hide stimming around them (it sucks). And it‚Äôs not that my parents don‚Äôt recognize that my brother doesn‚Äôt respect me, it‚Äôs just that they think that making fun of my stims isn‚Äôt a big deal. Well, it kind of is, and it‚Äôs one of the things that makes me feel like my feelings aren‚Äôt taken seriously (being AMAB doesn‚Äôt help either).",1

Needing to hate your autism to be valid,"Has anyone else felt like it‚Äôs been communicated by many autistics that you can‚Äôt be happy with your autism?

I wanted to ‚Äúfill my life‚Äù with autism.

Now, within recent months, my life has been filled with negativity. I started focusing on how shit it is to live with this disorder. I‚Äôm crying all the time, hating myself more, and praying to God my symptoms get better somehow. 

I‚Äôm filled with hate.

While life has buried me in embarrassment and self hatred, part of me thought ‚Äòthis is exactly how you‚Äôre supposed to feel about your autism‚Äô. But is it?

I need all of you to stop apologizing to the wrong people,"Once every while it happens. I see a post from one of you where you stand up for yourself only to immediately retreat and apologize when the other person plays the victim. I know many of us are weak to manipulation because these kinds of things are simply our Achilles heel. I'm not sure who needs to hear this among us, but don't let them do this to you. 

The reason why we stand up for ourselves is because people from time to time cross our boundaries and we have to enforce said boundaries to preserve our mental health. Your boundaries are completely up to you and you will likely surround yourself with different people depending on what they are. Enforcing boundaries against people who do not give them the respect they deserve is never wrong. Do not be afraid to do it. Everybody is entitled to respect. You too. 

A lot of you will paddle back and apologize because we are easily manipulated. But even then we can do our best to arm ourselves against it. There are actually many common strategies that manipulators use like gaslighting or guilt tripping. It's vital to be informed of these behaviours because it will allow you to pinpoint such strategies and know how to respond to them or prepare for what comes next. Please understand this. If you apologize, they win. And if they see that they can easily trample over your boundaries, it only invites them to do it more cause they now know you're an easy target. It might feel like the polite or civil thing to do, but it's the wrong course of action. Stand your ground. I'm sure you have your reasons for calling people out. Respect your reasons. 

The world is a good place, but at times it can also be really nasty and bad people can often take advantage of people who can't resist them in really vile ways. This is my attempt to look out for people who need to hear this. Look after yourself, folks. And if you can, look after people who need you to do it for them.",1

Here is the thing though it requires moving all of our things out of one room and into the other and cleaning the spaces after we move the stuff. I hate cleaning. I hate it so much. I hate messes but I hate touching the messes even more. It leads me to a lot of avoidance of creating waste whenever I can or pilling my boxes so I don‚Äôt need to move them as often. (I also have adhd in conjunction with my autism if that makes a difference to and I am medicated) but because of all of this I have to put in my earbuds and ignore everyone because the minute that someone talks to me they can always seem to tell I am upset. Because I get angry when I clean. Does anyone else experience this?,1
Diagnosis struggle,"So my diagnosis process has been anything but smooth. At first my doctor brushed off my issues as depression and anxiety. Put me on meds for both and they got worse. Way worse. I was almost sent to a psychiatric hospital bad. Then he suspected bipolar. Kept me on the other two meds but added meds for bipolar. I started to hallucinate and get even worse! He got rid of the anxiety meds and the depression got really bad. The anxiety had almost completely gone away. I was unable to stay wake for more than an hour at a time. I failed high school and have to go through the expensive process of getting my GED. After enough complaints from my teachers, parents, family, and myself my doctor took me off my meds and agreed to do a screening for ASD and ADHD. (ADHD runs in my family.) when doing the screening the only things that flagged for ADHD were the lap over ones for ASD. Well now since he prolonged my diagnosis process till after I hit 18. The only place that will do a diagnosis for autism is TWO HOURS out of my city. That isn‚Äôt even accounting for the distances in the cities I‚Äôd have to go just to get to the exact location. There is a doctor in my city but the oldest people he diagnosed are 17. I‚Äôve been telling my doctor teachers have raised concerns of me being autistic for long before I was 17. My doctor has made things difficult for me from the start with almost everything. Stomach issues, my transition, therapy, and even just simple blood work so I know if I have some of the genetic conditions that run in my family. I‚Äôve got the paperwork for the place outside of my city because I finally want a set in stone answer so I can access the proper accommodations I‚Äôve needed since day one. I‚Äôm gonna take them in when I have my next appointment. I‚Äôve already had my local hospital help with my transition (which I find out if I start hormones on Monday or a later date!) I‚Äôve done my research on this and honestly once this is all said and done I want to be a voice for people like me in my city because this situation is so draining and isolating. Please tell me my doctor isn‚Äôt the only one? I‚Äôm not even self diagnosing the screening said I‚Äôm autistic and should do the full diagnosis. Teachers have said I probably autistic. If it weren‚Äôt for them I would have never even started the process because I thought I was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù compared to my family‚Ä¶ sorry if that made no sense at all. I‚Äôve had a busy week last week and I still haven‚Äôt fully recovered. 

TLDR: doctor has made my diagnosis process 10x harder by pushing off the actual diagnosis until after I was 18. Now I have to leave my entire city just for one appointment that could have been done here if he had acted 3 years faster.",1
why is making things up on the spot so hard?,"I‚Äôm preparing for exams that will grant me a certificate that I can speak in english, it‚Äôs useful to get jobs and things like that. 

One of the tasks is just speaking, you have a person asking you questions about yourself and you have to answer it in 3/4 sentences. 

The thing is, a lot of these questions are really personal or touching on politics and I don‚Äôt want to answer honestly,
especially if it inevitably touches on subjects like mental health affecting my day to day functioning, or politics in my country that are quite hostile to me considering I‚Äôm lgbt. 

The obvious answer would be to just make stuff up, my teacher even encourages it, they‚Äôre not questioning me and checking my past, they want to know if I can speak english. 

But I just can‚Äôt think of anything. I make myself look like an idiot on my english classes, because my teacher ask me a simple question and my brain just shuts off. Like she asks me what my future plans are and instead of making some shit up about some dream career or where I want to live, my brain short circuits and I have no idea what to say. Doing this on an actual exam would make me fail it. 

Right now I‚Äôm searching for as much questions that I could possibly be asked and I‚Äôm writing down some made up things that I could say instead of opening up to random people. And it‚Äôs just so stupid. My main struggle isn‚Äôt that I can‚Äôt speak english, I‚Äôm even slowly getting over my accent insecurities, but I‚Äôm failing to do this task cause I can‚Äôt make shit up on the spot. 

I also hate how I have to ‚Äúfluff up‚Äù these answers, it was always a struggle for me in school, when writing some essays or doing speaking tasks, I would get straight to the point, not hitting the minimum word limits, or making it seem like I can‚Äôt speak english.",1
Autism Rant,"It feels like when someone mentions I have autism, my performance at school and my understanding of things seems to decrease. Last month my brother was getting pissy at me and I argued with him and overall it didn‚Äôt well,He said I was basically like a disabled person because I‚Äôm Autistic for not handling my anger when he provokes me all the time and how I wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle a job and how he has no faith in me so I stopped talking to him and ever since he said that it feels like my performance at school has suffered as well as my understanding in subjects such as math and stuff. I hate the fact that people classify autism as a disability because I feel that it impacts my progress and not to mention, I am fully able to move around like a normal person and I don‚Äôt have frequent trouble understanding basic subjects. I also overthink most of my situation and it feels like before I could handle the big work and understand the lessons that most of the class didn‚Äôt even despite being told I have autism. I hate how I‚Äôve been Shielded from the real world just because I have autism, not to mention I‚Äôm the youngest in my family so I would‚Äôve been sheltered enough already in my life, I hate how they weren‚Äôt as strict with me as with my older brothers because it now means I‚Äôm weaker mentally than my older brothers. I‚Äôm thinking that if they didn‚Äôt treat me any different, maybe I would‚Äôve beaten this thing, but no it‚Äôs still present in my life and I just want to be treated like everyone else and not pitied by anyone. I hate how fucking nervous I am when talking to people, I hate how my mom told me I wasn‚Äôt like the other kids when I joined wrestling, I hate how if I did something bad my dad said he would send me to therapy as if that were to fix everything and I hate how my oldest brother annoys me the most by peeping on me through the door, trying to kiss my left cheek and randomly opening my door and trying to deny it, getting pissed and telling me that I‚Äôm disabled because I can‚Äôt handle my anger, it‚Äôs not my fault I don‚Äôt want to be someone‚Äôs bitch. I hate how I‚Äôm told that within the time I get a drivers license, I‚Äôm gonna get that blue disabled thing that I‚Äôm gonna put on my car to let the rest I‚Äôm ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù when I‚Äôm not. The only people who haven‚Äôt judged me for my autism are my 2nd older brother and friends and strangers count I guess. I hope to god there is a way it can be cured because I feel it also impacts my wrestling skills and the way I learn new moves.",1
"I hate when people say ""obviously sarcasm""","I can use sarcasm myself, but most times if someone else does I'm really confused.

This leads to a lot of confusion on social media considering how prevalent figurative language is.

Whenever anyone asks if something is sarcastic or not the response is usually ""obviously"". 

I'm not someone who likes to use the word ableist because it's grossly overused online but I feel like this is. 

Assuming everyone else must be neurotypical therefore anyone who doesn't get it is an idiot who missed the ""obvious""

I just wish people put more thought into their comments, I know I'm much more sensitive than most people but it really hurts to be treated like I'm just too dumb to talk to others.",1
(Autistic) burnouts suck,"It started when I was 19. I‚Äôll become 23 this year. Next month. It‚Äôs nuts. Almost 4 years of my life gone in the blink of an eye. My youth slipping through my fingers all because I‚Äôm extremely exhausted. I had to quit college and my job. Lost contact with all my friends. Socializing is absolutely exhausting. Gained a lot of weight because I can‚Äôt even walk for longer than half an hour. At first I could barely walk. Went to 3 different therapists and all sorts of organizations for help but I just can‚Äôt seem to recover. How much longer is this going to take? I did make some progress but all it takes is one stressful event and I‚Äôm right back to where I started. I can‚Äôt even rest at home because of my parents divorce and my mom‚Äôs paranoid, borderline behavior. I just want a normal life for fucks sake. I only wanted to finish college, get a good job, move out of my parents house, make more friends and get a boyfriend.

I can‚Äôt do things I want to do because I have no one to do them with,"I wanna be partying and drinking till 3am. I‚Äôm almost 23 and never done that yet. The only people who talk to me are autistic, and they refuse to stay up passed 10pm or drink at all. I tried to be friends with people who would do that stuff, but they just refuse to continue contact. Now I‚Äôm not in school so the only people I can meet are the people I already know",1
The wait is killing me.,"I underwent a miniature diagnostic process for autism a few weeks ago with my therapist. I got a 6/10, which is just on the threshold that qualifies me for a full follow-up, potentially leading to a diagnosis. I had a previous therapist indicate that I could be on the spectrum as well.

But, frankly, I'm dying to know the answer. I live in the UK and with the current state of healthcare it could take months for me to find out. But, I feel like I've already kind of accepted my diagnosis before getting it, which feels foolish. But something about it feels so right, I don't know. Even the few people I have in my life seem to think it's highly plausible that I could be.

I don't know what I should be feeling, but I'm already feeling a strange sense of relief. Like even if I am not autistic, it feels like I'm a step closer to understanding myself and why I am the way I am. It feels like a very important question that's going to be unanswered for a large amount of time.

How did everyone else's diagnostic process go? How did you feel when you first found out you might have autism, and how did you feel when you'd been officially diagnosed?",1
questioning my autism.,"I do get it. I can mask so well I seem like a happy and social person to a lot of people, or at least just normal. I can look people in the eye, I can make small talk, if I didn‚Äôt get someone‚Äôs joke/ what they‚Äôre trying to say I just pretend I got it and get away with it. No one can see that I didn‚Äôt get their joke they just told, that the sounds are making it very hard to listen to you, that I‚Äôm sweating and that your eyes are hurting me, it seems like I‚Äôm doing just fine. If I do show a bit of my symptoms, I come off as weird or rude. 

 It makes me wonder if I could even be autistic if I can mask to this extend because sometimes it doesn‚Äôt take that much effort, or maybe I‚Äôm just used to push through these things no matter what. Sometimes I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm just an overreacting attention seeking neurotypic (even though I‚Äôve only told a handful of people about my diagnosis) even though I can finally relate so much to autistic struggles and other autistic people in these subreddits.  



I also be on the verge of a meltdown because of everything happening around me, but due to traumatic experiences from the past I‚Äôm extremely good at pretending everything‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôll just be my ‚Äònormal self‚Äô, then as soon as I get home I‚Äôll hit myself, throw things around me and cry hysterically.
Ever since I was a little kid I would only do this when I‚Äôm alone because I knew my parents would just act like I‚Äôm doing it on purpose for attention, even though I know my emotions are so intense for me I just explode. In social settings I‚Äôve always daydreamed/ sort of dissociated when I‚Äôm overwhelmed to cope, but if I am alone, overstimulated and one little thing goes wrong all my frustration gets out. No one sees that.


I just hate that people think I‚Äôm not having that much struggles with my autism, or that ‚Äúit must be really mild then‚Äù, or ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôm just a HSP!‚Äù, just because I appear to be ‚Äònormal‚Äô most of the time. You don‚Äôt see me struggling with emotions, doing simple tasks at home or understanding things. You don‚Äôt feel all the things I feel in my body when I‚Äôm with you. IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT TO APPEAR THIS WAY. 


That‚Äôs all.",1
It makes me extremely angry that we don‚Äôt have an autistic male sa statistic,"9/10 Afab autistic people get SAed in their lifetime, I‚Äôve been attempting to find an amab statistic on this since every amab autistic person I know has either been molested or SAed at a young age but when I try to find anything on this I find satistics that call amab autistic people rapists.

I hate having trouble understanding intent behind things like jokes and phrases sometimes,"Usually I‚Äôve learned pretty well to gauge through context and experience that a lot of things that people say/do have either a fairly consistent meaning, or don‚Äôt have a conscious meaning behind them at all, at least in how they‚Äôre communicating with me. Like, I can *typically* tell if someone is being passive aggressive, or if they‚Äôre hinting at something about me, or if they‚Äôre alluding to certain ideas. The problem is, there are still a lot of times in which I am either totally unaware of any sort of deeper meaning to things they‚Äôre saying like irony or if they‚Äôre even joking at all, or I overthink things because I‚Äôm afraid of the former scenario and end up coming to a wrong conclusion and having an awkward interaction. Also sometimes this leads to me overthinking and taking things personally because I just **genuinely** don‚Äôt know what they think or if they‚Äôre subtly communicating something that I‚Äôm missing. I hate not being able to tell if they‚Äôre joking, being insulting/annoyed or expressing an actual opinion, and I hate it even more when I read too deep into it and think that they‚Äôre doing something that they‚Äôre not because I feel dumb for not just knowing what they mean because apparently it was obvious, or at least it always feels that way in hindsight.",1

"everyone's fine with me being autistic when it's only ""quirkiness"", but when it's anything else they hate it so much.","it's fine when i'm naive, or just fidgeting a lot, or not making eye contact. but it's not fine when...

I finally found my bio father,"I (41nb) know this post isn't specifically autism related, but it's all about some heavy stuff I've been dealing with for the last two months as an autistic person. I've been struggling to process because it's so overwhelming and I'm looking for support/a place to vent these feelings. 


I'll give some brief background. My birth giver (73f) kidnapped me before I was even born. I found out about this from a series of guilty confessions she made to me as a child. She only told me initially that my father was a different man from my older siblings because her husband wanted to take us to his affair partner's home. Birth giver told me ""the truth"" to spite him. I was 3 or 4. That wasn't the first or last time she used me to hurt him. 


It took several years and several lies to get some semblance of the truth out of her. Meanwhile, I was treated like a pet while I was small, but I was also being abused by an older sibling. The older I got, the more I was mistreated by my birth giver, my half siblings, and her husband. I was denied medical treatment, education, and therapy. I was forced into isolation from the ages of 10-14. Everything in my life had to revolve around church and God or I was punished. 


I always wanted to find my bio father, but I was hesitant. Birth giver told me things about him and heavily implied that she thought I was better off with her than with the man she had agreed to be a surrogate to (she says she needed cash, but that doesn't really make sense given the context. Unfortunately I can't share those details as they make me too identifiable). She always framed her decision to keep me as if it was up to her alone. It was only recently that someone pointed out to me that what she'd done was considered kidnapping. That realization really messed my head up and I'm still trying to process the fallout from it. 


I cut contact with everyone from Birth givers side years ago because I was tired of being their scape goat. Recently, I finally got the courage to order a DNA kit and it got processed so much quicker than the company said. Once the results came in, I was able to track my bio father down through a cousin. All I ever really knew was his name and the state he lived in. But that was enough. It took time to finally get in touch with him, but this week we started talking for the very first time. 


He's eccentric, but he's been nothing but honest with me about himself so far as I can tell. I've asked him if he would share what he remembers of my conception, and it isn't much, but it seems to confirm that my birth giver set out to purposely  get pregnant and may have had 0 intentions of letting (me) that child go. I've always suspected I was her revenge baby, a child she weaponized, and I thought I had come to terms with that, but I guess I haven't. Maybe because there was always a small chance I could have been wrong before. 


On top of that, despite having a few very supportive people who I've confided in about this situation, some of them have told me things like: ""you'll always love your mother, she raised you."" and I feel like they can't possibly understand what it feels like to know your own mother only had you to hurt someone. Something broke inside of me and I don't feel any love for my birth giver at all anymore. It's scary and it hurts so bad, but its also a relief to finally have that emotional tie broken.


Ultimately, I am glad to finally know my bio father, I have zero regrets about finding him. But...this hurts so much more than I've let on. I'm absolutely devastated. My whole life was a lie. My ""family"" just used me to make themselves feel better. It's so much to process and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to fully come to terms with this. 


I feel so alone right now. My irl supports have all been very kind, but no one understands what I'm going through (they've all said that) and I hate that I feel like this. I made a post about my struggles with this situation in another sub, one for abuse survivors, but it got completely ignored. That's really set off my rejection sensitivity, so I deleted that last post and decided that maybe this sub will be a little more responsive? I don't know, I just feel lost and sad right now. Any advice is appreciated, but not necessary. I'm really just looking for support. 


Thank you for reading.",1
This stuff is hard.,"My mom waited till I was 18 for the diagnosis, my entire school life not knowing what was wrong with me. Being outside in public is generally uncomfortable. I don't talk and I only interact with people unless they talk first.",1
"i only understand sarcasm when it's really obvious, and expressions/phrases don't make sense","I don't know for sure if I have autism or not, I actually think inattentive ADHD is more likely, but I have a lot of traits that are similar to autism, I just can't get anything diagnosed atm, so I hope it's alright I post this here.  


i have a hard time with sarcasm sometimes. even if i know it's sarcasm by the tone of their voice, sometimes I still can't tell what they really mean. and with texts, sometimes I can only tell if tone indicators are used or if it's just something that makes sense to me personally... like, if it's something sarcastic I would say, then I might understand it.  


I'm worse with expressions, though. like, my mom sometimes says phrases that I don't understand and take literally, and then she gets annoyed with me for not understanding it was just an expression. it doesn't help that they usually sound really mean. like... even if you don't mean it, why would you say that?? it still upsets me.",1
I‚Äôm done with making friends. It‚Äôs too much trouble.,"TL;DR- can‚Äôt make friends, tried one last time and it didn‚Äôt work no matter what I did. Maybe too nice for my own good.

ETA: Also, the friend is NB, hence the they/them/their pronouns.

I don‚Äôt even know if this even belongs on this sub but I like to think I‚Äôm not alone here‚Ä¶

 
Like a lot of people on the spectrum, I have a very hard time with friends. Not just making them, but keeping in touch or keeping them in general. I‚Äôll be too weird, too insecure, too standoffish, etc. I try to make the effort, but my words get misunderstood when I‚Äôm trying to make jokes or try to join in on a conversation, and something happens and all of a sudden I‚Äôm out of the friend group or at least marginalized. I‚Äôve tried many ways to approach people but it never got much better. I‚Äôm used to it by now (I‚Äôm 38), but today I have decided to stop trying. 

I was set to give up a few years ago (pandemic/quarantine kind of made it obvious), but I went back to work and I met a new coworker. We hit it off, but they left a few months later. I decided then that I would give one last push to make a genuine friend that will help make life worth living again, instead of just surviving. It worked! We started hanging out after going back and forth online, and it was easily one of the best times of my life. This time, I thought, will be good. They started dating someone new, no problem, I‚Äôll stay supportive. They break up, I‚Äôd lend a shoulder. We‚Äôd just relax and watch YouTube videos to pass the time (we could only be so social before it exhausts us both- another great reason to keep the friendship alive). 

Then the one thing I feared happened‚Ä¶they were moving to another state for work. Obviously I was happy for them. But I knew that it would lead to me slowly but surely losing touch with them and I would be missing that one bit of light in my world. But I supported them and sent them off with a smile. But! This seemingly wonderful human insisted we stay in touch and offered to fly me over to visit the first chance they get. 

And it actually happened. We would get together every other month or so to go to a concert or see some sights or simply just watch a movie. The times we aren‚Äôt physically together we coordinate a watch party and watch random shows together online. It was working. I was eventually declared their best friend, and it felt nice. I was happier and lively, according to my coworkers (I don‚Äôt really notice it on my own). 

About a year goes by like this and suddenly my friend got let go. It was devastating for them and I immediately decided to take off work and go comfort them. I‚Äôm not the richest in the world, but I pooled all my funds and went, but something was off. They pretty much expected me to help clean up and I accidentally made a mess with a plate and it broke. They went ballistic. I apologized immediately and said I would reimburse them for the damage. I then started to clean up, and this is where my anxiety kicks in, because I already made a wrong move and i don‚Äôt want to make another. But they kept on and on how they can‚Äôt replace it (it was an inherited gift apparently) and takes the broom from me and cleans up. I said again that I was sorry and that I‚Äôm trying to help them feel better and they just said ‚Äúwell, this isn‚Äôt helping me, is it??‚Äù I made a point that I dropped everything to lend a hand because they have lost their job and is having a hard time (their words), and the one phrase I hate hearing from people was uttered. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask you to do that!‚Äù 

In my mind, friends (especially ones who call YOU their ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù) are there at the first sign of trouble. I will do almost anything if I can physically do it. Now, I truly understand boundaries (I‚Äôm a rare one and actually like hugs, but I‚Äôll refrain from hugging those who don‚Äôt want them), but I didn‚Äôt think I was overstepping. I didn‚Äôt just surprise them by showing up on their doorstep; in fact, they were so grateful to have company as they live alone. They could have said no if they wanted to be alone or with someone else. So that phrase took me aback. All I said was ‚Äúokay, guess I‚Äôll leave you alone all depressed instead like a BEST FRIEND should, right?‚Äù Trying to make them see that i was trying to be a friend. The next phrase all but broke me. 

‚ÄúYou did it for yourself.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt know what they meant, but I took it as ‚Äúyou‚Äôre selfish‚Äù. I was so stunned I couldn‚Äôt reply. I don‚Äôt see how I was selfish except me trying to keep this friendship alive. I thought we both were. I packed my stuff and left the next morning. 

It‚Äôs been almost a month since and we‚Äôve been occasionally texting as if nothing had happened. But for me I don‚Äôt see how I can continue. I would try confronting them about how their words hurt but I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôll have another argument that will just guilt me into submission. Just the thought of seeing them either in person or on video makes me feel ill. I tried as hard as I could to be kind and loyal and friendly all around, and it took one mistake to mess it up. I kept sidestepping to avoid being too clingy or too intrusive, but none of it mattered. Maybe I‚Äôm just bad with words and communication. Maybe I have shitty judgment and make the wrong friends, I don‚Äôt know. 

I‚Äôll just try to keep going by just doing what I must and saying as little as I can. It seems to be the best chance for a decent outcome for me. In hindsight I was probably just a convenient person to walk on, and I mistook it for someone who genuinely accepts me for me. At least I got to be truly myself for a little while, so that‚Äôs something, right?",1

I learned about nihilism from a book i was reading in grade one that i stumbled onto at the library.it made sense, my life sucked then,still sucks, and will continue to stuck in the future. I dont have some grand traumatic event that made me have these thoughts or at least i do think ?. i just kinda put my thoughts in order after reading a book. i was never abused or at least i don't think ? i was neglected by a legal definition sure but i only had one extremely poor parent so its expected - emotionally and physically. before my diagnosis a few years ago i never understood why i was so much slower than most kids as i started to reach the integral ages of 7-11 and began to noticeably slow down brain and intelligence development. i was below average in school and only did good on tests,after age 10 everything became so much harder. i never had friends before or any of that so i was already extremely behind in that regard, along with worsening grades, i just couldn't keep up with normal people and that continues to today. im doing terribly in school due to chronic pain from brain injury and now found genetic condition (CJS) which basically just degrades you quickly as you age, which i guess makes sense in my hilariously pathetic existence. Ive tried jobs and failed, i can barely function as a human my age and i dont see much of a real future. i also don't have a easily obtainable bucket list which includes travel and things like romance but i could take it or leave it tbh. ive kinda resided myself to that those luxury are for normal or rich people. i don't really see a point in my future ? im two grades behind in high-school due to my health issues and now im almost entirely reliant on passing a highschiool early out exam or dropout.my existence has just been a comedic play to someone i bet, reel out that carrot on a stick and give me one positive event only for 99 negative things to happen. i dont really see an end to my mindset either. obviously some parts are confirmation bias to an extent but when your told your entire life is confirmation bias it feels a little stupid. i dont have a long reason or point to life to stay around past 18 ? if anyone's got any ideas id like to hear them. there most likely not obtainable but im a severe maladaptive day dreamer so i could always imagine it. thanks for reading",1
I feel my mom judges me for my special interest/hobby,"So I (23F) absolutely love plushies. In fact, I'm working on collecting a certain series of plushies. They are a bit expensive (like $10) but I consider myself responsible with my money. I have a good amount of money saved up and hoping to buy a house at the end of the year.

I got one of these plushies and my mom spotted it in the plastic bag and I told her what it was since she asked, and she was like ""another one?!"" and I tried defending myself saying how it's a series I've collected and all she said was ""well you need to save your money!"" There was time before where she questioned me on what those plushies were and I felt embarrassed. 

I feel like now I always have to hide those particular plushies from my mom because I'm always questioned or feel judge for this particular interest. I don't feel like this interest/hobby is hurting anyone and not hurting me financially, so why am I being judged for this? Does anyone else have their parents judge them for their hobby? I just feel embarrassed when my mom comments on it.",1
They were right-- I'm not cut out to be in the vetmed field. (Tw suicide mention),"I've been a receptionist for a vet clinic for a few months, burnt out, then got hospitalized when my support system dissolved (my cat of 17yrs died and my parents were out of town). I lost my job because my doctor was convinced that forcing me to go back to work was a good idea. I had a meltdown and was forced to quit or be fired. It took me 5 months to get another job-- same role as before but at a different hospital. I started a couple weeks ago. I'm close to quitting because I cannot handle the abuse anymore.


 Some people are monsters and I am forced to just take their abuse because saying or doing anything to defend myself is not ok. The managers that are supposed to handle the difficult people won't deal with them. I can't handle being mocked and told that I am a ""fucking idiot"" and that I ""clearly don't give a shit"" about their pet. I can't handle being yelled at for shit out of my control or blamed for someone else's mistakes. I'm tired of being the scapegoat and punching bag for anyone who gets frustrated about things not going the way they want it. My coworkers have been doing their best to help me, but they can't stop the clients from absolutely bullying me. 


Idk what to do. I feel like I need to quit. Again. I feel hopeless about being one of those ""meaningful and productive members of society,"" and I doubt I will be able to get financial support from the government bc I'm (apparently) not disabled enough and haven't worked enough hours or something? But the issue is that I cannot work reliably. I cannot keep a job. I'm incapable of this. I'll end up trying to kill myself bc what's the point in trying anymore when I am not allowed to thrive? 


In the end, my dad's gf was right. I'm not ever going to make it if I tried to become a vet. I might not even survive just existing.",1
Should I give up of trying to be successful doing what I love?,"I'm going to give context, so it's going to be a little longer. Sorry.

I'm 28 years old, I love photos and movies since I was 10 years old. I learned to edit videos at 12, I started creating videos at the same age. My first YouTube video was in 2006, and the idea of YouTube and exposing it to the world was amazing to me.

I went to film school where I learned to be a filmmaker, while taking all the Journalism classes (photojournalism).

Leaving college, I started working in the field of marketing, since my country doesn't give a damn about national artistic production and the only types of films are the same comedy scripts. I focused mainly on working with brands and companies, to be able to deal with less EGO (dealing with money is easier than with people's egos). I've been working in marketing ever since, and it's had its ups and downs.

But my dream has always been to work with cinema. I love to tell stories, I love to create, and I need to let my imagination go, otherwise I get very depressed.

So in 2018 I decided to move to Germany even though I had never left my country or even spoken another language IRL. I started working hard, doing 16 hours of work every day of the week. I saved enough money to move and I came to Germany in August/2019. I started working here and gently paved my way until covid happened.

Between 2020 and today, a lot has happened: an abusive/manipulative relationship that destroyed my self-image; 2 months in psychiatric hospital; I broke my elbow; ended my relationship; I lost my home;

Since last year things have been more stable. I have a new house, with my pets, I started dating my best friend. I started to find myself again. What I like to do, what I like to wear, what I like to create (things my last relationship took away from me).

And this year I felt it was time to get back to pursuing my dreams and passions in filmmaking.

&#x200B;

**And here we come to the point of this post:**

&#x200B;

I just can't do what I've dreamed of my whole life.

Not for lack of skill or knowledge, but for lack of social ability. I can mask enough to work full time, but I suck at networking.

Like, HORRIBLE HORRIBLE at networking with new people

&#x200B;

And that's 80% of what's needed.

&#x200B;

I reached the point of thinking it would be easier to become famous through the internet. And now I'm 72 days into posting regularly on Instagram and YouTube. Going out, filming, create, plan, posting. For a little recognition and a lot of frustration (algorithms, people hating for no reason, no reach, much shitter content blowing, etc).

You might say it's only 72 days. But for me it's much more than that. It's years. It's a change of continent.

I feel like I'm banging my head against the wall (metaphoric) every day because I can't do a simple networking task. And even doing photo-shoots is very difficult, because the need to interact with new people all the time, giving instructions and being friendly. When I try to do it, I feel so frozen, it's like forgetting everything I know. And this is so frustrating.  


I don't know what do to anymore, because I'm tired and frustrated. I can't go further. But at the same time I don't like to give up. Photo and film are part of myself, my personality, my hobby, my job, my passion. I'm overwhelmed by my feelings, by the situation, without being able to get out of this, to find my way out, and how to overcome. I overthink everything and spend hours and hours trying to find solutions. Meanwhile the only thing that I get is a lower life quality because the constant anxiety crises.

"Why are my autistic traits ""cringe""?","My friend has been ignoring me, and I found out he was talking behind my back from a mutual friend. So I confronted him, and he said i was high maintenance and cringe.
I'm high maintenance because I dont like emotional talks about me, I require reassurance, I tend to not answer if I'm called unexpectedly, and I dont answer when in shutdown (he used those exact words. how am i meant to answer when im not THERE?)
Before I get to the cringe part, Ive started unmasking around my close friends (stimming, infodumping, not suppressing meltdowns/sensory overloads, etc.)
He called me cringe because I move weirdly, I yell when talking, I hit myself, Im always talking about my spinterest, i have a hard time listening without providing solutions, and other autistic traits. I dont think he's ableist, or the rest of my friends, as apparently they agreed with him, but I'm tempted to just...never unmask around them again. I dont understand how I'm cringe or high maintenance. i think im just an autistic HUMAN. I dont know how to feel, or how to react. And he did apologise, but i dont feel okay to unmask anymore. He's done the same with my other autistic friend.",1
My dad is a doctor and still won't accept my autism diagnosis/people tell me I'm not autistic,"My dad is a very smart man as well as a doctor and he wont accept my autism and adhd diagnosis. I would say its a recent diagnosis but it's been months. Every time I bring it up he gets uncomfortable or irritated. If I even mention the ableism I have to deal with everyday he gets extremely angry and tells me I'm being unrealistic. I asked him for clarification on a direction the other day and he got very angry at me and started yelling. The vice-principal of my school has also told me that basically I cant be effected by ableism because I'm not even really autistic. Just because I'm high functioning socially doesn't mean I'm not autistic and it makes me so extremely angry and sad because nobody understands, not even my other autistic friends. Does anyone else feel this way?",1
Having sensory overload/meltdowns as an adult,I can't help but feel embarrassed that I still get meltdowns in public as an adult. My mom never got me help as a kid when it came to this so I spent a good portion of my life having little to no coping mechanisms when it comes to noise sensitivity or any other aspect of autism. I'm slowly learning to cope better but I feel so far behind other autistic people some days.,1
speaking aloud is becoming more and more tiring and i feel incredibly selfish for wanting to stop speaking completely.,"for the past few years, my ability to talk has become worse and worse. i used to be able to speak somewhat okay without getting too tired out and slip up occasionally (like stuttering a little or switching up words a bit), but now nearly every sentence i say makes no sense. everything i say is jumbled, i stutter super often and it takes longer than it should for me to get a sentence out. i have to often resay sentences 3+ times because i cant organize my words and it pisses me off. if i talk too much, itll start to feel like i have a faint sore throat (which i DESPISE the feeling of) and i have to strain more than i already do to get the words out. its so exhausting to speak aloud and i hate feeling ""pressured"" to continue talking because of the fact its not socially acceptable (from what ive gathered) to just choose to not speak. sometimes talking feels overstimulating, even when im not overstimulated otherwise.

as bad as this likely sounds, every time ive been overwhelmed to the point of not being able to speak at all, ive felt a sense of relief that i cant talk anymore, and my energy came back much quicker than if i were to be less overstimulated but still be able to talk. i wish i could just write on a notepad or in my notes app every time i wanted to speak, but i fear people wont be patient with me and i dont want to get yelled at by a stranger or something. GODDDDDDDDDD i just wish it was socially acceptable to not talk, because at this point it feels so irritating and horrible that it makes me want to punch something.

sorry if this post doesnt make sense. its easier to get my words right when i type them, but this post still is kinda jumbled i think.",1

I wish I knew how to act like normal people do,"Hello, everybody.
I'm not diagnosed with autism but when I read or hear autistic people talk about their life experiences I feel like I finally found people who are as ""weird"" as me.
I relate so much to the people of this community that sometimes I feel so happy that I start crying... But anyway, this is not the main reason I created this post: I'm here because I'm so tired of my lack of social skills.

When I'm with others, it's almost as if I wasn't responding to their verbal and body language: they smile, talk happily and nicely to me while I'm there, still, trying to look at them in the eyes with absolutely no facial expression and no verbal response (the only things I say are ""yes"", ""no"", and ""mh""). Therefore, people label me as ""weird"" and avoid to talk to me.
Sometimes, when I think about how I act with people I laugh because it's so funny, but most of the times it's so saddening to me.

But when I find what I call a ""favorite person"" everything changes: I can easily look at you in the eyes, I show you so much love, I always try to make you happy, and I try to protect you at all costs (even if I'm really physically weak). I just love it when I find ""that person""... I finally feel happy...
But I get way too attached to that person... My attachment becomes a true obsession and all my friendships end because the other person gets so tired of me.

For me, having a favorite person is kinda like having a partner (for a neurotypical person): I want to spend as much time as possible with the other person and do many things together, and when the relationship ends it takes me years to accept it, even when I found a new favorite person.

For these reasons, I've never had more than one friend and I passed most of my time alone with no friends. I just wish someone told me what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it... I would literally follow all their instructions precisely.


Also, I've made this post because someone who I considered my favourite person told me that they don't like how I act, that everything I do is so annoying, and that I should seek medical attention. Maybe their words weren't that hurtful, but they made me so sad because I just thought that in these last months they were stressed/sad and I wanted to help them to feel better... Apparently my actions have been misinterpreted.


P.S.: sorry for any mistakes or if something is hard to understand.",1
How do we get through to our autistic friend that he needs help?,"My friends and I are autistic too but our symptoms don't manifest like his. We're all incredibly independent (Even though we all constantly crave guidance) And our friend is so dependent that hes willing to put up with abuse.

So we have a friend who's 25 and mildly autistic. His Mom is a narcissistic psychopath who treats him like a servant. His dad is afraid of his mom but hes too old to do anything. They live in the deep country and he has nobody around him to help. No family. No friends that live nearby, we live states away.

Ever since September we've been flying/driving down and visiting him, but nothing we do can convince him to even spend one night outside of his home. His entire life is under lock and key, he's even afraid of walking away from his parents at the supermarket. He has a breakdown and starts sobbing like a kid every time we ask him to tell his parents to let him spend one night outside of his home. We always feel terrible about asking this, but in the same breath he'll tell us he's unhappy and feels like a prisoner. It's even gotten to the point where hes been lying in manipulating us to try to get us to do things for him because he refuses to stand up to his mom. He told us that his parents were beating him, but then he admitted that that was a lie. He was just trying to think up ways where he could legally justify leaving. But it was always legal, hes just afraid of standing up to the mental abuse. 

He even catfished a girl from another state to fly down and visit him without telling her the way that he was living, and tried to manipulate her into a long distance relationship and sex. She spent $2000 on him during her visit because he was really good at telling her what she wanted to hear over the internet, like a fantasy. She dumped him after he couldnt keep the charrade up any longer. He didn't want to take advantage of her initially, but hes so desperate to have a life outside of his abusive mom he's willing to do anything. His dad really wants him to move out and move on, and not tell his mom. But he keeps telling his mom because he wants her to support him. (I think he tells his mom because he's secretly afraid of growing up, but thats just me) In reality she just wants to use him like a slave until the ""Great Lord"" takes her away. 

Shit's psychotic but we have no idea how to help him. We keep giving him numbers and people who have spare rooms but he refuses all the help. (And then after feeling abandoned he wants the help again) We've driven down for hours (some of us drove for 6 hours) and ask him to come with us but he chickens out at the very last second every single time. But he tries to get us to do it again 6 months later! We're tired dude, we want to help him but we have no idea what to do at this point. He obviously needs therapy but no one will drive him to therapy. He obviously needs support but no one with power will support him and hes too afraid to leave. 

What do we do? We all really care about him but I'm starting to think we shouldn't get involved anymore...",1
sitting outside of a 2¬Ωhr movie because it's too loud for me (theater). my ride is watching the movie so I'm stuck here until it's over,"I had sensory issues the whole way coming here and now I am stuck sitting in the hallway doing nothing until my family drives me home. What is the point of making movies so loud I have to cover my ears?

Feels Like I'm Mourning Because I Realize I Live In A World That Wasn't Made For Womeone Like Me,"I've been spending more time thinking about how I'm autistic and didn't know most of my life, and doing more research to better understand my autism. 

I really miss how things were during the height of the pandemic. I live in a major city and I enjoyed working from home more often, less people outside and on public transit, etc... Everything felt less overwhelming for me, and now that things are pretty much back to normal, I feel overstimulated in public places more often. I am trying to learn ways to better manage this. I already wear noise canceling headphones pretty much everywhere, I wear loose fitting clothes to feel less fabric against my skin (and I'm picky about what I wear), and I recently bought a pair of sunglasses and a sun hat because sometimes the sun and other lights are too bright for me. I was on the verge of tears wearing the sunglasses yesterday because I felt immediately more calm, and I had no idea the bright lights made me so stressed out and I've been living like that for 27 years. My baseline stress level is likely much higher than NT people and I had no idea because this is all I've ever known. I'm trying to figure out other ways to feel less overwhelmed outside of the house now. 

As I've been thinking about this more though, I've talked to people in my life about me being autistic, and even people who know me and really care about me, they're supportive of me, but they don't understand. They are willing to do things to help me, like being okay with me turning off the lights because they're too bright, or fidgeting to calm myself down. But for everyone else, I explain it to them, and it's like in one ear and out the other. They say they're supportive, but when I ask for what I need to feel okay, I'm told that I need to, ""be flexible,"" and that, ""we all have to deal with things we don't like,"" without acknowledging that I already have to be very flexible to exist in a world where I feel like an alien. 

I want to do more to educate myself so I can better support myself and advocate for the autistic community more. I'm trying my best to be optimistic and focus on solutions, and I've been relying on God to help me through this emotionally difficult time (I'm a Christian). It's just difficult to accept that most people don't understand autism and don't want to learn anything beyond their limited understanding of it. And that it will be a battle to fight for more awareness and better accommodations for autistic people in the community. I already did a lot of education and advocacy work for the trans community because I'm a trans man and I know a lot of folks who are trans who I care about. I'm tired and I'm sick of life being an uphill battle just to have the same rights as everyone else, and to have an even laying field. I feel like I'm mourning the fact that being autistic had affected my whole life and I didn't know until like 3 years ago, and that if I want more awareness and better treatment I have to basically go into battle again. It feels so unfair. 

I'm not really asking for anything, I just wanted to get my feelings out here because I feel like this is the only community I know that will understand. I don't have any autistic friends irl and I don't know where I could meet some.",1
Burnt out on enjoying video games.,"For 8 years now I have been playing video games as my main source of entertainment. Gaming does something for me that movies and TV shows haven't really been able to achieve. I would say it's the immersion and flexibility of the stories in video games that I really like in comparison. 

Around 2021 though I got progressively more burnt out of videogames. This was around when I played through all campaigns of Halo: MCC on Heroic difficulty. I felt pretty good and played a bunch of multiplayer. I didn't really have anybody to play with on that game, so I got bored after a while (110 hours). I noticed afterwards though that I would spend more and more time on the library screen, scrolling through trying to figure out what would be a good game to play next. It got to a point where I got stressed by the scrolling and zoned out on Youtube. 

It wasn't all bad though, it gave me more opportunity to discover more hobbies and activities. I've been more social, I drew more art, and I recently discovered a love for directive writing. What bugs me nowadays though is that I would still have moments where I really wanted to play a game, but I would just scroll though and end up not playing anything. The only opportune times I played a video game was when my friends were playing a game on Steam or Roblox and I joined them for 1-3 hours. 

There's many reasons I have come up with too on why I'm so burnt out on games, not finding the right genre, not playing with the right groups, shying away from stranger players on MMOs. Those are some of the surface issues that I have with games, and it's not the lack of games that bother me, but rather I think it's an issue with really getting into the game that I'm playing. I've struggled recently to invest myself into a game, and it's caused me to close the game in the mid stages of a campaign or a storyline. 

Recently I tried playing RP and MMO games, but I notice that in those games I get really shy, even more so then in public, (it mostly stems from toxic players online). I also got hooked onto Dwarf Fortress for a bit, getting invested in it's complexity, but then I got bored of it too, unprompted and without reason. 

I'm hoping that I can find a spark sometime for games, I feel that it fulfills me emotionally and it sharpens my strategic, perceptive, and reflexive skill. If anyone here on this forum knows/feels gamer burnout too let me know, I'm still semi-fresh on my own super powers :) .",1
So I just found out yesterday that I'm considered fucking obese,"I'm currently a senior in high school, with very little friends and depression because I don't know how to talk to people normally, and I often embarass myself. So I basically spend most of my time inside my house because of that. I just went to the doctor yesterday, and they told me that according to my bmi I'm fucking obese. I don't think I look or feel obese so I was really really shocked and confused, and I had a huge panic attack when I got home. I have no idea what to fucking do now, I don't know how to lose weight and I don't have any motivation at all to do so. I feel so disgusting and sick rn and I don't know what to do",1
Update. My autism assessment sucked. Mainly just a huge vent post.,"TW: swearing, mentions of emotional abuse

I made a post awhile ago asking for advice about getting a diagnostic test. My main concern was my psychologists‚Äô bias. I was 100% correct.

My psychologist did not do the whole test. She only did the questionnaires, the IQ test, and the social interview. After the test, I discussed my experience with my boyfriend who has gotten an eval before, and he said she skipped MANY components.

She based most of her conclusions on my mother‚Äôs questionnaire. I have told my therapist that my mother is emotionally abusive and narcissistic for as long as I have been seeing her. I cried to her for help and she did NOTHING. And now, despite years of telling her not to trust my mother, she decides to base her entire diagnosis on my mother‚Äôs manipulative and biased questionnaire. However, even despite the manipulation, my mother‚Äôs questionnaire still had the flags. My mother said I don‚Äôt handle change well, i struggle to transition from one task to another, I only talk about the things I‚Äôm interested in and it‚Äôs very hard for me to talk about anything else, and I have a few narrow interests. But she chose to ignore all of that because I ‚Äúcommunicate so well‚Äù.

She threw out the questionnaire I filled out because I had ‚Äúconfirmation bias‚Äù.
Based on my IQ test, the social interview, and the questionnaires from my mother and teacher, I FIT THE CRITERIA FOR AUTISM. However, she said my social skills ‚Äúaren‚Äôt bad enough‚Äù. She compared me to her coworker, who she said is ‚Äúexactly like‚Äù me. She said verbatim, ‚ÄúI just wish you could talk to her, you would see, it‚Äôs just so different. You just communicate so well‚Äù. Having her A. Compare me to someone else saying I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot bad enough‚Äù and B. Talk down about someone because they‚Äôre autistic, was so fucking horrible. It took everything in me not to start sobbing.

The worst thing is, I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs my fault. I‚Äôve never spoken to her unmasked before. I haven‚Äôt spoken to my mother unmasked in at least 10 years. I‚Äôve never spoken to my teacher unmasked either. I‚Äôve been seeing therapists and counselors since I was 5, and I learned quickly how to act in a clinical setting. I unmasking with a therapist would be so fucking hard and so terrifying. I only unmask when I am alone or with my close friends. So I feel like her diagnosis is based on my mask, and it‚Äôs my fault.
Then there‚Äôs the part of me that thinks she‚Äôs right, and I do just have confirmation bias. So then I am back to where I started. I‚Äôm struggling. I can barely take care of myself, and I have no answers. All she told me was I‚Äôm a fucking genius, and I already knew that (honors student, 36 ACT, etc).  I‚Äôm just fucked up and I‚Äôll never know why.

If you read this far, thanks. I don‚Äôt even know anymore",1
Someone who gets me,"Showing someone a cool special interest I have, and sharing it with them is all I've ever wanted. But because of how rigid and linear I think, I fail to associate these people with the interests we share, and thus our friendships remain nothing more than acknowledgement of the fact that it sorta exists

I really never had that luxury with in-personal acquaintances, nor was it genuine with the people I met in online spaces up until fairly recently, when my circle of friends tallied itself into the sorry number of threes people.

Masking myself in front of my family isn't really tough, but oftentimes I see no reason to because in their misunderstanding, they will simply refer to my mannerisms as me being weird. Yet they will never truly get the full picture, so all but three complete strangers within my life only truly get me",1
My take on empathy and autism,"Some neurotypical people say that people with autism don't show empathy, and sometimes seem like disturbing psychopaths. As a person with autism, I think the argument can be understood that neurotypical people don't show empathy and seem like disturbing psychopaths. To be clear, I do not believe this in the slightest and am using a metaphor to better explain how autism does have empathy. Instead, my point is that both arguments are incredibly similar.

I can't speak for other people with autism, but personally, I experience empathy through having an intellectual understanding that someone is feeling an emotion. I think it's rather obvious, but if I don't know someone is feeling an emotion, I can't really feel empathy. It just doesn't make sense, and wouldn't be genuine anyway.  


I've heard some neurotypical people (who I am not suggesting in any way are representative of all neurotypical people, but are a large enough group to bother me) say that people with autism don't have empathy, and are cold in the face of people suffering. Specifically, I've seen the argument made multiple times that people with autism could watch someone suffer and just... not care.

&#x200B;

However, I can easily imagine some people with autism making nearly that exact argument against neurotypical people (which again, is not an argument I support, it just illustrates why the first is bad). The argument goes something like this: neurotypical people only show caring for those whose suffering they can see, and not for anyone else. Specifically, the argument would say that neurotypical people care more about the aesthetics of suffering than anyone's actual pain. There is evidence that could be presented for such a thing too. Check the amount of media coverage, legislative action, and concern whenever a massive, violent event happens and people are hurt or killed. However, anything that doesn't have that violent flair to it is often left forgotten even when it affects many more people. So neurotypical people (so says this hypothetical argument which is WRONG) would condemn people to pain and suffering because of aesthetics outside of these people's control.

&#x200B;

I obviously don't agree with that argument, neurotypical people DO have empathy (obviously), but I thought it would be interesting to share because it illustrates exactly why it's sister argument is wrong too. Autistic people (like me) DO have empathy, we just show and understand it different. It's precisely BEAUSE we care and want people to be happy, that some neurotypical people think we don't.

In one of my classes at school, we had a discussion about 9/11 which prompted me to feel rather horrified at how important the event is considered, and the rest of the class seemed put off that I suggested it is given too much weight. So I wanted to share my feelings about that here cause it is sorta bothering me. Like, numbers-wise, compare something like terrorism to something like overdoses or workplace injuries... just, wow...",1
My car being in the shop over the weekend is way more bothersome than I anticipated,I told my job I‚Äôd miss the first 3 days of the week and it turned into the whole week. I hate dealing with Lyft/Uber to get where I need to go and yesterday I left and everything then realized when I got to the worksite I don‚Äôt even have the proper shoes on. Then I tried to hurry and leave before anyone in my team saw me and had to call another ride to get home wasting my money and my time. I feel like not having my car is like losing part of my identity. I‚Äôm back to being that person without my own car and I hate that feeling.,1
I‚Äôm super overstimulated,"I was watching my phone then my stepdad came in and asked me to watch a movie but I said no then my dog was running around then my mom came in and hugged me but I hate hugs because I don‚Äôt like being touched and I‚Äôm trans so extra dysphoria then I brushed my teeth with my mom but she played a video of these puppies barking and scratching stuff really loud so I went in my room and tried to shake it out but then my ~lady parts~ moved and I got super dysphoric so I tried to get my phone but I lost it so then I was looking around and I found it so now I‚Äôm awkwardly hanging on the side of my bed with my stomach clenched and I‚Äôm super dirty and just feel gross so I‚Äôm writing this to get my mind off it but idk it‚Äôs just annoying 

Summary and question: I‚Äôm trans and got overstimulated so I tried to stim but it made me dysphoric and I want to know how to do stuff that won‚Äôt trigger me",1
Started a new job and no consistency is killing me,"Not sure if this is something that bothers other people but it stresses me to no end. Like every part of the facility does things differently, different call lights (Health care) different light switch locations, all the patients have different preferences and needs which I get is part of the field but it's so stressful to remember everything.",1
Do you guys also hate/have difficulty regards driving ?,"I hate to drive...I‚Äôve only had 2 practical lessons so far and I find driving to be one of the hardest things ever, you need such a good combination of motor skill, multitasking, quick thinking and calmness to do everything well but I lack all of those things ! 

I can never put the proper amount of pressure on the pedals and do the smooth movement ( btw I‚Äôm a big guy and the mechanical car that my driving school gives me is minuscule, the pedals are way too close for my big feet so it only makes it harder...), I always hit them in jerkily movements with blunt breaks, and always forget to follow the sequence of doing each thing one at a time because the car is moving and that makes me nervous.

The same goes for the car gear, i always forget to hit the pedals before moving them so most of the times I almost break the damn car.

The instructor also doesn‚Äôt help as he only says ‚Äúminus 2 points‚Äù, ‚Äúif this was the exam you would have been disapproved‚Äù, the pressure doesn‚Äôt help...I‚Äôm literally trying to navigate a 3.000 pounds vehicle, when I never did it before while being multitask and pretending that I have good motor skills, and trying to stay with the vehicle on my side of the street as the steering wheel is both sensitive and sturdy that I can almost never do it and you not only is putting unnecessary pressure on me but on day 2 you expect me to have learn how to perfectly manoeuvre it ?!",1
Laundry Anxiety,"I just put a load of laundry in the washer, and another person in the household stopped the washer and threw in my hoodie that was on top of it into the load. This is a graphic hoodie that's dear to me and I always turn it inside out when I wash it, and put it on gentle wash and gentle dry. The washer was full of an only jeans load in WARM water on quick wash (not gentle at all) that will mildew if dried on the very slow gentle setting. I'm having incredible anxiety now about this ruining my favorite hoodie.  


This person means well in most cases, but holy crap I'm getting so tired of living with someone who makes me feel like I can't relax in my own living place. Can't even leave my laundry in the laundry room unattended now. It doesn't make sense cause he's self-dx and should theoretically understand NOT to mess with other people's stuff.",1
This is totally F***ED up how teachers and a school can treat children with Disabilities. It makes my blood boil.,https://youtu.be/1bL_rNZa54Y,1
Psychiatrist doesn't want to rx stimulants for my ADHD because I'm autistic,"I finally mustered up the courage to ask my psych for an ADHD eval. I got the results yesterday.

I do, in fact, have ADHD (primarily inattentive type) but she said I scored way higher on the autism part of the test. I'm really not sure how I feel about a memory/focus test being used to diagnose autism? I'm not a medical professional but that just doesn't make sense to me. 

I also didn't realize I was being tested *for* autism. I thought I was just taking an ADHD assessment. I feel kind of violated about it? Not that I'm mad about being autistic (I have suspected for a while now) but I wasn't really interested in pursuing a diagnosis because

1. There's no ""treatment"" for it
2. I've heard you can be denied medical care for being of unsound mind or whatever

So yeah I'm kinda miffed that that's on my medical record now. I don't really need another reason for doctors to belittle me and talk to me like I'm stupid.

The other reason I'm upset is that my psychiatrist seems reluctant to prescribe stimulants to me because my ADHD ""isn't severe enough"" (compared to the autism I guess? idk) even though I've already expressed that I'm struggling with task initiation and follow through, as well as time blindness- which is all severely affecting my work.

She increased my Wellbutrin rx and said we'll meet again in 6 weeks to see how that's working. If there's no impovement, she'll add strattera. Hopefully things will improve, but I'm also worried that if they don't, she won't want to try a stimulant.

She very briefly mentioned some behavior therapy to ""help"" with the autism (and I mean very brief). I'm hoping it was more of a ""this is a thing that exists"" comment and not a ""this is a thing you should do"" comment, but I'm still wary. I don't really struggle with the ""classic"" neurotypical ideas of what an autistic person struggles with. And I also couldn't give less of a shit if people think I'm weird or hard to talk to (although I think the general consensus is that I'm funny and easy to get along with).

I like her as a psychiatrist, she has generally been very good at listening to me and letting me decide what kind of medication I need. I guess I'm just worried she's going to start treating me differently now because she knows I have autism.",1
Problematic Coworker,"So first off; I'm Self-Diagnosed Autistic, and actually diagnosed ADHD.  
I work at a local supermarket chain (I won't say the name of the company or what state I live in) and it prides itself on being an equal opportunity employer; which is certainly the case - been here for 9+ years and I've seen a wide variety of people come, go, move up or just happily stay in one position (I'm the last one) I'm just a bagger - lowest rung on the ladder; although I am treated as a sort of unofficial manager of the parking lot since I've been here so long, I'm reliable, and I'm firm enough and have decent enough social skills to train and keep an eye on the teenagers outside. But I have no real true authority - nor do I want it.  
We have a variety of people with different conditions; ADHD, Downs Syndrom, having a prosthetic leg, autistic, and people of varying ages from 14 year olds to people in there 60's-70's.  


So, I have one particular coworker who's been here for about 5-ish years. He's Autistic and has depression. He's also approximately my age; I'm 32, he's 31. I used to consider him a friend - we never hung outside work. But we have talked often, we share similar interests, and we were both art students at different points in our lives, ect. I honestly get how he thinks for the most part, and I see a lot of myself in him - athough; a younger version of myself. The way he thinks reminds me A LOT of myself when I was in my early to mid 20's in all the wrong ways. Claiming and thinking he's a noble white knight when he's really a hypocrite. Being very socially awkward. Over-correcting other people's behavior (he used to be a talle-tale early on)  
And the most frustrating of all to me; using his Autism diagnosis as a sort of shield when he does something wrong. He constantly late to work. He'll sneak off and hide out on his phone for long periods. He'd take advantage of other people's kindness or oversights. When he's confronted when he does something wrong; first thing out of his mouth is excuses. When he DOES apologize; it's half-hearted because he'll often go right around and do it again. Hell, a few months ago he tried hitting on another coworker who was 19 at the time. (it was a few weeks away from his 31'st birthday at the time) She told me how creeped out she was by that.  


The other frustrating element is that managment seems totally unwilling to do SOMETHING about his behavior. They just don't even bother reprimanding him at all. The Assistant Managers might say something about him being really late, but actual managment won't really do ANYTHING.  
I've tried talking to several of the managers for my department about being firm with him if they actually want him to actually do his job. But many of them behave that because he's Autistic he's TOTALLY incapable of his behavior being corrected. One HEAVILY IMPLIED that he thought he was too dumb to learn. When I KNOW DAMNED WELL that it DOES work because we had a manager 3 years ago who DID do something about his behavior and actually punished him by taking away his phone except when he went on break, and he had to stay in the checkout department; he couldn't work outside in the parking lot for several months. And it WORKED! His performance and attitude did improve back to a respectable level. He was no longer late, he didn't slack off or take the easy way out. And he stayed like this for more almost 2 years.  
But last year his performance and behavior was slipping right back to where he was right before he was at his worst.  
Honestly, I think if this company wasn't so forgiving, he would have been fired A LOOOOONG time ago. And I've even told him that since he told me he's going to be moving out of state later this year, and was going to be forced to live on his own.  


I've vented to other friends of mine; many of them being Neurodivergent in various ways. ADHD, Autism, ect. And they all side with me that my coworker is a spoiled brat in a grown man's body.  
But still, I wonder if I'm just being too harsh and/or that my standards are just too high. That I should just let it go - but it's difficult to do so when I've been working very closely with him for 5+ years. I DID consider him a friend for most of that time, but I had to put my foot down when he made more fake promises that he would do better. To me; it was a breach of trust and faith that he'd just take advantage of me many, MANY TIMES when I've been kind, understanding, forgiving despite me being firm with him when he's fucked up.  


Still, I feel like I'm being a total asshole because I can't/won't let it go. Sometimes I think maybe I'm just not understanding enough. That perhaps I should lighten up. That perhaps that me being only self-diagnosed autistic makes my judgement of his crappy behavior invalid. I don't think I have clinical depression, so maybe I'm just just not understanding him there.  


\*shrug\* I dunno anymore. Maybe you strangers and fellow Autistics on the internet can let me know if I'm just an asshole or not.",1
"Fictional/media depictions of autistic ""rudeness"" and why it's so offensive","I hate how media portrayals of autistic characters depict ""rudeness"" that is based on the assumption that we are deliberately and knowingly being rude because autism makes us uncaring. 

An example of a non-autistic character who is intentionally a dick is House. He is knowingly an asshole and has an excellent grasp of social skills that allow him to fine-tune his insults. However, this is portrayed as part of his personality and free choice, with some trauma and chronic pain mixed in. 

Tons of autistic or autistic ""drag"" characters (looking at you Sheldon fking Cooper) are portrayed as rude, but not because of the actual reasons that might cause an autistic person to unintentionally be rude. They're basically written as jerks who just dislike social conventions, rather than not understanding them. It's all part of this horrible mythos that we could be ""normal"" and we're choosing to act like this because we're assholess without empathy or desire for approval and human relationships.",1
DO NOT TOUCH ME UNLESS I GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO DO SO FFS,"Me: *walking to my room, which is right across from my sibling‚Äôs, after grabbing a drink*

I went from being one of the top3 most experienced new employees, ""no problem getting a raise and climbing the ranks"" to being literally useless, on the least important part of the line, being let off early 2 nights in a row. This was supposed to be my ticket to actually make good money and be able to support myself for ONCE in my fucking life. But im fucking inept apparently. 

He said he wasn't gonna fire me but funding obviously i vant get my funding job done right and im so fucking easily replaced. 

Im useless, im stupid, im a fucking annoyance, i hold up the entire fucking kitchen, and im good for nothing. 

I can't do anything right except make peiple think im worth more than dirt.

Im gonna get fired, like i have from every job I've ever had, im gonna get sick from stress and be bed ridden for 3 or more weeks, I'll loose my funding house and I'll make everyone one here homeless. Were funding screwed amd i can't even try to save us. I can't funding fix myself i can't hold down a job i actually like doing. I can't get food stamps i can't get disability and i can't ask for help from anyone for anything. 

I would be so ready to k^ll myself if i fucking could. But i can't leave my fiance without anyone. I dragged them across thw cou notary and i can't even keep them safe and secure. They're worse off than me and im so funding selfish *I* want to kill myself

Does anyone else hate customer service chats?,"I recognize that each customer service chat is required to use scripts, but it is so frustrating to have people run through the same responses they don't really apply to your situation.

I'm sick of seeing functioning labels!!,"In every freaking community I go in I kept seeing ""high functioning"" and ""low functioning"" every freaking time and it's really upsetting!

There's no such thing! We have didn't needs and supports! Yes, labels can be helpful sometimes but these are harmful! It makes people like me out to need way less support than we actually need or people like my friend out to need more support than they need. 

I'm frustrated because when I mention to someone new that I'm autistic they're ALLWAYS like ""Oh, you must be high functioning then, I couldn't tell."" Like, no Becky, I'm not ""high functioning"" I'm barely functioning.I'm constantly overstimulated, anxious I'm doing the whole interaction wrong because I can't freaking tell your body language apart from a rock, and frankly am forcing myself to not be non-verbal because I'm at work.

It's so damaging. Can we just not anymore!?",1
