"TW?? paranoia of course: afraid I’m being watched, thinking of being killed, suicidal & intrusive thoughts


I got really spooked by them and the first night was terrible. I was frozen in fear that someone was watching me in any dark corner of my room, watching my every move, waiting to kill me. That was three weeks ago. My sister has been kind enough to let me sleep in her room on the floor this entire time, but I still feel unsafe and scared. I feel like I’m seeing and hearing things that aren’t actually there. Not like hallucinations though, I don’t know how to describe it right now. 

Then I saw another tiktok on my fyp a few days ago (I don’t want to go into detail about what it was just for the sake of you all) and it genuinely screwed with my head even more than the first one. I cried for an hour on the floor panicking and my sister let me sleep on her bed for that night instead of on the floor and I calmed down a little. But this paranoia is still here. It wont leave. I’m having to force myself to stay up late even when really tired  to get to the point where I physically can’t keep my eyes open anymore and would fall asleep any minute so I can easily fall asleep without all these intrusive thoughts that someone is watching and waiting to k1ll me.. but at the same time, it’s painful to sleep because I’m so afraid I’m going to have nightmares about all of this. 

I haven’t had any paranoia before this really, but I do have GAD. But I’m assuming all of this is paranoia right?? I can’t get it out of my head and I’m worried I’m going to be like this forever now since it has been 3 weeks. People have said it’s normal to be spooked for a day or two by something, but for something to last this long and this intense there is probably a problem.. 
I don’t understand...we have a dog AND an alarm AND I’m in my sisters room. Why do I have to be like this? I feel so unsafe and it’s honestly to the point where I just want to kms so nothing has the chance to do it first. I already am suicidal as it is (but never would act on it) and this just makes it so much more intense I don’t know what to do. I just hope this is temporary, but is it possible that this literally just stemmed into my brain now and am going to be like this forever even though I’ve never had any previous experience with paranoia?..",5,paranoia
"I had a falling out recently with a group of friends. I was neither the protagonist/antagonist in the argument, but I chose to cut them all off after seeing their true colors and how they handled the situation. ever since then I’ve been extremely paranoid over the tiniest things. I will wake up and check all their social media making sure they aren’t talking badly about me, making negative posts about me, etc. I’ll check our mutual friends and see if they’re not talking bad about me together or if they’ve unfollowed me. I check every 30 minutes I’m awake during the day and it’s driving me insane. none of those friends have tried reaching out to me since I cut them off so it’s safe to assume they have chose to forget about me. I used to never care how other people view me and cutting people off was so easy for me. so why am I feeling this way and how do I stop?",5,paranoia
"Sadly I have been diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer. A 7cm adenocarcinoma tumor was found on my lower esophagus with spread to several local lymph nodes. Currently no other spread to other major organs. Confirmed with biopsy via endoscopy and CT scan.

My only symptom prior to the endoscopy was slight dysphagia. At the initial meeting with my health professional I was told this was most likely gastritis but recommended an endoscopy as a precaution.

A further PET scan also detected lights in my neck and under my tongue. Doctors are unsure if this is related to the same cancer or if I’ve been unlucky enough to also have a separate lymphoma cancer. More testing is required to confirm this.

Needless to say I’m absolutely devastated. The doctor has told me this is not curable but I may be able to prolong my life with chemotherapy.

Before I can start chemo, I am waiting for biopsy results from the potential lymphoma in my neck. This may take a few weeks before being confirmed, then I can start the right treatment for me.

If anyone has any advice for me that would be much appreciated. My family still think there is a chance I can reverse/survive this but from reading online I have severe doubts about this.",0,negative_samples

"One month into stimulants and I just became accutely aware of my true nature. ADHD was completely blocking me from accepting innate parts of my personality. My memory could not hold enough information to gain perspective.

 I laid in bed, and a clear visualisation of my childhood ran in my mind. I grabbed my journal and started recording the sequence. I pushed as far back as I could , at my first signs of impulse management. My mother would never correct any impulses. Hmmmm I kept going through insane acts of unrestrained impulsivity and nope, no corrections. I then got a sense of my emotions at the time, something completely missing from memory before stimulants and focussing on my past. A sense of being ""special"", but this sense was felt with my newer higher order functions, more access to understand emotion.....

It hit me right there and then. Like nothing has ever hit me before. I wrote the words..... Is this narcissistic personality disorder?

My mind went blank...... Memories loaded fast and hard. I started tingling all over my body and just held back my emotions from exploding. It was impossible to miss now. Everything fell in place. My grandmother was queen narcissistic, my mother was a victim and unfortunately was unaware of her inability to love me normally. Raising me with ADHD, and dysfunctional parenting style left me with personality defects that would go on to a highly dysfunctional adult life. For all three, Grandmother, Mother and Son.

In one evening, every single moment in my life made more sense then ever before. Previous diagnosis of NPD a decade before I could never accept. Not until the ADHD was treated could I access enough emotional intelligence to remember my life. I believe I was hiding myself from this trauma. It's not easy to see. 

Its been a really big few weeks. My wife is really not surprised, and Im so lucky my strange broken way of loving a person has been compatible. Now with ADHD treated, I can make an effort to be adaptive. My maladaptions will never totally disappear but it's a relief to start a new journey, where I can minimise harm on others through awareness.

"So I'm currently experiencing autistic burnout. I feel like giving up trying to explain it to people, communication deficits make it too hard to articulate.

People get mad at me every time I try to explain myself. I don't go into great detail but I think I give enough information to give them a fair idea.
How tf do I tell people I literally cant handle that amount of constant pressure to perform in a socially acceptable way, showing  proper empathy, while maintaining the correct tone of voice or the appropriate amount of eye contact. How do I communicate this without them getting mad or hurt that I have to mask or that I can no longer hold the mask. 

And then constantly being misunderstood or having my motives misrepresented because I speak too formally so it doesn't sound empathetic enough. And when you say you can't deal with it and need to retreat, people assume its because you're an AH but really its because you're barely holding it together yourself. But then if you tell them this, you have to make yourself vulnerable and expose things that you don't want other people to see. Because of course they need you to quantify why or how you're struggling with something so they can validate it. It just makes me resent everyone so much but most of all myself.

Tldr: I lost a life long best friend recently because they couldn't get over the fact that I mask with them.

So I’ve been severely depress before but it all kind of faded away when I started realizing how stupid it felt for me to hold my own self back from living life. I’ve hurt myself before but only when I was really low in life. But I’ve been fine for almost a year and then all of a sudden after reading a chapter in a book about abuse I felt like I was dying and couldn’t breathe and then passed out and my blood pressure dropped pretty low. Ever since all I can think about is hurting my self again. I don’t feel depressed like how I was before I feel fine and only sometimes feel like my body is not my own. But these thoughts about mutilating myself and doing awful things to myself are in my mind on loop. It was especially intensified after I started talking to this guy I really like. Thoughts like committing suicide together and or being hurt by him or vise versus roam my head. I don’t know how to feel or what to do about these thoughts. I just think them but I don’t think anything of it until recently. Now I feel like I might actually try something. But I’m not scared. Maybe it’s because I’ve hurt myself already and I remember the burning I felt. Maybe I’m just crazy.

"Struggling to live normally in my own home

(Long a** read) - anxiety and paranoia.

Hi all, 

TLDR; anxious and paranoid  about neighbours listening to everything I do. So I live in complete silence and it’s driving me insane. Help!

_____________

I moved into an apartment a few years ago. And when I first moved in I felt great. I played music a lot and everything else no problem. My neighbours were also a lot noisier, like I could hear my next door neighbours TV, general chatter. It was really nice and homely. 

Anyway, I went through a rough patch and started drinking heavily, during which time I would go on rants & argue with people.. i was very loud & obnoxious. I also fell out with a few of my neighbours, because I was blasting music until early hours and just being an all around prick really. Once I quit drinking I managed to make up with everyone expect my next door neighbour. Deep down I’m also embarrassed how I was when I was drinking, and I genuinely think some of my neighbours want to listen in on me for entertainment now & probably didn’t realise I was going through some BS and drinking. 

My issue is that when I do anything I feel like people are listening in, and it’s like people stop what they’re doing. The only time I hear “normal” neighbour sounds is when they don’t realise I’m at home. I’ve been living so quietly that my downstairs neighbour commented to me “oh you’re alive then” sometime last year.. a few months back he mentioned that he can’t hear anything, but just my footsteps.. and now I’ve resulted to learning how to step silently and placing thick cloth or thick material on where my main walking paths are in the house so I can walk silently. 


Some more examples: 

* I have a loud mechanical typing keyboard, which sounds similar to tapping — and my neighbours aren’t too young, 50+ mainly and I’m 28,— & multiple times I’ve heard people tapping back. Not just one tap. But  consecutively, mimicking me typing. I don’t think they realise it a a keyboard. I’ve resulted to learning how to type without noise and placing a foam pad under my keyboard. I’ve not heard the tapping since. Another example is when I was using a normal computer mouse with a loud click. I would hear a neighbour flicking things on and off asif mimicking me. I’ve resulted to getting a silence mouse — now I never hear that.   

* when I want to use my oven or washing machine which both slam into their latch, I hear someone slamming back. 

The one strange thing is, when someone else is with me none of this happens, and actually when other people are here my anxiety completely goes. 

My only remedy is putting my washing mashing on a long wash, or leaving my heating on which makes listening through the walls nearly impossible and masks my noise. The only issue with the heating is, when it’s pressure is low and on a timer, where it turns on and off frequently it sounds like a tap turning on and off —  one of my neighbours started copying it.. until a few days ago where i was speaking to a neighbour and I told him I always have my heating on, he looked a bit puzzle and now I never hear someone copying it. Another remedy was leaving my kitchen fan on, but the noise was unbearable. 



I’m unable to cook, clean or socialise. I can’t watch TV out loud or have conversations on the phone. Im also a music recording artist, and I cannot record my vocals. It’s driving me insane. Im struggling on a incomprehensible level. This is holding me back, and I feel like I’m trapped when I’m at home. I can’t ask my neighbours if they’re listening to me because no one would admit to that. Today, I was playing music, heard taps on the wall asif someone is listening and it resulted in me playing my music lower and lower until it was all the way down and I snuck into my room silently to lay on my bed in silence & write this reddit post. 

I have told my doctor about this but he doesn’t really understand, and it’s something that sounds so ridiculous it’s hard for me to convey & express. I’ve told my parents. my mum just thinks  I’m scared of someone & doesn’t understand.  some friends know, but they can’t grasp the idea of someone suffering with this so can’t relate or give advice.  The response is usually them telling me how good their neighbours are. I am currently taking anxiety and depression medication partly as a result of this anxiety I have at home . But the medication is becoming less affective as time goes on & all my doctors wants to do is increase the dose and call it a day. I don’t hear voices or sign in my head, I’m not schizophrenic or anything else. 



Help 😔!

Edit — also times I feel like I can’t even breath or chew on food. This isn’t an issue that I struggle with anywhere else, though I do have social anxiety which can be really bad or non existent depending on my extent of depression. Also, if I’m wearing headphone then the anxiety and paranoia just goes away",5,paranoia
"I work in an office and I’ve gotten many comments about things I could be doing better, all of which relate to me being autistic. 

For example: I was told that my emails were “too impersonal” and then they were “too informal”. So I’ve been using ChatGPT to write them for the most part and just not giving a damn about whether it sounds like a robot did it because I obviously can’t understand how to do it right. The little greeting phrases like “I hope this email finds you well” that it puts in are really what I think people want from me. Writing those on my own is absolutely grating and I don’t know why. I just really don’t like it and it feels disingenuous and unnecessary.

Another thing is talking to people. I have customer service mode where I can function comfortably and get people to where they need to go in a way that they’re none the wiser, but people come in and try making small talk with me a lot. I hate it so much. I don’t know what to say and it’s so awkward. I use scripting a lot and sometimes it doesn’t match up and I feel like a doofus. 

Also, the fact that everyone lies a lot. Not about anything I care about, but things that are apparently just social facts, I guess? Like, they expect you to claim to be and look busy even when you aren’t. If you offer to help with work because you have nothing to do, you’re looked down on for having nothing to do. When I first got my job, my supervisor would come up to me and say things like “it’s really getting busy now, huh?” And I’d say “not really”. 

And that would get me in trouble, even if I asked everyone in the office to give me some work. “The last person in your job didn’t have a problem keeping busy”. Well, either they were much slower than me or they were lying just like everyone else here is.

I just don’t know how to be normal😩",1,autism

"A story set in the 1980s’ Ireland of an English nurse to take care of an Irish child or more.

This book really brought me out of my Reader’s block so kudos for that. It’s more of a psychological thriller with the elements of Christianity/Spiritualism entwined. Really loved the way how the Author has put the book together despite the climax was a bit of a meh to me. The book starts off slow and keeps you intrigued till the end. >!Will the child die or not?!< It kept me hooked that I finished it within two days (a big deal because of this long readers block I’ve been having). 

The tension between the English nurse and the Irish is another intriguing aspect of the book. Despite the English nurse (or nurses in general) who should be specialized in sympathy deters from it when it comes to the Irish people. The way she is apathetic towards the Irish and condescension towards their beliefs and virtues is wrote well that you as a reader feel furious at her prejudice towards them. The more you read the more her character develops but later onwards you  are more inclined to believe that her way of treatment towards them is right (Don’t wanna spoil why). 

This story is based on some real life incidents that took place in Ireland during that period where >!overtly religious people going into the delirium that they can survive without food for God’s sake.!<This isn’t like any other thrillers where you’d have twists that will make you gape your mouth but moreover like not twists but revelations of what happened/happens.

i've had severe misophonia since the age of 6 (severe as in i wear ear defenders almost always, i can't eat near my family whatsoever, if someone is chewing gum i have to put on ear defenders and loudly chew to myself, if no ear defenders are available i will genuinely go into a screaming and sobbing tantrum like a toddler who was just told they can't buy something) and it has affected almost every part of my life. my mom always found it stupid, my nan accepts it as a thing that i have which i'm thankful for. 

i swear my mom used to purposely chew and smack her lips way louder and kore frequently than normal if she was mad at me. she always made me sit in the room with her to eat with no ear defenders (yes, i cried every time. no, she didn't care, she told me to stop being dramatic a lot. no, she's not in my life anymore, and my nan is okay with me eating alone) and i swear every time she was upset with me she would purposely trigger me because she wanted 'revenge' and the only way to properly upset me was by triggering the disorder that disables me the most. 

i was talking to my nan a few minutes ago. another trigger for my misophonia is sniffing. i can't explain it but i can't explain any of the triggers. she seemed a bit annoyed with me and i swear she was just loudly sniffing for the entire conversation. 

i don't know what to do. i don't want to ask my nan if she's doing it on purpose because she'll say no.",5,paranoia
"Does it feel to you that depression hits way harder when you're physically tired? 

I mean, not in physical pain, that would be an obvious guarantee. Just being depressed and physically tired, like feeling weak legs/weak body, or when you sleep less than you normally do, even an hour less than the normal...sure it does feels bad in the body, but that in my mind it's a guaranteed boost and entrance to a big fckng hell",2,depression

"Bien. Posiblemente ni un alma lea esto pero bueno, creo que ayudara a desahogarme y sentir algo.

Siento que estoy roto, no tengo metas. No tengo nada que esperar de esta vida más que humillaciones.

Esta tortura comenzó en 3ro de primaria. Yo era bastante sensible y a mis compañeros les gustaba jugar con eso, solían golpearme y llamarme ""bebe llorón"" o simplemente ""perdedor"". En ese tiempo solo contaba con una amiga, yo la apreciaba mucho y quería hasta que descubrí que solo me hablaba por pena y para contar mis secretos con otros compañeros y así burlarse de mi. Eso me destruyo. Mis esperanzas en este mundo se terminaban, a mi corta edad ya pensaba en tirarme de un maldito puente y olvidarme de todo, volver a nacer en otro lugar y no tener este cuerpo sensible de mierda, no ser yo.

Comencé a alejarme de las personas, comencé a ser solitario hasta que me aburrí, quería contarle mis ideas a alguien. Quería tener amigos. Ahí conocí el internet, me enganche al instante, el hecho de que podía hacer un montón de cosas sin salir de mi cuarto o moverme me fascinaba pero aun  no me sentía satisfecho. No me siento satisfecho.

Los amigos que llegue a tener en el internet no eran suficientes así que lo deje. Trate de volver a la realidad y activarme un poco, eso paso el 18 de Marzo en 2021 pero ""OH SORPRESA"" mis piernas no funcionan, mi cuerpo no funciona. Tan solo estirar mi cuerpo me duele, y mucho, no aguanto ni dar 10 pasos para caerme rendido. Al inicio no le di importancia pero a los pocos días comenzó a darme una obsesión con el tema, probaba dar unos pasos y descansar para seguir caminando pero no funcionaba, tenia miedo, aun más por no tener a quien contarle.

Decidí olvidarme del tema y seguir viviendo por el internet pero ya no era lo mismo, saber que mi cuerpo no estaba funcionando bien me puso paranoico y ansioso. Mis horas de pasar jugando videojuegos pasaron a revisar paginas medicas, buscando que me pasaba. Lo más parecido que encontré fue un ""tendón inflamado"", no estoy seguro si es esto pero me esta matando.

Al volver a clases. No pude comunicarme con mis compañeros, ellos trataban de hablar y conversar conmigo pero yo sentía un nudo en la garganta, algo no me deja hablar. Siento que algo me obliga a no juntarme con nadie, que algo trata de hacer lo posible para que no me mueva del ordenador. Siento que algo me mira. No sé si ya estoy loco o si es mi paranoia quien me hace creer esto. Siento que esta detrás mío, escondido en la profunda oscuridad de mi cuarto, puedo ver algo correr de un lado a otro, puedo escuchar algo ahí atrás, algo llamándome, algo pidiendo que termine este sufrir. Tengo miedo de levantarme, quitarme los audífonos y verlo detrás de mi, observándome. Quiero pensar que estoy loco. Quiero creerlo. Quiero creer que solo creo que hay algo persiguiéndome por esta maldita soledad y el vacío que siento en mi. Quiero pensar que mi padre esta afuera tratando de entrar, que trata de sacarme de este infierno. Quiero sentir el calor de un abrazo y que me digan que todo esta bien, que solo fue una pesadilla y que tengo muchos amigos esperándome para hablar y hacer locuras juntos pero no, estoy solo, solo con mi oscuridad y con este sentir de que algo me persigue.

Quiero salir de esto, aun si la muerte es necesaria.

Perdón si fui muy críptico pero necesitaba desahogarme y si alguien puede ayudarme, por favor... AYUDA.",5,paranoia
"I am a 20 year old female struggling with GAD. I experience nausea almost constantly and extreme nausea between the hours of 3am-8am. I usually wake up from my sleep w straight adrenaline in veins. my chest feels like a giant room before i even have the chance to open my eyes. this along with my GERD stomach movements in the morning cause me to feel nauseous, which in turn makes me anxious cause i have a terrible fear of puking. i also get the shakes, sweats, hot flashes, etc and it causes me to miss school and work and other obligations. I’ve been in therapy and just the other day finally caved and got prescribed a VERY strong antidepressant from a doctor who has given me no other options. if anyone has advice on how to cope with my type of anxiety if they may have experienced something similar, i have found that xanax really help as i only really have attacks in the morning so as needed seemed like the route for me but my doc is against it. if anyone has advice or tips please let me know!",4,anxiety
"I've been married for over a decade to the love of my life, but I believe she has a problem with paranoia and I worry it's going to destroy our marriage.  She always feels like people are criticising her, insulting her, judging her negatively, etc.  If someone says something completely innocent, she'll read a lot of unspoken, negative meaning into it and often times either cut them out of her life or lash out in anger at them.  Every time we've visited my family, she's gotten upset over something totally innocent -- someone having a certain expression on their face, or watching too much TV, etc -- and she'll be convinced that it's somehow a personal slight against her and demand we leave early.  I'd say about 40% of the time that she goes out to e.g. pick the kids up from school, she comes back all pissed off at some random person because of the way they exhaled or failed to greet her and she's sure it's an intentional slight.  She can't go to buffet restaurants because she feels the owners are watching how much food she takes.  If someone tells her something, she believes there's a whole mountain of hidden meaning behind it, which is always negative toward her, and this causes her to behave angrily toward them.  Years ago, she agreed to go to therapy (not for this, but because of depression) but only went for one session because she believed the therapist insulted her.  

None of it ever makes sense to me.  I try to discuss it with her and she's never able to rationally provide any evidence for how she feels, but she is 100% certain of her perception.  It enrages her when I am not ""on her side"".  Every time I bring this up because I am concerned about her, it leads to the hugest arguments where she talks about leaving me.  In our marriage, it's basically the only thing we argue about.  Her father is the same, and she often complains about it, but she is unable to see the same behavior in herself. 

She has other issues which, best I can tell, often accompany this.  Trouble sleeping.  Anger problems.  She had a bad childhood.  These issues with paranoia get worse when she's under stress.  

I feel bad about the drama this causes, the relationships it hurts, the things it prevents her from doing.  Mostly I feel bad that this problem robs her of the happiness she deserves in life.  And I'm scared that one day she really will leave me for not ""supporting her"" by playing along with these false perceptions. 

If I explain that I've done a lot of reading online and that the way she behaves is a common thing people experience and seek help for, she'll react badly.  Broaching this subject in any way that proceeds from the assumption that she has a problem and that her perceptions of persecution don't make perfect sense will just result in a blow-up; the same blow-up that we've been having on a regular basis for years.  I don't know where to go from here.",5,paranoia
"Is it time to give up?, a thought ive had since age 6. Is it time to give up and jump into the street or similar methods. im too poor to afford quality therapy and all the places ive been too near me have been wildly ineffective in treating my ASD level 2, ADHD, OCD and Medication resistant MPD. Im probably gonna end it soon, im entirely unfixable unless i become rich enough to afford real therapy. My entire life has been a terrible Cycle of emptiness, neglect and loneliness. I grew up in a extremely poverty struck home with a emotionally wrecked and distant single mother. ive
been through everything from intense health issues to emotional issues
and ive decided life isnt worth it anymore, im an unfixable broken toy
and my circumstances are unfixable as well. when your poor and disabled
in california your given an insurance called medical. its horrible and
useless. your a second class citizen to doctors and hospitals. especially mental health. heres my detailed my 4 experiences that made me come to the conclusion of i wanna die soon. 

My first stint of therapy was at Choc Childrens in socal, from ages 5-8 is when i started to become extremely depressed, isolated, lonely and suicidal. the gap between social and intellegence bassed development which was later to be found
out caused by my autism was getting noticable. the reason i wasnt diagnosed till 3 years ago was beacuse i was racially profiled by my GP who said all my issues were because of my i tensive seizures as a kid and that because im black i couldn't have autism ot similar learning disability. i had said i wanted
to commit suicide to a teacher in 2nd grade and i was forcibly made to see a childrens therapy place in my area of South socal. the place was terrible. i was treated like a second class citizen and discrimated for me being poor and a half black mix. i was never treated properly and was passed around by multiple therapist who just played stupid board games with me.i hated it. nobody really cared they just babysat me for a paycheck. this is around the age when i began to develop extreme nihilistic ideas from reading books and watching internet content. Nihilism explained my existence it gave it reason, my entire life is suffering. I have nothing and will always be poor. in my early life i had a shit ton of health issues like seizures and breathing issues. this created an even larger social and Self suffering divide. i was divided and pitied socially like a kicked dog. I was never able to be ""friends"" everyone thought id give them seizures since i had experiance one in 3rd grade in class due to my epilepsy and extreme stress which come to find out are autism related. My life hasnt improved at all since i was younger and has continued to snowball so 8 year old me turned out to be correct. 

Elementary public School Psychologist - from ages 9-12 i kept myself closed off from others. My inability to make friends continued and i became even more depressed and nihilistic. spending hours reading philosophy books trying to figure out why im forced to suffer this terrible existence. which eventually led to buddhist ideas and to this day i've never found an answer on why my life sucks and i was cursed to suffer. in California schools your required to do mental health checks yearly and i answered truthfully on mine was forced to do multiple appointments with the school psychologist. she was terrible, just another worthless shrink that made me fill out paperwork for her and i
was never actually cared for or treated. just fill out this questionnaire and ill give you SSRIS that are complete BS and dont work for you at all. my social life became even harder the older i got. i drifted so far away from my age group in terms of interests and social skills i became an outcast. The ""weird fat kid"". Ive continued to worsen as i age in terms of physical and mental health. 

western youth services - at age 13 i was forced to go to a place called
WYS after my first major suicide attempt. i was referred there since
they were the closest place to me that took medical, boy was that terrible. they somehow where even worse then my previous two experiences combined. Terrible unresponsive psychologists, terrible therapists and they actively emotionally abused me. they gave me more ineffective drugs and treated me like a nuisance rather than a patient. most psychologists just gave me SSRI'S and told me to fuck off. nobody cared
for me, my family didnt and neither did the shitty workers. my depression became even worse and i began to develop violent thoughs of revenge and bitterness began to develop in me. mI wanted to kill my family for neglecting me, i wanted to kill my bullies for making fun of me and i wanted to kill my psychiatrists for not listening to me. i became even more nihilistic and had began to Self harm more extremely 

After that stint i was out of therapy for 2 years, i had only one attempt and my nihilism worsened. I was socially ridiculed more than ever now as i reached junior high. this when i noticed major declines and more bullying. Between stint 3 and 4 in late 2021  after a i had a hard head injury i was seen by a neuropsychologist that diagnosed me with autism,ADHD, OCD, and MDP and advised me to see a Therapist and psychiatrist. she was incredibly surprised i wasnt diagnosed with autism before. she said after talking with me for 10 minutes she knew. She was astounded nobody noticed till now. Its kinda hilarious guess racial discrimination and all that really does exist when it comes to autism in black men. Previously between 3 and 4 and the autism diagnosis i wanted to re enter therapy and was subsequently put on a 2 year waitlist between late 2019 and early 2022. In mid 2022 i began my 4th stint back at choc

choc stint 2- from age 14-16 i i was placed on a two year wait list to receive treatment after my 3rd suicide attempt in 2019. 2 years passed then COVID hit then it got extended to another couple months even though i had another attempt in the mean time. A TOTAL OF ALMOST 3 YEARS TO RECEIVE GARBAGE TREATMENT. i was treated like trash by choc again. i started back with them in mid 2022 and its been terrible. the therapist was a step up and my best to date but the Psychiatrist was terrible. Dr ngyuen fucking sucks, how can you take pride in your self as a dr when you actively miss appointments and flake on patients a bunch. Hes no showed us 8 FUCKING DIFFERENT TIMES. since ofc hes a telehealth only dr, but thats not all oh nooo he was fucking garbage at treating anything. he gave me 10 different SSRI/SNRI/SDRI combinations all to do fucking nothing since im medicine resistant and we told him that from the start. hes also completely worthless in terms of treating ADHD as its one of my biggest struggles and is actively ruining my life. his treatment plan is the exact opppsoite of what your supposed to do for ADHD. hes insistent on treating my depression first which basically means ""heres a new SSRI go away"" each session. hes also shown some very racist and discriminatory actions towards me. im refused adderall because i have an ""addiction risk:"" due to my socioeconomic status and my race. This recent stint has solidified in my mind that my only relief is death. i have no other option. this place was my last one that my insurance covered.

I bet nobody read all of this, but i just wanted to rant today. My psychiatrist flaked on our appointment today and i needed to get this out. i have no hope for my life and actively want to end it soon. lk the whole ""its so over meme"" but my life feels like it literally is unless i
win the lottery. Im too poor to afford anyway out of my living hell and
i cant work.i have no options. i have no other therapy options or ways to fix my mental or health disabilities. I just need to end it now",1,autism

"I've had very strong paranoia ever since I can remember. I used to be unable to sleep without my mum in the same bed because I was too afraid of ghosts. Sometimes I couldn't sleep even with her lying next to me.
I also sometimes get extremely paranoid when I wash my face that when I look up there will be someone behind me. This happened to me earlier this evening actually. 
Anything related to ghosts can make this paranoia worse. 
It's gotten slightly better as I've gotten older, but sometimes I still get the same fear and can't close my eyes at all, despite how tired or sleepy I might be. 
Location plays a big role in this, for example, in my home I generally don't have problems with this anymore, but I still am extremely paranoid when I'm staying at my mum's childhood home.

"When I first really looked into the possibility of having autism and taking it seriously, I was told to come here to find like minded people. By the time I got diagnosis I was in the peak neurotypical people don't understand us phase. I was in the phase thinking autistic people are intrinsically different, unique.

But then I came on here and did my own research. 

The next part comes on day one of the release of openai chat bot, the 3rd version. Within hours I was able to jailbreak it and make it make copies of itself. With all its copies I made it run a simulation 100,000 times about autism. It's results came out that there is a high correlation with a specific gene expression and in culture of low technology.

To me then I started to really understand maybe, just maybe, autism was needed in a hunter and gather society. For survival, the heightened sense of perception, and pattern recognition that gave us an edge when it came to surviving in that environment.

Then I started to think about the implications of neurotypicals. How the gene expression for being neurotypical is most likely associated with high levels of technology, or complex logistic chains, and or high society. NT's are able to go to work like hive minds and they for the most part can sustain this type of life style. Because if history has shown anything, civilization is always built on the back bone of slave labor, indentured servants, or cheap labor. Work that has to be done to keep the cogs of society running.

So then I wondered if there really is a difference between NT's and ND's. That at the end of the day, it just comes down to different gene expressions for different purposes. 

But I come back to this reddit.

&#x200B;

People have identified with autism so much that as it stands right now, it's become outside of what it is. It's become this unspoken institution justifying it's own existence through validation of mob mentality. That like any other religion, people will convey emotions of distress on here over the over expression of autism. That people will ask questions for confirmation biases, instead of falling back onto reason and logic. That in this age of political correctness and inclusiveness, to question the overreach of that culture that's become of autism is to be labeled a heretic, an ableist.

So I don't see a fundamental difference between autistics and NT's like I used to. It seems like humans in general are keen to mob mentality, to over culturing a matter of fact into this self confirming bias that we create an informal religion out of. That anyone questioning that paradigm is a heretic. That the evils done to us by the NT's, the discrimination, is done back to others that do no blindly accept the accepted paradigm. We all think there are external enemies that we need to conquer. That in our strife to create a better world for our problems, we become the civilizing heroes. But it's a trick played to us by our primitive minds in believing that we are morally superior than the other side. But there is no other side. It's just us against us. It's the masses of blind men bowing their heads down without questioning why they're bowing in the first place.",1,autism

I'm currently taking Cortiment budesonidedo for an ulcerative colitis flare-up. My nurse recommended it as an alternative to Prednisone, which I was concerned about taking due to side effects I've had in the past.

However, I've read conflicting information online about whether Cortiment should be taken with food or on an empty stomach. Have had issues with sleep for 20 years so this is why I'm asking. 

Can anyone who has experience taking Cortiment share their advice on whether it can be taken on an empty stomach?

"Hi,

I wanted to read an account of Arthurian myths that is at once relatively brief, that didn't stray much from traditional accounts and that was suitable a ""modern day"" sensibilities; by the latter I mean  mostly that its characters had psychological depth to them, and not two-dimensional cardboardy ones.So I picked up Steinbeck's ***The Acts of King Arthur & his Noble Knights*** because 1) it was an abridged retelling of sir Thomas Malory's ***La morte d'Arthur*** (arguably the ""ultimate"" account of Arthur's life and adventures), 2) it was written by a Nobel Prize winner, so I assumed it would be a carefully and beautifully crafted prose and 3) I was ""promised"" a certain psychological depth by the Wikipedia article on the book.

So far none of my expectations was fulfilled. I've read the entire first part of it and I've found it to be pure exposition, with non-existent character development. Completely unsuitable for a modern day reader. For example >!lady Igraine just accepts the fact that she was raped and impregnated by Uther Pendragon disguised as her husband, while her actual espouse was being killed in battle by her rapists's armies. This was the same woman that urged her husband the duke of Cornwall to flee from Uther's court because she suspected him to lust after her and attempt some sketchy shit. So she was raped, impregnated and a made widow on the same day, and she just marries the perpetrator immediately after, like no big deal. I'm not narratively bothered by all this. This makes no human sense for modern day writers but misogynistic narratives of this kind were the norm and very much taken for granted back in the day. The thing is that, misogyny aside, it doesn't even makes sense for the character of Igraine. Like even if she accepted to marry her rapist and husband murderer, even if she accepted to bear his child, both very plausible in ancient times, why would would she not place any objections or show any reluctance after urging her first husband for both to flee from Uther's lust.!<  Likethat shit is the exact opposite of ""exploring the the psychological underpinning of the events"" that Wikipedia promised me. And I'm not being just ""woke for woke's sake"". I can deal with problematic or outright unethical stuff in fiction, but I would've hope Steinbeck would care to address and attempt to give some insight on her thoughts on the whole thing, if anything just to give consistency to an arguably important character.

Anyway, if the entire book it's gonna be like this, I'd much rather read ***La morte d'Arthur*** or any modern retelling of the Matter of Britain.**So my question is: Does it get better as it goes or will it keep sucking ass?**

"My mind is focused that the voices in my head are my apartment neighbors using some weird electronic devices to speak to me in my head.

I’m VERY slowly accepting that it’s impossible to do that, but I wish there was something I could think that can push me to the right direction.

I am fully aware that it’s impossible to use any device to hear what I’m thinking and to put their voices in my head… but theres something in me that wants to think maybe they’re in the military and have access to classified devices to do this. Something is just stuck in my head where I can’t let it go that it’s plausible to happen but %0.001 likely to happen.

Any advice with pushing me into that direction?",6,schizophrenia

"I’m 22 and was diagnosed with Type 1 last year. The T1D diagnosis (as opposed to Type 2) was based on testing positive for GAD65 and Znt8, and my BMI of 23 (in healthy range). However, my C peptide levels were on the low end of normal, 0.85. 

I seemed to require a lot of insulin relative to my bodyweight the first year. I was taking about 28 units of basal and 12-15 bolus per day in order to stay in range. 

I started taking Ozempic two weeks ago and everything has changed. I have lost 6 pounds but the bigger effect has been on my insulin needs. I no longer need insulin most days. Every other day or so i’ll take a couple units of Humalog for a high carb meal. That’s it. If i took basal, I’d go low. I stay between 70 and 140 all day even after meals.

I know it would be impossible for a true type 1 diabetic to not need insulin anymore just because of GLP meds like ozempic. Sooo what does this mean for me? 

Both types of diabetes run in my family and i’ve always been suspicious that i either had type 2 (i used to be overweight which may have contributed ?) or that i have a combination of some sort.

"Our toddler recently had an anaphylactic response to her skin scratch test - nuts suspected were pecans, walnuts, pistachios, and pine nuts.  Also reacted to beef and Timothy grass.  Delayed reaction to wheat, milk, a couple other things.  We did IGE tests and the only positive from her blood work was milk.  In the past she had a full body hive reaction with swollen lips and coughing that we tied back to pecan exposure.  

Fast forward to this weekend, we are out of town for a wedding staying on site at a horse ranch.  First night we were ok, but within five minutes or so of leaving the cabin and walking to our car, hives were spreading.  They kept spreading until they were full body.  Within half an hour, her eyes and lips were itching and very slightly swelling.  No breathing issues.  We were close to the local ER, so we dosed with Xyzal and waited. Reaction stopped spreading but took a while to calm.  About eight hours later, she still has some flat red spots.  She had not ingested anything this morning prior to the reaction, but I talked to the property owner and the property is covered in pecan trees.  They are not common where we are from, but this is still scaring me.  How bad is this if walking past them when it is not a big flowering season is causing a big reaction?",0,negative_samples
"What the title says. I love learning. I like science and geography and I'm obsessed with history. I love textbooks and documentaries, taking notes and writing essays and always having facts to tell people. I don't mind sounding like a nerd - I really, really like learning. But that's why it makes me so sad and frustrated and angry that I failed school. I officially dropped out about a year ago but I haven't attended since S3 (9th grade). I hate that my school ruined my education. I'm so smart and I'm capable and I really WANTED to learn, but they refused to accommodate me or listen to me or treat me like a human being and now I'm fucked with no qualifications and no idea what to do with my life. I don't know if it's wrong to blame them, but I tried my best - like really, really tried - and they shot me down every time. Yeah, other disabled students do learn from home, but you don't need that. And yeah, other disabled students do get support, but you don't need that either. Your meltdowns and panic attacks are just overreactions. Though we're constantly saying you're capable and full of potential, we won't let you take the exam because you won't pass. It doesn't matter that you studied at home - if you wanted to study at home, you should have asked to do home learning. Oh, you did ask us and we refused? That's because you're not disabled enough for home learning. But you're too disabled to take the exam. None of it makes any sense. I know I couldn't have passed my math or my English, but I studied every damn word in 3 different History textbooks and I know for a FACT that I would have passed that exam. I just wanted one qualification in the thing I love and they denied me that. And if they'd let me do online learning like a few others did, I know I could have passed other classes too. For the few months we did online learning for COVID, I did really well.

School sucks for everyone, I get it, but neurotypical people get to complain that algebra is useless and the cafeteria has terrible food and they don't want to take English for 4 years. I just wanted them to consider my needs for 5 minutes instead of brushing me off for years until they presented the choice: ""Attend every class full time or drop out at 15"". Why are those my only choices? That's not fucking fair. Who are they to decide who's autistic enough for support? I'm fucking autistic. I shouldn't have to look like this image of autism they have in their head just to be treated with the empathy everyone else gets.

"I feel like such an awful person because I was fired for insubordination and passive aggressive behavior. I worked at a preschool that had some skewed values. My bosses verbatim told me they believe in using micromanagement. I also asked my supervisor to please kindly not speak to me 
in a certain way, as she was beginning to be snappy and short. We had a great rapport at first and I felt comfortable expressing this. She became very power over. She replied “You just need to nod your head and say ‘Yes ok got it’”. I told her so nicely and it was just such a sudden change in her demeanor. I don’t work well with supervisors like that nor do most people. 

I was constantly told I’m inflexible for pointing out things many, many other people would frequently complain about. Things my bosses previously apologized for and said they never wanted to happen to an employee again they used against me. Such as, they said parents were complaining about a specific teacher that I also brought up to them, as did many other teachers. Then, they mentioned that in my firing that I was causing too many problems with that instance in particular. That makes no sense. Obviously a bullshit reason. 

I just wonder what the kids think, what the parents think, what the uninvolved coworkers think. I know the families were probably told something vague, but it is totally against everything I strive for to seem as though I just up and left. It hurts to know the kids probably think I abandoned them without warning. I had such good bonds with all of them. I wonder what all the gossip is about me.

Everyone makes excuses for her, I made a post not long ago because I had an argument with her, got overwhelmed and she mocked me for it and I’m the one who got lectured. 

Today I had an appointment with my therapist who told me I should get my dog certified to be an assistance dog and when I saw my sister I told her about it. My dog is really intelligent he learns so many things easily and she told me he’s too stupid and would never be my assistance dog and then proceeded to grab him to get him away from me.

I’m not leaving the house for a while, as you probably know the economy is ass and I especially for autistic people who aren’t hired at jobs so can’t save up to afford an apartment, plus I’m still in school. So I don’t know what to do when I’m being disrespected like that.

I think what hurts most is that at her job she prides herself on “being the one knowledgeable about autism” and “being the most accepting”. But when it comes to me, I’m the annoying stupid childish sibling who says weird things and doesn’t have any real friends. I’ve tried so hard to be a good sibling to her, I was like three years old when she was born and I already wanted to be there for her and care for her I actually remember that because that was such a strong emotion. So that makes me extra sad that all her life she never wanted to have anything to do with me, would always break my toys and say mean things and I would get yelled at just for slightly raising my voice. 

She only cares about autistic people when they’re her eight year olds gymnasts who she can boss around to do whatever she asks them to. Oh they’re so cute because they give her hugs and they’re tiny children with no agency!

"Hello, everyone!

I’ll be visiting Korea this year and was wondering about the best method of payment. 

I already have cash in Korean won in my Korean bank account. However, I was hoping to apply for a new credit card and meet the minimum spending requirement by using it while there (and take advantage of the bonus categories). 

The card won’t have any FTF, but I’m not sure how currency conversation rate comes into play. On one hand, I think it’d be beneficial to use U.S. credit card as dollar is strong, but on the other hand, I’m worried that there will be some kind of mark-up during conversion with the credit card.

Is there no difference whether I pay in cash or with a U.S. credit card as long as I request to pay in local currency AND the card has no FTF? And no FTF means no currency conversion fee as well, right? 

The cards I’m planning to use are Chase Sapphire Preferred (already own), Bilt Mastercard (new), and maybe Amex Gold (new).

"Hello fellow sufferers, this season has been the absolute worst for me según a delayed Spring, thus everything is blooming at once. I have perennial allergies as well so this time of year is double trouble. I went to a couple of stores and got myself a Nettypot and Steam sinus reliever. I already own allergy pills (Xyzal), allergy eye drops, anti-histamine nose spray, and Breath Right strips. I currently take allergy shots but it has only been a year and ≈ 4 months on maintenance so they shouldn't have any effect yet, as my doctor said. I also am taking melatonin this time of year due to horrible sleep quality.

The point is, I did EVERYTHING yesterday. Yes, the steam, the netty, pills, spray... etc. And and AND: it DIDN'T WORK???? Like I layed in my bed and after 5 minutes all the sinus and nose congestion was back!! I was expecting something like this but not this bad! I have already come to the realization that allergy pills and nose spray are placeboes haha ( I know your secrets Big Med :\] ), but I really didn't think that none of this would work at all! At least the netty pot got a lot of clear snot out (I guess this means it's from the sinuses?), even if it was to return not 5 minutes later.

At 2 in the morning, nose stuffed to high heaven, I was led to this subreddit. I needed help. I found lots of advice that suggested **prevention** as the best method of relieving allergies, the logic being, that if there isn't any allergen, there isn't any reaction. Ok great, but the real problem is, how would I go about doing this? I'll pretty much do anything at this point, as this is my last line of hope.

Everything would be dandy if I just had one or two allergies, as a certain Koopa once said, ""It would be so awesome, it would be so cool."" This is not the case for me. I am pretty much allergic to everything under the sun (and under the roof) at this point. Local trees, all grasses, pollen, horses, dust, mold, pretty much everything non-food except dogs and cats, which is a real fluke. If I had the list from the doctor it would be about 20/30 of the allergens they tested me for that came out positive.

So with all these allergies, how would I escape even some of them? What do I need to do to survive this Spring without developing sleep apnea? Are there any articles or videos I should look at, that will help me ward off allergens? Thanks for any help! Also thanks for coming to my Ted-Talk!

P.S.: To clear up any confusion, I am a teenager, thus I face big problems mouthbreathing; underdeveloped chin, bad sleep quality, chronic drowsiness... If I could live without these problems that would be very nice. Also the reason I am not taking corticosteroids, sino anti-histamine nose spray, is because I don't want my growth to be stunted, which is a generally accepted side affect for those medications.

"Before age 23, I never struggled with anxiety. And then I started my first real job and was absolutely crippled by it out of nowhere. That was July 2021. I talked to my doctor, got prescribed SSRI meds, had an AWFUL adjustment period of mood swings and at least one panic attack for 2 weeks, and then on day 14, boom. Anxiety gone. What a bizarre little pill. Stayed on them for a month or two longer, got used to my job, tapered off, and I was good. 

Well now my anxiety is back again and it feels distinctly different. I used this herbal supplement called kratom for a long time. It’s a powder made from a leaf from a tree that grows in southeast asia. It’s completely unregulated even though it’s pretty much an opiate. It heightens your mood, kills pain and makes you feel motivated and happy for an hour or two. It does this by reacting with your opioid receptors. So it makes sense to say it’s as physically addictive as painkillers. 

I took one 5 gram dose of it once a day. For about three years straight. I thought I wasn’t developing dependency because I was taking so little, only once a day. 

Well I decided to stop taking it a month ago and now I have anxiety, but it’s not the same as before. It’s like my base level of anxiety is slightly heightened, and it only becomes really bad if I use marijuana, nicotine, drink coffee, or eat too much sugar. When I’m dehydrated I feel it too. None of these things ever used to make my heart pound and give me that tight feeling in my chest. And sometimes it feels like I’ll get a wave of anxiety for no reason.

There is a subreddit for quitting kratom but I feel out of place there. Everyone there was using 10, 20, 30, 40 grams of kratom a day, dosing throughout the day. When THEY quit, they get cold sweats, restless lags, GI issues, brain fog, depression, it’s like quitting heroin, and a lot of them also report anxiety symptoms, and these same sensitivities to THC, caffeine, nicotine and sugar that I’m feeling. 

So I’m hoping this is just my brain’s reaction to not getting that hit of Euphoria for 1/2 hours once a day, and this is temporary. Today is day 26 without kratom. Never taking that stuff again. But I thought I’d be feeling a little better by now. Every day is pretty bad. No signs of improvement. But other kratom addicts have said it can take two or three or six months to feel like your normal self again. For some it can take a year or more, but that seems to be very severe kratom addicts. 

I started the SSRI meds that fixed me up last time. First day of taking them was yeaterday. I do NOT feel good on them. It’s going to be another BAD 2 weeks. But fingers crossed that I have the same experience with them and they just suddenly cure me like last time. I just have a bad feeling it’s not going to be so easy this time.",4,anxiety

"Hi there,

My friend and I don't have any visible issues but every time I was in a group with her, I did more work, felt a lot of stress and she acted like she contributed evenly. She is toxic as an individual but she's not a bad friend per day to me at least. 

I have a hard time with confrontation and I switched myself to another group without saying anything (I'll use the excuse that the prof did it). 

The issue is the prof didn't switch any one else around and I just don't want to worth with her group on this. She's seen I'm not in the group and is asking I switch back. 

Not sure how to deal with this, I was thinking of telling her I'm fine with the group the prof switched me into but I'm worried this will impact our friendship etc. 

For context I'm in a graduate program that requires A LOT of group work, I'm working w her for all the classes except for this one now. 

Any advise is welcome, this has been causing me more anxiety (the thought of getting back to her is literally so nerve wracking) than necessary.",4,anxiety

I immediately said ""I'm so sorry"". I felt so terrible and still do, and the vibe kind of got killed completely after that. I ended up just muting and leaving after the game because I felt so dumb and I didn't even know what to say.

"I (M,22) have been diagnosed with panic disease a couple months ago, since then something really went wrong inside me.

I had my first panic attack, when I was 18 by smoking weed with my friends. I was in an insanely bad shape, cuz my gf just  broke up with me, so when we were smoking, I had a panic attack. 
Since then I’m not finding back to myself.
I have extreme depersonalization, derealisations, which makes my joyful life really tough. I have been to many many psychologists without any success. I recently started seeing a psychiatrist, so I had antidepressants prescribed. Since I started taking Scippa, an SSRI for about 3-4 weeks now, my life really went for a downfall. I feel incredibly stressed, nervous all the time. I am unable to desensitize myself or to even leave our home ( I live with my mom, she is a huge supporter of mine) since a week now.

I kept making excuses and putting things off and going on my phone feeling sorry for myself.

"I tend to get migraines with aura as a cluster usually before examinations. They do happen irregularly at other times too but when it's most severe it's usually around that period so I think the 'main' trigger is stress.

The visual disturbances, the migraine itself and the brain fog afterwards makes it very hard to study, I'm very lucky if I can at least focus. The uncertainty of the timing of the migraine attack makes me anxious. Whenever I see a flash of light that resembles the aura, my heart starts to race. 

I've tried most of what I can - exercise, getting enough sleep, having enough fluid, 'trying' to manage stress by thinking that the marks I get don't really matter, prophylaxis, regular visits to the doctor...

The fact that I only kinda know my trigger but cannot really avoid it makes me feel like I'm blocked my a brick wall on all four sides and it's quite exhausting. I don't know what else my GP can do for me. I've also tried accessing the services they offer at the university but extra time for completing the tests won't help at all. What can the school do other than tell me to manage my stress better or just drop out?

It's hard to explain, because even though I still had things to be unhappy about, I was content with how I perceived the world in my little kid brain. I wasn't corrupted by bad actors in my life, or exposed to evil. As an adult, my brain is so noisy and chaotic that I'm more of a homebody than anything. Being an adult with a drug/alcohol/gambling/anger problem is a much different animal and zaps of me any motivation to feel human. It kills the part of me that has imagination and creativity.  I used to be an open minded kid hungry for knowledge about things I didn't yet understand.

"All right, I apologize for my English, it is not my native language. I’m 19(M) and always frequent reddit threads and first of all, I must make it clear that I am diagnosed with OCD and generalized anxiety. Recently, I started to be very afraid of having schizophrenia. Once, when I was almost asleep, I heard people I knew calling me and talking to each other. Okay, I know this was possibly a benign event called hypnagonic hallucinations. However, everything got worse to the extreme when last night, something happened that left me with a lot of doubt, and caused me a very bad anxiety attack. I'll try to tell in details: I was lying on my bed and I had my AirPods in my ears, however they were turned off, that is, without sound. My fan was on, but its noise is low. Suddenly, I hear from my LEFT ear (I emphasize this because from my right ear I can hear my street, and from my left ear, there is only my door that leads to a corridor of my house) a voice saying something completely muffled, as if my headphones had drowned her out. From what I heard, she said one sentence, but I couldn't make it out and it was quite low. Then, I opened my door and no one was there. Since then, I'm having a panic attack because I know that if I have this disease, I'll isolate myself from everyone and break up with my girlfriend, because I'm too afraid of hurting the ones I love in an outbreak episode. I just wanted a certain diagnosis telling me if I HAVE IT or I DON'T HAVE IT. I don't have delusions or believe in unreal things, I know how to separate things very well. If someone who knows about the disease can go into detail and calm me down, or tell me the truth... on friday my girlfriend will come here and I won't be able to enjoy anything... I'm so scared.

What makes me think the most about not being schizophrenia, was the fact that I heard only one sentence and nothing more.

"Like it says, the film is perfect start to finish, every scene is essential, there is *no fat.* 



My pick is Spoorloos (1988) AKA The Vanishing



***!!!SPOILERS AHEAD FOR SPOORLOOS!!!***


From the moment the film starts with credits, there are shots of Rex and Saskia playing a game where they name things that start with a certain letter. Rex is teaching her to speak French. Both her lessons with Rex, and the specific game they use come into play when Saskia meets Raymond.

Seemingly silly things like the lighter Saskia buys Rex is the one he uses to light up his coffin(and it doesn’t last long because he’s used it for 3 years), and the price for the frisbee she buys is the same as the gift she wants to buy for Rex from Raymond. Raymond refers to many of these series of events as fate in the final act.

Anytime where someone is traveling from point A to B contains storytelling; Raymond walking to a work function sees a poster of a missing Saskia, and a conversation unfolds about why Raymond cares so much, and their conversation continues on how the coworker thinks kidnappers should be crucified, and Raymond asks what if it was him.

The longest traveling scene is when Raymond and Rex are together, and every bit of information you get from that point up until Rex is drugged is relevant. Even the conversation where the two are laughing about odd names, and Raymond mentions his neighbor’s dog name is Rex. Rex laughs about this in the grave as he shouts his name in defiance of the situation.

Rex running off when getting outside for a minute with his girlfriend ended up with him having the same floating egg dream that Saskia did.

Raymond’s brief scene in his classroom shows he’s an expert in Chemistry, therefore knows well how to use chemicals on his victims and how to mix them.


There are even more character details throughout this film, but at a tight 90 min, this film is meticulously decorated with detail, storytelling, and character development.

I get a lot of positive attention from strangers because I am conventionally attractive, but then nobody seems to care about my feelings or the things I like. They project their own desires and feelings on me, and then when they’re done or they realize I’m not a typical person with typical interests and personality traits they don’t feel the need to treat me with basic decency anymore. And sometimes in a really cruel way. 

For example I recently had someone who I thought was a friend essentially say that now that she isn’t attracted to me romantically anymore (probably because she realized I’m a little to weird), she doesn’t want anyone thinking she still is if we hang out because she doesn’t want that to get in the way of other people being interested in her.

She tried to be amicable with his friends but was obviously anxious, became “mute” as he put it and snuck out the back door 30 mins later. He then goes on to say how childish she is for not being able to deal with 1hr of talking. The general consensus was that he was the asshole for staging an ambush on her BUT she was the asshole for not wanting to socialise with anyone and that she should be socialising with him & his friends for the sake of the relationship. 

I really couldn’t believe that people were saying she was an asshole for not wanting to socialise with people. Honestly reading those comments made my anxiety skyrocket. They all had thousands of upvotes too meaning people agreed… now I can’t help but think that I am even more of a piece of shit for having anxiety and not being able to socialise. Whatever i guess.

"Hi, I’m Tuesday, and I want to give up.

I’ve been on antidepressants for the last 10 years, but I don’t think they’ve *ever* worked. To the point that, at the end of 2021, I stopped taking them. In 2022, I nearly punched my ticket, so, oops, Tuesday has to be back on drugs again. I’m physically repulsed by the idea of being on these pills for the rest of my life, so I’ve been trying to be better to get off of them. And I was doing okay…

But then I crashed, a week before my doctor’s appointment. I reiterated to her that I hate the pills, I don’t want to be on them, they don’t work. Her response was to increase the dose and brush my feelings under the rug. When I told her I doubt it would help because I feel I have ADHD, making actually taking medications difficult, she said, “I don’t think it’d be that.”

Since then I’ve been spiraling down. It feels like every direction a new punch comes my way, and I’m just defeated. I’m trying so hard to feel anything other than “I want to die,” but it’s fucking pointless. Why even try to do anything if you end up back at square one to begin with? Fuck this shit.",2,depression
"I want to improve my life, start one even. But I’m in my head the whole time worrying about everything. 

I’d like to find a job, clean up my room, start a hobby, study, find a group of friends 

But because I’m in my head so much I’m constantly overthinking things, putting things off, etc. My mind also usually starts talking shit about myself and catastrophizing 

I’m struggling to do the simple things such as cleaning my room and researching the steps I need to get a job so my mind starts to say that I’m no good at time management, discipline, and I’ll start thinking myself useless. I try to tell myself I CAN do things, try to be more mindful, or journal when I feel down. Somehow at the end of the day there hasn’t been much change.

I struggle to be consistent with my coping mechanisms, any advice on that?",4,anxiety
"I sometimes try to avoid reading books that have been reviewed exceptionally well or have the ""classic"" designation. It's partly because I become very impatient with these books.

Maybe it started in high school where I was forced to read various books that were considered classics but which I hated. So maybe even as an adult, those memories are shaping my choices. 

It's like a meal that somebody says is the best they've ever had. Or a restaurant they say is among the best. So you go in there and right away think the waiter is taking too long to come to your table, or a particular appetizer does not taste so good, or maybe the prices are way too high. In short, you are quick to feel disappointed.

Of course, I don't want to pick a random book either, because there are like, what, over a million books published every year (just guessing), and I don't want to waste time reading something that is not well-written or is not about a topic that interests me at all.

So what I do is sort of go somewhere in the middle, pick a book that got some positive reviews, and I read to make sure it is a topic of potential interest, then I start reading.

Anyhow, I totally feel like my expectations are ruining my reading experience. I envy people who are so open minded and read widely and give books a chance. I really wish I could one day be like that.",0,negative_samples
"I ask because I'm worried I'm too paranoid. I sometimes think people can read my thoughts and know what I'm thinking, as well as have an agenda against me and are just pretending to not like me/be my friend. Is this a normal amount of paranoia, or am I a little too paranoid? I also have a sense I'm being watched and followed sometimes, even when I'm alone. I tell myself these are just thoughts, but they feel really real sometimes.

"I grew up in a sketchy town where crime is high, so anything after the sun sets, gets suspicious quickly. Recently, I moved into a nice neighborhood, real nice, Americana suburbia, so I let my guard down a bit. Yet, I've been noticing some weird things lately. I've seen someone outside with a flashlight looking around. It might just be the neighborhood watch lookin' around for mischief, but I've only seen him once around 10 or 11, so that puts doubt on my Nightwatch theory. I've also noticed that every time I leave my window open at night, I hear strange noises. They could be the local wildlife, cats, and whatnot. 

Now all of these things could be waived aside as an overactive imagination, but the reason I'm typing this is because of what happened a few moments ago. It's 4 AM, and I'm still awake. Nothing new; this happens every few months. I stay up longer, a bit longer every day, and eventually, my sleep cycle flips itself; then I pull an all-nighter, and everything fixes itself. My father went to work a few hours ago, so only our sleeping roommate and I are home. 

I'm droning off to the computer but notice at the corner of my eye a tiny glint coming out of window blinders. I ignore it, thinking it might be my neighbor's porch light, but I swear it moved. So now I discreetly moved my seat to get a better view, and I saw that light again. At this point, I stare directly at it, and then It's gone. I turn on my room's light and head into the living room and kitchen to turn those lights on and get a knife. I'm sitting here hoping that this is a footnote and not a period in this story. I'll keep you guys updated.

"Rant because Jesus, I need someone to understand.

Mother’s Day was a nightmare for me. Usually, my family is very understanding of my needs as an autistic person, and will happily accommodate them. For example, going out to eat at restaurants and bars can sometimes be very challenging for me, so they’ll bring me home food or let me step outside if it becomes too noisy.

However, for Mother’s Day, everything was off the table. I left college that morning with my mom (she picked me up since I don’t have a car on campus) excited to spend the day with the family. My family agreed to go to a bar during the day that I know I usually have issues with, but they said w e wouldn’t do anything after, so I decided to go to make them happy. Sure enough, I had to step outside in the last thirty minutes because I couldn’t handle it. I’m visibly distressed and telling this to my family, who just tell me to “tough it up” because we’re now going to another restaurant that’s known for being crowded and loud for dinner. I ask to go home, offer to pay for my own Uber (we all drove together to the place), but I’m yelled at and told to toughen up again.

Sure enough, we get to the restaurant, and I’m immediately struggling. I was curled up in a ball with my hands over my ears trying to not have a meltdown because it was too loud, too hot, and I never had a chance to recover from the last place. My grandma snaps in my face to get my attention and tells me “to sit normally and just be quiet” to not ruin this day, especially after my mom drove all the way to my college just to get me. That sends me over the edge so I leave, sit outside, and just cry. My mom followed to yell at me, and that was it. I spent ninety minutes sitting outside sobbing because I was having a meltdown and nobody cared since “it ruined Mother’s Day.” My family didn’t even check to see if I wanted food or tried to help me calm down. They didn’t do anything they usually do when I have sensory issues. They’ve never even seen me get to this point because they help me out of it most days, so this was a low point for me.

I just got home and went to bed without eating. Now, it’s the next day, and I don’t even know what to expect. I’m considering buying a train ticket back to my dorm a few days early (I’m not fully moved out yet since my job requires I help with closing) to get out, since I don’t want to spend the next few days living on thin ice. I thought it would be common sense that I can’t just stop being autistic and turn off my sensory issues on holidays, but I guess it isn’t. I literally did everything I could, I tried to communicate multiple times that I wasn’t able to do this, and now my family is mad at me for having a meltdown that could’ve been easily avoided if they listened.

Sorry for the vent— I just needed to scream at something.",1,autism
"Hello! I am the daughter of someone who has recently been diagnosed schizophrenia but has been experiencing symptoms for decades. I love my mom so much, more than anything in this world. I’ve tried really hard to be there for her by calling her almost everyday and visiting whenever I can, but I have been at undergrad out of state for the past 4 years so it’s been hard. I’m just recently finishing and moving back near her. Since being diagnosed with schizophrenia, my mom has lost her job and hasn’t found a new one (any advice on that would be great too). She has money saved up to afford a place, but I thought that when I move for my job I would get a two bedroom in case she has to move in with me eventually. This is where the communication I need help with is. I have always expressed to my mom that moving in with me is a last resort. Not because I don’t love her or because of her schizophrenia, but because I am 22, newly out of college, moving in with my serious boyfriend of a year, and learning to become an independent adult. Now, that doesn’t mean I don’t want her in my life. I’d love to live near her and see her often, even have sleepovers when she’s having a rough night or just for fun. But she seems to think that because I am getting a two bedroom that means she can move in whenever she wants. If she was ever about to be homeless or ran out of most of her money or needed a caretaker, of course I’d take her in. But I’d much prefer to be neighbors who see each other a lot but have separate places to go at night. How do I express this to my mom so that she understands without hurting her? Because of her schizophrenia she can get really emotionally volatile, feel attacked, lash out, and also comprehend things poorly sometimes which causes misunderstandings. I don’t blame her at all, it’s just shitty symptoms that happens when she’s not doing well with the illness. I was wondering if anyone here with schizophrenia or family members with it would have advice. Thank you!",6,schizophrenia
"My mum really did her best I know she did but I’m going to make the hardest decision of my life to never speak with her again. 

I’ve had the worst year of my life I was in a very bad situation and now I’m mentally injured. 

During this time I haven’t gotten out of bed in months I’m suicidal and I cannot handle the world. During this time my mum has doubled down on her remarks towards me and I just realised no wonder I screamed and kicked throughout my childhood I had to deal with her mental gymnastics.

I’m cutting her off fully after hearing a voice that spoke out of my mouth saying “protect her” obviously it broke my brain so so much. When she heard that voice she said “Your never going to get better” and earlier in the night I told her I’m not coping and thinking of ending my life and she told me “fuck off”. 

I’ve just needed love during this time that’s all I’ve needed and she couldn’t just be nice to me for a year. My cat got sick and she said to me “don’t go broke fixing your cat” but she’s called me requesting money because she’s gambled it away. So she should get money to waste but I shouldn’t protect my best friend.

When I achieved something she said “Don’t act like it’s actually yours”. 

She has spent months and months trying to make snide remarks and I thought we got somewhere and she said oh no you’re just sensitive. She told me I’m probably better off without her she also sticks up so much for my dad and the men who assaulted her vs being nice to me.

I feel like such a bad person cutting her out but when that other voice spoke through me I was so scared. Im so traumatised my brain is trying to protect me. It’s time for me to realise that.

"One of my dad’s most noticeable autistic traits is that he can’t stop talking, and he doesn’t realize when people aren’t paying attention or aren’t engaged in his conversation… So he’ll just keep talking. No matter how many times you give a half-hearted “mhm” he’ll just keep going. 

Sometimes it overwhelms me, and I feel like I’m giving every sign possible that I’m not focused on the convo: not staring at him (which doesn’t work for obvious reasons), clearly being on my phone, playing a video for myself (it’s usually already playing when he starts talking), even wearing headphones (also usually on when he starts talking)! And since I’ll be playing on my phone, him talking starts to overwhelm me because I’m not good at multitasking. I’ll be trying to focus on my phone, but he’ll keep talking and it gets me so overwhelmed that I want to cry from stress.

"Since I was young, I have constantly turned to the internet as a form of judgment of my character. The most important thing in my life (And still is today) is being a good person. And the only way to decipher who a ""Good person"" is, would be the majority of people online (Twitter, redder, any social media). And at 25 years old, I feel like I have failed that task.  
  
With this, I am in a constant state of guilt over my past actions. I constantly scour the internet, reading over other people's opinions on how they judge others in specific situations (Think about the comments reacting to a cancel culture scene). It makes me think, ""What if that were me?"". These people who have done bad things in the past are permanently exiled from communities; is there something I have done in my life that would get me canceled (Assuming I was an influencer)? It makes me sad thinking that even if they were to have changed and genuinely become amazing people, these past actions will forever label them as unredeemable.  
  
The most disheartening part of it all is reading about someone being compassionate for someone who is guilty of something, only to sprinkle on an ""Unless you did something REALLY bad, then you deserve the misery"". And of course, everyone has a different definition of something that is really bad or not…  
  
An example of this type of behavior would be Atrioc. Someone who for all intents and purposes, was a very stand-up citizen. Hundreds of thousands of people looked up to this gentleman, for it all to be stripped away from one mistake. Does all the good he has done, and all the good he will do in the future, not mean he is able to recover from one bad action that he regrets? Even if he came back in the future, I can assuredly see hundreds of people raising their pichforks in anger over his return.  
  
I am 25 now, with a decade of self-hatred. Every day it grows, knowing I have wasted a beautiful day on this planet being miserable. I want to feel better, and I want to be happy more than anything. But then I see posts of people who have made mistakes in the past, with people replying to them on how they don't deserve to be happy regardless of the good they do.  
  
Today my therapist had me choose if I wanted to continue our sessions. Asking if I truly thought I could envision myself improving, and wanting to improve. But as someone who is guilty of past actions, of course, I don't think that. Because I don't believe I deserve happiness. So, that was the end of it, and I have never felt so alone. I want to be happy, but that is a selfish thing to ask for someone who doesn't deserve it. So I won't beg for something I don't deserve. There are too many good people out there, who have never harmed anyone in the slightest, that deserve happiness over me  
  
.  
  
Even if someone does comment on this post with a kind-hearted message (Which I am sure someone will, as there are lots of wonderful people out there) it is much easier to be kind to someone when you don't know the full details. If I was a truly evil person, who did terrible things, would you still be as compassionate? Would you still think I deserve happiness? I am willing to bet the majority of people wouldn't. So why should I forgive myself?",4,anxiety

"I used to be obese . Guys were disgusted when they’d have to sit next to me, even the fat ones. I felt sorry for them because they had to see me .

Then, I developed an eating disorder and became underweight ( can we even call it an ED tho ? I was obese, some of it was needed) . I felt a bit more confident at first , bit eventually it wore out, I was just as depressed as before . Still, no one was interested in me. The ones who congratulated my weight loss were all girls . I tried making the first step, all of my 3 attempts were rejected . I felt ashamed: how could I even think of going out with someone, didn’t I look in the mirror to see how ugly I am ? Those guys were probably looking for someone better, why would they settle for me ?

Now, I developed binge eating disorder. I already gained half of my weight back. I am more depressed than ever. I keep fighting and fighting but I just want to give up . Call me selfish , but I just want someone to like me, romantically, and not in a friend way . But the sad truth is that will probably never happen. My chances of finding someone keep getting slimmer as binge eating takes over my life . 

And I know, I know, love has many forms , not just romantic blah blah . Obviously, I love my parents and my sister, I could sacrifice everything for them and I am SO thankful to have them, because not everyone is blessed with a family . 

But I don’t know, I just want to experience being in a relationship. Don’t ask my why. I have no idea either .

The worst of the bunch was #59 Night of The Werewolf in my opinion, and that one still had some redeeming qualities but it's where the quality started to take a dip. Most of the rest of the bad ones don't really stick out because they were more dull than anything.

Edit because I forgot: Would I recommend you do this? No, unless you really enjoy reading generally lifht-hearted kids mystery novels or want to see how the series developed over the years.",0,negative_samples
"Alright, so for the past few years I've been heavily depressed and I've also got anhedonia (the lack to feel pleasure). Recently it's been getting worse, i:e Suicidal Thoughts becoming more frequent, Unmotivated and even planning out my own ""self-end."" I've always been a night owl, and my sleep schedule is usually like this; I wake up at like 3-5 PM and go to sleep at around 6-8 AM (Yeah, I know it's weird). About 9 months ago, we moved into a house located a small lake. We've been living her ever since and no issues so far, but recently (about a month ago or so) I started hearing odd noises in the night. I went outside one morning at 3AM to give my brother something (he lives in a small flat outside). I then admired the views of the stars a bit and walked around the house. When I got to the front yard, I heard sounds of something screaming in the distance, yet closeby. It clearly sounded like a woman, but far worse. If I had to describe it, it'd be like a demonic woman screaming in a movie or something. And then a few days later, I was in the bathroom one morning also at around 3AM. I heard dogs barking and a howl in the distance. It didn't sound like a dog or anything, since I heard dogs barking. If I had to describe it, it sounded like a ""demonic werewolf"" (if that makes any sense). And since then, I've been hearing this deep, eerie croaking sound every night (when outside). 

And just now, at around 3-4 AM...I went to the kitchen to prepare some food, but as I placed food in my plate; I heard a horrific sound that sounded like a beast/demon thing throwing up (like a metal screech or something). 

My older brother also has more or less the same sleep pattern as me, and everytime I heard a sound...I'd ask him if he heard it or if he could check outside. Each time, he claims to not have heard or see anything. He called me paranoid this morning when I told him about the sound I had just heard. So I don't know, I just hear these very odd, eerie and disturbing sounds at times. I heard them quite loudly and clearly. I don't think I'm crazy, but nobody else hears them. 

Am I being paranoid for no reason, or is something wrong with me? My brother claims that it's ""all of my negativity"" driving me crazy...",5,paranoia
"Throw away account because I'm ashamed. I know the rules say to search for similar posts, but I wanted to not only have responses that were specific to my situation, but also to vent a little. I don't have anyone I can talk to about this and I feel like it's ruining my life. 

I have paranoia. I don't know what mental disorder it stems from. All I do know, is that it's very much taking control of my life. I'm paranoid about losing my job even when I don't think I've done something terribly wrong. I'm paranoid about the health and safety of my mother. Especially, for the past few years, I've been extremely paranoid that she will fall in the shower. I check my phone often to see when she was last online, just to make sure she's okay. If I haven't' heard from her in a few days, I get a sick feeling and have to call or text right away, and I get very upset when she doesn't answer or reply right away too. Worst of all, the worst paranoia I have ever felt, is about my boyfriend cheating on me. It comes on fast and strong. It's always the strangest things that cause it too and the smallest of acts set it off. It's been causing a lot of problems lately because I've just been coming right out and sharing these thoughts. He tells me I'm accusing. I don't mean to come off that way. I just want to ask right out if the thoughts I'm having are true or not. It's been all day, every day for 2 weeks now really bad. It's been years with me being paranoid, and normally I am able to push the thoughts to the side and ignore them. But sometimes, they are so strong and so believable I can't help but to give into them. My brain puts all these pieces together, and no matter how ridiculous they may seem to everyone else, they make sense to me. They could never not make sense. Typically, it lasts for a few days, and then I just wake up and I'm not that worried about it anymore. But lately, it's not gone away and every time a new paranoid thought comes up, it just adds more fuel to it and it's scaring me. I don't want to lose this man but I'm doing nothing good for him or us by coming off as accusatory and I don't want to hurt his feelings. I know, when I'm not feeling paranoid, that he would never be unfaithful or do anything to hurt me, but the paranoia is so strong. I know I have issues with trusting people and I often worry that I don't trust him and maybe that's the problem? 

Any advice from similar situations would be greatly appreciated. Also, if you take any medications that have or still do help, let me know. I should also mention, I have very severe anxiety about every aspect of my life and I'm thinking that maybe causes the paranoia? I really don't know. But what can I do when I'm feeling so enraged and fueled by paranoid thoughts? And what if they don't go away? I know I've read it's possible to have a good relationship with someone that has paranoia, but I'm really feeling like this is all my life will ever be and I should just stay single as not to hurt the people I get close with.",5,paranoia

"TW: minor mention of abuse
I honestly don't know if this is normal for people who suffer from PTSD but I was in an abusive relationship for two years as an early high schooler and it's been almost 4 years since it ended. For that time I've had really bad sleep paralysis/paranoia based on my ex boyfriend. It ranges from him hiding under my bed to reach out and grab me, hiding in my closet, sh00ting me through my window, or hiding anywhere in my house with intent to hurt me or my family. Unfortunately recently aside from all of that normal paranoia, I've been scared of driving alone, being home alone, going to the store/public alone, etc. for fear that he's stalking me and going to find me to hurt me. Besides all of this I have routines and rituals I have to follow to feel safe such as I have to jump from three feet away into my bed so he can't grab me, close my blinds over my windows by 6 pm so he can't see in when it's dark, etc.

Main point of that whole thing is does anyone else struggle with PTSD based paranoia? / Is that a thing?",5,paranoia

"Yesterday, shortly before falling asleep, and after staying up all night drinking energy drinks and playing GTA V Online (trying to grind out some in-game cash, which is hard to come by for free), I had the distinct impression that I was rapidly losing my mind.

Normally when I'm tired I just fall asleep no matter how much caffeine I drink; the caffeine just helps me stay alert while I'm already awake. However, last night I guess I hit a 'sweet spot' and I sort of got stuck in between sleeping and being awake. I figured the game was making me twitchy from being alert too long, and began watching YouTube to unwind.

The first and only video I watched ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJEF\_U3L0B4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJEF_U3L0B4), I remember the video because that's when things got weird), I found my brain randomly latching onto little things in the video's content, like words, gestures, etc. and I got the most literal 'tunnel vision' effect that I've ever experienced.

This startled me, and I jokingly thought to myself something like, ""Ha, my brain's playing tricks on me."" I then suddenly had a frightening and nightmarish hallucination of a really vivid brain. Just the otherwise harmless word triggered a terrifying response.

I immediately slammed my computer shut, sprinted to my bed, and hid under my blanket like a four-year-old. I fought my way toward a restless sleep, in which I constantly felt like my back was exposed to some unknown threat, even when I laid face-up.

Now, after having slept and detox-ed, I still have lingering effects from this incident, mostly of needing to shield my back with a wall, or the floor... like I become afraid of staying standing if I lose focus on what I'm doing. Note that I really only delayed my sleep cycle by 8 hours or so, and consumed no more caffeine than I often do.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? It's like everything I normally do is 'realer than life,' and there's a creepy.... something lurking behind me.",5,paranoia

"I met my friend online a little over two years ago and we bonded over our love of books. She strictly only reads fantasy and smut. I like to read really anything and don't care too much for romance/smut. I like it but it's definitely not something I absolutely NEED to have in a book. Over these last few years, she has recommended me books that she likes that ended up just being really bad, poorly written fanfic type of books. I'm just not into that and that's totally fine that she is. She's gotten offended when I've said I didn't enjoy them or I just stopped reading them. I'm also realizing as I write this that we never read anything I'm interested in but like I said, she's strictly fantasy romance. 

Anyway, we started reading a big fantasy series recently and I love the series itself. I just don't really like reading it WITH her and I feel like shit for it. Here's why: 

- I think I just don't like the pressure of buddy reads. I don't like the pressure of slowing down or speeding up to be at the same point in the story with her.
- Spoilers actually ruin things for me whereas she doesn't care about spoilers and will kinda taunt me with what she knows.. idk I just think it's kind of weird?
- If she is ahead of me in the story, she will 100% spoil what I haven't read yet.
- So there goes that pressure of having to speed up my reading so that I'm sure she won't spoil anything for me in the future 
- When I don't feel like reading for one day, she gets annoyed and again, pressures me into reading faster and it gets to the point where reading just isn't fun for me anymore 
- There's also big, interesting things happening in the books but she never talks about them with me. She only really focuses on the romance and spice and tension (which is like 5% in this series) and thinks the rest (95%) is boring so ????

I've told her many times to not spoil things for me. I've also told her how I don't read 300+ pages a day like it's a normal thing. Sometimes it's 100, sometimes it's 10.. i don't know... I've tried getting her into the main plot and she just doesn't care what I have to say which is fine if you're not into it but like why do I have to listen to you scream about the way this man looks at the girl??

I don't think buddy reads are for me. I like to read books on my own, at my own pace and when I'm finished, I like going online to discuss with other people. I thought that since we both liked the first series she introduced me to that this would be fun but it actually kinda sucks. I don't really know what else to tell her. I think she'd be very mad and hurt if I just suddenly said in the middle of this series that I don't want to read with her anymore. I don't know if I should tell her that I just don't want to read anymore (even though I love the series) or just finish it and probably never read with her again lol. What would YOU do? 

I'm also very aware of how small and stupid this ""problem"" is... kinda just wanted a place to rant lol so thanks if you read all the way through :)

TL;DR: I don't enjoy reading with my friend anymore, she spoils a lot for me, doesn't want to talk about the book, I feel pressured to read faster or slower to keep up with her, I don't know if I should tell her or keep going until it's done.",0,negative_samples

"Hey guys,

I didn't really premeditate this, so forgive me if it sounds a bit garbled.

I've hand-held my depression for years, when the risk factor went away in my teens - it became a looming sort of grey-area. I'm no longer suicidal, but have adopted this sense of apathy that has been bothering me as of late. As grim as it sounds, it's the whole 'would never seek to harm myself, but if harm sought me out, I doubt I would move' sort of deal. 

All the things I would love to doing slowly fade out into my apathy-zone. From sports and socializing to trivial things such as movies, music and art. I have constant fidgets, and an overbearing weight of guilt that constantly sits on my shoulders like a little gremlin constantly whining that had I spent my time better in previous situations, I would have met more success 

Rationally I understand how unhealthy it is, but can't find the drive or energy to be better, so I just sit with my thoughts and flow through a cycle of beating myself up. I'm real tired of my internal monologue.

I've prefaced looking for help, however, in Canada the wait times for therapy and what-not for somebody 'not-at-risk' (which I totally get, but still) leaves me in what possible could be year-long wait times, on top of finding a General Physician (which took me two years last time). It's not looking so good over here,lads.

What I'm wondering from this community, is have any of you found a way to break these kinds of cycles? 

Maybe pulled out from your 'apathy-zone'?

"Hi, for some context, spurred by experiencing one of these moments my boyfriend has recently confided in me that he often has these strange..terrors? Only that's not what they should be called. Trouble is we don't know what to call them.

There are about four, each with their own distinct look. -One is a man who has no teeth and smiles. His neck can stretch high enough to look through second story windows and he watches you. If you turn your head he'll kill you. He usually is outside the window or at the end of the bed. -the other is a being with teeth like a whale, no eyes, and stands on all fours only his joints are all wrong. He is usually found on the ceiling or next to the bed -the third is me but my neck and limbs stretch out and I usually murder him -the fourth is a pulsating ball of nails.

Normally we'd call these hallucinations but the problem is he doesn't see them. He doesn't hear, or taste, or smell, or even feel them either. He'll just be existing in a moment and then feel as if they're there. He has never seen them in person, but feels as if he knows what they look like (this is how I got my descriptions. He drew them and they are thoroughly creepy).

He has more but these are the most reoccurring and memorable for him. They only happen at night and before he goes to bed. (The ball of nails only occured during sleep paralysis).

I've had people come into my life every other time I've come close to figuring this out that are a little *too* perfect to the situation I'm experiencing. Similar enough to me that they calm me down and throw me off. People that have given me psychedelics and encouraged me to spill lots of deep memories often deflecting when I asked them the same question. Sometimes those were the same people. I've been convinced at times that romantic partners of mine that just had randomly moved to the city were intended to keep tabs on me and two of them have even admitted it, albeit casually, almost as if to indicate I couldn't stop it if I tried.

During these 3 years I was most of the time alone in my parents house - dont ask, I dont know why I didnt get any treatment... Anyway, as you can imagine these years were not pleasant.

I feel like that I am basically helpless and I wonder what to do. I am around 30  years old and currently studying Computer Science, not very succesfull. I dont have a single friend, nor did I have friends in the past 15 years, maybe more... My living situation is secured, yet I have this deep feeling of hopelessness and that nothing makes any sense.

In total I dont have much courage to change anything, mainly because the ""ghosts of my past"" still haunt me to some degree. I have these memories from the paranoid years... they are like dialogs with people from my past, I argue with them in my mind. They question me and I oppose it. Which is really exhausting and it angers me. Every day feels like fighting.

I just dont know how I could change anything about my situation. around 15 years of CBT, many selfhelp books and medication didnt change much. I don't get the feeling that these therapists were listening nor that anything will ever change.

The scenario I keep having when I go in there is someone seeing me turn the light on, stand in front of the toilet to either sit to use the bathroom or to undress to get in the shower and just shoot me through the window in my head. 

It’s like I can see the outside of my house, the mysterious shadow person lurking in the deer grass (some tall grass that the deer like in my yard). I can see him (because mysterious shadow person is always a man, idk, I don’t make the rules when it comes to my thoughts) move closer to the window to get a better shot, pull out his gun and shoot. 

The scene switches to inside my bathroom where the glass breaks, and just before I have the chance to look over, my body falls lifeless onto the tile. The scene switches to my 4 month old crying in his crib from the loud noises waking him. The scene switches back to me laying on the tile just gone. Unknowing of what happened and what will happen to my son and my fiancé now that I’m gone. 

Whenever this happens in my head I tend to duck when I enter the bathroom and avoid getting too close to the window. I find standing in front of my bathroom sink stressful because I can’t duck and still see in the mirror. I sometimes find the intrusive thoughts after that scenario playing to be too much and so I’ll leave the bathroom without finishing or starting what I went in to do (excluding using the toilet cause I can’t just get up midshit or piss). 

I have a major fear of death, no understanding of the afterlife and don’t know how to react to death. I’m a paranoid schizophrenic. Most of my paranoia comes from that fear of death so therefore most of the scenarios end in my death while others end in my fiancé or my sons death. I have many other repeatable scenarios that pop into my head every day. It’s interesting when I get a new one because it only takes one time seeing that in my head to never go away. 

Most of the time these main scenarios are followed by a plethora of intrusive and unsettling thoughts. These thoughts will continue until I change what I’m doing or where I’m at to get rid of that setting, or they won’t stop until I’ve found some resting time, whether it be laying down for a short nap or just finding a moment to collect myself. I have also found that i have more throughout the day and night since I’ve had my son.

"I have anxiety, ocd, and depression. Idk if she knows about my ocd (though she has some misconceptions on it like that it’s only cleaning so maybe she thinks my symptoms are from my anxiety?) and I find she is constantly doing stuff that I have stated upsets me/stresses me out. She also is vomiting alllll the time bc of health issues but I have pretty severe emetophobia- and it’s a living hell. I’m gonna list some stuff she does/has done. I’m just feeling stressed rn sorry.

•leaves microwave with time left on it instead of canceling the time

•holds one of my cats that I’ve explicitly said doesn’t like to be held by other people (because he doesn’t)

•feeds my cats constantly even though I asked her not to

•calls for the cats in the same tone I use to call them for breakfast/dinner. She’ll just call them like that so they’ll come into the room but then they’ll pester me til I feed them treats

•leaves food out that’s meant to be in the fridge/freezer

•constant misgenders my friends

•makes jokes about my sexuality 

•makes comments about me behind my back in front of my sister who then tells me 

•says stuff like “I didn’t think you’d like this” or “glad to have found something you actually like” which makes me anxious because I already have anxiety about being hard to work with

•comments on my weight and asks if I’m eating even though I haven’t lost weight in months and my doctors helped me fix my diet

•talks abt how my older sister never texts her back to me because I also never text back

There’s more- but I need to get to sleep.
Do you all think she’s actually doing all this to bother me and stress me out???? Or is she just annoying? She’s extremely manipulative and will constantly buy things for our family. And then when her and my dad break up (which they do constantly) she’ll demand them back. She once gave my sister a $200 check to help pay for one of her classes as a present and then months later asked my sister when she’d pay her back- even though the money was a present.

"I feel like I’ve finally reached the last stage of depression which is acceptance. I think there’s 5 stages to depression, or, there has been for me anyway that are the same 5 stages of grief. The first stage was denial, this was stage I was in for the longest, I simply denied that I was depressed. Of course at first I wasn’t actually sure if it was depression, I was only 12 not long started high school so I wasn’t sure if I even fully understood what depression was further than just being ‘sad all the time’. I denied that something was wrong when my parents started to question why I was sleeping at any point I could and why I slowly withdrew from everything that previously granted me joy. I denied that I was suicidal and that I had thoughts about how I would kill myself to the school counsellor at 14 who had been asked to see me due to my declining behaviour in school and increasing distribution to lessons or the increasing amount of times I’d not turn up to the lessons all together. I even denied that I was depressed to myself for a long time, I wrote it off as being a teenager and the crazy hormones that occur when you are that age. 

Anger was the second stage. I was absolutely furious that I felt like this, that I had to be miserable and bitter, that I had to struggle to do even the most basic of things and most of all that it was something so difficult to fight. I was aggressive and mean towards everyone, taking my self hatred and anger out any anything and anyone. Third came bargaining, I rang the GP at least once a week asking about therapy or some form of counselling and was told at least once a week that there is a very long waiting list to see any sort of counsellor and that I was looking at around a year long waiting list until I’d even be able to start counselling over the phone. I prayed to every god or form of omnipotence that I could, I am not religious but I prayed, I begged for god or the universe or anything to help. To make me feel normal, to make me want to socialise with my friends, to let me be satisfied, to let me feel joy, to let me sleep or eat normally, to give me desire to want to do anything with my life, for luck friendship love anything, just to feel happy again. 

Depression was the fourth stage. I know what you’re thinking how can depression be the fourth stage if I’m taking about the stages of depression. To be as frank as possible I was depressed that I was depressed. I was in despair, There was not one single drop of hope left, it’s as if any last bit of light that was still shining in my life  lost power. No therapist or doctor was going to help me, no friend or family member, no god or higher power, nothing I was going to be depressed forever, and this broke me even further. 

I have finally reached the final stage. Acceptance. I have accepted that this is my life. I will always be depressed and thats that kind of. I will never beat this and things won’t get better because I’m 21 and by now they would have. I have no talent, no luck on my side, no future, no hope, no qualifications, no romantic experience what so ever, no good looks, I have nothing. And that is how it will be, that is my life’s path, someone has to be the person that you knew in school who went absolutely no where and lived on a council estate with no job on benefits for there whole adult life and that will be me. I quit my job two days ago. I’ve given up. I’ve accepted it for what it is.

I’m just wondering if anyone else feels like there at this stage or has been in this stage or way for longer and if there is any next steps I’m unaware of. I’m sorry if I’ve gone on too much, I’m not too familiar with posting and once I started typing i couldn’t stop. 

Also I’d anyones wondering why if I’m at this point why don’t I just end it all. I cannot currently do that due to be told by more than one person that if I were to die they themselves would bring about their own death. As you can imagine I do not want to be that cause of someone else’s death especially knowing the people that would be affected by there’s.",2,depression
"My younger brother [22m] has always had a lot of fears. Growing up he would cry every once in a while because he thought about death and how much he fears it. As he started growing up he got very interested in guns and began purchasing them when he turned 18, when we ask him why he goes on a tirade about the government not being trustworthy (which I agree, but not to his extent). He owns 5 guns now and still asks my mother for money on college expenses, these guns amount to more than 10k. 

He started drinking when he turned 21 and it’s only gotten worse. He accuses his ex girlfriend of cheating on him, despite her leaving him over this behavior, he had no evidence of her ever cheating on him. Yesterday he visited me and when he was leaving his eyes were red from being tired and he thought the valet in my building would call the police on him because they would think he had been drinking, but we had not had a drink all day. The valet is an 18 year old kid who I always tip, he would never do that. 

Then on his trip home he called me again because he was scared of traffic and the cars around him. He also carried his gun all day while we hung out, he has a conceal carry permit which is okay but I live in a very good neighborhood in a gated community so I don’t know why he felt the need to be armed at my house.

He also has no friends because they always do something that makes him the victim. Either he gets upset when they forget to invite him or he hates being out with them. He also thinks everyone at work hates him and he calls me weekly with fears of getting fired because he got a certain look from someone.

Can someone give me some advice on how to talk to him about getting help? Please.",5,paranoia
"In 2019 I had a near death experience, since I have heard voices, seen spirits, experienced all manner of supernatural phenomena. The spirits that would harass me would force my perceptions effectively capable of getting me to believe any delusional comprehending of the world they wanted. Every day brought new horrors. I lost my job, wrecked a vehicle, busted my teeth, was hospitalized multiple times, and was isolated from friends and family. The phenomena almost killed me so many times. I preformed a personalized summoning ritual for a spirit guide, this was a big up for me in my mortal and spiritual bout. I tried psych meds, that crap messed my body and brain up so much, I have no patience for the world of psychiatry. Maddening to know the spiritually gifted in this society are poisoned their entire lives and the torment from nihilistic spirits does not even relent. Taking that stuff is the equivalent of burning your house down so no one can break in. The only substance that ever helped me with this phenomena were the plants Chamomile and Kratom. I found the Hearing Voices Network, I began sharing my story and hearing others. It was staggering to see how much of my story was in everyone else's, how the spirits are dim witted and do the same thing to every human they harass. Lastly the three books from Jordan Peterson were of tremendous help to me. No only do they describe an ideal perspective to take in just about any trying situation, they describe his recommendations to people in this very situation. More so he talks about himself having heard voices and overcoming the harassment of spirits. Look into music, the story of the tortured medium is the story of countless artists in contemporary music. The spirits tell stories and send messages to each other and the rest of the world through these artists, who know themselves to be channeling spirits. The world is coo coo for crazy nuts, screw the APA. If you are interested in this please look through my profile, it tells my story. Lastly I have a google doc up that I am adding to that distills the key takeaways on how to understand and act around this phenomena.

"Hi all,

Hoping for a bit of a sanity check here / maybe some advice. If not, just venting and hoping someone can relate!

I'm having a bit of an issue with a person who I regard as my best friend. This is 100% an issue of my own making, and I doubt she's even aware of the fact that I'm upset. To be clear: I don't think *she's* done anything wrong, but I'm struggling with my own feelings on something.

I'm identifying this as an autism issue because I have a really REALLY strong sense of injustice/when something's unfair, and this is exactly what is eating at me.

Might require a bit of a long explanation, and it's a bit specific, so please bear with me!

So, background, this story involves two friends - names changed because I'm grouching about them on the internet, lol. We have Anna (my 'best' friend who I've known for 15 years) and James (a more casual friend to us both). Both me and James work in the music industry: I'm a photographer, he's a journalist. Anna does not, but she's a music fan and goes to a lot of concerts.

I introduced Anna to James about 6 years ago. Over the last 2 years, she's become closer to him than I am, because they live near each other, and hang out quite often. 

Last weekend, James got married. Anna was invited to the full wedding, but I was only invited to the evening party, so I felt a bit left out over that - I know weddings are difficult and friendships are like this, but it was eating at me a bit. And then, later in the evening, I found something out that really upset me.

In a couple of weeks, there's an awards ceremony happening. James goes to a lot of these sort of things - he's been working in the music industry for way longer than me, knows everyone, and gets invited to everything. But something very special happened for me this year with regards to these awards: as a 'music industry professional', I got invited to join the voting panel - to be one of the industry people who nominates bands for the awards. As a consequence, I too got invited to the awards. This was really important to me, because I've *grafted*: I've spent over 15 years working my way up in the industry, worked hard, networked my ass off, and to finally get recognised as a 'music industry professional' and get invited to something like this was a huge milestone for me. I'm quite insecure about my work and I finally felt like I'd 'arrived'. I was so pleased for myself.

There was a catch. Even for invited VIPs, tickets cost nearly £200. Granted that came with free drinks and hospitality and perks and such, and it really is a proper thing like any other music/film awards ceremony, but, still... ouch. I'm not exactly rich at the moment, but I justified it on account of the fact that I've been working my way up to this point for years. I deserved to go. So I paid, and I told James that I was going. We talked about it quite a bit, and he sympathised about how much it had cost me.

James, meanwhile, applied to cover the event as a journalist. This isn't quite as plush as it sounds - he'll have to work for most of the night, interview bands and stuff. But he'll get in for free, or for a small mandatory donation.

I also told Anna that I'd be attending. I told her how much it cost. And her immediate response was, ""oh, I'm 99% sure I'll get a free ticket.""

There's a backstory to this. Quite often James gets 'plus ones' - when he gets free tickets as a journalist, he gets an extra ticket so he can bring a friend. This isn't typical for a music journalist, but can happen if you ask. (I rarely get plus ones because photographers don't typically get them). And when James gets a plus one, he often offers it to Anna, because she's usually available, likes going out, and enjoys a free gig ticket.

So when she said ""oh, I'm 99% sure I'll get a free ticket"" I knew what she was thinking - somewhat arrogantly, she was assuming that James would have a plus one. Considering the fact that they were charging even invited industry guests £200 to attend, I told her to manage her expectations - I really doubted that there would be free tickets for many people this year.

And then, on saturday night, I found out from a mutual friend at the wedding that Anna was going to this awards ceremony. James had a free plus one, and had offered it to her. Neither of them had told me.

And I was extremely, perhaps unreasonably, upset. I was *really* upset. And angry. FURIOUS, out of nowhere. I didn't really say anything and held it together, but when I got home that night I ended up in tears.

I wasn't sure why I was so upset, but after a bit of introspection, it's the sheer injustice of it all. On top of the wedding grief (the fact that she'd been invited to the whole wedding and I hadn't, which knocked my self esteem) it was a huge, overriding sense of - *she doesn't deserve this.* 

It's the music industry in a nutshell really. It's not what you know or what you do, it's WHO you know, but it's the fact that a friend who hasn't grafted like I have (OR like James has!), who doesn't even WORK in the industry, gets into something like this for free. Meanwhile I, having worked my ass off to get to this point, had to pay £200 for a ticket. After all the stuff she's got into for free thanks to James, it just really, really got to me.

If you're still with me at this point, can I get some feedback? Am I overreacting? I know I probably am. I haven't spoken to James about it, nor her (she still doesn't know that I know!) but it's absolutely eating me alive. I'm furious. It's so unfair.

I don't think I even wanted James to offer me the ticket instead - I like knowing that I worked for my ticket and I'm attending off of my own hard work. I'd just rather he'd offered it to anyone other than my 'best' friend who doesn't deserve it. She knows that I've paid £200 to attend, and she's going to be so smug, because she always is when she gets into things for free, and she's used to that now thanks to James. 

I'm pretty sure that most people would be like ""eh, that's just the music industry, that's just life"" but I'm really struggling with this. It's really affected my perception of both of them and it's turned what was a special event for me into something that I don't actually want to go to any more, because it doesn't feel special now. I'd feel better if she'd told me, I'd feel better if she was excited and shocked and grateful, but she hasn't even said anything. It's just standard for her - another free ticket from James.

Am I being totally nuts over this? Would anyone else be this angry too? Am I the only one who thinks this is the unfairest thing in the world?",1,autism
"I just want to start by saying I don't really feel that my life has been terrible as far as it goes, but I can't help but feel like nothing ever quite went the way I hoped it would. I turned 30 recently and the realization about where I'm really at hit me like a truck. I don't have many happy memories from childhood up until I was about 23-24 years old because everything I did had the shadow of my parents looming overhead. They fought a lot as long as I can remember and wanted to control my every move. My dad is addicted to pills because of a problem that caused him a lot of pain. My mom had a heart attack when I was 13 that couched her indefinitely because she was too afraid to move. When my brother passed away everything in the house got worse. Every conversation became about death and loss. All of their expectations crashed down on me and I was intimately aware of how short I fell of them. I got bullied a lot in school up until I got expelled. I just sat in my room, never really left except to get weed and then I just smoked and wasted time until I could go back to sleep, the one time I wasn't looking over my shoulder.  I missed everything from the ""golden years"" of high school, and I miss everything now because being in uncontrollable social situations fills me with dread. Now I'm dealing with my own daily physical pain from a vague condition my doctors can't pinpoint. The sole saving grace in my life is my wonderful partner. I love her, but I feel more and more every day that I'm robbing her of a fulfilling life because of the demons in my heart that I can never seem to grapple with. It's always one step forward, two steps back. I can't ever finish what I set out to do because there's a titanic fear of failure on my back. What the fuck do you do when you feel like you can't change anything, but you hate damn near everything about the life you wasted all by yourself? I used to think I wasn't depressed, that I was just being a pussy, but damn man. I might just be really depressed.",4,anxiety

There will be a form to fill out. Information on passport photos. What documents & IDs you'll need, etc.

##Where to Apply

[Then you'll need to see which avenue you'll need to apply at](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/where-to-apply.html). This could be an acceptance facility like a local USPS office, an actual Passport Agency, or via mail (for renewals).

[If you are applying Outside of the US please see this information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/outside-us.html).

NOTE: Many locations still have COVID protocols and do not accept same day or walk ins. 


##Processing Times Within the US
As of Late March 2023, times have been extended.

[You can find the latest processing times here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html).

Normal processing is around 10-13 weeks.

Expedited processing is around 7-9 weeks. (You also have the option to expedite shipping from the facility, that is an added cost is an additional add-on to Expedited passports.)

Urgent processing within 3 business days. And you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date if you've not applied before. If you have you can only call within 5 business days of your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.

NOTE: This timing may not include shipping time. There have been issues in the past of USPS causing delays to and from the processing facilities and those delays are not accounted for in the official processing times.

NOTE: Some facilities may be quicker, others may take longer, the above time is the average. We have had users saying an additional week or two has sometimes been added onto the above processing times at certain facilities so do not assume the stated processing times are accurate. Do not book travel ""to the day"" of when the processing time says they could be done with processing the passport, because again, it does not include shipping times.

NOTE: It can take up to 2 weeks before your status changes to ""In Process"".

**Some people have gotten their recently submitted expedited passports quicker than stated times BUT NOT ALL. Do not plan on being lucky, get your application in early and expedited as needed.**

**Many people are saying that both Normal and Expedited processing is taking weeks longer than the above-listed processing time.**

#Frequently Asked Questions for Applying Within the US

### What is the status of my application?

Check here: https://passportstatus.state.gov/

### They cashed my check, does that mean my passport is coming soon?

No. During covid they have been opening the submitted paperwork and cashing the check first, and then often sitting on the paperwork for up to 2-6 weeks. Them cashing the check doesn't mean they are processing it or that everything is going well. 

Once they start processing it, if they find errors, or your paperwork, IDs, etc aren't in order you may hear from them and be told how to correct the issues.

### Can I get a same day passport.

Not likely during covid since they aren't taking walk in appointments.

### My trip is in a few days and I just realized I don't have my passport/it's lost/it's expired/whatever, HELP WHAT DO I DO?

In all honesty you are pretty much SOL. [It is almost impossible to get the Urgent/Life or Death/Emergency in-person appointments](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/emergencies.html). For these urgent appointments you must call them directly via the phone numbers on the above link. If you are trying to go that route you'll need to look at any location you can realistically get to INCLUDING flying to them. 

Note that many people have faked life or death/emergency reasons so this is making it nearly impossible to get these appointments.

Otherwise you may be better off calling all your pre-booked vacation expenses and see if you have any options to postpone or refund your now-not-happening-trip. 

### Can I switch my application from Regular Processing to Expedited? 

Yes. Expedited service costs an additional $60. If you applied and have not received your passport, you may call the National Passport Information Center at 1-877-487-2778 and receive instructions on how request to expedite your passport. 

NOTE: It can take 20 days to fulfill this request.

NOTE: This is just a request, sometimes it cannot be honored. Regular Passports are processed at a different facility than Expedited ones. So they need to FIND your application paperwork in order to be able to switch the processing. 


### I submitted my passport ages ago but my status hasn't changed/its been WAY past the processing times quoted on the website.

There may be a problem. Try contacting the State Department/Passport Office, or reach out to your state State Representatives. They actually can often help with speeding along passports and fixing issues when they get stuck in the system.

### My ""Status"" on the website says ""Not Available""

It can take up to 2-6 weeks for your status to change to In-Progress.

### How do I find my State Representatives who can assist me?

[This link will help you for your State House Represenative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) or [you can also try your Senator](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm). Once you are in contact and have asked for help on your passport application you may be asked to fill out a privacy form or other paperwork allowing your representative to work on your behalf. Make sure to follow up quickly to keep the ball rolling.

### Can I buy a flight that shows I'm leaving within 3 business days, get my passport, and then cancel the flight/Can I fake a family emergency? 

No, you'll need to provide proof of your emergency. 

### Can I buy a flight that shows I'm leaving in 2 weeks, book the Urgent in-person appointment that would be within 72 hours of that flight, get my passport, and then cancel the flight? 

Yes, but given that those appointments are still supposed to be for urgent/emergencies and right now those appointments are VERY hard to get even if you have a valid reason.

For those doing these in-person appointment, you'll get your passport within a few hours or a day or two from the appointment. They'll factor in your urgency, what wiggle room you have, and the other needs to figure out what priority yours will be. But you will get it within 72 hours.

### What about using a 3rd Party Rush/Expediting Service/Courier/Expeditor?

DO NOT USE THESE!!!

There is no magical service (other than contacting your state's house of representatives) that can get you your passport quicker than official channels. You are instead paying a shit ton of money for someone else to do any of the above steps and faster processing isn't guaranteed or possible. As well as there are many outright scam companies out there. I would not recommend you give them your personal information. [See the official government info here on why you should not use these](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/courier-and-expeditor-companies.html).

### I'm an American currently abroad and my passport recently expired. I need to quickly return to USA, can I travel on an expired passport?

Not any longer this ended December 31st, 2021.

## Other Questions

### Can I travel internationally by air without a passport book?

For air travel, the airline won't even let you on your first initial flight if you do not have proper documentation and visas. This is because the airline will be penalized and fined if you are held and deported due to improper documentation/visas. 

A passport card cannot be used for air travel.

### Can I travel internationally by land without a passport?

We frequently get questions on this especially for the USA/Mexico border. Officially no, you actually do need a passport. Unofficially some people have reported getting INTO Mexico without a passport can be easier than coming BACK into the US without a passport.

### Can I travel internationally via a cruise without a passport?

We'd recommend hitting up /r/cruise as it may depend on your specific cruise. Some may not allow you on at all without a passport, others simply won't let you do shore excursions if you don't have a passport.

### I have dual citizenship, can I travel on my other passport instead?

While USA has no exit immigration, so you don't need to show your passport to exit, you are required to enter the USA on your American passport. You cannot use your other citizenship to get a visa to enter America on your other passport. So unless you are going to get your passport abroad at an Embassy/Consulate before you return, get your American passport before you go.


### What is the difference between a Passport Book and a Passport Card?

Card is for Land borders and some sea ports of entry. Think Canada, Mexico, Caribbean, Bermuda. You cannot use it for air travel.

If you plan on doing any air travel within the next 10 years get the passport book.

### Since US Embassies are processing passports faster (less than 6 weeks), how can I send my application there to be processed?

You can't. Embassies only process passports for people in-person and in-country. 

Also, if your travel is soon and you are headed back to the US, you'll be given a limited-use Emergency Passport that can only be used to travel back to the US.

So the ""Why don't I just fly to Mexico on my soon to be expiring passport and apply at the embassy there?"" idea only works if you are in Mexico for 6+ weeks and if you have a current valid passport to even enter Mexico (or insert whatever other US Embassy you were asking about.)

### I've heard about ""6 Month Validity Rule"" what is it and what does it mean?

Some countries require the passport to still be valid 6 months after entry (or exit). This is to ensure you have valid documents to be able to exit the country. Some countries do not have this requirement, some require it to be 3 months, etc.

But the easiest way to think about it is your passport actually expires 6 months early. And so its best to renew it before that time.


### I lost my passport, reported it lost, and now just found the original one, can I travel on it?

No. Once reported lost/stolen its deactivated and cannot be used for travel. You should put a hole through a corner of the passport or otherwise make it clear it cannot be used so you don't accidentally bring it to the airport.

### I lost my passport, but have a photo copy. Am I okay to travel?

NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


### I got part of my order but didn't get my old passport/new passport/passport card/my ID documents?!?

They'll come in separate shipments.


### I forgot my passport was in my maiden name/former name. Can I still use it for travel?

Your ticket must match your passport name. 

Note: There may be issues if your vaccine card/info is in a different name than the passport/ticketed name, but use the COVID Megathread for that question. 


### How can I get flight confirmation/book a flight if I don't have my passport? 

Unless you are booking with a 3rd party agency that charges for every little change, pretty much all airlines allow you to book with nonsense numbers (all 1's) and at a later time update your passport info, or even wait until check in, in-person to do so.

Many people do not have passports when they book flights, or they lose their passport, or their passport expires. They are fully aware that until they check the passport day-of, the information might not be correct or valid.

"As someone who deals with a variety of debilitating head pains on an (almost) daily basis, I've come to develop some pretty wild - and primal - thoughts about how I might relieve some of the pain in my skull. I've never acted on these thoughts, and do not plan to. Though... I do fantasize about them often. And, I wonder if anyone else here has similar thoughts. I'll list some of the pain relief fantasies I have down below:

1. Drilling a hole into my skull to relieve pressure. I know this is actually a real - and very ancient - medical technique known as ""trepanning"". I've had thoughts about doing this for awhile, even before I knew what it was. Since my head sometimes feels like it's going to explode, I wish I could just drill or hammer a chisel directly through my skull. I like to imagine a very satisfying sense of relief would result, but probably not. 

2. Using a scalpel or blade to cut the arteries in my temples to drain excess blood. Sometimes the arteries in my temples start throbbing with pain, usually during stressful situations. I fantasize about draining the blood to reduce the pressure in my head. I imagine a calming sensation after allowing the blood the flow.

3. Using a spoon or other instrument to shift (or completely remove) my eyeballs to relieve pressure. Oftentimes, my head pains derive directly behind my eyes; it feels like there's a ton of trapped air pushing my eyes forward. My instincts tell me to push my eyeballs to the side or remove them to allow the air to escape (I'm aware that there's no actual air - it just feels like it). I imagine a sense of euphoric relief after allowing the air to escape my sockets. 

These are just a few of the weird and primal pain relief treatments I imagine sometimes. When the medications don't work, sometimes you just feel like taking a more... direct approach. 

Though, like I've said, I've never acted on these thoughts before and don't plan to. I'm currently seeing a medical professional for my head issues and I suggest everyone do the same - find a renown headache specialist in your area.

"Hey, I am 17 and am in seemingly good health. So I’ve had a constant headache for the last 2 months. When it started, I thought I was getting a migraine. I have probably had like 5 or 6 migraines in the last 5 years. My head does not usually hurt when I get a migraine; I just get auras and a lot of numbness, and it goes away in a hour if I sleep it off/ or stay in a dark room. This time my face started tingling/burning, and then I started getting pressure in my eye that turned into a dull headache that still remains. The following days I had a really stuffy nose, so I thought maybe I had a sinus infection. The doctors agreed, and they put me on a course of antibiotics, and after no avail, I got a sinus CT, and it was clear. Sometimes the top of my head tingles, and my jaw and neck hurt. I have tried NSAIDs, the chiropractor, acupuncture, antibiotics, vitamins (magnesium, b complex, turmeric, etc), but nothing has seemed to help. Before onset of the headache, my neck was hurting for a couple hours. Also about two years ago, I was having off and on headaches (some would last hours some days), but they went away when I started seeing a chiropractor. Something else that is notable is that I am like 10 days late on my period; sometimes, I miss my period if I am stressed. I also got my braces off 10 days before I started experiencing this headache. I have had tmj and ear ringing since I was like 10, but it has never caused issues. I also have anxiety. The headache pain ranges from a 2-6. It gets worse when I am not doing anything. Sometimes when I go do stuff, it gets a little better, but I can definitely still feel it all the time. I am not light sensitive. The first week I was nauseated, but now, I rarely am. This whole situation has made my anxiety a lot worse. Before onset, I was not unusually anxious. I do not eat the best, but I can’t see how that would cause such a long headache. This is starting to really affect me, and if it lasts much longer I will seriously loose my will to live. I think the onset is really strange between the neck pain and runny nose, so I am just confused. I am working towards seeing a neurologist/ headache specialist. I am really struggling, and any two sense or suggestions would be helpful. I really want to get this figured out/ managed before I go to college in the fall which is making me even more stressed.

"i work at home depot, and it’s probably been one of the worst jobs i’ve ever gotten so far with what little work experience i have.

it’s incredibly social, physical, and they didn’t train me at all. i’m overwhelmed and clueless.

the person who was supposed to train me just never does when she’s working, and everyone gives super vague answers to questions i ask 
(its incredibly hard for me to understand what they’re talking about because it’s full of abbreviations and zero specificity)

it also just feels so chaotic like there’s almost no sense of routine in the job, because it just always depends on who is there and what they want to do. 
i always get last choice on things

i know i should probably be advocating for myself more and continuing to press or ask more questions, but it’s been really difficult for me. 
sometimes it feels like i can’t even speak at all.

within my first day i broke down crying because another employee refused to show me where something was and instead gave me a vague explanation.

i’ve never told the places i’ve worked about my autism before because i am able to mask, so people often don’t believe me… 
but i’m starting to think i have to disclose my disability if i want to get actual proper training here or else i might just continue breaking down during every shift.",1,autism
"I don’t know how I’m going to live like this. Some days I get up, take my medication and have my little to do list but I’m so unmotivated and unhappy that I just have to crawl back into bed. I have a job that is what I always wanted that gives me flexible hours and lets me do what I love but I still resent that. It makes me feel like a spoiled brat. 

Absolutely Everything feels like a chore except binge eating, drinking with friends to the point of black out, doing drugs, spending money on vanity, and sleeping. 

I feel like I’m filling with poison and can’t even talk to family or friends sober without it feeling a chore. Everything has to be intense and to the max or I don’t want it at all. My self esteem is at an all time low because I don’t know why I can’t just enjoy things and go for a walk and smell the flowers- boredom doesn’t feel mundane it feels like it’s actually excruciating. 

I feel like I’ve tried so many different doctors and meds and psychs and none of them have worked for me for very long. I try so hard to have periods of exercising in the morning and less screen time and trying every new hobby I can think of and every single time I come back to the same place- lying in bed at midday feeling like my life is completely pointless and vapid.
I even recently tried just booking tickets to different states in my country and working in different places (I can work remotely) and I still just found myself not even wanting to explore wherever I was unless I had a bottle of vodka in my purse to do it with. I preferred staying in my Airbnb alone and rotting in bed. 

I don’t even feel I can tell the people in my life this because it feels offensive given how
Privileged I am (I have a job, friends, relationship, enough money, my own place, access to health resources etc) 
I want to love life so badly and I know there are times when I do but I just wish I could be re born as a completely different woman with a different brain. 
I wish I could love watching a sunrise or sunset without being under the influence. 
I wish I at least knew that one day this cycle would change and I could find more peace being alive.",3,adhd
"It's been a few days since my budgie ciel died.The first day felt strange,i don't know how to explain it but it just didn't feel that horrible.The next days became worse,i believe that's when it finally hit me,maybe i was still in denial about the whole thing but i'm not sure,however i know that it was only after i buried him that i was at my worst.

Ciel was given to me as a gift by a relative,i never even thought about getting a pet bird,but when i did i fell in love with him,he was so gentle,cute and very sweet,the most innocent creature in my world and my best friend...Now he's gone.

I feel awful,it was all my fault.I wish he had a different owner ,maybe that way he wouldn't have died so soon.What hurts me the most is that i know i could have done better,for the past two months i wasn't able to spend much time with him because i have an internship,so i'm not at home during the day,and when i'm back i have to go work on my assignments and some college projects.Of course he would be in my room while im doing my work but i was mostly focusing on the tasks i had,it was a really tough time for me because of all the things i had to do,but i hate myself for it,i should have spent more time with him.

I have no idea why he passed away,was he sick?or maybe being alone affected his health?I can't know the reason anymore,but during his last week he slept a lot more than usual,he seemed so weak to me,he wasn't as energetic as he used to be and i was really worried for him,he was probably sick,i wanted to take him to the vet but i could not afford it,seeing him that way broke my heart i even cried that day,i had a feeling that he was dying,i don't know why or how but i just felt it,that he only had so little left to live.I refused to believe it..i told myself that i was just paranoid and that he was going to be better soon,that i was wrong and that there was no way he was dying.I was going to buy him a friend that weekend,i went to the pet store and the guy working there told me there were no budgies left but on sunday he would be bringing them.I was happy ,now he was getting some company!But the next day i woke up a bit late,my sister came into my room and told me the news,all she said was one word: ""Ciel..."", and i understood.

That day i was still composed,now i can barely do anything right,i'm thinking about him 24/7,i have a report ive been writing and sometimes id just burst out in tears,i can't even count how many times i have cried in the last few days,it's the worst thing that has ever happened in my life.I was depressed years ago but nothing comes close to losing someone dear to you,it's too much..it hurts too much,the pain,sadness and regrets...his death absolutely shattered me.I cannot do anything without thinking about him,he's always on my mind.Earlier i was going through my gallery looking for some screenshots and i saw a picture of him i had taken before,i couldn't look at it,i looked away the moment i spotted it and i put my phone away,i don't understand why but i cannot bring myself to look at any of his photos.

Today i woke up and i realized once again that i didn't tell him goodnight the day before,it was something i always did when he was still with me,and now i feel empty.When im in the kitchen i unconsciously think about how its time to give him his food,but the next second im reminded that he's not here anymore.

I miss him a lot,i want to see him and listen to his cute chirps again,i want to see him healthy and happy...I try to tell myself that he is in a better place now,but it doesn't help at all,in fact all it does is hurt and make me cry again.Why did he have to go?Why so soon?I wanted to do so many things for him,i was going to get a job soon,then i'd be able to give him many things, take him to a vet,buy him toys,and just take better care of him..but he left without all of that..before i even had the chance to do anything for him,i hate myself for not being able to provide things for him before he died,i feel so guilty for not being a good owner.It's all my fault..

It's so unfair..I just want him back..",2,depression

"Throwaway account first of all. I don't usually make posts. I think I'm just looking for some semblance of connection with someone. I'm a father and husband. My wife and I have been together for over 5 years, got married and had a kid. I have a decent job in my field that I studied for in school. Wife works as well but has no education, so her options are limited. I make more than twice what she does, but even with both incomes, money is tight. I stress a lot, and when I do it also stresses her out and makes her feel like she isn't doing enough. 

In my younger years I was very openly angry, meaning I had a temper and would be rude and nasty. Which is ironic. Because these days, I'm very controlled in how I handle my anger. In fact, I'm so good at controlling them, I've also learned that it's best that I stow most negative emotions deep within so she won't know that I'm stressed, down, and frankly, depressed. She notices at times that there may be something off, but these days I just tell her that I'm okay and we're okay and that everything is good. I keep daily life going and make sure all is taken care of. Our kid, daily duties, etc. 

I think that my negative emotions, even though they're calmly expressed, they tend to end up in an argument. I think I expected my life to be less stressful at this point. I'd have a house, enough money to save, that in the event that I died, my family would be okay. Of course there's so much more to all this, but I'm frankly tired of everything to the point that's it's hard to fully explain. I'm just exhausted. It's tired of pretending. 

Today, I finally took it upon myself to look for a psychologist. I got a call that the one that I had chosen wasn't even accepting patients. So back to the drawing board on that one. I'm finding myself less and less interested in home life. Work feels like the only escape I have, and I get burnt out with that too after a while.

Is it constant or does it happen in, (for lack of better words) episodes?

What is it like and how does it feel to have one of these ""episodes""?

Is the whole thing about hearing voices real or just an over-exaggeration and if it is are the voices your own or are they different?

How hard is it to live with schizophrenia? 

What's the worst or best part of it(if there even are positives)?

Is there anything I shouldn't do/say around someone with schizophrenia that could trigger some kind of episode (if that's even how it works) or would be offensive?

"Hi, I don’t know how to continue with my life. 
A bit of contest here. 
I’m 21f and I was diagnosed with depression in the last months by my therapist. I always had depressing thoughts during my life and also some suicidal ones but I’ve never ever done anything in the concrete, I think I was too scared (just one time I tried to take a lot of meds together but I stopped and asked for help). 
I never considered myself ill, nor everyone around me. I have the perfect family and I live in a privileged contest, middle class kind (not rich but I always had what I wanted). Others think I’m a pretty girl, skinny and very gifted in social contests, outgoing, always first in my classes with fantastic grades, not very good at sports but it’s not important. I’m very empathetic and always had some kind of “perception of the deepness” around me, and my therapist says it’s a gift. I write, sing, and have too many hobbies including gaming, reading, painting and so on. I’m the gifted kid of the extended family and the good girl type, that did something rebel only one or two times. Now I study history and work as an emergency rescuer. I have tons of friends in real life and also online. I wanna be a writer.
I have the perfect life, I’m convinced that I’m so lucky and I just don’t understand why I am … I am depressed. I know I had problems in my growing. I was the loser, always bullied by everyone and against me there was intellectual and actual violence. I had to be always perfect because of my parents and my family, I am the first of the grandchildrens and so I’m the role model. At 19 I had a toxic relationship that leaved me with the fear of love and also a little stomach sindrome caused by anxiety, but never less, I didn’t have a real trauma. A REAL one like a bad family or rape or something like that. I always been dark and sad all my life and i know that when I was a child I was so happy and a little overwhelming so others will call me “strange” or “freak” but I was so innocent and wanted the friendship of all of them. (I want to return to be that happy, like a child.)but this was never something like real real trauma.
Now I’m here, trapped in my bed every time I return from work. When I am at work I am someone that is happy and I help others and fight in very difficult situation but when i return home I just turn off. The worse thing it’s that I’m numb every time, also when I am happy at work. I worsened in the last weeks and I’m trying to don’t see my friends and it’s working. I have a deadline for my university studies soon and I didn’t study. I feel useless and I hate so much myself. I hate the way I look, the way I act, the way I think and the way I am. I hate every inch of my being in this world. I want to see my self being wrong and fall into the deep end. I love my friends and I will do anything for them, they deserve the world and I want to cancel myself for them. Right now I have only two girl friends that I try to be in contact with but three days ago I messed up over a very stupid thing because I panicked and with my anxiety I didn’t responded to them. Part of me don’t want to lose them but the other part knows I want to be alone cause I think I deserve to suffer, I deserve cause I’m an horrible person. I feel like an impostor that it’s acting all her life and everyone just sees the good things while I’m so horrible and selfish. My therapist it’s trying to convince me that it’s all in my head but I don’t believe her. I sincerely think I am a freak, a bad person, a sociopath of some kind. I don’t deserve the life I have and had , I don’t now why I had such a good childhood and I will happily switch it with someone more worth of my family and the ppl I have around me. I don’t deserve anything. Im wrong. And now my two bff are so angry with me, I tried to explain them I panicked and I wanted to write to them, not ignore them, but I didn’t have the courage because im so scared of the anger of others. If they go away how will I do? It will be the end? I’m not lucid, idk what is happening in me or around me I just wanna sleep all the time. I try to seek help from my Parents but they are convinced it’s the period cause it’s spring and everyone it’s a little sad and tired and I said to them that I have depression but everyone it’s a little depressed don’t you think? I don’t know what am I doing and I don’t know how I will live a peaceful life if it will be always like this. I feel so alone and if I try to explain I just seems to victimise myself so the others Will be around me. Am I doing it? I don’t know anymore. 
I don’t want to un live myself but I don’t want to live also right now. How can I go on? 
I hate myself so much cause I just created problems when my life it’s perfect. I’m such a loser, a drama queen, idk, just a fucking pathetic self-centred girl with a god complex i think 
I don’t want to call my therapist, I’m scared
I’m always so scared 
How can I do
I just can write this on the internet to totals strangers

I’m 21M and my whole life I’ve been lazy and unmotivated then I started having anxiety, fear, insecurities, and depression. I’ve seen a couple therapists before, they didn’t help me at all and now, I’m seeing my third therapist. She is better than the previous ones but I still feel like I’m not making any progress. I also started seeing a psychiatrist because I thought I had ADHD and started stimulants but it doesn’t seem they’re working. I don’t know what to do anymore. I am a failure and my life is slipping away. Is it possible for me to change and be a happy person one day? Were you in a situation similar to mine and were able to turn your life around?

"So about a month ago I posted here saying I was paranoid about being spied on by my folks. Turns out it was completely true, as my mother talked to me about how her boyfriend started rummaging through my stuff in the bathroom and reported it to her.",5,paranoia
This all started when I was younger and my dad and stepmom (mom died when I was 7) would sit downstairs in the room above mine and listen and monitor every little movement and noise I made. This made me very paranoid my whole life and I know any movement or noise I make will be met with punishment. They expect me to be downstairs with them all day every day and to listen and talk about them all the time. Anytime I try and talk about myself or something I’m dealing with it’s always a story from her or my dad about how they had a similar experience when they were my age and “understand what I’m going through” Then they will continue talking about themselves and how great they are. Now the eavesdropping and creepy behavior didn’t stop when I got older. It got worse. We only have 2 bathrooms in my house and one is upstairs near my room. The kitchen is right above that bathroom so they would whenever I went to use the bathroom go in the kitchen and listen. Then my stepmom would always come upstairs and wait in her room for me to finish. Then not the second I opened the door she acts like she wasn’t just listening to me and walks back downstairs. She always would comment about the smell always telling me to light a candle or you need to ask your dad for some airwick. She would always go in the bathroom after I was done and always listen and be around when I did. Now that I’m older and still live at home I can’t even use the bathroom anymore. I haven’t used the bathroom at home in over a year. I’m gonna need years of therapy and behavioral therapy just to reverse all the trauma and damage they did. I always think no matter what someone is listening and monitoring everything I do. They even watch the WI-FI to see exactly what I’m doing and looking up. I have never in my life been around people who treat someone like this just because they need attention.,5,paranoia

No one is raising the appropriate minimum wage. If it's us ordinary people who have to mobilize and fight back, well, in Canada and USA, both countries are far too large and brainwashed to achieve the things that France has.

Look, why is living so valued anyway? Any good moment you have is going to be followed up by plenty of self doubt, negative events, struggle, and disappointment... It's like 5 to 1 ratio of stupid shit for every good thing that happens.

Don't want kids. Can barely afford my living conditions (credit cards in the red). I don't believe in working a job you hate to afford life... Because that is NOT living.

Plus... Chemical imbalance in the brain. Been fighting it for almost 20 years now. Dad died when I was in grade 9... Mom died in pandemic. Feel lack of connection with aunts and uncles.

"I'm 18 and I can't sleep. I used to watch a lot of horror movies when I was 12 and stopped being into horror at 14, so it's been 4 years since I watched SCARY SCARY movies, the last horror movie I watched was Dr. Sleep which for me isn't horror and it was long ago. The thing is I was never afraid, I never once thought that the monster from a movie will come and kill me. I was never scared, until 3 weeks ago. All of a sudden I am seeing shadows in the dark like I see a silhouette in pure dark, I'm thinking a killer is in my closet, behind the desk, next to me, and I can't sleep. Even when I turn the lights on and see that nothing is in my room I can't leave my room to go the bathroom because of the killer in the hallway. I didn't sleep in the last 3 days at all.

"I’m on mobile sorry for bad grammar and stuff. I’ll start with my downstairs neighbor let’s call him h-man. His daughter is constantly crying and yelling. While taking out the trash one day I saw they have a huge tv though a window with open blinds. It’s most likely that h-man is a hard worker with a young or autistic daughter. But a part of me thinks he’s (I don’t feel comfortable typing it) but it involves $$ and humans in this case a child. I’ve never seen her leave the house. Now I talk about my neighbors across from me. They are junkies. People go over there all the time. One of them once yelled “I’m so high!” Keep in mind the space in between apartment is like 10 feet plus were ever she was in her place. The most recent incident was when I was watching a movie in my living room, when the door handle was jiggled I assumed it was my dad and went to unlock it when I heard high girl laughing her ass off. I think they are dealing but I know the people in the building next to ours are. (Random people go into the building a leave shortly there after) and know my next fort neighbors. A couple going through a rough patch. Fist of all they fight a lot. And a couple days ago I heard the dropping of metal (like lead pipes hitting the floor in movies) and then beating sounds. They vape as well. But the weirdest thing about them is they shower late at night. I think the latest was around 10:30-11:00 pm. I don’t know what I think about them Im just scared of them.

"Long story short.... Used opiates from 17 to 22 been clean since. Then in 2018 life hit me hard with loss and other stuff and I got on meth. I used it hard.... Hard.... For 3-4 years. Ten days awake at times I went into plenty of scary psychosis... Had delusions of grandeur... Persecution complexes. 

Then I hit rehab and wanted to and got clean and have 7 months plus now! The first 6 months were relatively easy. But the past two months I've been having the same recurring meltdown or psychosis for an hour or even day. 

I'm just really frustrated. I moved back in with my parents, older brother lives here, they all support me though I believe my brother enjoys making fun of the failures in my life. 

For example two days ago I had a good day, woke up at 8 am, showered. Worked 5 hours. Around 8 pm at the house all the sudden something took over me ... I got very anxious and fearful and was having delusional thoughts my brother was in the CIA and my parents only kept me around here to make fun of the loser I have become (yes I am self demeaning at times). 

My dad asks what's wrong and I just say something is not right. Then my half drunk mom comes in, mind you I'm in my 30s and she's 60s and goes ""is this because you don't have a girlfriend"" which I laugh at now, but it didn't feel natural and almost like she wants to gaslight me and make it worse. I'm having a panic attack or delusion and she brings up the negative aspects of my life unrelated.... Well I think.

Anyway. I wanted to post and get some feedback because it happened again tonight not as severe. Nothing like the week long psychosis I would have binging on meth with no food or liquids thinking there were cameras everywhere watching me for the world to watch etc......

But damn. 7 months clean and I guess it's brain damage? Can anyone relate after getting clean from major meth use and the mental and psychological side effects. Nothing is scarier than thinking reality is fake or that I'm being streamed live in hidden cameras for the world to see a loser that destroyed his mind and mental health with METH.

"I (27F from the UK) have had classic IBS symptoms since I was a pre-teen. I was diagnosed with Coeliac aged 20 and have been on a GF diet ever since which has been fine. For the last 6 months I’ve been having what I can only describe as a prolonged flare up of debilitating symptoms which include:

- Alternate diarrhea and constipation, there is no middle ground despite a really balanced diet. 
- Weight loss (about 20lbs in 4 weeks). 
- Fatigue to the point where I sometimes just pass out from sheer exhaustion. 
- Explosive and urgent diarrhea with about 30 seconds warning. 
- Pinching and burning sensations. JFC sometimes my intestines feel like they’re on fire. 
- Abdominal pain 24/7 that gets much worse when I eat anything at all. 
- Bleeding (bright red) with BM’s. 
- Painful BM’s. 
- Abdominal spasms (centre upper area) that I can literally watch happening. 
- Absolutely zero appetite. 
- Noisy ‘bubbling’ sounds in upper abdo. 
- Nausea. 

I had a FIT test and a separate sample sent off. Both came back negative. Leading a normal life is becoming impossible, I feel like I can’t trust my own body. When I’m having a few golden hours of relief, they can come back full force with no warning. My GP has given me a ‘non-urgent’ referral for a colonoscopy due to the weight loss.

"Dear schizophrenics, 

I want to warn you about flat earth. I didn’t really study this stuff much when I was young, and got stuck in it for a year or 2, and had to study my way out of it… I was a slow/lazy researcher, and kept letting it get hold of me, and it would make me delusional.

Please don’t get caught in flat or hollow earth.

Do your best to study.

This stuff can really mess with your mind until you grow enough to understand it. Don’t become delusional with it.

Eratosthenes experiment isn’t the same on a flat earth… don’t let people confuse you about it. Think about what a shadow would look like on a stick at the North Pole, with the sun hitting it from the side, with parallel rays (not mentioning tilt). Hollow earth would have inward pointing shadows due to an opposite curve. Sticks in the ground with shadows really can prove a lot.

South celestial pole is not possible on flat earth.

Moon and sun somehow magically float on flat earth and hollow earth.

The North Star disappears once you go south far enough.

Clocks speed up, and gravity is less at higher altitudes.

Meteors somehow make it through the flat earth dome.

The flat earth excuse for seasons is the sun moving further out on the flat earth map, but that would technically mean a longer day due to the sun doing a bigger circle. And doesn’t explain the analemma properly, and in Australia in summer, the sun actually appears to curve south during sunset, due to the angle and tilt…  

Personally, I still think the moon and mars stuff is dodgy looking… but they aren’t 100% messing with us about the shape of earth… their camera angles do suck tho…

Don’t let yourself start thinking science is stupid, like I basically was… keep trying!",6,schizophrenia
"Once every while it happens. I see a post from one of you where you stand up for yourself only to immediately retreat and apologize when the other person plays the victim. I know many of us are weak to manipulation because these kinds of things are simply our Achilles heel. I'm not sure who needs to hear this among us, but don't let them do this to you. 

The reason why we stand up for ourselves is because people from time to time cross our boundaries and we have to enforce said boundaries to preserve our mental health. Your boundaries are completely up to you and you will likely surround yourself with different people depending on what they are. Enforcing boundaries against people who do not give them the respect they deserve is never wrong. Do not be afraid to do it. Everybody is entitled to respect. You too. 

A lot of you will paddle back and apologize because we are easily manipulated. But even then we can do our best to arm ourselves against it. There are actually many common strategies that manipulators use like gaslighting or guilt tripping. It's vital to be informed of these behaviours because it will allow you to pinpoint such strategies and know how to respond to them or prepare for what comes next. Please understand this. If you apologize, they win. And if they see that they can easily trample over your boundaries, it only invites them to do it more cause they now know you're an easy target. It might feel like the polite or civil thing to do, but it's the wrong course of action. Stand your ground. I'm sure you have your reasons for calling people out. Respect your reasons. 

The world is a good place, but at times it can also be really nasty and bad people can often take advantage of people who can't resist them in really vile ways. This is my attempt to look out for people who need to hear this. Look after yourself, folks. And if you can, look after people who need you to do it for them.",1,autism

"For 8 years now I have been playing video games as my main source of entertainment. Gaming does something for me that movies and TV shows haven't really been able to achieve. I would say it's the immersion and flexibility of the stories in video games that I really like in comparison. 

Around 2021 though I got progressively more burnt out of videogames. This was around when I played through all campaigns of Halo: MCC on Heroic difficulty. I felt pretty good and played a bunch of multiplayer. I didn't really have anybody to play with on that game, so I got bored after a while (110 hours). I noticed afterwards though that I would spend more and more time on the library screen, scrolling through trying to figure out what would be a good game to play next. It got to a point where I got stressed by the scrolling and zoned out on Youtube. 

It wasn't all bad though, it gave me more opportunity to discover more hobbies and activities. I've been more social, I drew more art, and I recently discovered a love for directive writing. What bugs me nowadays though is that I would still have moments where I really wanted to play a game, but I would just scroll though and end up not playing anything. The only opportune times I played a video game was when my friends were playing a game on Steam or Roblox and I joined them for 1-3 hours. 

There's many reasons I have come up with too on why I'm so burnt out on games, not finding the right genre, not playing with the right groups, shying away from stranger players on MMOs. Those are some of the surface issues that I have with games, and it's not the lack of games that bother me, but rather I think it's an issue with really getting into the game that I'm playing. I've struggled recently to invest myself into a game, and it's caused me to close the game in the mid stages of a campaign or a storyline. 

Recently I tried playing RP and MMO games, but I notice that in those games I get really shy, even more so then in public, (it mostly stems from toxic players online). I also got hooked onto Dwarf Fortress for a bit, getting invested in it's complexity, but then I got bored of it too, unprompted and without reason. 

I'm hoping that I can find a spark sometime for games, I feel that it fulfills me emotionally and it sharpens my strategic, perceptive, and reflexive skill. If anyone here on this forum knows/feels gamer burnout too let me know, I'm still semi-fresh on my own super powers :) .",1,autism

"I know it’s an absolute cliché— everyone wants to be young again, even if it’s for a day. It’s practically in our nature to cling to the past and miss the old days. 

But man, is it the most depressing thing (for me.) I’ve struggled with depression for about 10 years or so, my therapists have attributed it to an after effect of anxiety. I’ll momentarily have *up* weeks, but majority of the time— I’m depressed. It started because of a variety of other reasons, but recently it’s been nostalgia related.

I’m just turning 20, so I’m not far from my infantile days; I can still remember vivid details down to at least 3 years old. I’ve been missing my little friends, the ignorant bliss, my grandparents (who’ve passed), and it stings because it feels like more and more memories pop up every day.

Turning 20 has really given me a wake up call, I know I’m not old but I’m at most 1/5 through my life. It’s just crazy to suddenly realize: shit. Im really like UP here now. Im a genuine adult. 

I worry about future me missing the time that I’m spending right now, and all of the people that I’ll inevitably miss. I live in constant fear and denial of loss. I’ve recently tried meditation and practicing Buddhism, but it’s difficult for me to adhere to a genuine hobby or thought process. For the most part, my medication, therapy, and (as dumb as it sounds) philosophy have kept my spirits up.

"I didn't go to pre-K, I did go to a morning class but I never went to pre-k. In 1st grade I went half days, and my mom would take me out in the afternoons. I did go to a homeschooling teacher for a little while, I can't remember how I did. Then 2nd through 4th grade I went normally. Then, she took me out to homeschool me, it didn't work out so she stuck me back in later in the year. 

I surely fell behind because I couldn't stay focused on my schoolwork at home, that's why my mom put me back in public schooling. Which I'm thankful for. I missed a lot of school through my education years, due to an illness I had which had me vomiting quite frequently. They took me out of class for math because I fell behind, and I had comprehension issues due to my ADHD. I have attention deficits. But, now it's gotten better. In 5th grade towards the end of the year they brought up to my mom they would like to place me on an IEP due to falling behind in a few subjects; Reading and Mathematics.

Fast forward to current time, given I was in an IEP I feel like I'm intellectually or developmentally delayed. I feel like I'm slow, I currently live at home and work in the hospital as a certified nursing assistant. I work full time, but I feel dumb. I pay rent at home even though I'm so bad with money it's insane. I'm impulsive with money especially, I prioritize things badly. I know I'm doing it too, it's just like impulsive. It's weird. I have bad anxiety, social anxiety as well.. anxiety for every situation it seems like. I've gone to therapy for it, because I feel like I'm existing... not living. My therapist says that given that I was able to pass my CNA state certification I'd have to be average or above average in intelligence to even pass it. 

I feel like everyone around me knows something is ""off"". Even though I haven't heard it, I'm sure they talk? I don't really care about anything else anyone has to say BUT the thought of them thinking that I'd be slow or intellectually delayed bothers me. As a kid I walked and talked on time, and passed my childhood milestones. It wasn't ever indicated I was intellectually delayed. 

I got employee of the month 2 months being in the hospital, but I've made big mistakes no one got hurt. I've been a CNA 4 years prior. These nurses are my age and younger and they seem so mature. I feel like sometimes I feel dumb and inadequate. I'm quiet, but I want to be smart and an intellectual. They always say how a hard job I do. These nurses hangout and are friends with each other. I feel out of sorts here. There's been times where they come sit by me cause I sit away from them. Do you think they think something is off? They seem to like me and keep me included.

I was abused and have cptsd so the thought of ""another thing wrong with me"" was too much. I have 2 other undergraduates in unrelated fields that i wasn't ever able to use. 

Finally, I have a real engineering job. I spent 4 years as a technician and was able to break out. I've been here for 1.5 years. I feel so dumb. Everyone around me has this vast amount of knowledge and even though, yes, they have more experience on the job, this is stuff I should have learned in school but didn't. Either because of my severe imposter syndrome/very high anxiety/other crap and/or being unmedicated. 
I feel like I remember nothing. Or I'm not able to think through situations because of the anxiety/shame spirals. I spend forever researching ""basic"" things and the shame is horrible. It's like I didn't absorb anything! 5 years of education and it's gone? Did I ever really understand anything?

I still feel new to ADHD and maybe I'm missing something about how this all works. I don't understand how I can be ""smart"" but it takes hours of repetition to remember something and even then I have to review it again and again.
The tiniest details derail me. If I don't understand one small thing then I can't move forward. And if I ask questions about it, I feel like I look dumb because others around me 1.) Don't ask it and 2.) Look embarrassed that I don't know this, so I assume I've do e something wrong/""should know this"".

"As the title says, I’m currently pregnant and am in a flare. I have been in a flare for the best part of a year on and off. With only a couple of weeks respite between bad bouts. 
I must have conceived during a flare and have heard that if you conceive during a flare it usually lasts the whole pregnancy well, so far this statement is living up to be true. I have to add that during my flares I’m not so bad I need to be hospitalised but I am at my wits end. I have been back and forth to the GP no end of times and they’ve referred me to the hospital twice (urgently - so should be seen within 2 weeks) and I have had nothing! The hospital keep cancelling my appointment because they say I don’t need it as my UC is ‘mild’. This condition is debilitating, I barely leave the house, I can’t walk round the block without needing to get to a toilet urgently - I am having bad braxton hicks which makes it worse and I just really honestly don’t know what to do! I have never been on any medication for UC as I’ve never been so lucky as to get to see a consultant after my diagnosis through a letter they sent to my home.

"So I have had severe depression since I was 10. I also suffer from extreme OCD, ADHD and OCPD. It did a number on me as far as self esteem and confidence. Fast forward a few years and I was very lucky to get a get a girl that really supported me through thick and thin. Due to her I became highly functioning but everyday was a misery fest. Of late, last 6 months I have lost my job and am the lowest point of my life. I am 42 so no spring chicken. My wife has grown progressively tired of dealing with my issues for the last 23 years. She seems to be disengaging and charting a way for herself and my son. I can’t get up and pursue anything meaningful to save my life. Always plagued with guilt, regrets, doubts and FEAR. 

While I have savings right now that will last me a bit due to my high functioning years I can’t help but think what happens after that. Do people who can’t earn (like me anymore) and don’t have active family support just end up on the street, homeless and waiting for death. 

My biggest roadblock to any success is my own mental limitations. Am on 22 medication a day and just don’t see myself ever coming out of this black hole.

"I hate how media portrayals of autistic characters depict ""rudeness"" that is based on the assumption that we are deliberately and knowingly being rude because autism makes us uncaring. 

An example of a non-autistic character who is intentionally a dick is House. He is knowingly an asshole and has an excellent grasp of social skills that allow him to fine-tune his insults. However, this is portrayed as part of his personality and free choice, with some trauma and chronic pain mixed in. 

Tons of autistic or autistic ""drag"" characters (looking at you Sheldon fking Cooper) are portrayed as rude, but not because of the actual reasons that might cause an autistic person to unintentionally be rude. They're basically written as jerks who just dislike social conventions, rather than not understanding them. It's all part of this horrible mythos that we could be ""normal"" and we're choosing to act like this because we're assholess without empathy or desire for approval and human relationships.",1,autism

"Hi there,

I have been living with paranoia for all of my life.

Even before entering nursery school I can remember not being able to sleep because when I closed my eyes I felt like I was being watched.

A key memory of mine was in primary school where I sometimes ran to school as fast as I could because I was able to see shadow creatures far behind me when I moved my head quick enough. Even though it was exhausting it was better than the fear of being followed.

Over time it got worse enough that in secondary school I didn't go to school for a week because I the creatures were getting closer. Almost breaking of the intense fear the creatures just stopped appearing and I went on as if nothing happened.

Through secondary school I started to have moments where the creatures appeared again and over time the frequency started to increase. I was in school acting like usual and suddenly freezing, internally screaming and barely able to breath while a creature stands besides me, barely visible and terrorizing me with its gaze.

I thought often about telling someone about my issues with imaginary monsters but I didn't trust a single person and was scared to appear like a clown so I just lied when someone noticed it. I also considered suicide multiple times and I'm glad I never went through with it.

At some point when I was 20, covid had started, this state was permanent again and made me quit work, I hid in my room below my blanked. I only survived thanks to my roommate paying rent and giving me bread and water. (True MVP here)

I am only able to rely on my roomates telling as most of memories of that time are very blurry and dominated by extreme fear but I remember that I somehow started to actively suppress it. As suppressing it was very demanding I used weed to calm my mind while searching for other solutions and then I had a weird idea while being high.

By recognizing their existence (looking at them) which makes them look real (they usually were shadow/fog like) I got used to it and realized a few days ago that no matter how close they are, they just exist and can't be a danger to me.

&#x200B;

Currently I'm sitting in my room while a bunch of humanoid creatures are watching me which gives me a weird feeling of assurance and well-being, occasionally I look at them in awe for what my mind is able to create. I may struggle a bit with trusting others but that's something I just have to work on.

Is that a good way to accept my paranoia or do I sound insane? I honestly don't know but I'm generally more happy than ever.

Thank you very much for reading and it's very relieving to have written down what has been on my mind for a very long time.",5,paranoia

"I have been working in Sales for coming up to 10 years now. During that time i have struggled with Social Anxiety and Imposter Syndrome to varying degrees. At its best, i can just about manage to control it, at its worst it severely impacts my ability to articulate myself, communicate with colleagues/customers and focus on what i need to get done in any given day (I procrastinate a lot through the overwhelming feelings of the tasks at hand). I foolishly believed at certain milestones in my life/career that i would reach a point where my anxiety would dissipate but this is yet to happen for me. 

I am at an Industry event tomorrow where there will be lots of my current colleagues, people i know from other companies in the industry and of course prospective customers. 

My anxiety is playing havoc at the thought of this as i hate the expectation to ‘perform’ that these events bring. I feel like i am not good at small talk or that people won’t want to listen to what i have to say. I overthink what i want to say (i almost always play conversations out in my head) and think that the people who do speak to me are judging me and end up inevitably losing interest.

Having said all of the above, i am trying to get better at managing these feelings of anxiety and reframing my perception of them (It won’t be the end of the world, if i f**k up, will it?) to try and control it to the point where i can get by.

"So the ending left me wanting...something.  I had a theory brewing through the back half of the book that was never confirmed nor denied: Brother Charles McGarry is the father of Keira's baby.  
Evidence:  
\#1: The mere presence of the McGarrys (and specifically young Charles) is an obvious Chekhov's gun.  There is no real reason for him to keep popping up in the story, and the fact that he has a healthy baby boy with his wife is a reminder to the reader that this guy... gets after it.  
\#2: Brother Charles making house calls, especially with no one home besides Keira, is... odd.  Grisham clearly has no qualms about showing the ugly underbelly of American institutions (the court system, law enforcement), so why should the clergy be any different?  Brother Charles is new, doesn't know what he's doing, has a pregnant wife and is human... it might not have been force-able, but he tried to reach Keira on an intimate level and gave in to his human weakness.  
\#3 The time matches up.  If Brother Charles sowed his seed that late night in December, that lines up with Keira's due date, her knowledge of probably being pregnant the night Stu was killed, etc.  
\#4 Stu's idea to look at Keira seemed novel in the first chapter.  If this was a true first-parent perspective on his thought-process, it does not seem like the sort of thing he would think of as an afterthought.  The physical/verbal/emotional abuse was 100% happening... maybe the sexual abuse was embellished.  
\#5 Juror Carpenter calling out the ugliness we all know exists: Teenagers lie to get out of trouble.  Teenagers growing up in trauma are not 100% innocent.  
\#6 Stu was the perfect patsy.  He deserved everything he got for what he did to Josie and the family...but maybe the last straw to finally off him was to blame him for Keira's pregnancy, get Charles off the hook, and get him out of the Gambles' lives.  
No blood test, the adoption closed... not saying the Brigances knew anything, but it could be the byproduct of a cover-up initiated by the Gambles.",0,negative_samples

None of these hobbies are satisfactory, fun or fullfilling to me. After those long hours of studying and not achieving my unrealistic goals I go and try to have fun but I never do. I feel like a idiot wasting my time

I want to have fun in life but im not able to do so. That sensation of doing something you enjoy and having fun feels just so out of reach... and everyone else can just have fun but I dont.

How can I have  fun? My life feels so empty right now, I want to be happy",2,depression
"I would like to firstly say that I am not diagnosed with depression, but I feel like there's something wrong with me. Take this post more as a way for me to vent out my feelings and frustrations. I don't feel the need to hurt myself or anyone around me, so breathe easy.

I'm a 30 year old guy. During all my years up to this point, I have never felt understood. I try to be honest with people when I'm feeling down, but that always results in those people going away. I've always had these moments where, even unprovoked, I just fall into a pit of sadness and can't get out for a varying amount of time, usually from 1 day, up to maybe a week or two. During this time in the past I've tried reaching out to people, but now I just sit and wallow in my sadness.

I'm alone, ever since I moved out at 18 I've always lived alone. I've put my heart on the line and tried to make meaningful connections with some people, but it was never either the right time, or the feelings were unreciprocated. I don't blame the people for not feeling a certain way about me. But what hurts me the most is that because every time I've tried to find that special person who I would want to give my all to, who I want to make happy, it's never mutual. I'm left to feel alone, unwanted and unloved.

I've had partners, who I've been close with, who I've been intimate with, but I've never been in a committed relationship.

I don't think that I deserve anyone to feel a special way about me, I don't think I deserve someone to love me. But I want, at least once, for someone to feel that way about me. I want to feel like I matter to someone. And I know that I matter to the few close friends I have, and to my family. But that's different. People don't care about how a 30 year old man feels. They just don't. I don't care what anyone says, the feelings of a man are always disregarded and thrown away like a used napkin.

I'm lonely.",2,depression

"I hate this so much, I feel embarrassed for being unemployed. Everybody else my age has amazing jobs and everybody else is working really hard progressing in their career and making money and building families. Meanwhile I'm jobless af. I have had various jobs in the past.... In high school, I worked as a cashier and stayed there for 4 years. I had a few other part time jobs during college as well.

I graduated college with my bachelor's degree at the height of covid in 2020, and had the hardest time finding any employment. I remember spending entire days applying for jobs and just never hearing anything. I some interviews here and there, would study my ass off about the company and interview skills and make absolute sure I did my best, would send thank you letters and the whole nine yards, but would get ghosted every time. I would even be applying for jobs thousands of miles away just hoping anyone would take me. Eventually I landed one job.....a minimum wage barista position at Starbucks. It was the worst job I ever had, I was mistreated by manager and shift leads every day, vastly overqualified with a degree, got paid so little and the work was so strenuous. I ended up putting in my notice, and then getting fired one day before my last day because I just couldn't keep up and my manager just had it out for me. I got another job later on, but it was also very low pay and the work environment was so horrible and the commute was so bad, that I didn't even last beyond my first week.

I continued to apply for hundreds of jobs and never got any callbacks. On top of my dad constantly hounding at me for being unemployed and struggling with horrible depression and anxiety, eventually I got so burnt out and couldn't stand the thought of applying for jobs anymore. I had just been through 20 years of school and spending the last 10 of those working shitty minimum wage jobs at the same time, stressed out applying for hundreds of these jobs, writing endless cover letters, dressing up for interviews....and going nowhere. I just got so burnt out because of it. I'm currently living mostly off of an inheritance that my grandparents left me and my siblings.

I feel guilty that I don't have a job. But I just feel so anxious around the thought of applying for jobs and also getting trapped in a bad environment where I'll be mistreated again. I feel so anxious of giving up all of my days to work for a company that doesn't respect me, underpays me and could easily replace me. I feel anxious about learning the ropes at new jobs as most companies I worked for had horrible training and the first 3 months were always hell. And in general I feel so aimless because my degree isn't even what I want to do with my life. I feel that I also wasted my youth, I wanted to do so much more while I was still young. I wanted to travel and make friends and have fun experiences but I basically have to give all of those dreams up to work some underpaying job with back breaking hours for the rest of my life. It sounds like my definition of hell. I just keep waiting for the day where I'll have some revolutionary idea that will save me from this, but it never comes.",4,anxiety
"Having multiple different friends messaging me mostly every day, whether to have casual conversation or invite to something, has been really suffocating me recently. I feel bad for thinking this way since many other young adults, as well as some of my friends wish they had more friends / people asking them to hang out but that's why it's very hard to express. I love my friends, and I usually have a good time online and in person, but I have an extremely low social battery. 

When I spent 3 days in a row doing spending even a few hours with friends I'm drained, and I want at least a day or two to recover and spend on my own things. When I do something social, I feel like my entire day has gone out the window since it disturbs whatever plan I had laid out for myself. If I reject one invitation, I might still have 1 or 2 more to reject that day or a text conversation to hold for an hour or two while I'm trying to focus on something else. And it's not really good to say, ""I'd just prefer to go back to what I'm doing than talk to you right now"" when I don't necessarily interact with that individual a lot. Even if I'm not doing anything important at a given moment, losing this time unexpectedly usually means I won't keep up with other things I wanted to get done. I can explain that I have a low social battery and that these things are more taxing on me since I have ADHD, but none of my friends, even ones that also have other mental illnesses, understand how straining it is for me to keep up relationships, especially online ones or if I'm expected to be reaching out first. I told that to someone and they must've misunderstood it because they still try to start a conversation every day (sometimes multiple times if it fizzles out) and think it's not straining since I'm not initiating. (Said they ""would do all the heavy lifting"") 

Explaining this to friends, especially since they don't know all of my other friends are or how I've been dividing my time, sounds like me complaining I have too many friends and that I'm annoyed that they remember my existence lol. I can go weeks without messaging a friend first because I just haven't thought about it. With a lot of my friends over my life this has been completely normal and worked out fine, but its difficult when I have so many things to keep in check just in my own day to day life. 

I wouldn't trade having my friends for anything, and I could only imagine how terrible I would feel if I didn't have any, but it still often feels like an obligation to me. I got diagnosed in Fall 2022, so I'm still learning a lot about myself and unpacking things like this",3,adhd

"Hi I am new to this community!

There is something on my mind and I really hoped to be answered. As with title. Does people in your city/region have a tendency to make you feel bad/terrible/guilty for being born with an underlying condition such as a chronic migraine?

In my city, people here do. They’ll look and treat you differently as if you’re an inferior being, or someone that has gravely commited a sin. 

They’ll attribute it as being your karma and behave as though you ought to be ashamed and remorseful for being born with one. They’ll really try to make a point that you deserved to treat harshly as such since you probably might have done something terrible in your previous life, hence you are now born into this life with this condition. Some would also attribute their mean behavior towards you as them being benevolent, so as your past misdeeds in your “previous life” will be finally redeemed through your suffering through them.

I would really appreciate your experience coming from where you are from. Regardless if you did or never did.

If you could share which societies are more empathetic of such underlying condition and free of such misguided belief, please do share as well. I do not wish to spend the latter half of my life putting up with these.

It’s really cruel to myself if I continue to allow myself to be subjected by these terrible experience.",0,negative_samples

Started a yoga teacher training program in may, by march I was experiencing constipation for 2 weeks, which led to an internal hemorrhoid. 
Started adjusting my diet (so I could poo) and then comes the blood. Some of you might be able to relate but I also struggle with anemia, so when I see blood in my stool I take note. Before my diagnosis my hemoglobin was at a 6, so it’s something I have a lot of anxiety over. 
It wasn’t too bad and getting better until Saturday night. Imagine squeezing red food coloring into the toilet. Steady stream, just blood. It was like a faucet. I’m calling it a “watergun for blood” 
I went to yoga the next morning bc I was feeling okay and it was not a good practice. I felt so weak and woozy so I called my dad and told him what was happening and he told me it was time to go to the ER. Long day and lots of tests, inflammation, hemorrhoid, AND gallstones.

"Hi Everyone! So I’ve had GI issues all my life I am 28 now and started having issues since I was 12. It progressively gotten worse every year since that age. I have multiple diagnosis(s) such as Endometriosis, POTS and Fibromyalgia. In regard to my GI related issues I was only ever diagnosed with IBS-M , dairy intolerance and a gluten intolerance. I’ve went to several GI doctors around 3. I’ve only had blood testing done and 2 endoscopies done. First endoscopy as a child came back fine. My 2nd one which was in 2021 also came back fine but they also did a Sigmoidoscopy which showed inflammation and and a rectal ulcer. I had to repeat the sigmoidoscopy several times (awake) every time the biopsy would come back the same, showed “inflammation”. The GI doctor seemed to not know what to do or say and kept saying the results were not specific. I winded up moving and not going back to him as I wasn’t getting answers.

Now forward to this year and it’s just been worse I have rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, mucus in stool (usually just mucus by itself), nausea, abdominal cramping, anal pain/pressure, abdominal distention and I can’t seem to eat anything without feeling horrible or paying the consequences.

I was able to get in with a IBD clinic to test for IBD but the appointment is not for another 3 1/2 months…I’m really struggling and am seeking advice.

I'm literally worried of everything, and nothing seems to be able to distract me. I'm worried I won't be able to fall asleep, that I'll be tired, and that might lead to further seizures.

Then there are days like today when just maintaining enough mental focus to write this post is excruciating, much less trying to focus enough to actually do my freaking job or to get anything done on my to do list. I have literally spent the last 30 minutes rereading the same two or three paragraphs and then immediately forgetting what I am working on.",3,adhd
"I'm 39 and have never dealt with seasonal allergies. I'm in the Midwest US and I know allergy season is crazy this year. 
For the last 7 weeks my eyes are constantly swollen, watery, bright red and weepy. I have seen three doctors who all concur it's allergies. I take daily allergy meds, steroidal nasal spray, I use prescription eye drops and regular dry eye drops...cold compresses don't do much, I can't wear my contacts and some days it's so bad I can't even see to drive. It's 100x worse when it's sunny. If it's really bright I have a hard time keeping my eyes open. And even on ""good"" days, my vision is so blurry I can hardly see. (Right eye is worse.)
I am at my absolute wit's end. Can anyone relate and help save my poor eyeballs??

ETA: We have dogs who are outside a lot and sleep in my bed. I have cleaned my bedding multiple times and kicked them out and it's made no difference. I have locked myself indoors for multiple days at a time and no difference. I have checked every single detergent/facial and body product I use and I have used nothing different in this entire time. I also quit wearing eye make up.",0,negative_samples

"i know i have nothing going for me

i have a nervous breakdown whenever i try to work a job in real life.  i'm stuck in a shitty gig where nobody likes me that pays $200-$250 a month. i have learning disabilities and i know i'd be too much of a hassle to train because of that. i just wish i could work somewhere small, or start my own business, but i don't even know how to do that. i just want to experience being able to function like a normal human being. but my dad works and we don't have a second car. oh, did i mention that i have spatial awareness issues and can't drive because of it?

i'm trying to force myself to stay positive, because 5 years ago i believed i would've been dead by now because i thought about suicide all the time. at least i'm not in that pit anymore. truly the worst part of my life. i just can't seem to force out a ""but i'll get better"" no matter how hard i try

"I mean how can I tell the companies I want to audition for, the agencies I would like to sign me on as a client, that I am autistic, that opera music is both my passion and special interest, and that singing and performing on stage is one of the few things left in this world which gives me meaning to my life… And without them flat out rejecting me for it?!?!?!

Professionally I put together my bio/CV/cover letter and audition reels, and I try to word my letters as maturely and as professionally as possible to seem like I am ready and willing to do business!  Obviously no agency has taken me yet, and that’s not surprising for a number of reasons… but then again no agency has ever read me expressing that I am autistic, and that I view the experience of being in stage, and in character, in this deeply personal way before.  

My biggest fear about this is that I will say it to an agency looking to audition me, and I will fop it up by expressing this, and they will look at me with cold eyes and jot down their rejection; “don’t call us, we’ll call you” and all that.  

And that’s why I’m one of my previous posts, [I expressed we need some sort of service that got autistic people the jobs they wanted](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/13dhb6e/im_just_gonna_say_it_i_wish_there_was_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1).  I feel like if I take any off-job posted on some random board, instead of following my special interest, I will want to kill myself because I’m not living a life which fills me with meaning.  I’m afraid of that, and I feel like nobody understands how deeply important it is from my perspective.  I’m also afraid that, instead offering advice or assistance strictly with my endeavors, people are just going to defeatedly say that there’s nothing we can or should do about this, and that I should find some other thing that gives me meaning WHEN THERE REALLY ISNT!!!! 

I honestly and truly cannot live with that!!  I NEED the work in opera!  Not for the money, but to not feel like my life is so meaningless because I am autistic. To feel like I have a valid right to exist and do what I do without having to hide the fact I’m autistic from the professional world. To feel like I haven’t wasted my childhood on my fixation with music!!!  For me, life without that opportunity—to be a represented artist performing on a REAL professional Opera stage— is a hellish cesspool of people who won’t bother to truly understand me for who I really am!!!

"i'm currently cat-sitting for a friend, and i stayed over today. wanted some toast to eat while watching tv, there's no toaster here, so i turned the gas stove on, which has like a middle griddle on it, which usually just has one big burner (my stove and most other stoves layout) but this stove has two burners, so i turned both on, changed my mind about the toast and just turned one off (this is what i'm used to since my stove has the one big burner) and forgot all about the other one, went to watch tv, felt tired, got in bed and as i was about to go to sleep i got super thirsty, went for a glass of water and realized i had left the one extra burner on for like 2 or 3 hours with the griddle on top, i obviously turned it off and instead of relief i freaked tf out which was followed by an unshakeable sense of dread and my mind just started racing with what-ifs: 

what if i hadn't gotten thirsty and left the burner on all night and burned down my friend's house, killed myself, her cats, the neighbors, the neighbor's kitten, what if i left it on and the flame somehow got extinguished and i killed myself and everyone in this building from carbon monoxide poisoning, the tamest one: what if nothing happened but my friend's gas bill came back at an exorbitant rate and she got super mad at me and stoped trusting me altogether.

mind you, stovetops have been a huge struggle for me since time immemorial, but being unmedicated (idfk know why since i was dx'ed pretty young), i've prided myself on becoming an insufferable controlling apprehensive heap of neuroses, because that's the only way i can cope with this ~~curse~~ disorder and not fuck everything up in my life in one millisecond, and yes, i do have some modicum of control over my life despite the adhd and mainly because of these neuroses that stemmed mostly from continuously and mercilessly self punishing whenever i fuck up since i have a memory. this is a double edged sword as you can see because i cannot stop ruminating on all the fucked scenarios that might have come from this and now i can't sleep even though i'm tired as hell and need to sleep because i'm in the middle of a major ibs flareup from too many stressors and sleep is much needed. 

 i just can not stop going over the same damn thing and hating myself about it and thinking about how i told my therapist i didn't feel fit for catsitting because i had preemptively thought about all the worst possible scenarios and she told me i was actually trustworthy and responsible and now this is a testament to the opposite and that i shouldn't have been trusted around the cats because i was obviously going to kill them and myself from being such a ditzy dumbass, as always.

I been experiencing ADHD-like symptoms. On top of that  anhedonia symptoms.

Since my last depressive episode, which was two years ago, I been having trouble reading novels or writing fiction.

I find it hard to enjoy watching TV or movies. I get so restless and bored. I dropped so many shows because of it.

This week, I really noticed I lost interest in my hobbies. They aren't fun or as enjoyable as they used too. I can only do them for a few minutes before giving up.

I really been dealing with extreme boredom too. I feel understimulated. My mind isn't as active now I'm on my semester break. 

I will finally tell my therapist tomorrow. I spoke with my psychiatrist earlier this week and they feel like they missing something when it comes to my diagnosis. They want me to me a neuropsychiatric assessment done. (Who knows when there be an opening for that?)

"Hi all! First of all, I’d like to state 2 things: I am not looking for a diagnosis here, just opinions, since you have a lot of experience in the subject. Second thing: English is not my first language so sorry for the gramatical errors :) 

I am a 33 year old male, and never gave too much thought about ADHD since about 1-2 months ago when I stumbled upon an article where some of the main symptoms were listed. Actually almost all of them checks out for me:

1 Inattention. This one is the strongest. From childhood I always struggled with it. My mom told me I am just lacking concentration, and I am inattentive because I am not interested in things and need to pull myself together. She also told me that this thing runs in my dad’s family. I have never asked her to visit a doctor, guess I just accepted that this is my fault, this is how I operate, and I just need to focus more on things. Till this day, when I read something in work (IT Support) or at Uni, I need to read it like 4-5 times like I am an idiot, meanwhile others don’t have problems with it. When I watch a movie, I often don’t know how the characters end up in certain situations, only when I watch it again it makes sense. My mind often wanders around, meaning I am daydreaming a lot on different things, I can even spend like 3-4 hours with this “activity”.

2. Procastination
It is bad. Often with tasks which require full attention, like university assignments.(Computer science). Also studying is extremely hard, I often spend a lot more time than necessary with simple things.

3. Impulsiveness 
I often make impulsive decisions which I almost always regret later on.

There were other symptoms too but I just wanted to list these 3 as I think these 3 are the worst for me. 

According to these, do you think I should visit a doctor? Is it worth checking if I have ADHD? Or maybe my mom is right and I am just “slow”. Which is fine, I can accept that.",3,adhd
"[Trigger warning for question my sanity and reality and mention of self harming behaviour during meltdown.] 

I HATE IT! No matter what I think or do, if I am overstimulated, it will eventually send my thoughts spiraling down till I sit in my room question if anything is real! Till I sit there biting my hand because pain is the only thing calming me down. And I don't think that this will ever end. Even if I forget it, eventually something will bring it back in my head and it starts again. I don't know what to do! It makes me question if I am going mad, if I am mad. It makes me think that I am crazy. That maybe nothing is real besides my own consciousness! And maybe I am! I can never now for sure I am not! I don't know if that is a meltdown or if me loosing touch with reality or something entirely different, but I just want it to stop!

"It seems the emotional disregulation is one of my strongest symptoms that continues on even as they increase my dosage. I don’t know if my reactions to things are justified. I don’t know if someone being incredibly rude to me is actually someone being so, or if it’s just my emotional reaction derived from my condition that makes me perceive it that way. I can’t trust what I feel is actually a reasonable reaction. Feedback from others is that “you can’t control how other people act” but it just sucks having such strong reactions to everything.

to make this short and sweet, **should i reach out to my family doctor as a last resort to things hopefully getting better?** would a chance of diagnosis and medication actually help/do anything? therapy isn't really helping and only leaving me feeling empty or more miserable. it doesn't help that it's biweekly (and no, unfortunately, my mom doesn't believe in mental illness and is already not supportive of paying half of session fees for me going somewhere just to talk). i'm just done with it all. i can't do this. i don't see any point for me to keep living.

I couldn't sleep that evening, so I wrote him a paragraph explaining how sorry I was and if he needed time and space, I'd give it to him.. Because he has every right to feel upset towards me. But I did mention not to stay away from me for too long, because I'd miss him.  
I took the advice of people on Reddit to ask him how much time/space he'd need.

"I'm so frustrated. I graduate with my master's degree in a week, and I am having crippling anxiety over the ceremony. I normally wouldn't, but for the past 10 months, my anxiety has been causing me to dry heave. I'm severely emetophobic (afraid of throwing up), so this symptom is my biggest nightmare. No other anxiety symptoms scare me, but this one terrifies me. I've still managed to live a somewhat normal life, but it's considerably limited compared to what it used to be. 

I have a big family/friend graduation party over the weekend - I don't want to do that because I'm terrified of dry heaving during it and ruining my whole day. It's even worse for my actual graduation ceremony. My boyfriend is flying in from 1,000 miles away to come see me, and I don't want to make his trip pointless if I panic during the ceremony or I'm not able to actually participate because I'm too anxious. I don't even want him to come because I'm so panicked. I'm afraid of disappointing my parents by panicking and not going to the ceremony (they're also traveling to come see). If it were up
to me, I would be able to skip this all and just move on. I still have an entire week until the ceremony, but for the past 3 days, I've been waking up with a horrible racing heart, nausea, and I feel like dry heaving all day. Xanax helps, but I don't allow myself to take it more than 1-2x per month. Hydroxyzine and propranolol don't touch it. 

I don't have social anxiety, I normally love big events. I love parties and ceremonies. I'm not scared of the social aspect, I am just terrified of gagging and being trapped in the ceremony/grossing people out/looking like an idiot. I haven't been able to find a single thing that stops the gagging - not water, not other drinks, not mints or gum, nothing. The fact that I can't prevent it is what scares me most. I've tried positive visualization, but all I can visualize is me getting all done up for graduation, getting to the ceremony, and either dry heaving in my seat or worse, walking across the stage. It's so irrational, but it feels so real. The *only* reason for the dry heaving is anxiety, so you'd think that if I knew I could stay calm, I wouldn't worry about the dry heaving - but nope. 

I don't know what to do. I'm considering just not going so I can stop being this anxious. I'm so angry that I can't just enjoy exciting, happy life moments like most other people can. No one in my life even gets why I'm so anxious because I should just be ""happy and proud"" instead.

"25 year old male

August 2022:

Finished an intensive masters straight after a 4 year undergrad.

September:

Job offers and interviews
End of relationship

October:

Moved into a 'party' flat and Starting work in the IT department of a Martime management company

November:

Mood decline begins - began to realise I want this job and lifestyle to just be temporary and work towards a better future for myself

December:

Dog passes away over Christmas.
New Years eve party my friend asked if I want to take his place on a new years day surf so he could do MDMA all night instead, I decided to go instead of him (I was drunk and didn't go to sleep until 6am)

January 2023:

Hit on the back of my head by a surf board while in the water.

Attended A&E to close up a bleeding wound on the back of my head, tetanus shot and advise to 'take it easy' before going back to work in 3 days.
I took it easy and tried to get back into a routine before starting back at work.

The day before I started back I vommit (thought it was something I ate - even my flatmate said 'is that the concussion?') - tried to sleep it off.

Worked for 3 extremely stressful days where I got no sleep what so ever and after the third day I just got home from work and went straight to bed extremely exhausted and just couldn't sleep all weekend.

Monday 9th of January:

Requested the day of sick and went to my GP and tried to explain my situation while getting things all muddled up and with slurred speech. The GP wrote me a letter that referred me to go back to A&E.

Arrive at A&E and handed in the letter and had to wait for half an hour to get seen. 

Got into the briefing room and tried to explain my situation to the nurse while again getting things all muddled up and with slurred speech.
The nurse without hesitation leaves the room and comes back in with a doctor.
 
That doctor brings me into the hospital bed area where I had to take off most of my clothes and get a heart pulse scan - all ok.

Then came about 3 nurses who all did the limb tests to see if I had control over them.
Sent for a CT scan of my head.

After the scan I had a chat with the doctor who tended to my wound on new years day who said the head scan was all clear and that I was suffering from the effects of concussion and discharged me on the same day. 

I walk outside the hospital all dazed and confused with a banging headache.

Got an Uber back to my flat and took a week off work went back to my GP the following Monday who was shocked I was back and thought I was drunk the last time he saw me, signs me off work for 4 weeks with a sick note that said 'Head Injury' and advised that I just try to stay in a routine and my symptoms would eventually go away. 

I did just that but for those 4 weeks I could not sleep what so ever and my mental health just got worse and worse and my flatmates just kept on partying and partying while I was getting clinically depressed with extreme anxiety trying to get better from a concussion.

February 2023:

I got so unwell by the 4th week of my sick note I had to get another 4 weeks off and go home to my parents just to get my physical health okay with 7 days worth of sleeping tablets from my GP who also referred me to a brain injury unit.

March 2023:

Went back to my GP and got perscribed a low dose of sertaline due to my mental health decline.
I started having suicidal thoughts but just thought they would go away after a while.

Had meetings with the brain injury unit over the web and they basically said I was all okay to do a phased return to work due to my head scan being all okay.

April 2023:

My thoughts of suicide got worse to the point where I had to tell my dad and the next day we went to A&E and I talked with the mental health crisis team and voluntarily went into a physciatric ward where I was diagnosed with clinical depression, my sertaline was uped, had another CT scan and an EEG (all okay) and I was discharged 3 weeks later.

May 2023:

Still have those thoughts and had to make an appointment with a pychcologist because I am still having so much trouble processing all this.

I just keep on saying to myself 
""just get through another day"" and ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem""
everyday.

This is the most messed up year of my life and I have no idea how I am going to be okay as there is so much uncertainty that lies ahead :(

My therapist believes that schizophrenia is caused by a piece of the psyche splitting off from the self due most likely to childhood trauma and forming separately and then being tapped into as you age. I'm not sure if this is true. Mostly he just offers empathy not advice. I've had some rough time as a kid but nothing too abnormal. My mom heard this theory and got really mad. She insists that trauma has nothing to do with it. She read about that awhile back and has held onto it very hard as she was somewhat abusive verbally and a little physically and I think she feels bad or regrets it and can't face that but I'm not sure what to think. Her anger seems out of place and she doesn't want me listening to my therapist. What do you think?,6,schizophrenia
"I want to keep this anonymous as I can.
This is a very long read, uhm.
I got sent to the mental hospital because I sent a friend my goodbye message, and I was planing on committing suicide by overdosing on all of the pills I find in my house when school ends. Getting sent to the mental hospital made me feel like I was being punished for wanting to die. I am so fed up with life. Getting sent there made me feel worse. I had these certain friends that I could trust and be myself around, and they were encouraging me to live but over time, they started being distant. They pretend that I don’t exist now. I asked my friends if I could hang out with them on the weekend and they said yes. They ALWAYS hang out without me and always post about it. But suddenly they ghosted me again today and I feel like shit. I was so excited and happy, but they ignored my multiple texts. I wasn’t being rude... I’ve always struggled making friends as a kid, and this reoccurring moments give me terrible flashbacks. I struggle with communicating because I am neurodivergent. Luckily I have therapists. I wonder why I have to experience this…",2,depression
"My work is contract based. Since I started working 8 years ago, I've never had a break. Since our contracts end a few weeks apart we decided to take 3 months off work this summer. 

I finished work a few weeks ago and I am struggling to relax and enjoy myself. Activities I find fun (painting, drawing and other creative things I enjoy) and want to do feel so overwhelming and make me anxious. I also am finding it hard to sleep. The first few days off I only slept 4 hours.

I want to get stuff done around the house but I can't and I just don't have energy. But when I try to relax, watch some Netflix or go for a walk I get this panicked and stressed feeling.

If anyone has been through this I'd love to hear your experience or if anyone has anything that worked for them.

"This sounds like such a simple problem to ‘normal’ people, but when you think people are imminently about to kill/torture/rape you, how do you override your instincts to defend yourself? I’ve attacked a few people now; verbally and physically (staff I thought were trying to hurt me when I was properly ill in hospital) and it’s becoming more and more of a problem and I can’t think my way out of it. 

I get delusions where I think people are trying to kill/torture/rape me. Reflecting back on it, it’s clear they weren’t but in the moment I had felt no other way out than to defend myself against them when they did something that I believed was them starting to actually kill/torture/rape me. To make matters more complicated, people have genuinely attacked me in the past. I can’t distinguish between delusion and reality in the moment, only after lots of careful reflection.

When I’m not in crisis, I actually already underreact to situations because I’m so scared of overreacting again. For example, today I got hit (not hard) by a car and was so busy apologising and wheeling off that I didn’t stop to think how awful it was that he had pulled out of the pavement and ran into me without ever having looked down at me on my wheelchair. There’s lots of similar situations where I’ve allowed myself to get into danger for fear of overreacting. And yet, when I get ill, I’m so scared, I’m like a cornered animal.

Is the solution to just try to never react no matter what under any circumstances? If so, how should I override the primal urge to ‘defend myself’? What happens the next time I am actually attacked (either in hospital or outside in the real world)? How do I work around this? I don’t want to hurt anybody yet I’m also incredibly fearful of being hurt by others as I have been in the past.

Anybody have any experience with this? I’m at a loss. To make matters more complicated, my community team are currently trying to kill me so idk what to do?!",6,schizophrenia
"Yesterday my psychologist called to tell me about my evaluation. She told me there is no doubt that I have a moderate combined type ADHD. I finally have a diagnosis after a 2 year wait! 🥹 Now my crying 31 y/o ass just needs to wait for treatment ☺️

Sadly when I called my mom (who most likely also has this fantastic dx however she's clinically undiagnosed), she told me something that broke my heart completely. Evidently my dad had discussed some concerns about my behavior with her when I was about 7 y/o, but mom just brushed those concerns aside and continued as if nothing ever happened. I'm really trying to not think of ""what could have been"" but it's freaking difficult when I know that there were people advocating for me as a struggling kid but no help was given to that poor kid who didn't understand why she was different 🥲

So now I'm torn between happiness, understanding, massive sorrow & relief, and also just plain anger.

Usually I have a big appetite and can eat large amounts. It's starting to concern me now. Now I'm usually forcing myself to eat something so I have some food in my stomach but my stomach starts to ache later. I noticed I can go 24 hours without eating and still won't feel hungry. Could depression be playing a part in this? I recently just started taking Magnesium Citrate and Vitamin D supplements if that has any effect.

Duration of complaint 2 months

Location right side of head. 

Any existing relevant medical issues. Nothing yet. Beside and x ray for my neck pains showed neck spasms. I have been recommended and have referal. To se neurologist. Convince parent is hard though. 

Current medications

I don’t know what cause my head pain.  But over the past two month I have been feeling this weirds squeezing pain on the right side of my head. Near temple area. It in’t really painful like the head pains I get. Feel weird. The closest I can describe it to is like a squeezing pain on your vein. On my other posts of mine I have described my head pains.     


Here is a description from one of my older posts: I started a log to track the amount of migraine or whatever pain this is and the last day of logging will be tomorrow. I have had 19 days of migraines in January. Then past months have been averaging 14 to 15.  These pains started in the summer of 2021 and got a lot worse by may 2022. My mom took me to see a physical therapist cause she was convinced it was just neck pain and posture and the x ray showed that I have neck spasms. I did 2 months of physical therapy and went back and extra two weeks In hopes it would get better but it hasn’t only worse. I have worked on my posture and made an effort the past month to consistently do excerise and take all my vitamins. I did physical therapy October and November and a little bit of December in 2022. In the summer of 2022 I made an appointment myself with a nurse at my campus and she did tests and after me following her recommendations and not improving she gave a referral to get a scan at a neurologist which ended up getting thrown away. The physical therapist said if the pain doesn’t improve I need to make follow up appointment and get mri. That never got made. I finally took it into my own hands and got an appointment at cleavland clinic with a neurologist in December and my mom decided to not take me. I have tried different over the counter medicines which don’t work. I switch between advil liquid gels and excedrin. My family recently got sick with Covid and I am sick also but I haven’t done a test yet so that doesn’t help me either. I had a call with my physician and she told me to try migrelief and it gave me bad side effects and only made it worse. I tried this cefaly and it also made it worse. This pain is around the base of my skull, neck, ear, also where the varix of the angular vein is. And I get random pain on other parts of my skull and face. I have been really trying to improve my self care of taking vitamins daily; having water, exercise, eat healthy enough, sleep in a bit more. I started chiro two weeks ago. First appointment went well second did not.       

I really need advice on the squeezing pain but also the main head pain. Anyone experience this? I will try anything at this point. Any ideas?",0,negative_samples

"I am in my early twenties and am 5’6.5”. I have a hard time with women and so do my other short friends. My tall friends have a much easier time. 

I have a good physique, I have a very solid degree, and I’m generally well-liked and often make people laugh.

I constantly feel inferior to bigger, taller men. I train bjj but I know that most bigger guys could still beat the shit out of me. I’ve seen women approach my taller friends frequently. They also match with attractive women on dating apps, whereas I only match with overweight and/or unattractive women. I’ve learned to stop caring what women look like, but my friends and men in general will bash me for the girls I date/sleep with and generally respect me less because of this. 

I’ve spent an ungodly amount of time working out and paying attention to my nutrition in order to work on my physique, but no matter how hard I work, I will never be as physically attractive or powerful as a guy who is 5’10”.

I feel like I will never be respected or seen as dominant. I feel like this is a huge component of sexual attraction for women that I’ll never be able to satisfy.

I have dealt with relentless emasculation and depression largely due to this for about a decade now. I don’t mean to complain and I know this is incel shit but I just need help. I don’t know how any guy deals with this. Feel free to check my post history for more context. Thank you.",2,depression

"  For the last 2 years I've been extremely sad at almost all times. About 2 years ago my grandpa died, obviously I'd be sad. I feel like that just opened the door to all my bad thoughts and emotions. I haven't ever had a good outlook on myself, I think I'm a 2/10 at best, I'm not funny, and I absolutely hate myself in every sense of the word. 
  I've never had any luck romantically(I know that's very common) and rejection is never a surprise anymore. As a result of the constant rejection both romantically and socially I never talk to anyone new EVER. I actively avoid all social interaction if possible and I don't feel like I have anything to give anyone. I'm just an annoying burden with absolutely 0 worth. I've tried all the things and they don't work. ""Talking about it"" has gotten me nothing but judgement and some of the very few people I talk to think I'm making an excuse to not do things with them. 
  It's gotten worse recently, for the last few weeks all I've been thinking about is how much better the world would be without me. I've completely stopped drawing/sketching (The only thing I liked to do) I have no inspiration and feel like I'm forcing it too hard whenever I even attempt to draw. So I stopped. I am a shell of my former happy outgoing self because I've got nothing to show for it. All I did was be nice and considerate and do what all good boys and girls are supposed to do and I've got absolutely nothing for it.

I don't think I'm scared, as an atheist I've fully accepted my reality of there being no afterlife or reincarnation.

"TW for suicidal ideation. I 100% understand if my post gets deleted. I'm posting this to anywhere I think I can find somebody, ANYbody who could give me some semblance of advice.

I'm a 24yo American male and I'm completely lacking in motivation and purpose.

I've always been a lonely and mentally ill person. Anxiety, depression, suicidal, etc. I feel very little positivity and joy. I lack the motivation for self-improvement and self-reliance.

Ever since my youth, I've never been much good at making friends. Was never a very social or motivated kid. I've seen it said many times that charisma and having connections are essential to success in life. I severly lack social skills/people skills and fear that this has crippled my ability to live a well-off life.

I suffered a mental/emotional breakdown in 7th grade due to the stress of the workload. I got diagnosed with Asperger's and spent proceeded to spend most of my time in the special needs classroom. I've suffered several breakdowns throughout my years as a middle and high school student. Lots of banging on walls, lots of crying, lots of screaming, etc. I was the stereotypical ""psycho"", the quiet loner kid with no friends and no social skills. I dropped out of several high-demand classes and clubs as a result of never being able to handle the workload/responsibility (APUSH, robotics, Beta Club, National Honor Society, etc.). I never took the SATs or anything like that. I feel horrifically ashamed and guilty and useless and worthless because I could never make it in these classes/clubs. It's resulted in me feeling constantly suicidal to this day due to never living up to my own hefty expectations of myself.

In 10th grade, I confessed how sad and angry and suicidal I am to a guidance counselor and it landed me a week in a juvenile mental facility. I wasn't allowed to return to school for half a year after that. I totally screwed myself even further. Shoulda just kept my mouth shut.

I'm still living with my parents and am totally dependent on them for everything. I never learned how to do all the things kids are supposed to learn. How to make friends, how to swim, ride a bike, etc. I'm 24 and I don't know how to drive! And as an adult, I know diddly-squat about insurance, homeowning, taxes, etc., or any other important adult stuff. I've been working part-time as a dishwasher at Cracker Barrel for the past 8 years, less than 20 hours every week. I still rely on my parents and grandparents to get me to and from work. I feel like such a massive burden and have attempted to take my own life multiple times.

Sis got accepted into college recently. She's absolutely amazing, an extremely talented and intelligent young woman. An artist, musician, writer, etc. Recently, I overheard Dad telling her how great she is while talking trash about me behind my back. Said I'll always be dependent on him and Ma. He's sick of it and moving out in September. I'm absolutely terrified of what'll happen to us once he goes.

I confided in Sis about what I heard and she told me she wanted to yell at Dad and tell him to shut up right then and there. That a parent should never talk like that about their child. She offered to help me learn how to drive and she offered to help me apply for college. But I'm so genuinely terrifed that I'll crash and burn in college (see my previous academic history of stress and mental breakdowns). I'm so, so, so genuinely scared outta my mind that I'll never make it. That I'll never amount to anything, so why bother accumulating debt if I'm probably just gonna drop out like I always do?

I've become hyper-fixated on the concept of euthanasia. Death with dignity, the right to die, etc. This suffering is just too much to bear. I'm so sick of myself. I wish I was normal. I wish I wasn't so emotional and outbursty. I wish I wasn't so socially inept and helpless. I wish I leaned how to swim and how to bike and how to drive when I was a kid. I wish I knew how to be responsible and own my own place and do taxes. I'm the type of person who needs firm directions from others in order to achieve some semblance of function. Can anybody give me direct and concise orders on what to do next? I can't do this alone...

I apologize if all this comes off as whining and complaining, I'm just so very sick and tired of myself. Seriously, what should I do? What CAN I do?",2,depression
"Hey everybody that reads this post!

For starters I myself am not schizophrenic, however I have been dealing with an awful amount of health anxiety and OCD issues relating to developing schizophrenia.

"Hello, everybody.
I'm not diagnosed with autism but when I read or hear autistic people talk about their life experiences I feel like I finally found people who are as ""weird"" as me.
I relate so much to the people of this community that sometimes I feel so happy that I start crying... But anyway, this is not the main reason I created this post: I'm here because I'm so tired of my lack of social skills.

When I'm with others, it's almost as if I wasn't responding to their verbal and body language: they smile, talk happily and nicely to me while I'm there, still, trying to look at them in the eyes with absolutely no facial expression and no verbal response (the only things I say are ""yes"", ""no"", and ""mh""). Therefore, people label me as ""weird"" and avoid to talk to me.
Sometimes, when I think about how I act with people I laugh because it's so funny, but most of the times it's so saddening to me.

But when I find what I call a ""favorite person"" everything changes: I can easily look at you in the eyes, I show you so much love, I always try to make you happy, and I try to protect you at all costs (even if I'm really physically weak). I just love it when I find ""that person""... I finally feel happy...
But I get way too attached to that person... My attachment becomes a true obsession and all my friendships end because the other person gets so tired of me.

For me, having a favorite person is kinda like having a partner (for a neurotypical person): I want to spend as much time as possible with the other person and do many things together, and when the relationship ends it takes me years to accept it, even when I found a new favorite person.

For these reasons, I've never had more than one friend and I passed most of my time alone with no friends. I just wish someone told me what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it... I would literally follow all their instructions precisely.


Also, I've made this post because someone who I considered my favourite person told me that they don't like how I act, that everything I do is so annoying, and that I should seek medical attention. Maybe their words weren't that hurtful, but they made me so sad because I just thought that in these last months they were stressed/sad and I wanted to help them to feel better... Apparently my actions have been misinterpreted.

"Hey guys. I have struggled with paranoia for years now and I finally wanted to make a short film about it. But I dont want that film to only go over what I went through, because that wouldn’t be as interesting as me learning about other peoples’ experiences so I have a broader knowledge of it.

My best friend has been through abuse by his Nmum. Coming from a toxic family has impaired his mental health since an early adult. He has substance addiction. We always used to think his paranoia about being harmed and persecuted were due to his drug.

He hasn’t even realised where and how these thoughts and mental torture started. With my knowledge I feel he might be suffering from CPTSD. The psychological damage from Nmum left him with huge paranoia of people out there to get him, control issues, fear of government institutions and etc. Now he is on a recovery programme and he needs to do mandatory urine test every week. The state will charge him if he fails to report or if tested positive. However, since he has this huge paranoia he feels this procedure is a plot/artificial and thus has failed to show up for it. He has been absent without valid reason for two months. If he doesn’t report in the following weeks, he will be charged severely. We can’t seem to get him help such as seeing a mental health professional or anyone as he is rather avoidant. He just wishes isolation. Many times he even suspects me and mistrust me. Right now he has isolated. How do we get him help and what’s running through his mind? 

He has substance addiction too to cope with the cptsd. I really don’t know how to help him.",5,paranoia
"My family doesn't try to get me to visit or go out anymore. I haven't had a friend in about 5 years now, with the exception of maybe my boyfriends friends, who probably would have nothing to do with me if I wasn't dating my partner. Even my partner is giving up on trying to get me to go out. I just need a push, I know its inconvenient for other people to have to push me, but its the only way I go out. I am so overwhelmed every minute of my days that thinking about doing something is just too much and freaks me out. It has to be at least somewhat planned, like a couple hours ahead minimum. Whenever my boyfriend goes out with friends, they just text him wyd and then 20 mins later they're out doing stuff. I cannot do that.

I feel so empty. I feel like I literally only exist to make money for the business I work for.

 No one would care if I died. It amazes me how there are some people whose passing would affect an entire community like a tsunami, yet I feel my passing would not even make a tiny splash, a drop, even. Some people would be sad, but they would not grieve. There would be no one to grieve, as no one really knows who I am. My gravestone would never be adorned in flowers. The grass would grow tall, as no foot traffic would pass over, and yet again, I would be invisible. 

My partner would have no one to talk about me with when I am gone. He is the only one. People would try and sympathize, maybe mention softly how shy I was, or how I had a hound dog, but they would never be able to talk about ME.

When my parents pass, I will have no one to go to and grieve. I will be alone in my sorrow and emptiness as the last people I felt truly connected to leave, and I will live with the guilt on my shoulders from not talking enough, not visiting enough.

I am convinced that if my body and mind were not so used up by the corporate job and the capitalist world, maybe then I could make connections. Be someone. But for now, ill let myself continue to erode until everyone leaves. I have no energy left after the day anyways.

I feel obliged to add the positives before I end my post. I at least have an extremely dedicated, loving, supportive partner. I think the love we have is truly one in a million and he does know me inside and out. I think people could go through hundreds of lifetimes before experiencing the kind of love we have. He is why I am alive, though I don't tell him that. I pretend to be strong and I pretend well. When I cry, its just because of a bad day at work, or stress is what I tell him. It doesn't make a difference, as long as I have him. I am financially okay. I wish I was doing better, because I know without help I wouldn't even be able to afford my own food, but I'm stable right now.

"Hi friends, 
I used to not care about the seasonal allergies that much. But year over year, I feel weaker and weaker and never could get any help from any doctor.  So I wish I could get some advice in case anyone knows about this disease.

I started the so called seasonal allergies for at least 7, 8 years now.  In the beginning, it was perfectly seasonal.  I could tolerate it, so I didn't really use the allergies reliever from Costco.

But recent 3 years, it became literally every day.  Every time I woke up from night or nap, as soon as I opened my eyes, I feel wet in my nose, and if I didn't wipe it soon enough, I had uncontrollable sneezing.  I feel like catching cold every day.   In reality, I always feel throat itchy, and very easy to catch a cold.  

My concern is that, is it possible to turn into some immune system issue beyond just seasonal allergy?
Which type of doctor can help me?  I have bad experiences with primary care and urgent care doctor, whenever I asked about this , they just say oh sorry, people get sick very often this season, totally normal. And sent me away.

I really don't know where to find help now.",0,negative_samples
"A little back story.
I have CPTSD that stems from intense childhood trauma. One thing that continues to get worse as I get older is the feeling that I am unsafe. Im a 24 yo female and the world around me feels so unsafe. Sometimes I feel unsafe even in my own home. I have nightmares often that I’m being hunted/chased and cant seem to rest even while I’m sleeping. 

I have a particular fear of men and dating/engaging with them. This has started to impact my daily life as I have become isolated and antisocial from this fear. When I do start to get close to someone I start having delusional and racing thoughts about how they will probably end up harming or killing me at some point. 

Keeping this in mind, Ive been really traumatized the past few months. In June I was at work reading through local news articles when a picture of a man popped up that I knew. I used to teach group fitness and this particular man took my classes and he would always come to class early to chat and hangout with the instructors. We added each other on snap and casually started chatting. He was working on a book and would have me proof read it and stuff of that nature.
I never got particularly close to him but we still were very friendly with each other and I would say that we were decent friends. Not really sure what ended up happening but we ended up out of touch. Fast forward to a few weeks before said new article was found, he ended up trying to re-add me on snap by name but I ended up denying it due to said paranoia about men. 
This guy ended up murdering his ex girlfriend and her friend in a parking lot before taking his own life. 
This obviously has been kinda disturbing to me because it plays into my main fears and paranoia. I am very analytical and self aware so normally with irrational fears I am able to reassure myself its just that, an irrational fear. But recently I don’t have that reassurance to give myself which has been distressing. 
I don’t really know how to work through this and it has started to impact my social functioning.
Any insight and advice is much appreciated.",5,paranoia
"When I was about 13 or 14, in high school, i used to feel like someday, for whatever reason, someone (not someone in particular, just about anyone) would attack me. I started bringing box cutters in my jackets and eventually a knife in my backpack for self-defense. It pretty much went away when the pandemic started and we no longer had class in person, around spring of 2020.

By autumn of 2020, I had driven away a few online friends from me, because I kept thinking they hated me and were telling everyone I was a bad person and I would end up isolated, and I eventually lashed out at them.

And as of now, I fear most of my friends dislike me and at any time will make me an outcast. I dont know why I think that way, they have invited me to meet them in a few months and have even bought me a thing for when I go.

"About three weeks ago, I (23) found out I have ADHD after years hiding my struggles and pretending everything is fine. About a year ago, my brother (15) found out he has level 1 autism. At the same time I found out, he started to present Cognitive Rigidity and have issues with going to school. It has been a struggle. My mom is suffering a lot and so is he. She cries everyday and feels impotent, scared and like she’s not enough. 

She has been juggling taking him to therapy and to his psychiatrist, keeping his school and teachers updated and working towards accommodations, and supporting him as best as she can. She doesn’t understand certain things like “wait mode” and having to do things in a certain order the way I do. So that left me with helping my brother deal with that and comforting her throughout this hard times and explaining that somethings that are easy for her (like brushing your teeth every day) are not as easy for us. 

I love my mom and I love my brother. I just want the best for both of them but I’m struggling. The ADHD diagnosis has been harder to accept than I thought. I’ve suspected it for a few years but actually knowing is a bit hard. I’m mourning for all that I’ve lost because I didn’t know sooner, and coming to terms that there’s in fact something “wrong” with me and that it’s not something I can make go away.

The medication is helping but the side effects aren’t that great. I don’t feel hungry and forget to eat, my mouth is always dry, I feel exhausted after it’s over and the headaches suck. I also have trouble staying asleep. I just wanted to talk to someone about it, but my mom has too much on her back. My dad is not very helpful as he doesn’t know how to deal with this stuff and always change the subject. I’m just so tired.",3,adhd

"I have diagnosed ADHD with multiple comormidities: major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, mood disorder with bipolar features (meaning I just barely don't meet the diagnostic criteria for bipolar 1 or 2), and stimulant abuse disorder (in remission). I haven't abused stimulants in 10+ years.

To spice things up, I also have a rare metabolic disorder - glutaric aciduria type 2 late onset. Google it if you want, but basically my body doesn't produce the necessary enzymes for me to properly metabolize fat. There is no cure, and the symptoms include exercise intolerance and extreme fatigue. The treatment is a high carbohydrate, low fat and low protein diet. I cannot go into a calorie deficit at all or I will start to metabolically decompensate, which means a hospital stay for fluids and monitoring. I've been hospitalized seven times since my initial diagnosis two years ago. I've also gained 20lbs.

I recently switched psychiatrists because the one I had been seeing for 12+ years has no expertise in metabolic disorders, and he's located two hours away. I was also having issues with the old psychiatrist re: stimulant meds. Non stimulant medication has never been effective for me. I've literally tried them all. I need supratherapeutic doses of medications like Concerta or Vyvanse to have any effect at all, and my old psychiatrist viewed that as drug-seeking behavior.

My new psychiatrist has been practicing at Massachusetts General Hospital for 25+ years, went to Harvard medical, and lectures at Yale. He's been doing academic research in the psychiatric presentation of digestive illnesses for the past 10+ years. After our first appointment two weeks ago, he took me off all my old meds (prozac, Seroquel) and put me on abilify, lamictal, and trazodone. No ADHD treatment at all due to history of drug seeking behavior (obviously he and the old psychiatrist talked, which I authorized). Since I've gone on these new meds, I am sleeping excessively - like I go to bed at midnight and don't wake up until 4pm the next day. I'm crying spontaneously with very little provocation. I can't take care of my toddler (thank God for our nanny), I've been unemployed for 8 months, and I can't perform the most basic tasks like showering, cleaning (thank God for the maids), and cooking dinner for our family. My poor husband is pulling all the weight, and I feel like such a failure. I just want my life back. I want to be the wife and mother my family deserves.

I have a second appointment with my new psychiatrist tomorrow morning and plan to share all of this with him. My husband (who is a primary care MD) went through the ASRS ADHD assessment with me and had me write down concrete examples for each question, as well as how it's affecting my life. Despite severe symptoms having tangible negative impacts on every aspect of my life, he strongly cautioned me against asking for stimulant meds due to my history. 

I completely broke down. My husband sees how bad I am and feels the consequences more than anyone, but even in his professional opinion, I shouldn't have access to the treatment I need because I abused it in my 20s.

I don't know what to do anymore and feel so helpless. If I can't get the treatment I need, what's the point? I don't want to live this life being a disappointment and a burden to everyone I care about. 

I'm not looking for advice or answers, I just really need to vent. Thanks for reading if you got this far.",3,adhd

"Antipsychotic medications only seems to address the positive symptoms and I'm just anhedonic and bored all day I feel like a husk my life is so fucking boring.

Like even if I were to do meth it wouldn't be because I'm an addict. It'd be because I need a stimulant to counteract negative symptoms that my psychiatrist simply won't prescribe. I'd essentially microdose it and just take the equivalent to a therapeutic dosage of Desoxyn.

I'd rather just have my Dexedrine prescription back. I know it'd obliterate the anhedonia.

Wellbutrin worked for like a month or two then it just made me irritable and clench my jaw a lot. Dexedrine actually remained effective and made everything exciting. This was before I even developed symptoms.

I did eventually abuse it but that's because I was dumb and immature as I was still in highschool and just entering my drug experimentation phase at the time. I'm 19 now and I probably wouldn't abuse stimulants if I got put on them. Fuck I want them back life just isn't worth living with anhedonia.

Anal itching/pressure. Occasionally I get burgundy coloured stools that happens when I get bad pain in the middle of my upper stomach.

"hi. I'm 18f. 
I am kind of scared right now.
I opened my Instagram dm requests for the first time in weeks and saw a sugar daddy saying he wanted to get to know me. usually I only message these guys back to mess with them then block them and move on. but this person sent me pictures of a check so I could do the mobile banking feature on the CAPCOM app on my phone.
I did it thinking it would just be bullshit but it wasn't. $1,050 into my account.

so I was obviously very shocked and a bit confused. he tells me to buy bitcoin with it and send it to another account and was starting to get aggressive. 
I know this was stupid so please don't berate me too much in replies but I gave him my phone number and email. like an idiot. I know.
anyway, I blocked him because my friends told me to do so and he emailed me saying he had my information and I needed to return his money so I tried but my account would only let me transfer $200 and then wouldn't let me do any more. 
I tried to explain this to him multiple times but he continued to be aggressive so I blocked him again. then he texted me the following message: 
""Hey. [my first name] [my last name], I'm U.S Marshall G.H Dozier from the Department of Homeland Securities. A report just got to us from a certain Smith Christopher that  you attempted to Steal from her of her work funds. It is advised that you get in contact with her and sort out the discrepancy before the law takes matters into its hands. We will have approached your bank and acquired all the necessary information needed to find you and confiscate you. Make America a better place. And get back to me ASAP.""

so obviously I knew it was complete bull because
1. a US. marshal would not text you
2. he spelled my first name wrong
and just a whole bunch of grammar issues I don't even want to point out.
I blocked the number and thought that was the end of it. two hours later I received another text.
we had the following conversation:

him: ""hello [my first name] [my last name]. Good morning. Am officer Eric.""

me: really now. police officers don't text people. or use improper grammar like you do. if you continue to harass me I will be in contact with the police. leave me alone.

him: why do you block your sugar daddy. why get u paid $1,050. 

me: because he was scaring me and so are you. goodbye. leave me alone or I will call the police.

then I blocked that number as well.
I finally thought that was the end of it, but I checked my bank account because I wanted to see if I could change my pin number just in case and all the money that had been sent was gone (there is still however an extra ~30 that was not there before and everything that was there before is still there as well). 

when I checked the mobile check deposit tab in the app the check now says ""pending"". 
does this mean he has my banking information? or can you just un-deposit someone's check if it's in your name. 

I'm very confused and very scared. it is also important to note that I have a paranoia disorder. every time a car goes by or I get a notification on my phone I start to freak out again. my cat was just messing with my sisters door and I thought it was a knock at the front door. every little noise has me on edge.

"For those who haven’t read it, it is a brief and short novel about a young girl named Coraline. She finds a door in her house that is bricked off, and when she finds that door with the bricks mysteriously gone, she goes through to the other side. What she finds is an alternate version of her home, but one that is eerily perfect and has alternate copies of her parents that are too eager to have her stay there. Coraline leaves, but she finds that the other mother has kidnapped her real parents, so Coraline goes back into the alternate world to save them. 

I’ve read a few Neil Gaiman books now, but this is the first one that I’ve read that wasn’t targeted towards adults. It’s a little strange how his writing didn’t feel less mature; it instead felt similar to his other novels, but much more brief and skimping on details he would have otherwise included. It’s also baffling that he wrote this at the same time as *American Gods* (which I’m in the middle of as well), because that and *Coraline* couldn’t be further apart in tone and content. I really enjoyed this book, and I’d recommend it to those who are interested in it with the caveat that it is aimed at younger audiences.

I have some thoughts regarding it, and Neil’s writing in general:
- *Coraline* feels very similar to *The Ocean at the End of the Lane.* They both share a quality that I can’t quite put my finger on, but it’s almost like *The Ocean at the End of the Lane* was written to be a similar story for adult audiences. One to read when you’re young, the other to read when you’re reminiscing on being young.
- I have a tendency to envision (male) talking animals to sound like Keith David, so when I found out the cat was voiced by Keith David in the movie adaptation, I actually laughed. 10/10 casting. 
- Much like *The Hobbit,* I wish I actually read this as a child. That being said, I can’t wait to give either this book or *The Hobbit* to my future children and experience that childhood wonder through them. 
- This is one of the few books that I’ve read in a single day. It’s a great detox book when you need a day to take a break from your other books/hobbies.",0,negative_samples

I think we can make it a great community. Head and Neck cancer cases have been increasing and I think we need an active community to help support each other. Especially people first diagnosed.

So, please come on over, join and make yourself at home.

I'm also looking for H&N Patients that would like to help as mods.

Thanks so much,

"My mom was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the rectum last week. She also has mets to her liver, where a 5 cm lesion has grown 4 cm in the last 6 months from her previous scan. Also has some localized mets to nearby lymph nodes. The tumor in her rectum is around 10cm and partially obstructs, which means she has to be on an all liquid and purée diet for now until it can either be reduced or removed.

I was her full-time caregiver prior to this diagnosis and will be with her 24/7 for the next 3 months as she starts treatment for this. I also live with her and will provide care after I go back to my regular job. 

She has lost a considerable amount of weight during the last six months (around 50 pounds) and has been advised that she needs to focus on weight gain and increased calories during this time period because she will likely lose weight from treatment. She has been encouraged to drink/eat smoothies, protein shakes, milkshakes, creamy soups, grits, yogurt, mashed potatoes, and even consume baby food if she has to in order to get the nutrition that she needs. She can’t eat anything that is hard/crusty, has rough edges, spicy, bread, or chocolate (sadly) due to her specific stomach issues.

Does anyone have any ideas for creating meals or snacks that would be appetizing for her? Suggestions for adding calories to her very limited diet?",0,negative_samples
"Yeah. She expects me to be super high functioning and nonverbal and overall, act like a harmful depiction of someone with autism.

She also is very uneducated on mental illnes, but says her father is a doctor and has diagnosed things like autism and bipolar before.

She claims I don't act like those patients, who were all nonverbal and high functioning.

It's just so irritating.

She's so irritating and annoying and she makes me cry sometimes because she fake claims my issues and tells me that I can't say that I simply THINK I'm autistic or THINK I might have Misophonia (which I have full symptoms for.)

"So I just want to say I had a friend for a long while for a good few years like while. They have been a good friend and they are still a good person and we've always gotten along wellvery rasily.  For some reason and  I really don't know how it happened but last night this friend ans i who has always been aware that I have some mental challenges that present to the world at large as very stoic and non obvious.  I present as pretty normal and live a normal life because I've pretty well  learned how to deal with my challenges I keep my stuff inside without it being apparent to everyone else that there is in reality a whole ass shit show playing out in my head at most any given time.  Chaos would be peaceful. LOL Anyways..  I guess I made a mistake last night and I'm old enough to know better that I should never even say schizophrenia as a diagnosis term applicable to myself. I could just kick ny own ass I swear.  It came about while in process of a normal discussion about noise being quiet, peaceful and just nothing. No sound. We had stoppied in a rural area for a monent and she was sharing her detailed admiration of the peacefulness and just taking for granted I too was enamored of such an awesome moment that doesnt happen very often    I truly didnt even have an imagination to assist me understanding her poetic sounding details. I mean that like way out fictional and still I just dont get what silence must sound like. Oh but anyways..  i kust honestly slipped up  stating how it really must be a true moment in time worth cherishing. It sounds wnderful. My dum dum ass then  explained to my friend that silence that he is hearing  is not the same type of silence that I hear. He givets this look like.. silence is silence. Like everyone hears the same sound of nothing. I then explain silence sounds like for me what i hear is utter chaos. Constantly. There is never this silence and nothingness he is describing for himself. I explain to him that i of course understand rthe difference between it but it's very hard to explain that to somebody and I had never used the word schizophrenia before and decined my mental provlem  It just straight slipped out. Well then of course he was all  understanding and yeah it's okay and doesn't make a difference blah blah blah and questions galore . Todaywe had some plans and he said he needed to go home. He didn't speak one word to me after that was said and i didnt speak either. We didn't say I'll see you later when parting. No goodbye. Nada.  It was totally bizarre. I guess now he is a different person. Because  I have schizophrenia.  I have always had the stigma and it's never going to go away no matter how well I take care of it I know better than to use that ""S"" word I know better but I did it because I thought this was my friend.  But you know what?  I'm sad and I regret saying it but then of course I also dont regret it. Maybe he wasn't my friend at after all.  Generall anytime anybody hears you have that specifi issur they just don't understand it.  They just don't and obviously don't want to. I see Sally Field cross their face and wait to be called Sybil. Its just so ridiculous. Anyways... I just wanted to get that off my chest. I'm. Well you know as alone as i can be . I cant trust people I guess. It makes me me feel so fake  No matter how well I act no matter how well I try to keep myself contained it just takes the mere mention of the ""s"" word and that to completely change any type relationship. I swear i hear a door slam right in rhe moment  It just  make me very sad. Sorry everyone for my rant. Thank you guys I hope none of you are going through these same things.  If you are please know you're not alone.  I'm truly just very sorry for all of us. We are just out here doing the best we can. Just like everyone else.  Enjoy your Sunday All.",6,schizophrenia

"39/F. ADHD combined and Fibromyalgia. 

I lost my previous job (story of my life) and landed a new one and I was supposed to start today.

Last night my little girl (7) was really sick and I was awake with her until 4 am, I was very close to heading to the hospital with her because her fever/pain/elevated heart rate was so bad.

Instead I did what I could, giving her pain relief/monitoring her/holding her for hours until she calmed down/fell asleep.

Needless to say when the alarm went off at 7am his morning I was a total wreck and my Fibromyalgia has flared up so badly my body is in aching from head to toe.

I messaged my new boss and he was cool with me starting tomorrow instead. Literally so cool about it. 

But.. Can someone please tell me why I feel so guilty about missing one day of work, all I did my was my job as a mother and looked after my sick child?

I honestly feel sick with stress to the point of panic and nausea because I feel like I ""let everybody down""

Why does my brain do this!?

People take sick days *all the fucking time* why do I feel like I need permission from an adult or something to justify looking after myself?

"26 yo male. I’m on disability, working 12 hours a week and I’m on the third month working at my local goodwill. I feel people at my job resent me for my limited hours. And I feel like I’m falling apart at work. 4 hours a day isn’t always overwhelming but many days I just can’t do it, I swear. 

Two things are going on that are concerning me. One is that I have attendance issues. I missed two days because of major blizzards that stuffed me in and I couldn’t get there in the morning on time because of my parents big driveway. Then, I was actually sick one day. I left early a day for an appointment, and left early another day because I was going through psychosis and didn’t feel safe being around people that I think are against me and or reading my thoughts or talking about me badly. I was once a pretty darn reliable worker before my onset age of 22.

As I said, I am on disability so I can fall back on that. However, it is nice to get out of the house. But I do have an employment agent at my local behavioral clinic that can find me a job for people like me(disabled).

They’ve been supportive and listened to my issues and helped find solutions. But the warmer it gets the busier it gets and the more tense it gets on all fronts. I just am having a hard time. And no matter how hard I try sometimes, it just gets impossible to focus even on antipsychotics. 

Oh and they told me I’ve used up a “year’s worth” of attendance points and will talk to me tomorrow about it. Fired from goodwill is not how envisioned my life going when I was a boy. Is it safe to want a fresh start?",6,schizophrenia
"So much of what i see, especially on the internet, but even outside of the intenret, is my own internal experience, memories, and associations, reflected back at me through other experiences, things, names, and people.  its awful.

Some days i honestly feel like how Mal felt in inception, or how Truman felt in the Truman show when he realized everyone was keeping him in the dark and that his life was just a play.

I'm afraid of these feelings affecting others, but this is really how i feel about my own life and its scary to me.

My brain seems to spin narratives out of nothing, where i feel overconnected to the sounds my neighbor makes, and even find myself subconsciously going to the bathroom at the same time as them, only to find out after hearing them flush while im in the bathroom, and its like what they're doing is a reaction to what i am thinking. same with the (loud and annoying) cars outside my window, and of course i just HAVE to live on the bottom floor by a busy street, its like my parents did this to me on purpose, for revenge on me living with them insufferably for years after dropping out of college. even tho i know thats not how they think they feel, i think that's how they feel sometimes, and they wont admit it, but who am i to say how they feel, despite them gaslighting me and me gaslighting them.  so fucked up

it happens with the TV too, feeling like my brain is having a conversation with the TV itself. i know that's ""hallmark paranoid thinking"" but as long as im aware of it, im ""still in the prodrome"" or whatever. i know i need psychiatric help and that's what im getting, but i want to be able to pull myself out of this way my brain works without meds, because i have had really bad experiences with meds and they scare me more than this does.

and yet sometimes when normal life feels less real than this, i really dont know what to make of it, and i dont know what to do.

it doesn't help that i'm really socially isolated, and yet people trying to encourage me to be more social, while not offering up themselves as a social person to be social with, just makes it feel like their help is really misplaced.   doesnt help that because i was socially isolated before getting a job, i tried to force friendships on people i ultimately didnt even want to be friends with and was probly honestly not a good ""match"" for them because i projected what i thought they were onto them, based on appearances and past friendships.

on a different note, i can't believe this is how my life has gone, i had friendships in high school and college, but those were before i came out as trans, and in retrospect, those friendships weren't that deep because i was always acting and being someone i truly wasn't. but since those memories are real, and since the fucked up person i am today is really detached and dissociated, that person i used to be feels like the realest me i have, even tho back then it felt like i was repressed. so now i feel like im trying to find my old self just to get to my new self and its all traumatic.",5,paranoia

"I isolated myself from society because I want to recover and finally give me some time for my mental health. My doctor thinks I'm bipolar, so we're working to hopefully have a diagnosis of my case (28y now, have been dealing with severe depression since my early teens, and have been through a lot of traumatic situations and drug addiction)

Now I've been sober for 1month, but isolating from social apps was a decision that had to be made, so I usually don't go outside unless necessary, and the only people I socialize with are my parents, and a couple of friends like once a week.

I know it's a process, a very long process, but it's inevitable to feel pathetic, alone, miserable. I don't have a job because of agoraphobia, and a lot of mood swings. My friends are busy with their life and also dealing their own wars. To cope with all this, I've been taking antidepressives, mood stabilizers, and Clonazepam for panic attacks.

I don't know anymore, I just needed to vent, these years have been the roughest of my life. I apologize if my English may be confusing sometimes, not my native language. I also apologize if what I wrote doesn't have a very good narrative, I'm kinda threwing up my feelings.

"Ok this is going to be hella long but I hope someone is willing to read this because I need help. For nearly my whole life or as long as I can remember (my earliest memory of feeling like this was when I was 4 and I am now 16) I have been extremely paranoid and it has not stopped in 12 years. It’s not a type of paranoia that I read about most on here like I’m afraid my neighbors are plotting against me or my boyfriend doesn’t actually love me. I constantly feel like there are “things” around me and out to kill me. They taunt me all day every day waiting for the one day they will all finally get me. Now obviously I know that this is a delusion, but I guess the thing with paranoia is you can’t actually convince yourself it’s not real. There is never a single moment where I am not afraid or weary of my surroundings. Like I said this has been going on since I was about 4. The first memory I have of it was I was sitting in my parents bed alone and I wanted to get up and go to the living room but I felt like there were evil things all around and if I got up they would hurt me and when I finally worked up the courage to get up I had to sprint to the couch because I could feel them chasing me. I’ve lived with this feeling every since day since then. I don’t remember having any sort of crazy trauma that may have caused this, or maybe I did and it was so bad I can’t even remember it. My childhood is a foggy memory I don’t really know. 
I have “episodes” I guess that can be as short as a couple hours or as long as 2 weeks. They’re just periods of time where I am twice as paranoid than I usually am, and in consequence I severely lack in self care such as showering or brushing my teeth because I’m too scared to go into the bathroom or be near the mirror, or I can’t do anything all day because if I get out of bed or up off the couch I’m too vulnerable and in danger. I’ve found that they are usually triggered by seeing a scary movie or creepy picture/video on social media because it gives my mind more delusions to make and place them everywhere in my life like for example something that has happened before was I saw a video from an account that makes like digital art video stuff and it was this very disturbing human looking creature creeping around and then bam that was everywhere in my house for the next two weeks. I basically live life in constant fight or flight mode. In my house it’s just me my dad and my dog. I do online school and my dad works full time 5/6 days a week so I am home alone 80% of the time and that is when I am the most scared and vulnerable. I am still very paranoid when my dad is home though, it’s just not quite as bad. I don’t think I have ever truly  hallucinated but I do always think I see things or see an object as something else like a person, or think I see things running around or past me. I also don’t think I really hear voices necessarily, it’s more of my voice in my head saying things that I’m not voluntarily thinking like “if you go in there you are going to die” or “get out right now”, “it’s coming”, “hurry”, stuff like that. Maybe that is what hearing voices is, but it sounds like my voice so idk. I used to only be paranoid when I was alone and when someone was with me I was completely fine. But in the past year and a half ish everything has been getting continuously worse I’m not even slightly okay anymore when I have someone with me, sometimes it’s worse and I think they’re not even real and just a trick to get me to feel safe and let my guard down. 
I’ve always thought this would just go away one day or I’d get used to it but it is impacting my life way too severely now that I’ve been considering therapy and maybe even medication who knows.  

If you read all of that I love you so much.

"I've never used paranoia to describe my mental illness. It always falls under anxiety when I talk about my issues. But I just wanted to share this feeling with people who might understand, who can tell me yes or no, if what I'm experiencing is paranoia.

It's not like the stereostypic ""someone's looking at me through my window"" or the more serious ""I think someone is stalking me everywhere I go."" It's more like, I think the entire universe is out to get me. Like, I'm seruous when I say this, I feel that some being is going out of its way to make me miserable. It knows when I'm happy or feel safe and secure, when I'm most vulnerable, and it drops a bombshell on me. 

My life isn't exactly bad to be honest, I have it pretty good. I have a boyfriend and an apartment and an internship, but every so often, almost like in a sitcom, something utterly stupid happens, something totally out of my control, and it ruins my life for a few days, weeks, months, and in some instances forever. Nothing could have prevented it, an illness, a car accident, losing a job. Not always me but sometimes it affects those around me, indirectly affected me as well.

""That's just life,"" yeah I KNOW that but, it just doesn't feel that way... The universe is sending me a message. Sometimes I hear it talk to me, when I'm at my worst. It's just in my head though, so idk if it's related to my mental illness. I'd like to imagine it is, because the thought of the universe coming down on me the moment I realize it's playing games makes me wanna puke.

I've been like this since... middle school I guess. I remember distinctly. I got bad grades because the universe wanted me to be stupid and everyone else to be smart. I would study and memorize and still get B's and C's. It didn't matter that I tried, everyone else was better. I think it's the universe's way of saying I was never meant to be here and that I should stop trying. I'll never be good enough.

"They say that to be able to achieve anything, to find motivation, you need to know your “why”. I call it knowing my endgame. I think that’s absolutely true and it has always worked well for me.

I left home a few days after highschool graduation - I moved to another country to study and it was as exciting as it was exhausting. With barely any time off, I was studying or working or thinking of either. Still, although it was hard I was able to pull it off - cause I knew what my endgame was. I wanted a degree.

After leaving uni, when I was finally free of shuckles and could do whatever I wanted, **I realised I had absolutely no idea what I was supposed to do**. I no longer knew what my end game was.

For a long time now, I have been wondering what to do about that. Is my endgame for the week to get to the weekend? Is my endgame for the next couple of years to get a better paying job? And then, after I’ve done it all, what will my endgame be? What’s the actual point of reading, taking walks, staying healthy, keeping relationships?

And then it hit me, as banal as it sounds, that the endgame might just be those things in itself. The point of reading a book shouldn’t be to finish a chapter, to finish it all, to finish another one by the end of the month. It is to *read.* The point of going for walks isn’t to walk a mile, to walk ten miles, to take 7 walks each week, it is to *walk*.  


Obviously, there will always be things we can’t find pleasure in, and having goals is useful. But for the most part, I think I should make peace with the fact that the process should be the endgame in itself.

But how to do that with ADHD? When your body is literally incapable of producing satisfaction from those tasks? Or worse, it’s a *chore* to read, to walk, to hang out with friends. How do I live then?",3,adhd

An example of this would be a simple short, easy cycle/run bringing the onset of physical symptoms such as dizziness, tight chest, blurry eyesight etc. Before all this started i was quite fit and have ran marathons in the past so i have a decent idea how exercise feels and how my body should react to it.  


The only thing that makes sense to me here is that the stress caused by exercise tips my already quite high level of stress just over the edge and into a place where physical symptoms occur. Does this make sense and importantly, has anyone else been through this? It's frustrating to have been so active and now face this, especially when 95% of anxiety and exercise material is about the postive side effects.  


I also experience the onset of symptoms if i have caffeine, or sometimes during other controlled stress actions like, cold bath/shower, wim hof breathing

"hey, since reddit is so comforting for me i wanted to ask u guys for some advice.
i suffer from anxiety, depression, insomnia, bpd, psychosis and other ""minor"" things but these are the principal.
in june, i went home from my bfs house, i couldn't sleep bc i missed him so much and then at 9am i tried to sleep. i felt like passing out, everything felt dizzy and strange. i had a panic attack and i had to go to my grandmas house, bc i wanted her to call an ambulance, after 4 hours of screaming and hitting myself to ""stay alive"" i calmed myself down. i kinda collapsed in a deep sleep and i woke up at 9pm, feeling like extreme shit. my head felt so heavy, my sight was so bad and i couldn't recognize myself in the mirror. i had episodes for most of my teenage years but this was just different. the fact is, i got so bad i couldn't speak, i had moments of blackout where i hurt myself and i screamed so loud my neighbours wanted to call the authorities. my mom told me these things bc i completely forgot. i couldn't go out, i left therapy bc of this, i just couldn't do it. for months i was convinced of having brain cancer, thrombosis, aneurysms and things like that. for 3 months sorta i had hallucinations everyday, i couldn't see anything in fact i thought i had to get glasses, i couldn't sleep, i kept having convulsions 24/7, at that time i was also just 16. i felt pain everywhere, and bc i feared having thrombosis whenever i looked at my arms i thought my veins were black, i had multiple panic attacks bc of this in different days. somehow, in september the situation calmed down, and now i can see, i rarely have hallucinations and i think im getting better. i got my blood tested and it came out positive, im absolutely sane. but i have a problem. my hypochondria wont go away. idk what to do. im afraid of dying soon and i dont think that going to the doctor frequently could help me, soon il be back on my meds, i hope they'll help. how do i reassure myself that im not gonna die soon or in my sleep or that i dont have a deadly disease? can u guys help me? my bf is the only person that can calm me. when hes not with me i burst into panic. what should i do? im tired of living in fear. i hope someone will read this and answer. my story is much longer than i wrote here but this is just a summary of everything. i just want to stop worrying abt every single pain i feel. i wanna start living u know?:(",5,paranoia
"I was very flattered to be asked to be a bridesmaid (one of six) to my mother-in-law who is remarrying. She see's me as a daughter and wanted me to me part of the very special day.

I have various anxiety disorders, which make it difficult for me to do, well, anything. It is extremely debilitating. I barely leave the house. Can't get into other people's cars. Can't go into public places (other than a supermarket), don't see friends etc. I see a psychiatreist and a therapist weekly, and we have been working on a plan and doing exposures to help.

When she originally asked me a few months ago, I initially said that I do not think it was a good idea, due to my mental health. I said I did not want her to be worrying about me, as the day is all about her, so I am happy to be in the background, unnoticed. She said that I do not have to partake in any activities that I will not feel comfortable doing, and I do not have to match dresses or walk down the aisle etc.

Well, this has now all changed, and before I knew it, I had an invitation to a dress try on's, booked to see a hair stylist, makeup etc. All, I suppose, are normal for a wedding (so yes, stupid for me to assume that I wouldn't do this). I have said that I can't really do these things, but I keep getting booked on to do it. I have only managed to do the dress try on. But, I have been trying to find the bravery to book to see a dressmaker to make alterations, and just can’t face it. And, even though it’s well known I can’t get into a car, I’m getting picked up by a bus to take me there. Something I just cannot do.

I managed to get a dress second-hand very cheap (less than £30). I bought my own shoes and jewellery, so, the brides hasn’t paid for a lot. 

There are now several months until the wedding. And although I have been doing a lot to try and get myself into a position where I could walk down the aisle with her, do a speech etc., but, I just don't think I'm there yet. So I am wanting to back out of being a bridesmaid, and just attend as a guest, where I can sit at the back near an exit and be more of a fly-on-a-wall.

I want to know if I’m going to be a horrible person if I back out. I'm so nervous to even speak about it with her, because I cant stand that I'll be upsetting someone, or ruining their plans. This is THEIR wedding, and they must be so nervous as it is and I really really do not want to add to it or cause any unnecessary stress. I'm just so worried that it'll come to the day and I just won't be able to leave the room, and by then, it's too late. It’s horrible that my anxiety affects others and not just me.",4,anxiety

"Hi!! 

So just over two weeks ago I did a bit of an introduction, vent and ask for advice and I have a bit of an update which. Really sucks if I'm going to be honest. 

I had a quick preliminary call with a Neurologist about three weeks after my MRI, where they said - as if it was facts - that my tumour was hopefully benign, small and livable. I wouldn't need treatment unless it grew or spread. 

So, it's been nearly five weeks since my MRI and I've heard nothing. Today I pushed and pushed, like I have for a week, and finally got to talk to someone. Turns out there's a five week delay on MRI results within the NHS. That preliminary call was mostly possible outcomes and hopes, not facts. 

The fact is, I have to wait up to another five weeks for my MRI results and properly clinical appointment to know what my brain tumour is, how bad it is, what treatment to do if any. And it's terrifying. I'm experiencing such severe seizures that are putting me in hospital, so I'm finally on some treatment and medication for that but - has anyone else experienced this type of wait? It's absolutely terrifying. I feel completely frozen in place waiting for this. 

 They've got me in contact with some groups and things ready, they've given me tons of reading and advice for the I guess worst case scenario. Just, scared. Needed to vent. See if anyone else has experienced this. 

Thanks all

i have a fear that everyone will disappear. not in an abandonment issue type way where i'm scared everyone hates me. no. i am afraid that every single person on the face of the planet will randomly vanish into thin air and that i will be the only person in existence and stuck in this world absolutely alone and terrified. stupid, right? but here i am. i live with my boyfriend and i just walked into our bedroom after going to the washroom, knowing i saw him walk in there before me. he was hiding in the closet as a joke (he doesn't know about my fear) and i had a full blown panic attack. sometimes at night when i am facing away from him, i need to make sure we are touching in some way just incase he disappears while my back is facing him. and this doesn't only happen with him, this fear goes back to when i was 8 years old. i'm just using him as an example because we are together the most. anyway, i just wanted to hear someone's thoughts about this, and to know if anyone else has ever experienced this / heard of someone else experiencing it.

"Hello everybody,  
(Long story short) I fit the bill for IBD, Ankylosing Spondylitis and unfortunately have HPV manifesting as genital warts. I'm currently at the end of my two-month Budesonide+Paracetamol treatment suggested by my GI. The treatment helped a lot, but I still get a nasty bowel and joint flare about once a week. I would like to pursue a more aggressive treatment. However, my first colonoscopy is scheduled for the end of the month and I expect my doc to suggest DMARDs or biologics. My fear is that the HPV infection might bloom due to immunomodulators and I will have to stick with steroids and joint pain all over for about two years.

I've been on 6mg of respirodone for a while now I went from 2mg to 4mg to 6mg. I never felt and I definitely never asked to be put on a higher dose. I know I'm an outlier and maybe its because it's been so long since I've been on it or maybe I'm just not that observant I've never felt that respirodone has that many noticable effects. I know it helps me sleep and it has definitely given me ED but that's it. Not once did the difference psychologists I spoke to tell me why they where uping my dosage or even that 6 is a high dosage. Now after researching it I'm not sure but isn't 6mg like an extremely high dosage? Like I've really struggled to find people telling stories about there experiences who where on 6mg. I feel like I must of said something to the psychologists that concerned them but they didn't tell me what it was. They didn't tell me what part of what I was telling them concerned them and gave me the impression that things didn't seem to bad with me. I really don't feel like my schizophrenia is bad enough for me to be on such a high dose.

"My sister is 30 and was just diagnosed with schizophrenia. My family and I always thought she suffered from depression and anxiety but she never sought help and when we tried to intervene she refused and would always do something that showed she was getting help on her own such as going to a therapist whenever we begged her. Other than that she functioned normally (or pretended to at least).

She went through a psychotic break two weeks ago and had to go to the hospital in which she finally went to psychiatric care. When we found out her diagnosis it was a shock and now none of us really know how to help her. Schizophrenia doesn’t run in our family so this is really new to us and we are trying to do our best to help her with the voices in her head she talks about.

She was recently discharged with medicine for her thyroid problems, zoloft, and risperidone. It’s only been three days but every night she still starts to hear voices around 5pm and at 8pm is when she begins to lash out and believes people are talking bad about her or lying to her. These voices are always negative. 

Please give me some advice I can give to my family. I live three thousand miles away so it’s hard knowing that I have no answers for them. I am trying to see if I can contact the doctor personally about her medicine. 

In your experiences how long before your medicine started to work? With medicine do you still hear voices in your head? Do they stay negative or do they ever become positive? What is the best approach to someone who believes everyone around them is lying?

"This started happening around 10 months ago. I think it started off as extreme anxiety about the possibility of nuclear war but it's kinda spiraled out of control.

At first, I was anxious about the possibility of nuclear war. I wanted to move out of the city I'm in to the countryside. I remember crying to my mum about wanting to move away because I was that terrified. I would go to sleep thinking everyday was going to be my last.

That fear got worse. I started to become scared of any planes, helicopters, etc. Multiple times a day I would start screaming because I thought one of them was a nuke and I was about to die. I would constantly be watching the sky to see if I could see any nukes. I live near a hospital where theres a lot of helicopters coming and going, it freaks me out.

I started hallucinating too. I would see everything getting really bright which would freak me out. Or everything around me would start to distort. One time, when everything was getting bright, I genuinely hallucinated my name being called. It was freaky.

Anyway, it did start to get better. Ive been avoiding the news about it and I try to avoid conversations about it. I'm still scared of helicopters, planes and loud sounds outside. 

I'm not sure if it's starting to get worse again. I recently moved in with my boyfriend and the bedroom faces a main road. There are cars constantly going past. The particularly loud ones really freak me out. I jump everytime. This morning, I got woken up by a loud car and it really scared me. My heart rate was 130bpm when it woke me up. Of course when I came onto reddit I see shit about Putin pulling out of the nuclear treaty and my boyfriend commented that ww3 is coming soon. I haven't told him about this stuff yet, it's honestly embarrassing.

I'm not even fully sure if this is paranoia? Maybe before I was paranoid but now I'm just terrified by outside noises (cars too apparently).

As I'm waiting for my colonscopy, I noticed that both blood and mucus radically stopped thanks to a super basic diet (no caffeine, no sugar, no milk, no dry fruit. Only fruit, vegetables, rice, white bread/pasta, fish and meat). As soon as I cheat it seems that blood comes back right away, even if it was a mini-cheat (like a taste of ice-cream one time and a mini-muesli dose the other one.). 

Could such a strict link between blood/mucus in stool be IBDs or is that a way too simple thing to be related to IBDs?",0,negative_samples
"I am pretty active on twitter under a pseudonym. Recently, I've grown incredibly suspicious of a handful of my followers. I feel like two/three in particular are plotting against me. I think one of them is trying to push me out of the fandom space in order to take over my position. I think another one is posting seemingly innocuous tweets where she talks negatively about a character I like, and that these tweets are directed at me in order to make me feel bad because she wants me dead/away. I think a third one is pushing my buttons a little bit. I think people in general are surveiling me because they dislike me and are waiting for an opportunity to attack me. I'm afraid that some people are gonna stalk or doxx me.

Thing is, twitter can be ruthless, so it's not like my fears are completely unfounded. I don't have any definitive proof that these people are out to get me, just a feeling. 

The issue is that it's affecting my real life a lot. I struggle to sleep because I'm so anxious. I have nightmares. I have been growing increasingly fond of alcohol to lessen the feelings. I'm struggling to concentrate on uni. I deactivated my main twitter account and I look absolutely deranged on my private account because I'm talking about how people are out to get me.",5,paranoia

"I know everyone with ADHD is going to experience varying symptoms to varying degrees. As per my diagnosis (DSM-5), I suffer from every single Inattentive type symptom, and none of the hyperactive type symptoms.

Sometimes the stereotypical symptoms (especially hyperactivity and impulsiveness) feel so alien to me. I also don’t recall ever hyper focusing on anything either. 

It often causes me a fair bit of anxiety, believing I’ve been misdiagnosed and something else is going on up there. The biggest things I really suffer from are VERY bad memory, keeping focus and spacing out / blanking. A really big one that affects every part of my life is blanking in conversations. I don’t feel nervous or anxious, and I don’t have an aversion to socialising but I do find it very difficult to hold conversation. My brain just goes blank in any conversation (makes it very difficult during therapy sessions, because I end up unable to explain or recall things).

Anyway, I guess this is just a rant. Wondering if anyone experiences similar?",3,adhd
"Does it make you feel angry too when people use the word depression inappropriately?  I just wish people understood that depression is not just feeling sad but it is something that actually affects your lifestyle and is debilitating in every way.  The incorrect use of this word bothers me a lot not because it takes away something from my condition but because I think that if you use it incorrectly you start to be treated less seriously. I've been suffering from depression for several years now and when I hear some of my friends say ""I don't feel like going out because I'm depressed"" it really makes me angry.  There is a difference between feeling down occasionally from feeling bad almost every day. Am I exaggerating in saying this in your opinion?",2,depression

Not late, late late. Then I get up. What’s worse is that I tried it, working out then going to work. Got stuck in traffic, made me late, ended up on my ick list of things to do.

"Hello I just wanted to post because no one around me seems to be able to relate. I've been struggling with mental health my whole life (depression, anxiety, ADD).

 In the last year my primary doctor has suspected I may have chronic fatigue syndrome. There's no test for this other than to rule out everything else my fatigue could be. All my blood tests and insomnia test were negative, and the last test to rule out was sleep apnea. So for over 3 months of waiting to get tested for that I was mentally preparing for either. I honestly was hoping it would just be sleep apnea because that is treatable and cfs is not. 

 I got my test result back a few weeks ago and I have the lowest possible sleep apnea positive score. I was relieved at first because I had only mentally prepared for it to be one or the other. But when I saw my primary again, she said most likely my light sleep apnea isn't what's making me so fatigued all the time but she can't diagnose me officially with chronic fatigue syndrome until I attempt to fix the sleep apnea. So she told me it is most likely both.

Now I have been waiting even longer for the sleep doctor to tell me what to do and I still haven't heard back almost a month later. I may not find out a real answer for another year or maybe never. I'm feeling so hopeless because I researched and all they know about chronic fatigue syndrome is that you can get bedridden from it and it's not treatable and may in fact take up to 20 years off your lifespan because of higher rates of heart attack or suicide. 

Does anyone else have chronic fatigue syndrome officially that also struggles with depression and anxiety? How do I live with the probability of this? I am already out a job and can no longer leave the house easily by myself because I don't feel it's safe to drive. But I'm not much closer to finding the true answer so I just feel hopeless. I haven't included all the ways my fatigue affects me but it has ruined my life. Anyone dealing with something similar please share how you deal with this",2,depression
"I was recently playing a tabletop RPG, playtesting my own system I'm working on. While playtesting a new rule I had added, my brother got very frustrated about the new rule after losing a roll to another player. He claims I interrupted him. I'm not sure if I did before he started yelling, as I was trying to explain that the changes he was recommending were something we already tested and rejected in a session he didn't attend.

I definitely interrupted him as he was yelling, asking him ""Will you listen?"" I raised my voice slightly in exasperation and to be heard, but didn't approach his volume. I don't think it's disrespectful to interrupt someone shouting to intimidate you to ask them to calm down, though it probably isn't effective. His response was to get louder, shouting ""NO I WILL NOT LISTEN"" and continuing on a tirade that lasted maybe 30-40 seconds. Myself and the other five players went deathly silent. When he finally stopped talking, I said I'd have to reconsider that part of the system and moved on to something else because I could see that everyone was uncomfortable and just wanted to get back to the gaming.

The next week, I wrote him a note expressing how unacceptable that was to shout me into silence. I tried to set a personal boundary in that note, and it enraged him. He called it an ultimatum (pasted word for word below this paragraph), and I can see why he might call it that. It was my first attempt at a personal boundary, so I don't have a lot of experience with this.

*If another such outburst occurs in any game in the future, that will be the last game I play with you. I’m playing to have fun, hang out with friends, tell an interesting story, and in the case of last week’s playtest, I wanted to try out various systems and changes for my own game. Outbursts like that make all of those things impossible.*

Of note, he declared angrily many years ago that we would never play a competitive game together again after I beat him in a game of Dominion. He claims I gloat when I'm winning and whine when I'm losing, but I think that's more of a product of his perception than my behavior, as no one else has ever raised this concern. We still play cooperative games, but I often find if we start struggling or lose the game, he starts criticizing my gameplay, either immediately or in the car ride home.

He has interpreted the above italicized statement in two ways. First, he accused me of trying to dictate what he could do and deny his rights. I view it as telling him I won't put up with being silenced, and he has no right to do that to me.

Second, he hasn't said this out loud, but I believe he interpreted this as me trying to kick him out of our gaming group. If I wanted to do this, I could have simply called for a vote to kick him out over the shouting. Instead, I suppressed my desire to immediately declare I would not play with him any longer, and thought about it for six days before writing my letter. I asked several of the players later, and they were all deeply uncomfortable.

He's gone on the offensive because of the note. He didn't even talk to me about the letter I wrote, bringing it to the next game session and forcing a two hour discussion about it with the others. I had no idea he was going to do this. He had what I can only describe as a predatory glare when he brought out the letter, stared at me, and said something along the lines of ""You think you can make an ultimatum to me? I'll show you what happens when you make ultimatums."" He hadn't said a word to me about the letter yet at this point, choosing instead to pop it on the entire group and try to paint me as the bad guy.

This is the second time he's had an outburst like this. He did it in a previous game, but because it was the first time it ever happened, I didn't know what to do, and we moved past it without a consequence.  There was no letter or even discussion about it, we just moved on. That was four years ago. I still didn't know what to do the second time, so I'm trying to put together a personal boundary statement to prepare for this in the future. He's only ever shouted at me, but I've seen him take an annoyed/angry tone in other games and our writing group if people contradict him. He hasn't shouted them down, but it wouldn't surprise me if those other folks had felt intimidated.

This is what I came up with after watching some videos and reading some mental health webpages. This is my first time ever having to do something like this, so any advice would be appreciated.

*This is me setting a personal boundary for my own health and safety. When you shout me into silence, I feel disrespected and intimidated. I cannot control your behavior, only how I react to your behavior. When you shout me into silence or otherwise intimidate me, I will repeat this boundary and ask you why you feel it is okay to silence my voice. I also reserve the right to walk away if I don’t feel safe or capable of engaging in respectful conversation.*

I appreciate your input. Thanks.",4,anxiety
"hey guys, i don’t have a medical diagnosis or anything and am not sure if i have ‘paranoia’ but i was wondering if any of y’all had advice or tips for some symptoms i live with DAILY that control my life.

some examples:
- constantly scared that i will die or my family will die
- think i will be part of a shooting or mass shooting every time im in public
- cant eat fast food bc i think the workers spit in it or did something to it
- cant get mad at someone for too long before thinking they will die that night
- hear noises that aren’t there and assume someone is breaking in

i don’t feel like i have anxiety, because i’m not jittery or insanely nervous to leave the house, but i struggle with these main fears every second of everyday. i don’t think a moment goes by where i’m not thinking abt my paranoiac thoughts.

does anyone else go through something like this and have any advice or tips? im not sure if i need medication, or maybe just therapy, or maybe to practice grounding. 

any advice will help!",5,paranoia

"I'm new here, wish I'd thought to come here sooner but I guess it's only been a few weeks that I've known what this is, which also makes me even dumber than I originally thought I guess. 

I've had a really really bad year, I guess I'm looking for a bit of venting/commiserating and advice for anyone willing to chug through the mess to follow.

Roughly a year ago, I engaged in some extreme self harm, I ended up with a severe concussion as a result. As it would happen, I led a chaotic life when I was younger, I'm 33m now. Wrestled in HS and college, did a lot of dirt biking and mountain biking (poorly), and was generally accident prone- so I'd had what was likely many concussions before, and been knocked clean out unfortunately for a few minutes on at least 3 occasions. None of those had ever really fazed me head trauma wise in the past though, but this one did. Boy howdy did it. 

My balance was wrecked, I was hiding from light like a vampire, dizzy, nauseous, head pounding with pain constantly, and incapable of even simple tasks it felt like. A quick trip to the grocery store would put me down for 2-3 days. This continued forever it felt like- but some things improved quickly though- my eye tracking, balance, and quick thinking all improved, yet I still continued to have constant headaches, dizziness, and light sensitivity.

It took me 6 months after the incident to be able to see a neurologist the first time. They fixed up my meds a bit and things got a little better. It took nearly 6 months to see them again, and I was in a pit of despair. 

You see, people talk about headaches with that 's' at the end, like individuals that come and go, and I guess it used to be that way with me too. I got headaches occasionally like anyone else, I even had a bout with migraines for a year or so when I was 17. This past year though had been different, I haven't had headaches. I've had one headache. I've had it the entire time- sure it waxes and wanes, but it's *never*, ever, gone. It's there so day, every day. Waking, sleeping, resting or working. It's a constant companion, I almost feel like I should name it at this point.

When I saw the neurologist again a few weeks ago, they told me they believe that my concussion triggered a severe chronic migraine disorder. Which, gee, I feel like I should have started putting puzzle pieces together sooner myself, but I've just let it be some existential head trauma that wasn't healing and had no end in sight till now. You won't find many willing to testify to my intelligence.

It's damn liberating to finally know what it is and have angles to attack it from, and thankfully my wife has good insurance, she's dragged my useless carcass through all of this. The triptans all killed me beforehand, so they've got me looking at injections. Ubrelvey worked wonders- it's the closest I've been to not having a headache in a year. Most days I start around a 4 or 5 and end around 7 or 8 unless I exacerbate it by doing something, but an ubrelvey cuts it back to a 4. Unfortunately insurance won't let me have aimovig and ubrelvey, so I have to give it up to try the injections... Acupuncture has actually worked quite well too, I tried it for the first 2 times over the last 3 weeks.

I have real hope for the first time in so long, but at the same time knowing the likely limitations of the injections, it also feels like the last of my hope is dying. I've had this headache for so long, almost a year to the day, I don't remember the exact date, just that I went strawberry picking that day- I'm wondering if this headache is now just a permanent partner in my life, and I don't know how to deal with that. That thought is crushing me almost as much as the headache itself, or my inadequacy as a spouse and father resulting from it all. I'm failing so many things and my family every day, and I'm just an angry and bitter burden on them. I hate that so much, but there's seemingly no positive outcome for them- they're either stuck with this broken shell, or would have to deal with the horrible fallout of how I chose to leave. I haven't given up just yet, trying to take it one day at a time... I'm just really struggling.

To another day, and another way to disappoint the ones we love.",0,negative_samples

The same goes for the car gear, i always forget to hit the pedals before moving them so most of the times I almost break the damn car.

"this is gonna be a confusing time,and i’ve had trouble figuring out which subreddit to post this in,but i settled here since i might just be overthinking things.

i got contacted by someone on instagram,asking me if i was a guy or not. at first i was confused,he didn’t follow anyone i was following,nor did he follow anyone my boyfriend followed. i had dodged the question and just asked who they are,however,they responded by asking the same question again. i answered just by saying that i was biologically a girl. he had acknowledged my response and afterwards i asked why he contacted me. he said that “my friend wanted me to ask you.” i had asked who was said friend,but the only detail i got was that their name started with a J. apparently,said friend had a crush on my boyfriend,and did not know if my boyfriend was gay or not. i had accepted this reason,and conversed with the person a little more before going to do my own thing. 

here’s the kicker,my boyfriend did not give out his instagram to anyone,merely two people,both of which names did not start with J. and my boyfriend only knew one person with a J name,which is who i’m suspicious of. so i was wondering,how did they get my account? my boyfriend follows quite a few people,and so i’m deducing that they went through his following to find me. which is a little weird to me. afterwards,instead of asking me or my boyfriend directly,used a friend to ask me if i was a guy? we both have no idea who’s the friend,or maybe merely a stranger,who had a crush on him. i deal with anxiety and paranoia,which is why i’ve been uneasy this whole time. this whole thing could be a prank but it would be a kinda elaborate prank wouldn’t it? i’m probably overthinking this,what should i do? how do i deal with this anxiety,and is this normal?

"Long time listener, first time caller.

Gah. 39yo and worked out this was probably me end of 2021. Since then been stuck in a waiting list (UK based) for referral.

If I was to explain what my head has felt like most of my life, it'd be an octopus weave of tentacles trying to access various parts of my brain whilst a swarm of bees just fly around inside just incase things felt too quiet. I just cannot switch off, invasive thoughts (sometimes not entirely pleasant) just constantly queue jumping in front of whatever it was I had decided five minutes previously was a priority. 

I can be sat on a Teams call that I'm chairing, suddenly look at my watch for the time. Then I'm counting watch links. Then I'm thinking what I'd need to get to smelt down the metals, could I repour them into a mould fo... ""So what do you think about that?"". 

Me: 'sorry my connection went then, can you repeat that?'

I work such lumpy hours, I know everything I need to do but sometimes I can be sat there just pointing a stick at my head awaiting something to happen. Then inevitably I get my work done at 10pm that evening, fueled by the mix of needing to get it done and the relative quiet of the evening. 

Sleep is just an arse. Can never fall asleep within 90 mins and ruminate through the churn of whatevers happening. It's like you go to flick the switch but it goes from on to on. I can rarely fall asleep quickly but only when absolutely exhausted, never at 'bedtime' but those times feel so good to just know I'm in that state.

The more I learn and read about ADHD the more it fits the things I've always struggled with but have lacked the awareness of what it was and wasn't strictly neurotypical behaviour. Could never concentrate at school or absorb information easily, was always told I could do big things by teachers (English usually) but just needed to apply myself. 

I lose so many items around the house and so many hours of my life meandering through. I'm getting there, my workplace are supporting me now (I decided to get it in the open with them last week) and am trying to get the process of a referral expedited. Just feel so exhausted, feel like I'm close to burning out at the moment and feel really emotional. Spoke to some good people recently who have ADHD and it's given me hope. Been on a journey with anxiety and depression for 20 years, if I can potentially get to a root cause and maybe tailor meds to help I'd be so happy. I mean I am happy sometimes but it's always underpinned, always compromised by never being able to fully feel that joy of just being without the constant noise of expectation, failure and inability to just be 'normal'.

"It’s a long-established and trusted hotel. They had my card on file for incidentals and have a website fully capable of receiving payments.

"I have a diary entry from the age of eleven talking about how much I wanted to die. I'm nineteen now, and not a day goes by that I don't regret not ending it sooner. 

I go to a good school, but I'm not overly passionate about my major, but then again I'm not really passionate about anything. I have a generally great family, and am upper middle class. I had a mostly good upbringing too; I only doubt my mother's love sometimes. So there's really nothing I can complain about.

I just am so lonely a lot of the time. I don't have a best friend. There's always someone better to hang out with. I'm a good person, I think, but there's always someone better. One of my friends comes to visit sometimes, but ditches me after an hour to hang out with her other friends in the area, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't cry all the way back to my dorm. I find myself doing dishes at other people's places, baking them things, giving them gifts, desperate to feel wanted and kept around. But there's no one with whom I've really ""clicked"" with, and certainly no one who actually reaches out to me. One of them even forgot my birthday. All of my friendships feel so superficial. I don't add anything to my family or my relationships. I feel like if I just disappear, it won't even be a blip in the radar.

Like I said, I've been sad for almost longer than I've been alive. I don't even know what's holding me back at this point. Why haven't I ended it? I'm not diagnosed; in fact, I don't even know who my doctor is. I just keep everything inside. And I have some friends who have gotten help for it and are better off for it, and I can't help but compare myself to them. One of them cried in bed for days, dropped out of school. For some reason, I just power through. I cry myself to sleep and hide behind long sleeves but I'm still functional. I shower, I get passing grades, I pull my head out of my ass and attend class and study and exercise, but I still feel so empty at the end of the day. Like all of it was in vain. I want to be like my friends who got help, but I don't know who to talk to (again, I don't know my doctor). I can't talk to my friends, because frankly, none of them actually *care* about how I feel when I would move mountains for them. I cried for hours when I realized that no one will ever care about me as much as I care for them. 

I feel like I'm a lost cause, honestly. Like the only way I'll get help is an un-alive attempt. I've gotten this far without help, like, do I even need it? Maybe I'm faking this all for the odd chance that someone asks how I'm really doing.",2,depression
"I cant sleep, all week I haven’t been able to sleep at all or barely. 

It’s 6 am right now and I feel like I’m full of energy but at the same time moments from passing out. 

I feel like I’m about to start crying and punching shit but at the same time I can’t move. 

Im scared as shit right now and I feel like I’m being watched but I know it’s stupid but I have this feeling like something sinister  is going to happen. 

All week I’ve had this feeling looming over me that something bad will happen, I brush it off as my anxiety but I feel like something is actually going to happen this time. 

I cant even recognize myself anymore, I look in the mirror and I just stare blankly every time I look I look different, my eyes change or my eyebrows of how my face shape is. 

Randomly when I’m having a conversation with someone it’s like my entire body freezes and it’s like when your in a dream and you realize your in a dream and everything feels unreal, and like everyone is trying to kill you . 

I freeze up and it’s like my soul fucking leaves my body and I’m unable to move and it’s like my body shuts down and I can’t talk and my eyes start tearing up and I start freaking the fuck out. 

I keep having images of myself pop into my head , but sometimes when it happens it sends me into a panic because I can’t recognize myself i don’t know how to explain it, it’s like someone took over my body and it’s not me anymore like I’ve been fucking replaced but I’m still In my body. 

I don’t know if it makes sense and I don’t know how to explain it In words it’s just a feeling I get it’s like pure terror when it happens and I sit there and it’s like I can’t breathe for a bit. 

My heart is beating so fast and I feel like I’m about to cry I don’t know what’s happening but I’m fucking scared , I feel like something in the universe shifted and something is wrong. 

It’s been like this for a while it’s like one day somethint changed, I don’t know what it was but the world changed. 

At my old school I would have this same feeling and I would have to speed walk through the hallways so I wouldn’t start crying, it’s like everyone was staring at me. 

It felt like something was trying to get me and if I stopped and looked around I would see it. It stopped for a while and I felt better but it’s started happening again and it scares the shit out of me.",5,paranoia
"i told him i wanted to be friends because he was hitting on me so i wanted to let him down gently, and he said that was fine. but actually i really fucking don’t want to be friends either. i’m at the stage where i have a support system that doesn’t cause me huge amounts of anxiety to be around but it’s taken me YEARS to build this system, and this guy talking to me has really put a huge damper on all of that. we’re just not compatible as friends, we don’t think the same way or have similar interests, and he always gets upset when i don’t reply quickly (my slow replies are a problem, but one that all my friends know about it - i have really bad executive dysfunction when it comes to texting back, it sometimes takes me weeks or months just to get back to the people I love and i hate when new people think they’re entitled to my quick replies. it takes a massive amount of mental energy from me). i know it’s my fault for telling him i want to be friends instead of just saying i don’t want to talk but 1) how the hell do you tell someone you see around that you don’t want to be even friends? 2) i still feel the need to be liked and 3) its silly but i believe all men are out to kill me so i didnt know how else to reject him. 

i just want to be left alone with the people i love, this is why i usually isolate myself, i wish id never spoken to him. i feel like i sound like a massive asshole because a lot of people would love more friends but im a huge introvert and the people i do let into my life, i let into my life because they’re incredibly compatible with me and i love spending time with them and they EASE my anxiety. 

i don’t want to be friends with someone who wants to make small talk and wants me to make it back and now i don’t know what to do and i have an anxiety attack every time he texts me. it’s not even his fault (im just mentally fucked) but he’s ruining my summer already",4,anxiety

"There’s a guy that has been bugging me about autism for a while now. He spread a rumor that I was autistic for NO reason last year when he barely even knew me, but that didn’t bother me that much because it eventually faded.

But a few days ago, he came up to me and asked me if I was autistic. I ignored the question because it’s NONE OF HIS BUSINESS and then he gave an unsolicited list of reasons why he thinks I’m autistic. He gave me nitpicks of the way I speak, walk, act, and literally everything that “came off as autistic”. 

Then he said I should stop trying to pretend and everyone in the school thinks I’m autistic already and I should just “come out”. 

Idk what to do now. It’s making me feel so naked.

Edit: forgot to mention he’s either allistic and ableist, or a closeted autistic that acts ableist and bigoted for fun. Probably the first option, judging by the way he wrote the list and the fact that autistic is his favorite cuss word. It wasn’t really educated, it kinda sounded like he got everything he knew about autism from The Good Doctor (yes, he made a reference to the good doctor). It was more like “you talk weirdly and clutter a lot, you walk like a penguin, you tic sometimes, your facial expressions are weird, you’re awkward, you’re kind of nerdy, you don’t make eye contact, and you just act SO autistic!!!”

Edit 2: I’m seeing a lot of comments about this but I don’t think he’s autistic. He reposted [this](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM222pr9N/) on his story recently. He’s just one of those people who think we’re toys.",1,autism
"I don't understand why everything I do need to be quick. I don't understand why even when I am doing chores or if I'm doing my things before chores I need to be quick. If I don't, I'll get scolded. I don't understand why I'm not allowed to take my time.

 My parents always scolded me ""I'm always the one doing this, that. You never do anything you're always so slow!"" They said without fail every single day. You might think maybe I'm overreacting or if I'm actually the problem because of what they said. I think so too. But this has been going for so long and it actually affected my mental health and my daily life.

I've always felt rushed. I feel like if I don't do anything soon or if I'm even resting not doing anything I'm useless, I'm garbage, human waste, I never ever do anything! For example, when I'm waiting for the bus even if it is a little late I would be nervous as if I've done something wrong and started waiting outside of my house eventhough it's actually still early.(my bus comes to my house) or when my father came to pick me up from school I need to get on the car fast. Even if I'm a little late because I waited for the kid in front of me to get on their car, I'll be scolded. 

I don't like the feeling of being rushed as if I don't do nothing I'm useless. I can't even take my time because I felt like I'm being wastefull. If someone does something for me I feel like a burden. I always feel restless because I think I don't deserve the time to rest. I need to do anything fast. Fast. I guess that was when I started to hate that word. 

Why do we need to be fast in everything to do? Does this mean we have to die fast too? If we can then I would be glad. But that is the only thing god wouldn't gave me. Even if I prayed I guess I would die if I get little older? I've always wanted to take a look of the afterlife. Whatever it is I hate the need to be fast. But I can't rest myself because it has been embedded in my mind that I need to do something fast. The only time stop was when I'm sleeping. Then I wouldn't have had to worry about anything. In that dream, it was a given that we would be so slow. If only I coulde sleep eternally, like aurora except without the true love kiss. 

When I don't do anything fast, there will be consequences. I.will.be.scolded. No matter where it is. I hate living so much. But I don't have the courage to end my life. I can only hope my natural death would be near.",2,depression

This is very debilitating.  I don't get or care to get certain social queues.  My wife cries sometimes about me being this stone-cold asshole but I can't seem to find the right emotion to help her.

" I don't know what happened to me. As a teenager, I was wild.. I started doing meth when I was 13 and was on and off til I was 17. I'm sure that has taken a huge role on my mental health now. But I was soooo care free. I used to hitch hike all around North America. Meet new people, sleep with strangers. (Not just sexually, but actually sleep with them in many different situations.) Then when I was 21, I started doing heroin, which then lead to fentanyl. That's truly what ruined my life. I had always been a functional alcoholic/drug addict until I did opiates. I went through a lot of pretty traumatic shit thanks to my fentanyl addiction. My husband and I lived with a severely psychopathic and abusive dealer for a long time. We watched people dying in front of us. We were also homeless for a long time and dealing with the gangs and being robbed and stabbings and stuff was obviously difficult. But it never truly phased me. Maybe because all I was thinking about was dope, idk. My husband went into the hospital for a week and I was on the streets by myself. That was the worst part, shit got really bad when I was alone. There's a lot of things I don't talk about, and definitely will never tell my husband because I don't need him to feel guilty because he couldn't protect me or whatever while he was literally on his death bed. Anyway, we got clean like over 3 years ago. I don't know what the fuck happened to me because ever since we got clean, I've been going through phases of extreme paranoia. No, it's not like day 6 of a meth binge where I think the shadow people are stalking me. I'm scared of real life shit and it's becoming crippling. I feel like every person alive is out to get me. Unless I know them well. I'm convinced that most people are violent and sociopathic and sadistic. The paranoia I feel in public is overwhelming but here's the stupid part - 

I did something I never should have done. See, I've always had this irrational fear of war, bombs, jihadists, religious extremists of any sort, neo nazis, acts of terrorism. Sometimes I'd play into that fear by watching war movies or documentaries that give me pretty severe anxiety and typically lead to nightmares. I don't know why I do it. I just wanted to feel afraid, but it was never as bad as it is now. Anyway, a few months ago, my 15 year old brother in law asked me if I'd ever heard of ""run the gauntlet. "" I said no, and he showed me one of the videos from it. It was a video of a man being beheaded, I think by some cartel members. About halfway through, I vomited and I was really upset. I don't know why the fuck I did this, but after that, I started seeking out gore websites. I'd specifically look up videos of murder or violence in general. Not because I enjoyed it, but because it was making me sick with anxiety and for some reason, I've always done this shit to myself. It's why I used to watch war movies. I would literally watch these videos of people being murdered and I've sobbed, hyperventilated, thrown up, and then continued watching. I realize how fucked up this all sounds. Well, I've stepped away from the gore videos because it was all just too much. But now my paranoia is at an all time high. I'm scared. All day, every day. I was shoveling snow at work yesterday, and every single car that drove past, I'd run and hide behind my car because I'm scared they'll drive by and shoot me. Or see me and get out and try to hurt me. Every time I go to get in my car, I get sick with fear that someone is in the backseat waiting for me. I try to take my dogs for walks and when I walk past other people, I specifically move far away when we pass each other in case they try to stab me. I don't go to any ATM's anymore, I have to have my husband do it, because I'm scared someone will be waiting for me to pull my cash out so they can rob me. When I'm in stores or restaurants, I start to freak out because I assume someone in there is going to pull a gun and shoot the place up. I wasn't going to admit this, but I literally am considering getting a helmet to start wearing in case someone shoots at me, I want my head to be as protected as possible. Needless to say, my time in public is extremely limited. I hardly go anywhere unless it's work. Which has become torture because I'm alone for most of my shift. I pretty much stay home now because leaving my house is a fucking massive challenge. I feel defeated. I'm so fucking over-stimulated because of all the anxiety and paranoia. I wish I never discovered those videos. I feel like they literally traumatized me, which sounds ridiculous, like.. How could a video traumatize someone? But it's just what I'm feeling. When I pass by people, I start having images in my head of the videos but it's my face on the people being murdered. It's like it happened to me. I already struggle with flashbacks from my fentanyl days, and these videos are just like that. I imagine people doing things to me that have never happened to me, just like a flashback. I get stuck in my head. I panic. I don't know what to do. I fucked up big time watching those videos. I now know how truly easy it is for people to murder and hurt others. Not just easy, but it's so much more normal and common than I realized. I just don't know what to do, I need help because I'm telling you, I cannot go on living this way for much longer.",5,paranoia
"So for a number of years I've had really random itches that jump all over my body, never lasting more than a couple of minutes, never really causing a rash or anything. One minute I'll be insanely itchy on the ankle and then the next minute I'm itchy on some random spot on my back for a second. Then it jumps to my hand and my face and back to my leg again. I could never understand how to even approach this because it wasn't like eczema or anything, where someone gets itchy somewhere in particular and it comes with a rash or hives or anything. 

I also do have a bit of hayfever and sinus problems, and I do get hives from a number of insects and things, so I figured I was just a bit allergic to life.

Anyway recently it got really bad, to the point where anywhere I'd shaved days prior was suddenly freaking out itching, and I was literally crying from how itchy my legs and everything were. 

I decided to finally try cutting out things that might trigger it, so I went and got some soap-free bar soap and body wash made for sensitive skin. The stuff with no fragrances etc etc. I also stopped using any body lotions that have fragrance in them. I'm just using a boring sorbolene cream for sensitive skin on my body. 

And LO AND BEHOLD I haven't been this not-itchy in years?!?! It's been two months now and I am having the most relaxing time of my life in terms of calm skin.

I just wanted to share this in case it helps others. If you suffer with itchy skin, try the things - actually try cutting normal soaps and stuff out for a bit. 

I feel really stupid for not having tried this earlier but I think I'm just so used to nothing ever working for my medical issues that I just didn't even consider that the most basic thing might work. ""Learned helplessness"" as they call it. Also because it wasn't like a rash so I didn't realise it could be allergy based 🙃",0,negative_samples

"Hey all - sorry wall of text here

I have a bit of a varied past. Essentially started out as potential ocd, then an adjustment disorder and was followed by a psychiatrist for 8ish years. When he retired we had a discussion and he was going to put on my discharge file ‘anxiety induced psychosis’ because he thought the diagnosis of schizophrenia would be too much stress. Last summer I saw a consultation psychiatrist who suggested schizoaffective - or that I am having periods of dissociation???. I doubt the dissociation piece. Anyways I had been fairly well managed on risperidone and carbamazepine for a number of years (until I got unwell again last summer in relation to a significant amount of workplace stress). Risperidone was increased and fluoxetine was added at that point. 


Anyhow - this last year has been pretty off and on with a variety of symptoms (mostly in the weird thoughts department) and its sucked. Ive basically separated myself from my brain at this point - I’m me and my ‘brain’ is the one causing all the shit. I view us as two separate entities. My psychologist suggested that externalizing my symptoms to my ‘brain’ is a good way to view things.

1. But besides spending time worrying about stuff that likely isn’t normal - I spend alot of time thinking about the fact that my ‘brain’ is causing symptoms because it wants me to be unwell because it is seeking attention. I personally don’t want attention and am revolted at that idea. I really dont like to talk about any symptoms at all and do my best to hide things other than with a select couple people that i share the tip of the iceberg, but I worry that my ‘brain’ is just making symptoms up to get attention. Can anyone relate? Or is this just me.. 

2. I know my brain is off and Ill even give in and say I have had psychotic symptoms, but I have a hard time believing in a diagnosis for myself - how do people come to terms with this? My psychologist suggested getting a copy of my latest psychiatric report - but i really dont know if I want to read that. I mean I dont really know what to tell people (like healthcare providers) based on the variety of diagnoses anyways. I normally just revert to the anxiety induced psychosis - but thats not really a thing. A large part of me doesn’t want to accept the possibility of schizophrenia or schizoaffective because I have never fully lost it.. I get unwell - but not that unwell.
And part 2 of this one is - I know medications work for me at settling things down- but i also spend alot of time thinking that maybe I dont need the medications and in the long term they are doing harm.. what if I have been misdiagnosed/over medicated - how do people deal with these thoughts? Im consistent at taking them as I worry about the potential repercussions of not taking them… but I dont know, maybe I dont really need them.. 

3. How do you get things off your mind? My mind is going down alot of rabbit holes lately and I worry that if I talk about this at all Ill end up at hospital against my will. I feel somewhat ok talking to the psychologist about some of it - not my doctor. I wish I had people to explore some of these ideas with as a sounding board - but talking to friends about it likely isnt a good idea. Is the anonymity of the internet where people turn? I do have some worksheets that help me challenge some of these thoughts that my psychologist gave me - but they dont stop the wheels from turning on some of the bigger rabbit holes. Overall Im doing fine - but if I dont have a distraction going on my brain is going 5 million ways and its causing me anxiety. A - because the thoughts are distressing. B - Im worried that I am potentially starting to get unwell again.

Any insights would be appreciated. Sorry if this seems disorganized, but besides the likely weird rabbit holes these thoughts are all circulating like a whirlpool in my head. I miss the days of my quiet brain that just focused on normal everyday life. :/",6,schizophrenia

"ever since a couple months ago, I've felt that my anxiety has worsened. Back then, like a year ago or so, it had been bad on some days but overall I could force myself through them. However, recently I've felt that it's become unbearable. 

I constantly feel this tight grip on my heart and I feel like puking and I get trembly and blurry visions occasionally. I dreaded living as a whole. While there were those minute moments where I've forgotten about my fears and paranoia, I feel that every hour of every day I feel this terrible feeling in my chest. I can't exactly describe it but it's this uneasy feeling and it's just bad. so so bad. It makes me lose my appetite and I don't like how things have gotten for me.

I used to really enjoy doing my hobbies like learning the guitar and drawing but nowadays even doing those things is difficult because my mind's always in a state of worry and I can't stop it.

I try to calm myself by depriving myself of my senses which used to work wonders but I just can't stop it. Its the fact that it's everyday for the past few months I've felt like this makes it terrible.

I hate going to school. I hate seeing people. I hate leaving my room.

At first I thought I could ride this one through, that it'd end soon but no it hasnt.

It's to the point where I actually really can't talk with people and I'm alone in school. I feel that I've avoided my friends to hide away in toilet stalls because the sight of so many people has become so sickening that I tend to panic so much that I have to isolate myself. As bad as it seems, I feel like isolating myself somewhat helped me through some bad times.

I'm constantly in fear of people and all I want is to hide away and live life invisible. I don't know why I'm this way and I don't know how to stop it.

and now that I've got group projects where I need to partner up with people, it's a pain for me since I don't have anymore friends and everyone else does.

"I've been really struggling with this lately. Almost everyone around me is in a relationship and I can't help but wonder if me being on the spectrum is what prevents me from finding someone. I feel so lonely, but there's no one who likes me or who I like. My best friend recently got a boyfriend so figuring out the changes there is difficult. I want to love and be loved, but I fear that things that make me ""difficult"" like my anxiety and inability to read social cues and my sensory overloads and occasional meltdowns and everything else, I fear that no one will ever choose me because of those things. I also fear that if someone did choose me I'd make them miserable or be too much to handle or something... I've been rewatching Extraordinary Attorney Woo because I relate a lot to Woo and it gives me hope that I'll find a good relationship like that but at the same time I fear that it won't happen and a good relationship like that could only be fictional. It's all really getting to me and making my depression act up...",1,autism
"Hello everyone, I deal with dissociation. i can’t go to a therapist. Lately I have been feeling very out of body. I do stuff everyday but I feel like I’m not even doing them. I feel so numb. It’s pointless living like this. Even If I do something that makes me happy, I still feel so numb and I can’t feel anything like I used to before . I sometimes look at people enjoying their life and I ask myself, why can’t I be normal? I am just surviving. My memory has become so bad lately, sometimes I mess up my words because I feel so out of body and I am so inside my head.My dissociation is actually not THAT bad, I have heard some worse scenarios but I am just scared. I am just so pessimistic. I think about the future and I ask myself Do I even have a future? What if I go crazy?

Feel like I don’t know or understand myself 

Feel like I’m acting weird or odd or strange

Feel like my mind is fucked up and that I am permanently broken

Starts acting in an insane hypothetical anxiety that I will embarrass myself and ruin my life forever 

Don’t know what these feelings mean

Don’t know how to fix myself

Have had intrusive thoughts of me ending myself and the timelines it would cause

Feel horrible about how I currently act

"It’s important to always know that life is invaluable. Maybe it’s the only thing that really matters. I’ve never been suicidal, I don’t think I ever will be.
But holy hell, man…

It’s hard to stay positive. It’s hard to stay awake.
I manage to lose touch with every good friend I make: maybe I was too much of a downer and got clingy. Or, life just gets in the way, idk.
The people who do stay in my life are narcissistic or apathetic. They keep me around because I’m easy to be around.. that’s as deep as it gets.

My first relationship ended in me being cheated on. My second relationship was with a slob who tried to get pregnant by me without my consent.

I fell hard for a girl 10 months ago, and she fell for me. She was like a princess, I’d never been so smitten. But she lived too far away and we didn’t want to put each other through long-distance. So we cut all contact.

Society is cold and hostile. Nobody trusts each other. For good reason: so many people do everything they can to exploit the crap out of everything they can. So, when a trustworthy person comes along, they get treated like shit all the same. The chance to prove yourself rarely comes along.. and a lot of people just don’t care if you’re trustworthy, they’re too busy trying to exploit you.

Now I’m here, ranting on reddit, because deep down I crave social interaction, despite being introverted af.
But all my social circles have died off, all my friends don’t respond to my messages anymore, not because they hate me, they just forgot.

It’s really just not easy to enjoy life sometimes, it just isn’t. But life is precious all the same. I just wish I didn’t have to tell myself that so frequently :/",2,depression
"Have been on Xeljanz for nearly three weeks now and still not entirely in remission - doctors are convinced if it was going to work it should’ve ‘rescued’ me by now (2 weeks in total but last 6 days has been 3x 10mg a day, CRP still 16 although they want to attribute that to the IV steroids). Very negative doctors pushing for surgery. 

I have read about so many late responders and people who achieved responses after a few weeks but the doctors do not seem to be convinced by it. 

As a second question, has anybody failed to come off IV steroids the first time when transitioned to oral (especially after 7 days of IV), only to flare and to be put back on them then successfully transition after a second course of treatment? The doctors are sure I will flare again once taken off them today but I’m hoping I will be fine and avoid surgery. Would love to hear some success stories. Last time my CRP went back up to 62 from 26 but that also coincided with many stressors and external problems I had which I’m convinced helped contribute to the flare. The gastroenterologist at the hospital doesn’t seem convinced that bad interpersonal problems, lack of sleep, etc I experienced in those days could’ve contributed so much despite things like those having always made me sick the next day throughout my illness the last few years.

to me, it doesn't seem like a bad or ""taboo"" thing to be interested in, i just see it as educating myself. of course, i understand that the holocaust was awful, but i'm not agreeing with or condoning it. its just,,, genuinely interesting to me to see how one person could cause so much damage and change the mindset of literally thousands and thousands of people around the world. plus, it directly ties into another special interest of mine, which is history about war, mainly the two world wars and the french rev. i wish i knew how to convey that message to people so i could tell more people about what i know :(( idk i just wanted to rant about this subject because i dont!!!! understand!!! why people think it's wrong to have the holocaust as my special interest!!! and it makes me upset!!",1,autism

"Sorry for the long post
I try to summarize it as hard as it really is for me. 
I have always had a bad relationship with my parents, especially with my mother where since she tended to be very rude because I am the son she never wanted as I was already the 3 'and during pregnancy my father who was an alcoholic at the time beat her so this has already marked (as if I were at fault) being labeled as the unwanted child, the black sheep etc. ...
Being strong in character since I was 4-5 years old when I saw my mother's verbal abuse towards me I (wrongly eh) raised my hands to my mother. Of course how much physical strength could I have at that age? Almost nothing. And after several times that this happened my mother tried to kill me by grabbing me by the hair and making me hit my head on the sink several times. As luck would have it, my older brother saved me.
The abuse from my mother after this event never subsided. But I simply learned to ignore her and keep it all inside (at most telling my father if it was really bad).
The verbal abuse growing up became comparisons to my brother, how he was, better looking, better behaved, more independent etc.... Taking me to make me hate him when I had no envy towards him, on the contrary, I have only good memories.
All this has carried obviously to other consequences, between closing me, distrust in the persons etc... So much so that then I suffered bullying and so on. I have always been happy in my ""loneliness"" because after elementary school I discovered video games (obviously also targeted by my mother). My whole childhood was like this: always fighting with my mother, one day she is the best person in the world, the next day she criticizes anything I do.
After middle school it was always a grow up until I had dozens of friends in high school and up to two groups where I was always among the most loved by the group.
In 5 'high finally I get engaged but after a fight with my girlfriend I get my first panic attack that affects everything I love, questioning everything (and if she does not love you, and if you are actually in the various groups of friends to be teased and if you have always hated even video games etc. ...)
After this event the end. After being the one who listened to his friends for years, he asks for advice for the first time and by doing so everyone looks at me wrong as if I were crazy. The question was just a confirmation of what I was thinking to push away the anxieties (i.e. asked them if it was just stuff in my head or something else). I get looked at sideways and almost made fun of by everyone and no one knows what to tell me. Some people almost forcibly tell me it's like I say, my girlfriend gets mad at me for doubting myself and takes it personally like I don't really love her.
I don't trust my friends anymore and I'm gradually closing my bridges with everyone, even those who used to agree with me (because I wasn't convinced by their answers).
After two years I ask my mother for help now exhausted and my mother every time I bring up something from the past, even if something stupid says that either it's different or it didn't happen at all. For example a few days ago I scold her saying that she is a superficial person who every time she can says if a certain person is fat or has gained weight. And after pointing it out to her she says ""but if you do it all the time too"", I tell her I never did it and she looks at me all weird asking me and: ""and how many times have you done it, few, many, medium"" as if to humor me because she is afraid of her crazy son. 


I have only talked about it with her, my father and my aunt, and a couple of my close friends. One of my friends gave me all his support one day by believing me and reassuring me and the next day he acted almost as if we had never talked about it. My mother acts this way.
A friend of mine also understood me completely but I'm afraid the same thing will happen as with my old friend.
The only ones who continue to always behave are my father and my aunt. 
I don't know what to believe anymore, what if these three people who agree with me are just in my head? 
I really want to understand if it's my mom manipulating me so much and it's my anxiety that overeacts or something else
Until a while ago I was more confident but then one day arguing with my mother she said I always had very few friends. It really makes me doubt everything....",5,paranoia

People who were hired later than me are now more competent and independent, while I still struggle and need assistance. I just don't feel like any of the training sticks.

It was never a problem in school. The few times I encountered this kind of mental block I was able to just take the GPA hit and patch it up with the next subject. I never did learn how to study the things that didn't immediately click though.

 I was supposed to be ""gifted"", I was supposed to have potential. My diagnosing psych. actually told me with a straight face that I have a high IQ and my ADHD ""brings me down to typical levels in affected areas"". All of it sounds like a lie now.

"Today I 26M (diagnosed 9 month with Inattentive ADD) just realize that i will never be understood by my family. Any thoughts of us being a better family is gone, of us having a better relationship is over. I am done, I give up. Today my sister 29F was talking on the phone to her boyfriend and said on you have adhd right, because my brother self diagnosed himself and thinks he has adhd and he act worse than you. My sister is a therapist who see adhd patients as well from what she tells me. I'm not sure how can she be a therapist or help people with adhd with their problems if she don't understand anything about me or can't see that I have it. She tells her boyfriend that I am self Dianoged which is stupid because I been Diagnosed by a psychiatrist and I take meds for it that I have to meet with a psychiatrist monthly to get that renewed. She knows that but I don't think she is an understanding person which don't make sense because she does have patients that like her and want her as a therapist. 

Also my parents are a lost cause. Every single day I don't do aethign right or fast enough and it's always the same, your a idiot, you cant do anything right, I waste my time making you, talking to you is like talking to a wall. Why are you like this, why can't you hold a job? Why can't you just try harder? Why can't you be better?  It's nothing but constant negatively at me for most of my life and I try to make them understand, I try to send them videos about adhd, try to explain it to them, and they can't or don't want to understand me and what I have, which sucks because if they take the time to do some research like 3 hours they will understand me better and maybe can help save them and me stress, but it isn't like that, it's just constant stress for me and for them, they are so frustrated with me and honeslty think they hate me and just want me to die. My sister calls me useless and other insults as well. My parents just think I'm stupid  but don't understand anything about my Condition, all they know is that it'd for hyperactive people. Well I give up, no way they will understand or ever understand. Sycks that I can't have a better relationship with my family.

 I guess I am just the black sheep. The no good very bad son of the family that is a disgrace and that how it is most of my life. Like I have such low self esteem and alot of stress because of the constant negativity of my family at me for not doing what they want when they want. It's all could be fixed if they could take the time and effort to learn amd understand me and adhd and seems like that won't or don't want to so it's over and I just give up. I'm stuck kn this house and just trying to think of how I'm gonna be on my own amd get my own place but I have no job and no money right now, I am broke and I just got out of school so I will try my hardest to get a remote job in another state or town or something. 

 These negatively to me is doing more harm than good. Adhd is having a harder time getting these negative insults, and the fact that I am messing up and constantly get blamed for not being good enough is just too toxic for me now, I can't be a better person with all this negativity at me, it so overwhelming and exhausting to just try to be the best I can be and just fail and get insulted, and this is a constant thing that happens daily in my life, I don't yell back or argue because that's not me, but I can't take this verbal abuse no more. I need to get out of here. Is anyone else in the same situation I am in? Are you the no good very bad son/daughter of your family that is a disgrace? I hope you all are doing well and I wish whatever struggles and problems you got that you overcome them. I hope your family is more understand than mine.",3,adhd

I'm looking for information on a film by Haneke but I just can't find it, so I'm asking for help from those of you who may know something about it: the film is Caché (Hidden, 2005), and the information is this: without revealing nothing too much (for he hadn't seen it) in the film at one point an animal is killed, but I would like to know if it was really killed or is it a special effect of some kind.

The reason is that I love the film and would like to show it to my daughter and wife, but both are very sensitive to animal abuse.

Actually I am too: I can't stand the representation of any kind of violence against animals anymore: even the famous sequence of the ox and the tribe in the jungle in Apocalypse Now today I struggle to see it again (despite having seen the film dozens of times over the course of my life: evidently as I got older I became like this).

So: if anyone knows how that scene in Haneke's Caché (Hidden) was shot, and whether or not that animal was actually killed, please let me know.

Thank you!!!!

"Hey everyone,

I'm feeling quite lost and anxious right now, and I'm hoping to get some guidance from you all. Recently, I've been hit with panic attacks for the first time in my life, and it's been a real shock to me. I've always been a calm person, so this is completely new territory for me. During the first attack, I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack and ended up calling 911. They helped calm me down, but I'm still shaken.

The panic attacks seemingly comes out of nothing, during the first one I was alone in my bed and during the last one I was enjoying myself at a barbecue with friends. 

I want to regain control of my mental health and minimize the impact of these panic attacks as much as possible. Can you help me with a few questions?

What are some initial steps I can take to manage and reduce the frequency of panic attacks?
If you've been through something similar, what self-help techniques or coping strategies have worked for you personally?
Should I seek professional help? If so, what type of healthcare provider should I reach out to?

I've been contemplating running away from home and starting off somewhere fresh recently as I still live with my parents and they are no doubt the main cause of my issue

ive been born into a life where my parents are in severe debt because of an accident before i was born and i work 2 jobs per day, just to help them pay off their debt and it'll be fully paid off in about 6 years from now if i keep going, but frankly im not sure if I'll survive for a single more year. it's not nice to work your ass off after a long day of college, work 2 jobs and still not be able to buy the things you want to buy, because all my money goes to my parents debt, and frankly I dont want to throw my life away for this.

I know it's not right to abandon my parents as they aren't able to work anymore and their massive debt, but ive spoken to a few people and the general gist i got was 'you need to think about your own life', so i thought on it and I've done nothing to deserve this life that im living, and I'm genuinely baffled on what i should do in this situation. the family i live with is extremely toxic and i dont like it here but i also feel a strong sense of responsibility as the older sibling, and i know my younger sister wont be able to deal with it if i disappeared one day.",2,depression
"From the outside my life is perfect. I'm well educated, have an interesting job in a field I'm passionate about, my own place, hobbies, a caring girlfriend and fantastic friends. I seem to excel at almost everything I do. I've largely got it all figured out. I am very fortunate. 

Yet, under the surface, I feel nothing. My life is joyless. At least half of the days over the last decade I've thought about how nice it would be to just be dead; to not have to deal with life anymore. I've always thought the saying ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" is stupid. To me suicide is a permanent solution to every problem I'll ever have. I've spent countless hours planning on how I would do it and how I can minimise the pain on others. I am honestly surprised I'm still here.

I'm currently at a crossroads. My depression is getting worse and it's becoming visible. I am already starting to lose people because of it. But, I feel like I can't talk to anyone close to me. I worry as soon as people know just how fucked I am I'll be treated differently and things will never be the same. It's also just not in me to ask. I am not the person who needs help from others. I've made token attempts before, seen doctors and underplayed my symptoms to avoid being sectioned. I've been prescribed antidepressants and seen therapists but all to no avail. What's to say if I ask for help this time will be any different.

As stupid as it feels to write this, knowing the advice I would give to others I feel this is a journey I must continue to take alone. I also wonder if it's even worth being fixed. I am incredibly fortunate to be in the position I am and yet and still this miserable. What does that really say about me.",2,depression
"Hi,

First time poster on here and on Reddit. Also on mobile :/.

I started meds a week ago on the starting dose and today is my first day on a higher dose and it feels great but also so bittersweet.

I feel so much more capable, my anxiety and depression symptoms are massively reduced and I feel like a different person but in a good way. That thick water of brain fog is mostly gone and it feels so calm.

On the other hand though, I feel sadness for my younger self. I'm not that old (25) but it feels like if I was diagnosed when I was much younger, it would have been easier, not just for the general ADHD symptoms we experience but also for my self esteem. I spent much of my teenage years thinking I was just lazy. Always doing homework and such at the last minute unless we were in class and could do it then.

I feel sad for my younger self. I was the person that everyone thought was super happy and not stressed about very much but underneath that I was deeply scared and stressed about everything. I wish my younger self could feel how I feel today.

I'm glad that I have got here though. It took a couple years to realise and another 1 year to get diagnosed and start treatment but in the end it was worth it. The only other sad part is I'm very confident at least one of my siblings has ADHD and my mum. They are very supportive with me but I don't know if I should talk to them about my concerns. It feels like if they do have ADHD and experience even a small amount of the relief this process has given me, it would help them so much.

Sorry for the long text and hopefully I got my first post right 😅",3,adhd

You’re a flower as well, not better nor worse, but still you start to feel like weed, and that’s how the other flowers are starting to treat you as well, every mistake you make, every good intention you have, will be regarded as either a diabolical goal, self-pity or non-significant. 

They perceive you as a burden in the garden who only wants attention and chaos, they even make fun of you or judge you,while not even getting to know you, but all you really want is just acceptance and love. You keep wondering what’s wrong with you and your actions. You keep punishing yourself, feel guilty and ungrateful because the soil you’re in is proper, you get enough water, sunshine while you’re well aware that there’re flowers without any of these, but you just keep asking yourself: “Why can’t I be and live like the other flowers?” 

Self-hatred takes a toll on you, until you eventually withers, but just before that, you realise that’s the best thing that could ever happen to you, you never had a chance, you were taking away resources from the other flowers while you were just suffering and in constant pain, and as the saying goes: “It’s better to burn out than fade away”.

"So this is a bit of an abstract thing that became evident to me when playing some games with friends, but applies in many areas of life including work and relations.. I noticed that when there is a solution to a problem, or a certain way to do things, many people will stick to that solution and do it repeatedly until that no longer works, while for myself, as soon as such solution is found I immediately tend to act like ""ok I know this method works, now is there a way to do it faster, or with less effort?"" And often times I find myself stuck in endless experimenting of suboptimal approaches looking for that one that might be 1% better. Some people look at me in that process and say ""you're making such silly mistake because you can just do X and it works"" and I'm aware of that, but also can't help the constant urge to look for different ways to do it (a process that of course involves many silly mistakes)

"I've been fighting with myself over the last year about my decisions and life choices...and it feel likes it's a never ending game.

I've had it repairs multiple times but I have anxiety attacks every time my car pops a check engine light. Every time it pops up is due to choices I made trying to fix it/ improper repairs.

"Hi everyone. I’m not sure if I’m the right group or not, but I figure this is a good place to start. I am seeing my new-ish GI doctor on Thursday and I don’t know where to start. I’ll try to give a brief rundown:

38yo female, history of constipation

March 2022, I had my gallbladder removed after having an attack with classic symptoms including nausea, vomiting, RUQ pain. This included a CT scan with contrast in which they noted that there were no dilated or thickened bowel loops noted.

June 2022: started getting pains again in the area where my gallbladder had been. It ran from the site of the missing gallbladder straight down to about 4 inches directly to the right of my bellybutton. Returned to surgeon complaining about the pain. They did abdominal ultrasound and only findings were fatty liver (non-alcoholic) and a small liver cyst and slight widening of the common bile duct. In September 2022 I had an upper endoscopy done (I also have a history of reflux) with no remarkable findings.

The abdominal pain continues off and on. Sometimes it lasts for weeks, then will go away for weeks.

November 2022: I move to a new state. Have to get established with new doctors everywhere. The move was very stressful. Can’t see the new GI doctor until March 2023.

February 2023, I have abdominal pain so bad that I go to the ER. They perform a CT scan without contrast. They suspect that I have kidney stones (I don’t). The report says “colonic diverticulosis with evidence of acute colitis.” That is the only abnormal findings other than a repeat of non-alcoholic fatty liver and the small liver cyst. Nobody at ER even mentions the diverticulosis or acute colitis and they send me on my way with an steroid shot only.

March 2023, I see the new GI doctor and I’m still having the localized pain, only now it is almost entirely in the right middle quadrant, about 4 inches right of my belly button. He thinks I might have SIBO and thinks my abdominal pain is stress related. I do the SIBO test at home and it’s negative. GI doc says take miralax daily and come back in June- he doesn’t even acknowledge the results from the recent CT scan.

May 2023, I’m still having the localized pain and it’s still in one spot only. I’ve been taking miralax (half cap) daily because a full dose gives me diarrhea. The half capful gives me roughly 3-5 BMs daily and they are all sort of loose BMs. I’ve also seen blood in my BM now, so I called the GI doctor and they are finally having me come in sooner- next week.

So my questions are: what questions should I ask the doctor? I really am confused if my most recent CT scan is something to be concerned about. And why didn’t the diverticulosis show on my CT scan back in March 2022? I’ve also been googling and of course everything says colorectal cancer, so I’ve also stressed myself thinking what if I’ve developed CRC and that’s actually what it is instead of diverticulosis and the colitis? That could also explain the blood. But the only things I can think of for localized pain are IBD, IBS or CRC. So that’s why I’m here, to ask all of you how I can get a diagnosis for the stomach pain and blood in BM.

Anyway, any feedback would be appreciated. I am pretty certain that I need a colonoscopy to get some real answers but I am worried I’ll be brushed off due to my age.",0,negative_samples

" In my life there are often great expectations of me and my fellow human beings (friends, family, strangers) and also great hopes and a deep longing for a different, better life, which logically have been and are repeatedly disappointed. 

Whenever I was a little satisfied with something, I felt at the same time this irrepressible and deep-seated disappointment and dissatisfaction. When I've been out with loved ones, I've longed for other ""better"" or ""cooler"" people, or complete solitude. And the other way around.

As if my inner self has been playing images of my ""dream life"" to me for so long that I would pick myself up and give it my all to achieve it. Like some kind of intrinsic motivation, but through a constantly yelling and driving drill instructor.

In that respect, couldn't we assume that expectations just naturally diminish and become less through repeated disappointments over the course of a lifetime?

I rather have the impression that my hopes for better people, better places, better times have developed in parallel with the disappointments, and that I have therefore developed higher and higher expectations for everything.

I had a very traumatic upbringing but have found happiness as a young adult, especially in my career. Ever since starting anti-depressants, I have also found it easier to socialise and keep hobbies. I have good relationships, and don't struggle to get out of bed in the morning anymore / be productive. But at the root of it all I just feel exhausted. Even with the small moments of joy life offers, the pain that comes with being alive – loss, suffering, fear – almost seem like they outweigh the good.

"I don’t know if this is a “me” issue, but I feel like my ADHD symptoms make me a wasteful person. Food waste is the first one that comes to mind. Things spoil mostly because I forget to eat them (hello, morning coffee) or that I bought them (sorry yogurt from three months ago). I try my hardest to avoid this. My dad had a rough childhood and we are very sensitive to throwing out food. But most often than not, it still happens. 

Another big waste is my hobbies. I have too many of them and often don’t feel interest in it for more than a couple months. Paint dried up beyond repair, candle making chemicals go bad, coloring pens are ruined because I swear I closed the cap (I didn’t). 

Money is also wasted. Subscriptions I forget to cancel. One year deals I get because I promise, this time I’ll actually do duolingo everyday! Or stuff I purchase without reading the full description and end up regretting it. By the way, thank you Adobe for the outrageous cancellation fee.  

My carbon foot print must be huge, between all the waste and the amount of times I had to go by car because I forgot to leave early enough to walk. I’m trying to do better but most times I’m wasteful, I only notice it when it’s too late.",3,adhd

"So my mom was rushed to the hospital on the 12th after not showing up for work. Her coworkers called in a welfare check and she was found unconscious in her house. Hours later, I’m bursting into the ER, seeing my mother sprawled on a table, her t-shirt cut off of her, dried blood all over her face, and a tube down her throat, unconscious in total kidney failure and on life support. 

She was in the ER, then the ICU, then the regular hospital for a total of nine days. It’s just me and her, so I was in the hospital, praying my mom would wake up and be ok. Alone. I spent every moment I could in the hospital, for nine days, sleeping at her house, not in my safe haven, not in my bed, without all the little things I use to get through a damn day without having a breakdown. Panicking wondering what the hell I’m going to do if the worst happens and it all falls on me to deal with. I live only 10 miles away, but don’t have a car because I am terrified of driving because I get overwhelmed easily and can’t afford one anyway. I mostly ride the bus. It takes almost 2 hours by bus to get from my end of town to hers, so in order to get things done, I was forced to start driving her car. I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve driven since getting my drivers license 15 years ago. I’ve already made tons of mistakes and probably gotten at least one ticket for slowly running a red light at a camera. 

My credit card is almost maxed out and I’m down to $100 in my bank account because I bought something I’d been saving up for earlier in the month and then I had to keep buying stuff like gas and food and pay one of her bills while my mom was in the hospital because I had no other money and I didn’t want her to get in trouble. 

I live in a not-so-good neighborhood, so I drive on the highway every two days to get to my house to make sure someone hasn’t broken in. It’s terrifying because I’ve never driven that particular car before and it’s huge. I had to move my two animals as well as all of my valuables to my moms house so I could take care of them easier and keep my stuff from being stolen. I had to do it all myself because people were too busy to help. 

After nine days, my mom finally came home, but was ultimately diagnosed with cancer. So now instead of being in the hospital, I’m preparing to take over both of our lives for at least six weeks  while she starts chemotherapy and radiation in couple of days. She has a kidney stent and can’t drive herself, so I’m driving around town (terrifying) running errands (how do I do this stuff?!) talking on the phone with her doctors (I’d literally rather die than talk on the phone), talking to a million people per day (I’d also rather die) cooking us food, getting her to her appointments, urging her to drink and rest, changing her bandages, helping her shower, making her as comfortable as I can, taking care of three animals (hers and mine), maintaining two homes and bills and everything else. 

If that wasn’t bad enough, my apartment is changing landlords and I get a housing voucher and on SSI, so I’ve been on the phone constantly, trying to get all the info and get everything situated with the new landlords and my caseworker before I have to pay rent on the 1st so I don’t get in trouble and ruin my credit or rental history. 

I had to see my psychiatrist to get a refill on my psych meds, which I can’t be without, (especially right now) and couldn’t reschedule the appointment. So I’m sitting in waiting rooms, missing my mom’s important meetings because I have to have Teledoc appointments. 

I also ran out of my HRT injections, which I  have to have an appointment and blood test to be able to renew and was actually in an appointment when I learned my mom was in the ER. So I had to leave, but they wouldn’t renew my prescription without the meeting, so I missed an injection, which didn’t help emotionally, especially right now. (I have this appointment literally once a year and of course it has to be at the worst possible time.) Then I had to drive and do it all over again, leaving my mom alone while still recovering from her hospital stay. 

My life went from calm to complete and utter chaos in one fell blow. I feel like I can’t concentrate and making too many mistakes that cost us time and money. I feel like I’m not doing a good job. If I wasn’t autistic, I feel like I’d be doing a better job. I’m almost 35. I should be able to handle this shit. I feel stupid and useless. My mom is really calm and telling me I’m doing a great job, and people keep telling me I’m a great son for being here for her and taking care of it all, but I don’t feel like that. 

I’m so overwhelmed and just want to go back to the nice, low-stress life I built for myself.",1,autism
"I want to start by saying a few things. I genuinely don't understand my mom or what could possibly be going on in her brain to make her think and act this way. Also, please don't comment anything like ""why don't you talk to her about how that makes you feel?"" I can't. she doesn't ever listen to me and brushes off my feelings all the time. Either that or she'll somehow turn the blame on me and make herself the victim of the situation, claiming that I don't understand her struggles, or that I'm just trying to accuse her of false things to make her look or feel bad, or go on about how she could never make me feel that way because she ""loves me"".

so, back to the original point of this post. 
i have diognised ADHD and suspected/undiagnosed high-masking autism. 
damn near every single time I try to bring up something that I struggle with or cannot do (because I'm neurodivergent), she always says something like ""you just forgot how to"" or ""you need to teach yourself how to do that"" or even ""just ignore it"" ""just stop.""
one of the main things is that I have time blindness. she just keeps telling me to learn better. and then she guilt trips me and lectures me about how if I don't learn to manage my time better, I'll never get anywhere in life, that I'll constantly be losing jobs and be excluded from social groups because I'm always late. great. thanks for that, mom. 
I cannot control my time blindness. time feels very different for me than what most others feel (I think). 5 minutes can feel like 1. 2 hours can feel like 30 minutes. I cannot estimate time or how long something will take me. that is not something that my brain do, I cannot fix that.
I also struggle to complete and turn in homework on time. she just tells me to stop doing that and try harder. that I need to ""stop making excuses"" and ""stop using your ADHD as an excuse, it's not"". she's right, it's not an excuse, it's a reason.
another time I recall is when we were out somewhere, it was outside, and there were powerlines over the place. my biggest sensory issue is auditory, mainly loud and/or high-pitched sounds. The powerlines were buzzing, they were so loud and bothered me so much. I could hear them no matter where I went. I was starting to become closed off, visibly upset, angry and irritable. my mom told me to stop just ignore the buzzing and just ""pretend"" to have a good time and stop wrecking the mood for everyone else. she even got mad at me when I tried putting in my headphones and listening to music to calm myself down. 
another time, when i was having a meltdown over a ""prank"" that she pulled on me. she refused to apologize, turned my lights on, made me take my blankets off my head and take my headphones out. she got really angry and told me to ""get over it"" and ""stop living in the moment"" or ""stop feeling bad for myself"". 
this has happened a few other times recently. she said the same thing to me both times. one was me telling her how I cannot recognize my body's signals (such as hunger). the other time was when I told her that I struggle with volume regulation and often talk too quietly without realizing it at all. she told me that I just ""need to learn that skill"". I just wish she would understand that I can't. my brain doesn't work that way.

another thing, I feel like she tries to ""relate"" to me but it just comes off as ableist to me. there's been several instances where she has said to me ""I get distracted sometimes, I think I might have ADHD too."" 
I'm like 90% sure she doesnt, but my dad does (diognosed), so I know that's where mine came from. 

I'm just fed up with this.",1,autism

"Yesterday, I finished reading *The Pre-Raphaelite Language of Flowers* by Debra N. Mancoff, and I could not recommend it more. At only around 80 pages, and with half of those pages being paintings, it is a very quick read, but extremely rich in content. I've always been fascinated with symbolism in figurative art, and this book focuses on the meanings of flowers in the artwork of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, one of my favorite artistic associations ever.

One of the principles of the Brotherhood was to study nature so that it might be effectively represented in their artwork. The importance of nature is emphasized in paintings like 'Spring' by Millais and 'The Soul of the Rose' by Waterhouse. Throughout the book, Mancoff introduces readers to the Victorian and medieval symbolism associated with various flowers, from the heliotrope and sunflower to the rose and daisy. This use of flowers, combined with the characters, results in every piece of art effectively presenting a narrative. Even if the viewer is unaware of the exact narrative behind the painting, the sense of symbolism is obvious, and one can be assured that this is art that *means something.*

Another principle of the Brotherhood was the belief that art should have a level of spiritual integrity and heartfeltness. Mancoff's commentary in this book does a great job of introducing the reader to what these artworks meant to their creators and commissioners. Whether it is the sorrow of 'Broken Vows' by Calderon, the maternal patriotism of 'Queen Victoria With Prince Arthur' by Winterhalter, the aestheticism of 'Sunflowers and Hollyhocks' by Hayllor, or the real-life romances and scandals behind 'Ellen Terry' by Watts or the Portraits of Georgiana Burne-Jones and Mary Zambaco, by Edward Burne-Jones, this is more than just a showcase of pretty pictures, but a glimpse into the lives of some of the Victorian era's greatest artists.",0,negative_samples
"I will continue to sing their praises for so many reasons. 

1.  You can't beat the price.  I just placed an order for 11 books and only paid 80 dollars.  (And it was only that cost because I did pick up a book for 20 bucks). 

2. Although selection is generally slim you can almost always find books that your local store doesn't have (Ulysses and The plague are two that I can't find anywhere in my region). 

I personally use thriftbooks and is the reason why reading has become a hobby of mine.  I know that most other countries have their variation of this and like the idea of reading becoming more accessible to a wider audience (because not everyone can pay between 15-30 dollars a book).",0,negative_samples

"Recently I've found myself to be increasingly paranoid about the possibility of being cyberstalked, having my personal info leaked, and having my reputation ruined by things that happened online. Like a lot of people, I did some pretty dumb shit on the internet as a teenager, and lied a lot about myself. I used a different moniker online for the most part, but was dumb enough to tell about a dozen people my real last name. It's not one-of-a-kind, but it's fairly uncommon in the US (about 2,500 people) Yes, I looked it up, because that's how much I worry about this. About 3 people out of them know my legal name, with my real first name. 

Now I'm filled with the fear that these people will try to look me up years in the future, harass me, post malicious content online that could be looked up by my employers, try to contact my family members, etc. I considered them friends, and I don't think they harbor any ill will toward me. One of them definitely didn't like me, but they were extremely non-confrontational and avoided any difficult conversations, so I don't think they would try to do anything.

"I'm in despair. My entire life is a mess due to ADHD and excessive daytime sleepiness. I've tried Vyvanse, which has helped with both issues, particularly the hypersomnia. However, I've experienced hair loss, including eyelashes and eyebrows, while on the medication. This side effect has led me to research amphetamines, where I've found many people complaining about hair loss as well. I also tried Modafinil, but I found it to be less effective. However, I'm concerned about the possibility of hair loss with Modafinil, as I've come across several posts on Reddit mentioning it as a side effect.

As a woman, I cannot afford to lose my hair. At the same time, I feel I have no choice but to take the medication that will eventually make me bald as I've wasted so many years of my life due to my conditions. The decision between prioritising my physical appearance and having my hair, even if it means having a chaotic life, or taking medication to get my life in order, but accepting the possibility of becoming bald and feeling less attractive, is throwing me into overwhelming despair. I know I sound dramatic but this dilemma is causing me to question the purpose of continuing on. I feel like wasted potential. I'm tired of life and I'm hopeless.

I see similar questions in this subreddit frequently, but in my case I'm wondering about the fine print of the rights given by easyJet on flight cancellations.

"I have been feeling increasingly depressed for the past year and a half or so. I would say it got much worse after I was involved in an accident that was my fault around that time. No one was seriously hurt but I can’t seem to get myself to let it go. I think it like fundamentally changed how I view myself, and I think deep down I have some unpacking to do re: understanding that I can make mistakes and still be worthy of love and compassion.

I am trying my best to do the things that make me feel better. I make myself exercise for at least 40 minutes almost every day. I make myself go to bed early enough to get 7-8 hours of sleep. I take care of myself and try to eat healthy. I keep my space tidy and clean.

But like, doing that is all I can do. And it takes so much effort. I can barely get into my hobbies these days. I used to draw and paint weekly and now it’s like, maybe once every few months. I just end up feeling paralyzed and blank on what to draw. 

My job is very demanding and high-stress, for not much pay. I want to find a more fulfilling job, but I’m stuck in this like paralysis of feeling that every job will feel like this no matter what I do. And my skill set is so specialized, I feel like I don’t even know what else I could do. Every “entry-level” job I see wants 3-5 years experience. 

I live at least a half hour from most of my friends, so I’ve started feeling more and more socially isolated and lonely. They’re a more spontaneous crowd and tend to just meet up since they live so close, so I don’t get invited to things. I live with my boyfriend but he works odd hours and is tired and not always as romantic/affectionate as he used to be. He is also going through a tough time and doesn’t have the energy to do the extra stuff anymore. What sucks is just not feeling wanted. 

Every day I feel like I’m slowly drowning. My job feels like a dead end, my relationship is losing its spark, I don’t see many friends anymore, I don’t enjoy my hobbies anymore. My self-esteem is on life support. Every day I just wonder if this is it and I feel so empty and sad.

Not that I don’t want to “be happy”, but I genuinely do not believe that is possible, anymore. My life has gone too far wrong. I’ve made too many life-destroying mistakes. I genuinely don’t have anything left to give.

So yeah, I don’t want to “get better”, if all “better” means is being a lonely weirdo with no real friends, a decade behind most people my age, with fuck-all, just playing constant catch-up for the next decade, while my body deteriorates.

I would rather simply *not be here*. And that’s not new, or “impulsive”, or something I haven’t considered extensively.

I genuinely don’t expect to still be around, in a month’s time, and I’m more than happy with that. Frankly, it’s all I have left. All I want is for it to be done.",2,depression
"Sometimes I get random attacks of uncontrollable worry and fear, often unprovoked and without reason. I be shaking and panting out of sheer paranoia that something bad is happening or is going to happen.

"I've been with my partner for 11 years now.  Recently, he's been having longer and more severe bouts of paranoia. 

He's always been suspicious but a bad experience with drugs made himbgo through bouts of paranoia. 

But they've been getting worse. He starts being distant for no reason, stops talking to me, only to tell me a few hours later he's going through paranoia. 

It's starting to wear on me. 

For those in committed relationships, any tips on handling the situation? Anything might help. I'm literally lost. I just don't get it. And I don't think I'll be able to....",5,paranoia
"I've been paranoid about everyone close to me for a while now, even my neighbours I've never met and random people that just walk by the house. I feel like they're all just keeping me around to fuck with me and make my life a living hell, without me even knowing. Like they're constantly posting on a social media account that I can't access that has all.of the stupid shit I do on there. Like they're constantly watching me and laughing at everything I do. I can't talk to anyone about it because they're just going to lie to me to keep the facade going. I don't trust anyone, and anytime I try to open up to somone I get a really awkward and ""you're fucking crazy"" reaction. Which adds to the feeling of paranoia. I even feel like my girlfriend is cheating on me, eventhough that's not possible during this pandemic because she looks after someone vulnerable. I don't want to bring it up with her again either because the reaction I got before was a really in the middle reaction. What drove me to write this post is a feeling of dread caused by a dream I've just had. My girlfriend broke into my house while I was sleeping, and when I opened the door of my bedroom she tried to attack me, but I eventually got her sat down and I took about 5 weapons off her. I read that participating in the detention of a criminal can either mean somone close to you is laying a trap for you, or someone close to you is plotting evil against you. So my trust for everyone close to me has just disappeared. Even if they try to tell me how much I'm valued my brain can't accept that and just thinks they're lying. 

TLDR: I had a dream that makes me question my trust for absolutely everybody around me, especially my girlfriend. Now I'm paranoid that I'm walking into a trap of some kind.",5,paranoia
"It's been with me for so many years now. I can't shake it off. Even though I'm with a girl that I love and it can sometimes be difficult to make work because it's a long distance relationship, I feel so alone and that nobody has my back or cares for me. Not that you should expect a relationship to magically cure your depression because believe me, it doesn't. I don't know what the answer is and I wish I did.

The older I get (I'm 31), the worse it becomes. It baffles me that some others make it to such high ages in life. I find so much of existing mentally tiring and a struggle. Trying to find some joy here and there and sometimes I do, but it isn't enough. I just always feel like I'm not good enough for some reason.

I miss being younger before any of this was brought on. I completely changed around my mid twenties. I can't go back to who I was. Feel so hollow and barely have the motivation to do anything.",2,depression
"I've got bdd and probably some form of ptsd. Ive been offered voxra (wellbutrin) (for possible add). Ive never tried it. Or i could start sertraline (zoloft) ive been taking it on and off over last 10 years.

discomfort caused by it. 

Sertraline has been Ok, but it flattens feelings and i hate that i have to commit to for so long. 

Voxra sounds like it may make me anxious.

I gained a lot of weight since the beginning of this disease that doesn't have a cure, and now I'm just fat and sad and don't look like I did before. I just saw myself in a video and I look horrendous. I try and try to diet, to do exercise but nothing works. I'm 24, didn't even get to celebrate my birthday, but I always have to give money to buy other's gifts. I am fed up.

"I have been diagnosed at the beginning of 2022. I was 21 and when I got meds for the first time I was 22.

Now I am incredibly lucky because I got to my diagnosis within 6 months but my ADHD treatment feels so nonexistent.

I take elvanse 50mg and the psychiatrist that diagnosed me also treats me. It was and still is the only clinic I can go to because most don't accept new patients even if they already have a diagnosis. Or most just don't treat adults. The place that I go to has several psychiatrists working there.

When I had my first appointment they told me things like ""you most likely don't have adhd"" , ""woman usually don't have adhd"" and ""most people grow out of adhd so don't worry too much about it, it will most likely be gone until you are 25""

My assessment was with a different person and she actually listened and told me that she has no doubt I have adhd and that the other psychiatrists will make a treatment plan with me.

Well on the day that I should have made a treatment plan with the psychiatrist he just basically talked about ""only meds can fix it"" and that stimulant medication is the only thing that works. Which is horribly inaccurate. He also told me (and my mother who wanted to come along) that therapy is no option and it will not help at all. I didn't even know coaching was a thing and I left really discouraged but I had my hopes up bc I finally had a diagnosis and got meds prescribed that could possibly help me really much.

Despite me being happy about it I still feel like there is a lot of tings wrong with how my treatment goes (I am now with another psychiatrist and she at leas is open for everything but its not that she suggests things. Its rather me suggesting things and she then talks about it with me and maybe she will go though with it like changing my medication after I had horrible side effects from the first medication.

Also other things like depression or anxiety and other things are not really taken into consideration. 

And one of the worst things for me personally is that I only got help because I was at a breaking point. Everything was overwhelming and I had constant brain fog. It got to a point where I slept just an hour or less a day and that continued until I was so physically and mentally drained that I slept 15+ hours on weekends because I could not get myself out of bed.

This issue has unfortunately not been fixed yet.
I sleep much better but still 3-4 hours of sleep per day is just not enough and honestly I don't know what to do about that.",3,adhd

"Hello,  
  
I was first diagnosed with ADHD in March this year. Ever since, whenever I share this with someone I care, they'll start by asking why I think I have it, and not long after I start explaining, they'll say ""that happens to me as well"". It is really frustrating and sad.

Impostor syndrome then hits me and makes me think ""maybe you don't have it, the symptoms can be easily misinterpreted, there's a lot of people on the internet claiming they have it just because they can't pay attention to things they don't like"".

I'm lead to think similar stories have happened to not few of you, and would like to hear them.

"Her response was “well ADHD doesn’t actually exist in adults”.. now I feel instantly defeated and agreed to blood tests for thyroid and vitamins because she’s certain that’s all it is. Hon, I’m not mentally unstable because my vitamin D is low. 

I believe I am a textbook case. For so long I have suspected it about my dad and my brothers, and now after a journey of self awareness after having children.. I believe I also have ADHD and possibly quite severely. My daughter is only two, and I am not diagnosing her, but I know the chances. I also have a one year old who is very different and I guess … ‘settled’ compared to her.. and I kind of want to atleast see someone so I can have a chance at getting my shit together to give them the best chance at life.

"I'm 19 years old and home for the summer from college. my dad and I never got along that well. we disagree on most things and we get into fights all the time. maybe hate is too strong of a word because we do get along sometimes but I feel like we are always at a constant battle. recently, I have not been doing well mentally and have been really unhappy. spending my hours laying in bed and not having the energy of doing anything. Last night my dad came into my room and started screaming at me for my room being messy, ruining Mother's Day because I did not leave my room, etc., and took my phone. He made me feel so shitty and I truly felt bad. when I get into these arguments I ""shut down"" and don't say anything because I think if I do say what's really on my mind he will contradict it and say that's not a reason. Today, I quit my job and began applying for new ones online on my computer. He again, comes into my room and asks why I'm not at work and I said I quit. before I can even explain myself he starts screaming at me saying I'm lazy that I'm a guest living in his house and that I could be homeless soon and so on. I don't say anything throughout this whole thing which is making him even more mad. I can't remember all the things he said because I think I blocked it out. As he was yelling he puts his hand into a fist calling me a bitch and I yell ""Yeah Hit me"". He laughs and said ""You would like that wouldn't you"" and I ran into my bathroom and locked the door. I start having a panic attack and he says ""Let me see your tears"" like he wanted to see me cry. a few hours later he's talking to me like nothing happened but I'm still pissed. I'm I wrong to be upset? he does not understand what I am going through and called me mentally retarded for thinking I have depression or ADHD. I don't know what to do. I'm tired of all the fighting and kinda scared of him. he has never hit me but threw a cup of water in my face one time when we were arguing. any advice on how to deal with this? living at home is a nightmare because I'm always reminded that my parents favor my sister more and that my mom does absolutely nothing about my dad. i just want to leave but I have no money. any advice is good!",2,depression
"I'm a very paranoid person, been like this my whole life. 


Rarely trust what people say, don't trust a lot of things. Always worried about dying in my sleep. Always worried about carbon monoxide poisoning, about theives and murderers in my house. About people watching me from the shadows. About snipers in the distance. About people following me. 

Recently I've been paranoid about replacement. Afraid my loved ones are replaced... by robots or aliens idk. Afraid I'm in a simulation. I thought about suicide for a few moments before giving up the thought. Always worried about diseases, ailments, you name it. But I'm also worried about vaccines. Not gonna get the covid vaccine (still wear a mask tho), too scared. Worried about demons controlling me. Worried about spirits haunting me.

"Had this specific thought that something was going on between some individuals in my social circle that involved me and someone else.  Turns out I was right.  Now maybe my other suspicions about other people may also be true?  I deal with PTSD (sexual abuse/psychological abuse put upon me when I was a child by friends, family and professionals) and along with that comes my paranoid thoughts of either people wanting to abuse/hurt me again, use me, or that they pretend to like me when they actually despise me and they only pretend to like me in order to get close and eventually harm me.  Kinda feel like shit about my thoughts being true, now I feel like my brain is on defense mode, which I assume is a normal/expected response?

"18F - I currently have enough money to buy the car of my dreams I have always been dead set on getting a classic car and I found it and have the ability to purchase it in the next few days but my constant paranoia about finances and how that can affect me in any way shape or form is holding me back from doing this. I feel like I get so close to doing some thing that I really want to do and have a passion for and then seconds before it happens I switch flips my brain and I go down these holes of what if‘s like ‘what if I buy this car and I magically get kicked out of my apartment and I have nowhere to live but I just wasted money on this car when I could’ve used it to help my living situation’ ‘ what if people think that I am trying to flaunt wealth that I don’t have and I start getting harassed or people talk about me and I get pushed out of the city I live in’ ‘ what if me buying this car is stupid because the follow your dreams idea seems to not work out for a lot of people and cause a lot of disappointment what if I end up super disappointed in myself’ 


I have suffered from paranoia and OCD for a few years now and as much as it has calm down in certain areas specific events like getting close to my dreams and doing what makes me happy starts this spike in paranoia and obsessive thoughts and obsessive actions where I don’t know how to function and I don’t have a lot of friends so I can’t bounce things off of people when I need to talk about them so I just have to sit alone. 

I have the option to put down a $500 hold on the car and I want to do it but my brain isn’t letting me do anything it’s like two sides of my brain are fighting with each other one wanting to do this thing in the other constantly spewing anything to talk me out of it. I want to do things that make me happy but I Ithink the problem is that I haven’t been happy in a really long time and I don’t know if putting my happiness above some thing that tomorrow or in a month or years later could really hurt me financially is worth it. My need to constantly explain myself to people and hear their feedback has a lot to do with my paranoia and now that I’ve reached an age where decisions are up to me and I know the decisions I want to make but my brain cannot let me go through and do it.

"Hello there, I doubt most people will read this but it never hurts to let some thoughts out. For starters, I apologize if there’s any poor grammar in this post,English class wasn’t my best subject. I have been in this world for 19, almost 20 years and the sad thing is, I still live with my parents, I’ve never been in a relationship, and I have little to no friends to speak of. It’s been like this my whole life and it’s constantly fucked with my mind since. One reason is that I’m a little on the fat side and I know people look down on those type of people but I am working on that, it is however a very slow process that I am aware of. Another reason is my looks, I’m not ashamed to admit that I am ugly and that I will always be this way, no matter what. One more thing is that I have a certain condition I don’t want to reveal but let’s just say it makes me harder to connect with others, especially on a personal level (yes I do know it’s not an excuse but I felt like I wanted to point that out). Because of my circumstances, my mental state has been going down hill since about high school and I really don’t tell people, not even my family cause what’s the point, they’ll just tell me the cliches like “it’ll be alright” or “we’re here for you” and that never really fixes anything. What doesn’t help was the my high school is full of rich stuck up white trash brats who think they’re better then everyone else, and I mean EVERYONE. Not only that but if I tried to talk to someone, they would just silently respond to me and move on to what they were talking about with their friends and completely forget what I said. Those 4 years of high school were the worst of my life mentally but not academically since I managed to ace a majority of my classes but I was so depressed, there were times I would sneak into my stepfathers safe and just contemplate on grabbing one of his pistols, loading it, and just finally ending this still pathetic and worthless life I live. If people saw me and the life I’ve lived they would think “why is this guy complaining? He’s got what most people wish they had.” Yes I will admit I am very fortunate in life because of the great decisions my mother and stepfather have made and I am very grateful for that. To those who have that exact thought, I do agree with you, why should I complain about my life and when so many others are having it worse than others me. Who am I to complain when I have food, clothes, a roof over my head, and a ok paying job. But I my mind, there’s no point of living a good life, if there isn’t anyone else to share it with. I do have people around me but it’s a very small number. My mom and stepdad won’t tell it to my face, but they want me gone, my dad is barley around and while he is a nice guy for the most part, he lives a very poor lifestyle and will end up dead sooner or later, and last but not least are my grandparents on my dads side, they don’t have much time and I don’t see them as much as I want to. I love the people around me but I’m selfish enough to say that it is t enough, I wish there were some people out there who could understand me and some girl to see me as a charming and caring guy and not some fat ugly slob of a loser who has no one. I will always cherish the great things my family has done for me but I always feel like a burden and that if I were gone, people would just forget about me and move on but I wanna fell like there’s till hope for me and that my life with take a huge turn.

"I can’t shake the feeling that my ex husband tried to kill me and I’m lucky to have gotten away with my life. I have had a lot of anxiety lately, so maybe it’s just my mind running wild. It’s hard to tell though because this guy is a pretty sneaky and narcissistic person not to be trusted. 
Some stuff he did- He frequently killed animals. There were some stray cats that hung around our neighbor’s house that he proudly shot in front of our kids. He even bought my oldest child a gun without telling me and tried to tell her that the cats were her target practice. She was 6-7 years old then. He shot and killed the other neighbor’s sweet pet dog in front of our kids for no reason other than it had gotten out and roamed into our yard. There are many other things, really a lot of trauma for me to remember. 
On to the “I think he tried to kill me”: I think this happened when we started having trouble in our relationship. When I started standing up to him. Things were rocky. I was really healthy and took great care of myself at that time of my life. I was in my late 20’s. I mysteriously got really sick. I lost about 30-40 pounds in two weeks. Everything I ate and drank went right through me. I couldn’t even keep water in me. I was extremely weak and couldn’t stand for more than a few minutes. It was pretty scary how sick I was and I was only getting worse. I finally decided I needed to go to the hospital. He refused to take me and he seemed like he didn’t care that I was sick and was pretty annoyed that I wanted to get help. We had three young children that I stayed home and took care of. I ended up driving myself to the emergency room although I was afraid I might pass out on the 40 minute drive there. My neighbor watched the kids because he wouldn’t. When I got there they immediately admitted me and isolated me in my own room. They told me that my liver and heart were both in really dangerous condition. They ran a multitude of tests. I ended up staying there for 3 days and my ex husband didn’t call or visit once. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me. After the third day I was finally able to eat something and keep it in and began to regain some strength. They never did figure out what was wrong though. I went home he was so indifferent to the fact that I was so sick. I got better. And it was like it never happened. 
I just can’t shake the feeling that he was poisoning me and he was disappointed that I didn’t die. It’s exactly the kind of thing he would do and get away with. He would have researched it. Honestly I vaguely recall him possessing some kind of literature on untraceable poisons or something of the sort. He was always researching and reading up on things like that. I just never thought it would be for me. I seriously have no doubt that I’d be dead by now if I would have stayed with him. But then I wonder if I’m paranoid. I’m glad I didn’t die either way!",5,paranoia
so i have paranoid personality disorder and i have two best friends that i consider my “safe people” bc they are really the only two people i trust. recently they sort of got into an argument and they haven’t been talking to each other ever since. one is very mad at the other. i’m terrified that they are going to stop being friends and that our group is going to be torn apart. i truly can’t handle even thinking about that outcome because this has been a constant “safe” part of my life for 3 years now. that’s the longest time i’ve felt safe with anyone in my whole life. and it’s becoming no longer safe because i feel like the two of them don’t want to be friends anymore. if our group breaks apart i have fear that it will hurt me greatly in a mental sense. i’ve already considered checking myself into the psych ward ever since it’s been happening. i’ve cried every single day since they’ve been fighting. that’s how badly this is affecting my paranoia and my areas of safety. i know it’s not my fault and i guess i should stay out of it but i can’t let them stop being friends. it will destroy me. what do i do?,5,paranoia
"So im going to go college / uni next year because ive been so worried about picking the right course for me. But i also have anxiety about the future, and things that shouldn't concern me but do. I'm worried that AI will cut jobs massively in the coming decades, because as humans, we find satisfaction in our achievements and wanting to make a difference in the world - AI will be replacing white collar jobs for example.

"Since whodunits are having a revival, I feel like a lot of the mystery recs on this sub have been pretty similar. For anyone who’s read a majority of the OG classics & modern day classics, it’s hard to find one that will actually surprise you in a satisfying way.

The Decagon House Murders by Yukito Ayatsuji is legitimately great - it’s originally Japanese written in the 80s but should be available most places with its English translation

The premise is VERY “And Then There Were None,” - the characters themselves talk about it in the book. It’s about a bunch of college kids who go on a trip to an island to stay at the Decagon house and start getting killed off one by one.

As a warning: the writing, especially in the beginning, is not that great. I’m not sure if it’s the translation but I think it’s just that it’s the author’s first novel and he wasn’t very good, technically. Choppy sentences, not great flow, extremely mediocre prose. I was actually close to DNFing it lmao because I thought the quality was so mediocre, BUT once it gets going it’s really impossible to put down. The plot is addicting and the atmosphere is tense despite the writing limitations.

The reveal is excellent - it’s that perfect “omg I should’ve seen it coming duh there were clues I noticed but didn’t put together” while simultaneously being shocking. The type where you go back and reread the reveal because you can’t believe it.

 It’s not completely airtight—there’s a little suspension of disbelief/“what would the villain have done if X thing happened” etc but overall I think it’s incredibly good and satisfying. 

Unfortunately Ayatsuji’s follow up Mill House Murders is the complete opposite: written well but boring/predictable/solvable in the first 20 pages lol. 

But anyway highly recommend Decagon for anyone who’s read all the popular mysteries and looking for something new!!",0,negative_samples
"Depression is getting worse. Being around people literally hurts. Everyday, my brain is like static on a TV. It really sucks because I can't articulate anything. I've been dealing with depression for years, and honestly, I'm slowly seeing no point in living anymore. I'm also autistic, and even though I'm high functioning, I can't express myself. I literally don't know how. People laugh at me, make fun of me, and I'm just tired of it. The only thing I want to do, is give into my symptoms. Stop working, going to school, all I want to do is just lay in bed, stare at the wall, and basically wait to die. And I'm 27, so I have a good 50-60 years of waiting to die. Then I feel guilty for feeling this way, because there's people out there with terminal illnesses that just want to live. But I'm just so tired of feeling sad, and so tired of being mistreated and misunderstood. I feel like my Autism is more of a curse than anything. Idk, people are just mean to me, and I'm sick of it. And the only outlet I know is self harm. And I can't so that, because then I'll get thrown into the psych ward again. So all I can do is just bottle it up. When I try to talk about it with my therapist and psychiatrist, my mind just blanks. It's as if my brain was made to torture me.

"Hello everybody, I am M 21  
This is my first post on this sub and I think its going to be a long one. I think I am starting to develop some kind of social anxiety or something similar, let me tell you how it all started. I was always a very outgoing person, never really had trouble with meeting new people or finding myself in a new crowd. I could even say I was life of the party many times. But lately, circa half a year ago I started to feel anxious when I was having lunch at work. Which was weird because I never had anything similar happen to me. I just ignored it and carried on like nothing is happening. Then I started having the same feeling when I was having lunch with my friends, but the feeling went away as soon as I left the table so I didn’t worry about it that much. Until one day, I call the breaking point, I was taking an midterm and was doing fine, I knew the answers, but in the middle of it I started feeling nauseas and went to the toilet to clear my head, hopping I could finish my exam, but to my surprise I just couldn’t concentrate anymore. And since the breaking point I am starting to feel anxious in many more situations, like presenting in front of the class or even just sitting in the classroom and listening to lectures. I still can not pinpoint the source of the problem, my main suspect is stress, because I do have I very busy life juggling job, college and my semi-professional sport career, maybe it all just came chorusing down on me lately I really don’t know…  
I am really afraid in what ways will this affect my life… But I decided to fight and overcome some of the fears which are totally new to me, I find it scary and at the same time a bit shocking how fast anxiety took over my life

"Tw: suicidal ideation 

23F, living with my single mom (57) since I was born. she's a recovering alcoholic and has been sober for almost 3 years. on and off depressive episodes since I was born, which I also struggle with. 

I desperately want to move out but she has breakdowns every other day about how guilty she feels about ""messing me up"" from her addiction and how she can't forgive herself. she is in therapy and does daily AA meetings. she has epilepsy so she can't drive. she has no friends. she doesn't go out. 

When I wished her a happy mother's day, she said that she couldn't celebrate being such a failure. Today, she said she wants to die.

It feels impossible to leave her even though we barely can have a conversation without fighting or with her starting to cry. I am her only support system. I feel like I'm just going to die and there is nothing I can do about it. I don't know what the point of life is. I've never had any dreams or ambitions. Even during phases of my life where I would not have considered myself depressed, I am aimless. I feel bad for my mom because it's like she's counting on me to do better than her but I also just want to die. 

I've been through multiple therapies, I've taken all the antidepressants and antipsychotic combinations possible since I was 11 years old. I had a year long severe depressive episode in 2021 and spent 2022 climbing my way out just to crawl back in earlier in the year. I feel like there is no way out this time because I don't think it's worth it. Depression will always come back and break down more until there is nothing left. 

I am so miserable and broken.",2,depression
"Hi! I didn’t watch movies much growing up, and I’m legally blind. My condition is regretory, as in it was worst when I was born, and improved until I hit puberty (ocular albinism, specifically). I still have a lot of trouble distinguishing people in movies unless they wear very distinct clothes etc.

As such, most of what I’ve watched as an adult has been sci fi, fantasy, or animated. Dramas and romance movies are typically too hard for me to watch without someone telling me who’s speaking because I can’t tell them apart. I am fluent in English and Japanese, but no recommendations outside those languages unless there’s a dub because, well, blind. I had to take a classics movie class in college and while I liked the singing in the ones that had them, the lack of color made it even harder to see what was on screen.

Are there any movies you think would be worth a watch for me- classic or recent? I’m fine with some deep cuts but it’s got to be visually high contrast or distinct enough and I’d like to step out of my comfort zone. I’m not a fan of audio descriptive movies, at that point I’d rather just listen to an audiobook.

"For about the last three(ish) months, I've been dealing with what seems like allergies, especially when I wake up in the morning. Symptoms include itchy/watery eyes, runny nose, nasal drip, and on particularly bad days I'll have some brain fog and odd aches. The eyes and runny nose will subside during the day, however the nasal drip will generally remain.

Most days I won't even take anything for these, since after the morning ""surge"" it's alright. However, when I do have a particularly bad/persistent day I'll take a Claritin, and I can feel (and see, when it comes to the watery eyes) a significant difference within a couple minutes.

What's really odd is I have never experienced ongoing allergies like this before. Historically I've always had a week or two late April to early May when pollen is extremely bad.

I've tried a bunch of cleaning to try and resolve this, ranging from really washing my bedding to remove any mites, all the way to cleaning the drains in my bathroom and the condensate drain on my HVAC system (found it was clogged when I replaced the filter). I also just got a new pillow and mattress cover. I slept great, but I was still faced with the allergy flareup a couple minutes after waking up. I'm really convinced there's something in or just outside my bedroom, given it's especially bad after sleeping.

It's also worth noting my housemate's dog sheds quite a lot from her skin condition. She's not allowed in my room, I've lived with them for almost two years now, and I grew up in a house with a dog and cats, so I don't think the dog is the culprit.

"I was diagnosed and medicated in kindergarten, thanks to my mom being a specialist. I never knew any ‘struggle’ associated with my school career. I excelled in elementary and middle school, and ‘learning’ was nothing more than just arriving at school, doing work, and then going home. I never really studied or saw the deeper meaning of an education.

When I went into high school, I had no reason to change my ways. And I started to get horrible grades. I couldn’t understand the concepts, I had no scheduling or organization skills, and more importantly, I had no ethic to get shit done. Because I never needed those things.

Every time I try to independently look into a topic outside of school (for example, trigonometry today), my brain crashes again and again into an obsidian wall, and I get frustrated. I know that education is something that I can do. But it’s been heavily stained by these experiences.

I've had the appointment with my Gastro Dr today and he's given me three options going forward. I can have oral Pred but he is reluctant for me to have these as I have a history of mental health issues. Next are immuomodulators and finally humira. I'm going on a pretty important and epic trip at the end of august and I won't have any healthcare without flying out and therefore my GI is keen to try and get me some relief by the time I go. He seemed to be swaying more towards the Humira because he thinks it is more likely to induce remission. 
Can people please give me their opinion on all three options as I'm struggling to make a decision. Humira seems a little drastic as I haven't tried everything else yet but at the same time if it induces remission I'm game.

"Watched this movie for the first time today after finding it on the iTunes Store for $4.99. I’ve long been a fan of Paul Newman and, as this is one of the rare 100% movies on RT and contains #11 on the AFI’s 100 Years, 100 Movie Quotes List (What we’re dealing with here is failure to communicate.), I felt compelled to finally give it a watch.

To say it was more than worth the five dollars is an understatement. Newman played the title role brilliantly and there were solid supporting roles from George Kennedy as fellow inmate Dragline and Strother Martin as the villain, the Captain.

Its role as one of the earliest anti-establishment films of the Vietnam War era and its subtle use of Christian imagery are quite remarkable and the film certainly holds up after almost six decades. It is especially enjoyable if you’re a fan of other prison dramas such as The Shawshank Redemption as there’s a rather similar tone between the two films.

This one, in my opinion, has certainly earned its 100% RT rating and is well worth the watch. I was quite glad to find it at such a great price and highly recommend this for addition to your film collection if you haven’t already seen it.",0,negative_samples

"Worrying about things like “self diagnosed” and “i don’t like the way my acquaintance said he’s slightly autistic” is the luxury of the least affected. 

Why would someone with level 3 autism care about whether Jimmy is self diagnosed or not? I’ll bet you’re fine with Jimmy wearing a dress and being a “she,” and you should be. This seems so much more trivial and hair-splitting but no…the autism police aren’t having any of it. 

It’s binary. Oh wait it’s a spectrum. But you’re either autistic or not…which is binary, but wait, it’s a spectrum? I’m confused. We shouldn’t distinguish between a nonverbal person and a fucking billionaire?

I am 22 years old, and believe it or not, I have been suffering from depression for almost a decade.

I have nothing genuine,no friends or purpose to go on with life,I have had ADHD since I was 2 years old and major depression with anxiety diagnosed about 3 years ago,although in reality,it has been going on for quite some time.

I feel so exhausted, so angry and so lost, that I don't even plan to be in the future. I feel like hurting people, even though I know it's not right. If I knew today that I would never wake up again after sleeping in my bed, I wouldn't mind ..... Yes, I would be afraid, but it would give me the peace I so longed for.

The only reason I haven't taken my own life is because of the harm I might cause my family.

Sometimes I wonder if teachers,classmates or people who barely knew me today wonder where I am,what I'm doing,or if I moved on as that kid who breaks out of the mold and doesn't like to be like everyone else....

I feel bad if someone gives me sympathy for my emotions- I feel so fucking guilty I feel like no one should be around me but if I stop talking to people they will lose the positive person past self from like a week ago

""I'll just KMS"" or now ""I will kill myself"" or something along those lies then
""Uuhhh no I don't wanna do that""
""Why not you don't matter"" smth like that then

"This is my first time in this community, but I figured this would be the best place to ask.

I have had anxiety and panic related issues for as long as I can remember. I have put a lot of effort into trying to maintain it and live normally, breathing exercises and whatnot. However, somewhat recently, I have begun to have vivid, memorable nightmares. I won't go into detail about them, but its gotten to the point that I've been often sleep depriving myself just so I don't go to sleep. Its hard for me to call them nightmares because, I used to have nightmares, but never ever to this degree of intensity. I tried explaining this to my roommates, but they didn't really seem to understand it as a problem, saying ""that just sounds like a bad dream"".

My doctor recommended that I should probably start taking anxiety medication, but my (also quite anxious) mom is very against it, saying she has had nothing but bad experiences with anxiety meds. I also worry how the medication would clash with marijuana use, as that is currently how I manage stress, which has been pretty helpful for whenever I've been too stuck in my own thoughts.

I'm incredibly indecisive, but I know something has to be done, because I have to sleep in order to work. So, should I ask my doctor to start me on medication? Or perhaps there is something else I could be doing to help   myself out? I also want to start therapy, but I don't know if I can afford to cover it, even with insurance.

"Edit: skip to the end if u don’t mind just answering a couple general questions.

Hi guys, I’m 19 and had my first psychotic episode last may during finals week from a combination of my adderall prescription, weed and stress. It was a terrifying 4 months. For the first half, I was manic believing I was telepathic with my d1 hockey dorm neighbor. For the second half, I was paranoid shitless that he hired a hit man to kill me because he was tired of hearing me. 

For 4 months, I kept hearing voices despite months of different medications. I was declared treatment resistant but Electroconvulsive therapy eliminated the voices completely. I was diagnosed with schizo affective disorder somewhere in that period

I stayed clear of all drugs but when I returned back to UW Madison this January, I started using weed and alcohol daily until I heard an external voice while riding my bike on campus. It sounded like a person talking about me within hearing distance but I turned my head and no one was there. This was my only psychotic symptom but scared me enough to stop weed completely(still sober from weed and plan to for decades). I heard external voices like this every 5 minutes but only while I was outside. It lasted for a couple days after last smoking weed then it went away. Then for midterms, I decided to buy a few adderall as I figured I’d be fine since I stopped weed. I combined this with little sleep and i heard external voices while outside for a few days then it stopped(exact same features as post weed). This was my only psychotic symptom as far as I know. Does this mean I’m close to a full blown psychotic episode? 


I haven’t heard an external voice in a couple months. But after my midterms, I noticed that EVERYTIME I thought about what someone is thinking of me, I heard the sentence I think they’re saying as loud as my internal monologue. Currently, those internal voices have decreased to a level im comfortable with. That level is around imagining someone else’s thoughts as half sentences and half non sentences(or a feeling). Please try this quickly by thinking of something you did recently that impacted someone and let me know if what you think they’re thinking is in sentences or non sentences? 



I have an addictive personality but have managed to decrease my alcohol consumption from 20 to 10 drinks per week since the emergence of these voices I experienced. Is this level of drinking likely to cause another episode eventually? and how long would you estimate it would take the average person? I currently don’t have any psychotic symptoms so I also plan to take 20mg xr adderall 4 times per semester(early, though, so my sleep isn’t effected). If this is dangerous in your eyes, I can definitely be persuaded to not take it to study for finals this week as Im not stressed about failing. I plan on limited by drug use to adderall and alcohol. If alcohol+adderall or just alcohol are the only drugs you use, what amount do you use if you have you been successful in not having another break? Last question: do second psychotic episodes generally have the same features as the first? 

I would appreciate any insight on your experiences with even one of my questions or any general advice you have for me. If you have any questions for me, I’d be happy to answer in detail. We’re all in this together.

PS: The only medical professional I have access to is a nurse practicioner who only knows enough about schizophrenia to prescribe meds and google doesn’t answer any of my questions

"Does anyone else feel like they are the world's biggest hypocrite? It's so frustrating because on one hand I understand my rationalization for the way I do things, and it feels justified. On the other hand, I can't help but feel like a bad person for setting different standards for others than I do for myself.

I know I struggle with time management, and I work so hard to be punctual and prepared. However, it doesn't always work out - sometimes I am late and sometimes I forget things. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect that I am understanding and gracious if others keep me waiting or are unprepared, right? Wrong. It feels like they have committed a personal offence against me. Like they are intentionally disrespectful. Obviously I would never say or do anything to convey this - I am am always polite and understanding because logically I know sh*t happens sometimes. But I still feel so guilty for being so upset by something I know I do often enough myself.

And there is more. I often interrupt people when they're busy, but I hate being interrupted. I live and work in my own cluttered spaces, but hate when people leave their clutter lying around. I often zone out when people are telling me things, and have to ask them to repeat themselves. But I feel in my whole body the frustration and irritation when someone isn't paying attention to what I'm saying. It's such a double standard and I know it doesn't make sense, but it's like an emotional reflex I have no control over. 

I feel like I can never voice these feelings because it's not fair to others, and it's not their fault that I react so strongly to other people exhibiting my worst traits. I feel like I spend so much of my time policing my own behaviour and making sure I don't act in a way that reflects my initial gut feeling. I don't want to come across as manipulative, or that I think my needs are more important than the needs of others. I just feel like a bad person and a bad friend sometimes because no matter how courteous I am outwardly, on the inside there's this mess of negative emotions I constantly have to push down. It's a never ending cycle of feeling like everyone is against me, and then feeling horrible for not being empathetic towards others, and then feeling hopeless because I can't help it.

"I (41nb) know this post isn't specifically autism related, but it's all about some heavy stuff I've been dealing with for the last two months as an autistic person. I've been struggling to process because it's so overwhelming and I'm looking for support/a place to vent these feelings. 


I'll give some brief background. My birth giver (73f) kidnapped me before I was even born. I found out about this from a series of guilty confessions she made to me as a child. She only told me initially that my father was a different man from my older siblings because her husband wanted to take us to his affair partner's home. Birth giver told me ""the truth"" to spite him. I was 3 or 4. That wasn't the first or last time she used me to hurt him. 


It took several years and several lies to get some semblance of the truth out of her. Meanwhile, I was treated like a pet while I was small, but I was also being abused by an older sibling. The older I got, the more I was mistreated by my birth giver, my half siblings, and her husband. I was denied medical treatment, education, and therapy. I was forced into isolation from the ages of 10-14. Everything in my life had to revolve around church and God or I was punished. 


I always wanted to find my bio father, but I was hesitant. Birth giver told me things about him and heavily implied that she thought I was better off with her than with the man she had agreed to be a surrogate to (she says she needed cash, but that doesn't really make sense given the context. Unfortunately I can't share those details as they make me too identifiable). She always framed her decision to keep me as if it was up to her alone. It was only recently that someone pointed out to me that what she'd done was considered kidnapping. That realization really messed my head up and I'm still trying to process the fallout from it. 


I cut contact with everyone from Birth givers side years ago because I was tired of being their scape goat. Recently, I finally got the courage to order a DNA kit and it got processed so much quicker than the company said. Once the results came in, I was able to track my bio father down through a cousin. All I ever really knew was his name and the state he lived in. But that was enough. It took time to finally get in touch with him, but this week we started talking for the very first time. 


He's eccentric, but he's been nothing but honest with me about himself so far as I can tell. I've asked him if he would share what he remembers of my conception, and it isn't much, but it seems to confirm that my birth giver set out to purposely  get pregnant and may have had 0 intentions of letting (me) that child go. I've always suspected I was her revenge baby, a child she weaponized, and I thought I had come to terms with that, but I guess I haven't. Maybe because there was always a small chance I could have been wrong before. 


On top of that, despite having a few very supportive people who I've confided in about this situation, some of them have told me things like: ""you'll always love your mother, she raised you."" and I feel like they can't possibly understand what it feels like to know your own mother only had you to hurt someone. Something broke inside of me and I don't feel any love for my birth giver at all anymore. It's scary and it hurts so bad, but its also a relief to finally have that emotional tie broken.


Ultimately, I am glad to finally know my bio father, I have zero regrets about finding him. But...this hurts so much more than I've let on. I'm absolutely devastated. My whole life was a lie. My ""family"" just used me to make themselves feel better. It's so much to process and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to fully come to terms with this. 


I feel so alone right now. My irl supports have all been very kind, but no one understands what I'm going through (they've all said that) and I hate that I feel like this. I made a post about my struggles with this situation in another sub, one for abuse survivors, but it got completely ignored. That's really set off my rejection sensitivity, so I deleted that last post and decided that maybe this sub will be a little more responsive? I don't know, I just feel lost and sad right now.

I tried my hands at several things, trying my best to find an income to at least pay my bills and commitment, but none yield any results. Banks had been chasing me to pay my mortgage and car loans, adding to the pressure. Because I am somewhat religious, I do not have any suicide thoughts, but the thought of dying is better than living kept lingering in my mind.

As luck would have it, mid 2021 I got a job offer at a startup company (at the time I don't care what it is, I just applied randomly), and I immediately joined the company, despite the salary offered far lower than my previous job (12k a year compared to 78k a year in my previous job). The job itself is mentally draining, but I had determined to prove myself.

So within a year, I went from the lowest position to being one of the top management, and my salary increased to 30k a year. I had my goals to help this startup company to become at least medium sized company. The job is hard, with me often staying in the office after 10 p.m. even though there's no overtime pay, dealing with clients, messy process and issues working with partner company. But I persisted. I have clear goals, and with my experience, I know what to do. The salary still not enough, but at least I can pay part of the commitment I have while the rest I refinance to pay lower amount.

But then, at the end of last year, my mom fell ill (heart attack, stroke, and malnutrition). Malnutrition part is due to wrong advise given by the nutritionist (my mom opted for APD dialysis, but the nutritionist gave the diet for normal dialysis). I took a month break from working to take care of my mother and my kids (my parents took care of them when me and my wife work).

In that time, apparently, my assistant wasn't able to cope well with the job I had given, and tendered her resignation to the owner of the company. The owner, called everyone from my department and apparently almost everyone have a problem with me. The main issue, I was not a ""leader"", but a ""manager"". Now the owner of the company became emotional and he dropped me from the position I held at the time, and told me to do other things, without listening to my side of the story.

From then on, he kept dismissing my ideas, highlighted my mistakes frequently without looking at what I had achieved, and held meeting daily to see what I have done for the day. The consequences of dropping me from the position I held? The department is crucial due to the bulkiness of profits comes from my department, but now it is mismanaged, there's no clear goals, and dissatisfaction among the clients kept on rising. Several signs of a failing business had begun to emerge. I myself had lost motivation. It became harder and harder for me to stay after hours like I previously did, and even the smallest matter made me take leave. I couldn't stay there.

My wife's attitude with me had changed since I got fired, and she seems to lost her respects to me (I think this is part of the things that spark my depression in the first place), as I couldn't provide for the family. But nowadays my wife's attitude had been getting worse and worse. She lost her temper almost everyday, and kept shouting and screaming at me, in front of the kids. I tried my best to be patience, but it broke my heart. My kids too seems to have followed their mothers footstep, yelling and screaming at me when I didn't adhere what they wanted. I still love them, but I don't know how long I could hold on.

I usually have three places that becomes my solace, where I feel happy to be there and it helps me deals with my stress. But now, the three of them, the office, my home, and my parents home, had become the worst hell for me. I am dying inside. My tears aren't coming out anymore. The feeling of thinking that dying is better had resurface. I saw graves, and thought that how good it is if it was me in there. I saw a fatal traffic accident, I thought how good it is if that was me. I still held the believe that suicide is not the way, but still, death seems to be the sweet release from all of this.

If anyone read this until this part. Thank you. I had no place or outlet for me to rant. To express what I felt inside. To meet with psychiatrist is not something I have money to spend on. In fact, currently I only have 50 bucks in my pocket to last me for two weeks. This is how I get by every month. So, this is the only place I can rant anonymously. Again, if you read until this part, thank you, from the bottom of my heart.",2,depression
"I'm  20 years old and about to quit my seventh or eighth job depending on whether you call working for the same company at a different location a new job. I've been medicated for this last job and the one before. I started the medication in september, medikinet. I've worked for a supermarket/grocery store since then and transferred stores recently to become a supervisor. Honestly the variety of the job appealled but i've quickly found how difficult it is for me. i did the training in my old store and just couldn't cope . i've done marginally better here but it seems like every job i do i'm crap at and have to quit or face being fired. I'm starting college/university in september to try and open up more career options. I feel bad because i just want to find something i'm good at. I actually felt a while for this job that i did enjoy it and thought i might self-sabotage it or soemthing like that. When things start going wrong initally i take the feedback, try and learn, but when i still seem to screw up i'm like well this isn't meant to be or i'm bad at this. I don't know. I'd be quitting the job anyway for when i move away. I'm honsetly baffled at how a lot of people with adhd go unidagnosed and do absolutely fine in very good,. demanding jobs but i struggle at this; it is a demanding job but i'm intelligent. Unfortunately the things i'm good at aren't easy to monetise.",3,adhd
"I am 21 years old Italian, nearly 22, and i've got these type of thoughts since I was like 10, but always ignored them, but sometimes they always return. And now, I just can't think of avoiding them. I didn't, and still don't know what to do with my life. I have ADHD and probably developed through depression some personality disorder, but having ADHD and growing tired and bored with things kinda fast, I just can't work, between being in a office, working 6 days out of 7 like my mother does, I prefer die. The only thing that can bring me joy, are gaming, but I guess with the many people doing it, the little pubblic being Italian gives, and being shy/depressed myself, that can't turn in to a job; the other thing is art. I went to an art high-school, and I had a wonderful time, finding friends and teachers that I liked, even if sometimes it was rough, and there was Covid in the middle of everything, I knew it was worth it. Then, nearly a year ago, it ended. I didn't found anything beyond it, I didn't know how to be an artist, all my friends were too far away, not even in the near cities, I didn't know what do to with my life. I thought I could get that figured out in time, while I attended an art university, but has since passed a year, I still don't know what to do, and everything that teached me university is pointless, nothing I can't find on the most basic of the YT channels. 

For all my life, people said I was wrong. My jokes, my look, my face, the round of my face, my beard, my body, ironic that somehow I even got called fat for a bit of time at school, without ever being, I'm now 1.70 tall with 60 kg, at least depression never put me in a condition to always eat. Now, I'm thinking, they were right, not for the reasons they gave me, of course, but I am wrong, I can't find my place in the world. Even if I quit university, what's in then for me? Finding a job that I'm going to hate and quit? Waiting to become a famous artist while playing tons of videogames? Very recently I'm starting to wish that when I go to sleep, I don't want to wake up. Being by IA taking control over night, being by WW3 starting over night, being by a thief, even by some magical portal with monsters, even by a zombie outrage over night. Because, in the end, I'm so wrong I can't even put up with the solution  to my problem I've found. Maybe, not the best of solutions, but a solution nonetheless.",2,depression
"idk where else to post this. 

i have anxiety and depression but i firmly believe i have paranoia and panic as well...

a few days ago, my parents had their friends over. and whenever we have guests over, i have to clean my bathroom because thats the one guests use.

but even though i know this shit is completely irrational, i cant stop feeling paranoid about it. for context, i use summers eve, a soap specifically for the vaginal area. idk how or where i came up with this paranoid thought, but i keep thinking ""what if one of my dads friends jacked off in my bathroom and put their c\*m in the summerseve bottle?"" and then i started getting paranoid thoughts about being magically pregnant from it.

i am fighting my brain on this. each nnight when i take a shower, i pour a lot of the soap out and examine it to show myself ""see, u're being paranoid and delusional. it's not true. u're not magically pregnant."" 

but even though i reassure myself every day by trying to prove to myself its not possible or real, i STILL get the paranoid thoughts that INSIST it's real.

idk who to fucking talk to about this because this irrational fear and thougth is SO Fucking strange and totally wacko. i might be scared of older men or something. idk why else i would be so distrustful of my dads friends...

idk how to make it stop. i've tried over and over to tell myself ""it's not possible. look, ur soap looks normal. it's fine."" 

and i KNOW that the possibilty of getting pregnant from rubbing that stuff on the outter area around ur vagina is slim to none...but STILL. MY BRAIN WONT STOP THINKING IT. i eve tried to chug alcohol in hopes i convince my brain to ""miscarry"" the imagination pregnancy and paranoid thoughts about it.",5,paranoia
I’ve never really had a paranoia problem before as far as I can tell in my childhood. Now I’ve had anxiety for a while to the point where I would cry and place mistrust and assume S/O’s are cheating on me. But after some traumatic events I can’t help but avoid certain crowds of people because I just believe that these people seem like they are out to get me. It’s got to the point where if I see anyone I know I walk around them or wave and speed past.,5,paranoia

"I have an important certification exam coming up in a month and I SHOULD really be studying for it but all I've been doing is going around doing everything but studying. It's driving me crazy. I've even got all these books ready and stacked up on my desk to remind me  to study but I just end up ignoring them. On days when I do hold these books or open them, I just end up scanning through them and not really understand or retain any info.


I don't know what else to do to get myself going coz I've already set up tons of alarms and reminders and none works!",3,adhd
"(edit: I forgot I posted this and then found it again. Wow that's a.lot of comments to go through, but I will get to them all eventually. I feel so validated and less alone but I hate that so many of us have gone / are going through this trauma. Even just thinking about it, I feel the panic response.)

I've had this issue with multiple relationships I've been in. When someone I love with is in cleaning mode, they expect me to be too just because they decided it's time for everyone to clean right this moment. Even if I was literally asleep. They'll usually get mad about it too. Do neorotypicals see someone clean and instantly get energized to clean, stopping what they're doing?",3,adhd

I'm allergic to everything they tested me for except cashews and one other thing which might be some small tree nut, if not it's a grass. Ik I'm allergic to all environmental plants they tested me for. I don’t know much about plants so idk the details of it just know they're PLANTS. I just realized I'm allergic to mosquitos today. I found out I get skeeter syndrome like a year ago then I just realized it's an allergy. I usually just say I'm allergic to vegan cause that's the whole vegan staple. I probably have more allergies, I have way too many that it's starting to get hard to keep track. I'll like know in the moment but off the top of my head, I might need a minute

I have a host of other problems too if anyone is interested in them LOL. I just learned I have ADHD so I'm bored and waiting for the medicine to kick in. It's probably not strong enough, and that sugar might had made it worse oops",0,negative_samples
"

My gender dysphoria is the worst, it’s almost killed me before. I’ve told my mom if I have to have my AGAB genitals in high school I will simply die. I cry every day in the shower, I breakdown just by looking at myself.  My family is by no means wealthy. But I read Croatia has great and relatively cheap bottom surgery for anyone above 13 with parental consent. It would be 30k budgeting in plane tickets. Question A: is it a good idea to get bottom surgery this young? (I’ve read about growth and how much skin they need for it) and question B: how the hell does one talk their mother into a 30k loan for this?",2,depression
"I have the oddest problems with my delusions. They're all coincidental but they feel so right connected to one another. I somehow am aware that the opposite of what I want oddly comes true every day in my life. It is so odd how the opposite coming true happens so many times, I delusionally believe my thoughts are being read.

"I can’t tell you how many times I have wanted to “unalive” myself or just pack my shit and run away to countryside Uruguay or something. I’m always dealing with this weird feeling that I’m never good enough for anyone or that whoever comes in my life is going to abandon me and disappoint me. I’m good looking, I get compliments all the time and my boyfriend makes a point at how many comments I get. (I even feel like he’ll be leaving me sooner or later) I’m pretty smart, a really great person to others and I’m fairly responsible. Im literally the person I would want to marry lol, I love myself and I feel like if I was alone I might be happier? I’m constantly crying and punishing myself but I admit I hide it pretty well from others. The only reason I stay around is because I have a child who I want to give a better childhood than I had. I look at her and she’s so confident and happy and brave and smart, but I’m doing this all alone with no support and I need help I really do but I can’t stop letting the intrusive “whoever comes along to help you is gonna disappoint you the moment you really need them” and I want to stop these thoughts! Therapy hasn’t helped. I truly do want help or at least to get over these feelings specifically. Do you guys have any tips or advice?",2,depression
"I'll say it, high and not so proud
I'll die during 2024
I don't know when exactly, but I'll die during 2024.
Having no feelings for anything and pretending to care for anything is exhausting, and I don't want to keep on pretending that I'm feeling good

All I can do now is wait for 2024, since my life's already crap

If you already felt insecure about yourself, please, remember that I'm alive, so there will always be someone worse than you.

Have a nice evening, I might see you in the other world",2,depression
"24F. I have always been the weird outcast. Spent all my school days just getting laughed at by other girls and getting picked at. I was always alone. I've never had a best friend. My parents are super toxic and conservative. They are Indian Muslims. I'm not saying all Muslims are bad people but my parents and my community sucks. They have been forcing me to get married since I was like 16. My father is abusive, my brothers misogynists, and my mother is a narcissist with victim complex. I had a job for three months after graduating but the environment was really toxic and I was recovering from a traumatic event so I had to move back home. I have no skills and no idea how to move forward. I am trying to upskill but some days or entire months I get so paralysed by depression. I need therapy but my parents won't let me. I'm an adult but being a woman in this community leaves me with no control on my own life. 

I have been going to the gym. And I made a couple of friends. I mean I thought they were friends. I talked to them about normal girly stuff and I tried really hard to not be weird. But I guess it didn't work. I heard them laughing at me and once I tried really hard to understand their body language, I realised they find me weird and don't want to talk to me. This literally triggered me so much.

I have to much empathy and I cry about everything. Any time I see someone sad or hurt I break down. I have so much love to give to someone. I so desperately want like someone to talk to who won't judge me. Even when I have things I want to share with like my mother, I suppress them because she will just make me feel childish and stupid for it. 

I don't know what to do. I am struggling with the thoughts of ending it all but I can't let someone else be responsible for finding me yk? I won't do anything. I would like advice on how to deal with all this and be okay with being utterly alone and move forward. I hate that humans need companionship. What a faulty design.",1,autism

I still wonder if it’s just psychotic depression, but psychosis certainly took the life out of me.",6,schizophrenia
