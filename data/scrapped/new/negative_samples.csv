5Ks and weight training - how can I schedule both?,"I recently completed Couch 2 5K, and while I enjoy running I’d also like to start lifting to improve my physique and become less “Skinny-fat”. I usually run 5K 3 times a week (3.1 miles).

I’m a complete novice looking for advice on how to balance running and weight training. However, a lot of my research just leads to vague articles saying “it’s possible to do both” without suggesting how to split up the workouts/not overwork yourself.

If anyone has any suggestions, I’d be really grateful!",0
"What difference is there between set/rep distribution, when total volume is similar, and how big is it?","As title says, I was wondering how big a difference is it between, say, 4x6 or 6x4 sets with same weight (obviously), or even more estreme ends like 3x8 and 8x3.

Intuitively I can think that lower reps allow for higher weights (waaaay higher, in fact), but that isn't the point of my question, which only pertains the same weight.

As long as I'm lifting same weight X, how much does it change how it's split across reps?

Tiny Rant about raction to hairdye,"Guys. Don't be as dumb as me and slap any ol' dye on your head before checking if it fits you. After 48 hrs of putting it in my head, I have been to the ER (this morning) and they could not help me, and now, a few hours after, have to go back because my eyes and my nose start swelling really badly. I look like a baloon. I might have to get checked in and stay a couple of days. I hate it so much. PLEASE do your research, because it might make lose you your confidence and breath if you don't. I know you might not care, but I wanted to say this for all people who are like me and will just go for it.

Thank you for reading.

I've been getting allergy shots for 4 years and I'm still on once a week dosage with minimal improvements. Is this normal?,"I was under the impression you'd be on matenance dosage by 5 years. I'm still on weekly dosing and have been for years. I also still have pretty bad allergies which is extremely discouraging.

"Next step after Allerclear (Claritin) that's not Zyrtec? Seasonal, PNW, Douglas Firs","Moved last year...seasonal allergies have hit me like a ton of bricks. Had to take the first place I could land/rent which is under 3 huge douglas firs. Trying to get out.

Last spring I started using Allerclear as my entry point and it SEEMED hit or miss. I tried Zyrtec and had an allergic reaction (throat closed, etc). I defaulted back to Allerclear as my daily and I suppose it's helping me fend off most days but with with spring doing it's thing it's not cutting it again.

Have heavy reactions happening that I've started keeping Bendryl near by as a second solution (does tame the reactions but knocks me out). Have tried various venting solutions in my house...but do have fans, humidifiers and a couple purifiers running around the clock.

Mint gum allergy?,"Hello all,

I’ve been noticing recently that whenever I chew mint gum, a few hours later or the next day I wake up with an swollen tongue I can barely feel and a ton of excess saliva. I’ve had mint drinks and this has not happened, and non mint gum and this has not happened, but it specifically only happens after mint gum. I’m at a loss as to what ingredient is only in mint gum other than the mint since I’ve had mint drinks and it didn’t affect me like this? Maybe it’s the mint mixed with the aspartame that create a chemical I’m allergic to

"Having some type of allergic reaction to deodorant, water, orr laundry detergent ?? lol","So I moved a few towns away in May of last year and since I've been living here I've been dealing with itchy armpits at certain times during the day usually when it's hot or when I'm sweating more than usual, or when showering washing off deodorant. 
- I have tried tests of switching soaps, switching deodorant (ive been trying non anti-perspirant for like a couple years now didnt have a problem), not wearing deodorant.. 
- I do feel better if I don't wear deodorant sometimes(?) but like today I tried a new one and I felt fine during the day but then when I showered and tried to rinse it off it really was itchy. Happened a lot last summer. 
- That makes me wonder if it's the water in the shower? 
- Or, I don't have any problem anywhere else on my body that makes me think it how could be the laundry detergent ? Read its possible tho. Fyi ,I use the seventh generation sensitive. 

I did read that you can still get it only in one spot like my armpits are itching so why would that be my laundry detergent. It's really hard to tell, any advice? Ugh..",0
allergy during/after shower. (I don't use products),"I noticed I often sneeze or rub/itch my eyes in or just after a shower.

I definitely have a dust allergy so I'm wondering if it's from dust in my hair being washed onto my face and eyes?

Help! Multi system reaction in toddler on horse ranch,"Our toddler recently had an anaphylactic response to her skin scratch test - nuts suspected were pecans, walnuts, pistachios, and pine nuts.  Also reacted to beef and Timothy grass.  Delayed reaction to wheat, milk, a couple other things.  We did IGE tests and the only positive from her blood work was milk.  In the past she had a full body hive reaction with swollen lips and coughing that we tied back to pecan exposure.  

Fast forward to this weekend, we are out of town for a wedding staying on site at a horse ranch.  First night we were ok, but within five minutes or so of leaving the cabin and walking to our car, hives were spreading.  They kept spreading until they were full body.  Within half an hour, her eyes and lips were itching and very slightly swelling.  No breathing issues.  We were close to the local ER, so we dosed with Xyzal and waited. Reaction stopped spreading but took a while to calm.  About eight hours later, she still has some flat red spots.  She had not ingested anything this morning prior to the reaction, but I talked to the property owner and the property is covered in pecan trees.  They are not common where we are from, but this is still scaring me.  How bad is this if walking past them when it is not a big flowering season is causing a big reaction?",0
Can one type of allergy make another worse?,"This past week I started getting itchy bumps all over and we think it’s our laundry detergent because of the timing and where the spots are appearing, like on my arms and bra lines. However, I’m also getting really itchy and dry eyelids, and I’m having trouble imagining much of our laundry coming into contact with my face. Over the past 5-7 years I’ve gradually developed seasonal allergies, and I’m thinking that my eyes being itchy might be due to pollen. But I just haven’t had seasonal allergies that long, so I don’t have like a pattern to compare it to. Would the rash from the laundry detergent affect my immune system to make me more sensitive to the pollen too? Is that a thing? Or should I be looking for some other source that would explain the weird dry eyelids and the rash at the same time?  

We also recently went camping and I initially thought the rash was poison ivy exposure but then the bumps kept popping up elsewhere several days after we were home and all our things had been washed.",0
Do Mattress & Pillow Allergy Encasings Work?,"For those who are allergic to dust mites…

An allergist recommended encasing products specifically from “Allergy Guardian”, and although they don’t seem unreasonably expensive, they do cost enough to warrant this poll.  The pore sizes of the mattress & pillow encasings I’m considering are 2.4 - 3.6 microns.  Any insights appreciated!

Allergies every single day,"Hi friends, 
I used to not care about the seasonal allergies that much. But year over year, I feel weaker and weaker and never could get any help from any doctor.  So I wish I could get some advice in case anyone knows about this disease.

I started the so called seasonal allergies for at least 7, 8 years now.  In the beginning, it was perfectly seasonal.  I could tolerate it, so I didn't really use the allergies reliever from Costco.

But recent 3 years, it became literally every day.  Every time I woke up from night or nap, as soon as I opened my eyes, I feel wet in my nose, and if I didn't wipe it soon enough, I had uncontrollable sneezing.  I feel like catching cold every day.   In reality, I always feel throat itchy, and very easy to catch a cold.  

My concern is that, is it possible to turn into some immune system issue beyond just seasonal allergy?
Which type of doctor can help me?  I have bad experiences with primary care and urgent care doctor, whenever I asked about this , they just say oh sorry, people get sick very often this season, totally normal. And sent me away.

I really don't know where to find help now.",0

Is it normal to be itchy after handling crushed grapes/pumpkin guts?,"Granted, it’s been a few years since I’ve done either of these, but the itchiness I got afterwards was probably the most itchy I’ve felt in my life. 

When I was a kid, mom and I were squeezing grapes through a pantyhose, I think to help my Tia make homemade angelica wine. My hands and arms were ridiculously itchy afterwards for over an hour. As for pumpkin, my family thinks I am a wuss for not wanting to scoop the guts out of my Jack-o-lantern every Halloween, but it’s partly because of how itchy I get after handling the guts. Now I just stab Mr Potato Head parts in my pumpkins to avoid carving altogether.

I’m fine with eating grapes, but never eaten pumpkin. I’ve literally only had itchiness after handling them those few times in the past. Could those have been allergic reactions? Though even if so, not sure if it’s worth bringing up to my allergist with how long ago the reactions were.",0
My dust allergies just….. stopped?,"I’m super sensitive to dust usually. I have to wear masks when I do certain things or I know I will regret it.

So I just said “whatever, I’ll just take a yellow pill when I get stuffy” and kept the mask off.

And the allergies never came. Then yesterday and today I’ve been doing things where I KNOW it is dusty, and I always get allergies when I work with the books etc 

I’m fine. 3 days. No stuffiness, no itchy throat, no sneezing.. I can breathe out of my nose fine.

Allergies Disappeared during COVID-19 - Anyone Experienced This?,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my experience with COVID-19 and allergies. I am someone who suffers from severe allergies, particularly to dust-related substances like dust mites, pollen, sawdust, floor dust, and anything else that's dusty. I have a runny nose 24/7, and I always need to have tissue paper with me. Additionally, if I come into contact with dust, my skin becomes incredibly itchy.

Last year, I contracted COVID-19, and surprisingly, I remained asymptomatic except for a one-day headache. However, during this time, something remarkable happened—my allergies vanished completely. I could finally breathe easily, my nose was clear, and my skin was no longer itchy. Even my scalp psoriasis disappeared.

Unfortunately, this period of relief didn't last long. Around two months later, all my allergies came back slowly. I often find myself thinking about that time when I had COVID-19, to the point that I've even wanted to intentionally infecting myself again just to relive that symptom-free period.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? I'm curious to know if anyone can explain why this phenomenon occurs.

I appreciate any insights or shared experiences you can provide. Thank you!

Ps.No medication was given at that time.",0

Unusually persistent allergies(?),"For about the last three(ish) months, I've been dealing with what seems like allergies, especially when I wake up in the morning. Symptoms include itchy/watery eyes, runny nose, nasal drip, and on particularly bad days I'll have some brain fog and odd aches. The eyes and runny nose will subside during the day, however the nasal drip will generally remain.

Most days I won't even take anything for these, since after the morning ""surge"" it's alright. However, when I do have a particularly bad/persistent day I'll take a Claritin, and I can feel (and see, when it comes to the watery eyes) a significant difference within a couple minutes.

What's really odd is I have never experienced ongoing allergies like this before. Historically I've always had a week or two late April to early May when pollen is extremely bad.

I've tried a bunch of cleaning to try and resolve this, ranging from really washing my bedding to remove any mites, all the way to cleaning the drains in my bathroom and the condensate drain on my HVAC system (found it was clogged when I replaced the filter). I also just got a new pillow and mattress cover. I slept great, but I was still faced with the allergy flareup a couple minutes after waking up. I'm really convinced there's something in or just outside my bedroom, given it's especially bad after sleeping.

It's also worth noting my housemate's dog sheds quite a lot from her skin condition. She's not allowed in my room, I've lived with them for almost two years now, and I grew up in a house with a dog and cats, so I don't think the dog is the culprit.

Has anybody had a similar experience? Any suggestions on extra medications to take or odd places/methods to try cleaning? This has been fairly troubling because I've felt consistently lower on energy than usual, thanks to my body fighting *something*.",0
Help managing dog allergy over Memorial Day,"My good friend invited me over on Memorial Day to their beach house. Unfortunately they have a dog, and I have a serious dog allergy. The good news is they are very understanding and accommodating!

I am planning to completely stay outside. There is a small poolhouse with a bathroom in case I need to shower or use the toilet. The dog will be in the house or leashed away from me. I am VERY grateful for my friend being so understanding. 

However… the dog has sat on all the fabric cushions on the beach chairs. They also use the beach towels to dry off the dog before it comes back in. They don’t have separate towels for dogs and people. 

If the towels are washed is it ok if I use them? I do have bad skin reactions to dander and saliva. Is washing them enough? 

Otherwise I will just bring my own towel and chair. Sucks having an allergy that makes planning a day at the beach so complicated",0

How do I get rid of the hives on my face (day2),"Hello, on Thursday night I ate a small chocolate bar (Aldi's version of a KitKat) and I've had a bad reaction, my face is full of tiny prickly hives and my neck and then it fades around my chest.

I took antihistamines and I've put anti itch cream on my face. I visited the pharmacy and they couldn't suggest anything other than what I'd already taken. I asked if they had anything less drowsy as I'd been really sleepy and fell asleep for over an hour yesterday afternoon (I don't usually nap in the day, I don't rest!) The pharmacist said I'd already taken the less drowsy type of antihistamine. 

My face has gone from smooth, to looking like I have severe acne! It's sensitive to heat and water, and it's hot out (for once in England!) So I can't even go out. I've just got to wait for it to go back to normal.

This has happened once before, about 14 years ago, and it lasted a week. I don't know what I'm allergic to, as I only have reactions like once a decade. 

Any tips on what I can do to ease the discomfort or get rid of the reaction quicker?",0
"Chronic allergic reaction in upper airways, difficulty breathing. Any ideas / suggestions?","Hi all, I’m going to try and keep this as brief as possible. I’m stuck and looking for any ideas / thoughts people might have. 

I’m 38/F, I’ve been having mystery upper airway constriction for about 1.5 years. It started after prolonged exposure to bushfire / wildfire smoke. Basically I can feel my upper airways are swelling / constricted, my throat feels constricted and if I breathe through my nose it feels like the airway is constricted and I can’t get enough air in. If I breathe though my mouth it’s slightly better but still feels like my throat is constricted and I struggle to get a good breath. 

There’s no congestion, watery eyes, sneezing etc. Also no itchy tongue or lips. 

It waxes and wanes but when it’s bad I’m panting / struggling to get a good breathe, and it can feel like an emergency. When I’m in a flare I feel really unwell and exhausted.


The only thing that helps really knock it out is prednisone - I’ve been on 6-7 courses of prednisone in the last year. My family Dr initially had me on steroid inhalers until I could get in to see specialists, she assumed it was asthma. I’ve also tried montelukast, I had a bad psychological reaction but I tried it for three weeks and didn’t notice any improvement. 

Tests I’ve done - 
- spirometry / lung function testing to rule out asthma. My lung function is always fine, when I do peak flow lung testing at home it’s fine. 
- mannitol challenge test to further rule out asthma. That was also negative, so it doesn’t seem to be asthma. 
- I saw an allergist last year and got skin prick testing done for environmental allergies. Positive for some grasses and dogs but the allergist was unsure if it was causing these issues. 
- I saw a respiratory specialist a few months ago who thinks it’s not asthma, but a sort of severe allergic rhinitis, and thinks my upper airways are having a chronic allergic reaction and getting swollen / constricted. He prescribed dymista which has helped a lot but I’m having a flare at the moment and dymista isn’t controlling it. I’m also taking symbicort at the moment on the advice of my family Dr while I’m in a flare, which helps a bit. 
- checked for reflux / GERD and tried medication just in case, but no improvement.
- the respiratory specialist also did a scope where he looked in my throat and nose etc with a camera - he ruled out vocal chord dysfunction. 

I live rurally on a farm surrounded by pasture fields, but I don’t have cats or dogs or any indoor animals and I don’t deal directly with the cattle around us. No carpet or drapes in the house, everything is kept very clean / minimal dust, no mould issues. I run air purifiers in the house to help minimise airborne allergens while I figure this out. I take a daily antihistamine. 

The respiratory specialist ran pretty extensive bloodwork to check for auto immune diseases etc but that was all clear. I’m a bit stumped and don’t want to keep taking prednisone. Wondering if anyone has any ideas / thoughts.",0

Contact dermatitis for 3 months - help!,"Hi everyone, 

I recently moved into my new house a few months ago and broke out in a severe rash that originally stated on my forehead, ears, and lips. Now it has been spreading to my chest, arms, and hands.

I went to a dermatologist who took a biopsy of the rash on my neck and arms, which came back inconclusive. They gave me a list of steroids and prescriptions (see the below list for topical and pill form).

I also went to an allergist where they did a TRUE test and tested for 36 allergens on my back. They all came back non reactive.

Here is the list of medications that I’ve tried the last 3 months:
 
Doxycycline 100mg (pill)
Prednisone 10mg (pill)
Hydroxizine 25mg (pill) 
Clindamycin 1% lotion 
Hydrocortisone lotion 2.5%
Desonide cream 

I’ve moved to dove scent free lotion and shampoo. Laundry detergent is scent free, and no perfume. The owners before us did not have any pets, and only lived there 60 days out of the year. We’ve also eliminated our dog from the back yard the past few months. My husband lives with me and he doesn’t have it. 

Would anyone know what this could be causing this? Or more importantly, how to get rid of it?! Thanks so much!!",0
How to have a balanced diet despite allergies?,"Hi, I'm allergic to most fruits and veggies that are available in europe (where I live).

Cut fish out of my diet for months due to anxiety. How to reintroduce with my phobia?,"Hi. I really only have a history of OAS. I have an older brother with a severe nut allergy. All my life, my mother grilled it into me that I could also develop this allergy, and largely kept me away from nuts. 

Last year, I ate a dish with basil pesto and had a panic attack, falsely believing my throat felt sick and my arm “itched.” There was no allergic reaction but the panic attack, and my parents’ reaction toward my ridiculousness, really stuck with me. I did go to therapy but my therapist…really tried to pin the cause on factors I knew not to be true. 

I went through a phase of being afraid of EVERYTHING, but reintroduced eggs, dairy and fruits, avocado, etc. I’m still stuck on nuts (I swear pistachios did once make my lips tingle, maybe OAS), and fish because I’d read it can develop in adulthood. I haven’t really eaten either in a year (nuts) to eight months (fish). **I’m scared I’ve actually built up an intolerance because of how long I’ve avoided these foods. Can this be true?**

My doctor refuses to give me a requisition for allergy testing. Any tips on safe reintroduction? I kind of tried with pho (fish sauce) but the thought of salmon or sushi or fish & chips is daunting.",0
For those who are allergic to cats!,"I had a health scare a couple of years ago that made me think I was severely allergic to my cat. Thankfully, my problem eventually resolved itself and this turned out not to be the case. But for a while I was put in the position of thinking what to do and how to keep my cat.  
I've seen so many heartbreaking stories of people who've had to give up their cats because of a worsening allergy. **I thought I'd share some tips on what might be a possible solution, apart from taking medication, vacuuming regularly, air filters and so on. My suggestions might not be for everyone, every household or every cat. Not everyone will agree with them. They might even sound pretty drastic, in fact. However, they might be a way to keep cats out of being abandoned or put in shelters. Also, hopefully others can chime in on what tips they have for allergic cat owners.**  
1) Wear an allergy mask or at least a face mask while interacting with your cat or being in the same space as your cat. Find some middle ground between the ones with the best filtration and the ones that are most breathable. If your allergies cause your eyes to itch or swell, wear sunglasses/glasses or even goggles. If your skin itches due to your cat allergies, try wearing long sleeves or applying a hypoallergenic barrier cream.

  
2) If your living situation allows, convert one room into the kitty's exclusive space and keep the door closed at all times. Do not let kitty into other spaces in the house. Use a baby gate to prevent kitty from running out of the door when you open it. Dander can still leak from under the door, but it will be much less than what you'd get if kitty is in most indoor spaces in the house. Put up lots of cat trees and all sorts of fun accessories, bridges, etc so that kitty will never get bored! You will probably need to do some deep cleaning of the other spaces in the house to notice a difference.

  
3) Finally, if you live in a house or an apartment with a balcony and you have exhausted all options (especially if you have a kid who is allergic), convert the patio, the balcony or some other outdoor space into a safe and cosy catio. There are many DIY tutorials online. If you live in a cold climate, put in insulated/heated boxes.

  
Like I said, these tips won't be for everyone, but I just wanted to share in the hopes that it'll help someone out there not make the heart wrenching decision of putting their kitty in a shelter.",0

Do I get my next allergy shot if I still have some swelling (that is only a bit itchy now) from the last one?,"I got my last allergy shot on Wednesday and I developed a very large hive at the injection site that was incredibly itchy and somewhat painful for the first 24 hours or so. Since then it’s gotten very small and less raised but is still a bit itchy and is a little painful to the touch. 

I have an allergy shot scheduled for this morning and it’s close to the office’s opening time. I’ll call right when they open and ask but I wanted to know if people think I should expect to be heading there or if it’s best to skip for now. Thank you!",0

I'm allergic to everything they tested me for except cashews and one other thing which might be some small tree nut, if not it's a grass. Ik I'm allergic to all environmental plants they tested me for. I don’t know much about plants so idk the details of it just know they're PLANTS. I just realized I'm allergic to mosquitos today. I found out I get skeeter syndrome like a year ago then I just realized it's an allergy. I usually just say I'm allergic to vegan cause that's the whole vegan staple. I probably have more allergies, I have way too many that it's starting to get hard to keep track. I'll like know in the moment but off the top of my head, I might need a minute

I have a host of other problems too if anyone is interested in them LOL. I just learned I have ADHD so I'm bored and waiting for the medicine to kick in. It's probably not strong enough, and that sugar might had made it worse oops",0
What is a good allergy shot replacement?,"I currently live in a big city where my insurance covers allergy shots 100%. I'm about to move to a state that doesn't have insurance approved allergy shot places. I've looked into curex and the like, but have been hearing that they're not legitimate. Is there any good alternative? I'm in Arizona and am allergic to every type of pollen. I currently get weekly allergy shots.",0
Allergies are draining me,"But of a long post, but it obviously covers everything relevant. My girlfriend and I moved into a townhouse a couple months ago in Arizona that we got from a friend of hers that moved out. They had three longhair dogs, two of them being huskys, that lived here with them over the course of a couple years. The place wasn't cleaned at all, but because we know them we cleaned up when moving in, no big deal. Fast forward a month and a half, I start having the worst allergies I've ever had. I've dealt with outdoor allergies since I was a kid, and dealt with pretty bad ear infections also, but this was terrifying. I work from home, and in the course of a couple weeks had some pretty scary panic attacks, one that made me leave work early to go to my parents house. I also had chest tightness, trouble breathing, and general seasonal allergy symptoms. Our property manager is very accommodating thankfully, and immediately started getting mold inspectors, HVAC guys, the whole deal to see what the issue is. HVAC guy tells me it's the carpet as soon as he walks in. Tells me it smells very strongly of ammonia, which my girlfriend and I never smelled assumedly because we live here. Carpet gets replaced, severe allergies have gone away. However, I still am getting bouts of minor chest tightness, and throat irritation/tightness along with my seasonal symptoms. I know I need to go to an allergist, but it's driving me insane. I take Zyrtec and Flonase everyday, and vacuum regularly. Is there any advice for what I could be missing? My girlfriend works a normal job, and has zero symptoms. Her guess is because I'm home for work I'm clearly the one being exposed to whatever it is. I've also spent $200 on a dehumidifier, as our home was sitting around 50% and is now around 38-40 daily. Last thing to mention, my symptoms go away within 10-20 minutes of leaving my house, if not less. 

TLDR: Had ammonia/pet dander infested carpet from previous tenants, replaced carpet, but I'm still having some lingering allergies.",0

"Balance Issues, Anxiety, random ear pain, brainfog?","I am 23m and haven't dealt with Allergies before. Since the start of Covid, I started dealing with anxiety issues, but for the past year I have been able to manage much better.

A couple weeks ago, pollen has been flying like crazy here in Northern California, almost snowing. The only reason why I think it could maybe be allergies is because I only started to feel weird in the sense of balance, vision, and brain fogginess just recently out of no where. 

I am experienced with Anxiety and I know that it's possible my mind could be playing tricks, but after reading how there are people with similar symptoms with this allergy season, I started to question maybe it's all the dust and pollen that is flying in the sky.

I have never taken any allergy meds, and am a bit worried after reading some people's experience with side effects. Any advise would be greatly appreciated!",0
Tried every allergy pill nothing works,"Allergy tests show I have environmental allergies. I have taken every different OTC allergy pill that you can, but my nose still runs like a faucet most days. I can almost never breathe through it. It’s so embarrassing it’s been like this for years

Sometimes I can breathe just fine and then all of a sudden my nose is blocked up and running like crazy again when there aren’t even any significant allergens present. I don’t have pets and I have an air purifier and a roomba vacuum in my house and I scald my bedsheets every weekend to kill dust mites

Is there a prescription grade one you can get that will simply prevent the symptoms? It’s so bad, any advice is appreciated",0
I had patch testing for contact dermatitis this week but am confused about one allergen,"So I had 3 positive irritants. Neomycin sulfate, p-tert-butylphenol formaldehyde resin, and decyl glucoside. And I had 4 positive allergens, which were methyldibromo glutaronitrile/phenoxyethanol, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, disperse blue mix, and propylene glycol.  


I'm noticing that phenoxyethanol comes up in ingredient lists a lot, but not in combination with the other compound. Does this mean I would only need to avoid the combination of methyldibromo glutaronitrile/phenoxyethanol, or both ingredients even when separate (so avoid both methyldibromo glutaronitrile AND phenoxyethanol)?",0
Paranormal Activity,Have you had paranormal phenomena that you can justify with a photo,0
I feel like a clown. I've tried everything; you people are my last hope.,"Hello fellow sufferers, this season has been the absolute worst for me según a delayed Spring, thus everything is blooming at once. I have perennial allergies as well so this time of year is double trouble. I went to a couple of stores and got myself a Nettypot and Steam sinus reliever. I already own allergy pills (Xyzal), allergy eye drops, anti-histamine nose spray, and Breath Right strips. I currently take allergy shots but it has only been a year and ≈ 4 months on maintenance so they shouldn't have any effect yet, as my doctor said. I also am taking melatonin this time of year due to horrible sleep quality.

The point is, I did EVERYTHING yesterday. Yes, the steam, the netty, pills, spray... etc. And and AND: it DIDN'T WORK???? Like I layed in my bed and after 5 minutes all the sinus and nose congestion was back!! I was expecting something like this but not this bad! I have already come to the realization that allergy pills and nose spray are placeboes haha ( I know your secrets Big Med :\] ), but I really didn't think that none of this would work at all! At least the netty pot got a lot of clear snot out (I guess this means it's from the sinuses?), even if it was to return not 5 minutes later.

At 2 in the morning, nose stuffed to high heaven, I was led to this subreddit. I needed help. I found lots of advice that suggested **prevention** as the best method of relieving allergies, the logic being, that if there isn't any allergen, there isn't any reaction. Ok great, but the real problem is, how would I go about doing this? I'll pretty much do anything at this point, as this is my last line of hope.

Everything would be dandy if I just had one or two allergies, as a certain Koopa once said, ""It would be so awesome, it would be so cool."" This is not the case for me. I am pretty much allergic to everything under the sun (and under the roof) at this point. Local trees, all grasses, pollen, horses, dust, mold, pretty much everything non-food except dogs and cats, which is a real fluke. If I had the list from the doctor it would be about 20/30 of the allergens they tested me for that came out positive.

So with all these allergies, how would I escape even some of them? What do I need to do to survive this Spring without developing sleep apnea? Are there any articles or videos I should look at, that will help me ward off allergens? Thanks for any help! Also thanks for coming to my Ted-Talk!

&#x200B;

P.S.: To clear up any confusion, I am a teenager, thus I face big problems mouthbreathing; underdeveloped chin, bad sleep quality, chronic drowsiness... If I could live without these problems that would be very nice. Also the reason I am not taking corticosteroids, sino anti-histamine nose spray, is because I don't want my growth to be stunted, which is a generally accepted side affect for those medications.

P.S.S.: I think it's so funny that I spent more effort on this than any essay I ever wrote in English class.",0

I have ALOT of allergies tips on travel abroad?,"SO I’m anaphylactic to Eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, poppy seeds, shellfish, and latex. (And more but nothing that will cause death) long list I know! I just returned to Canada after travelling Europe a month, things weren’t super easy. Lots of lunch meat, fruit and pre packaged foods to keep me living but I got by! After returning I realized it is actually possible and not as difficult as expected to travel to foreign countries outside of North America. I’ve had a life long dream of touring countries in Asia, South America and Africa but I’m aware the food labels and accommodations can be quite different. Any tips or recommendations for travelling to countries where food labels aren’t as strict as Eastern Europe and North America so that I can get by without having access to a kitchen? I don’t plan on eating at restaurants in most of these locations as with the language barrier the risk is much higher and precautions aren’t taken as seriously. 

I’d really hope to find a way to make these trips possible so if anyone has been in a similar situation I’d really love some input!",0
Mold or inconsistent food allergy?,"I (M25) just had my fourth allergic reaction this last Sunday. Me and some friends were at a Mexican restaurant a couple of states away to see some other friends and suddenly out of nowhere, I got extremely red all over my face & chest, some hives on my chest, and breathing started to become more difficult than normal (I'd say 50% more difficult). My previous reactions weren't nearly as possibly life threatening as this one, so i never really paid too much mind to it, but this was sort of a wake up call so I now have an allergist appointment to finally find out what I'm allergic to.

The main thing I'm curious about is what I should avoid in the meantime. The allergic reactions have been extremely inconsistent with each other and I wouldn't know where to begin on what it is besides a possible mold. Anyone have any good guess till my allergist appointment?  


**First reaction** (Family friend's house for a party)

* Face became red and puffy
* Breathing required way more effort, but was still possible and easy to do
* ""Lightening strikes"" looking rashes on my skin coming from my throat to my chest
* Was drinking Bacardi (which I've had plenty of times before and after without a reaction) from a liquor tap

**Second Reaction** (Different friend's house)

* Woke up with hives ALL OVER my body (had to have been at least a dozen of them)
* Hives were extremely itchy
* Felt hot and sweaty
* Absolutely no trouble breathing
* Went to ER thinking they were spider bites, got told they were hives from something internal I ate or breathed

**Third Reaction** (Driving home from retail job)

* Breathing suddenly became extremely difficult to do halfway home (15 minutes into a 30 minute drive)
* Was not eating or drinking anything in the car
* stopped at a gas station to get benadryl, clerk let me take it and relax before having to pay because apparently I just looked that bad
* 30 minutes went by and I started feeling fine

**Fourth Reaction** (Mexican Restaurant)

* Friend said I don't look too good, then breathing started to become more difficult than usual
* Face was completely red and a little puffy
* Took a benadryl and felt better in thirty minutes
* I recall drinking a coronarita, eating tacos (with beef, sour cream, refried beans, cheese, pico de gallo) and that's it

Any suggestions on things to avoid until my allergist appointment? It seems breathing has become more difficult each time it has happened so I'm trying to think of what to avoid until then.",0

So then I am sleeping on pillowcases needing to be washed, which couldn't be good for allergies either. lol.

I wonder if my washing machine is just not rinsing well enough or if I need to try to find yet another detergent...

I just found out I have a new stupid allergy - my sunscreen,"I have so many allergies. Not any food allergies that I know of, but all just stuff you can breath in or that can get on your skin like all the dust, pollen, dander, bugs, etc. Well, I solved the mystery of my itchy, hivey neck rash I had over the summer. I reapplied sunscreen around my neck again for the first time since last summer, and the rash came back. It's probably a good thing cause I'd been planning to upgrade my sunscreen to a more eco friendly reef safe sunscreen anyway. I learned that metal based sunscreen with absolute bare minimum ingredients are the most hypoallergenic on the skin. I may also start wearing a buff or bandana or something for my neck.

One thing I find especially awful about this rash is the type of itch is causes. I get this red hivey rash, but the itch is like a phantom itch that I can't quite pinpoint, and scratching brings no relief. Very strange. I don't have any remedies for it. I tried calomine lotion but it doesn't do anything. Any suggestions for topical treatment for allergy rash?",0

For the last 7 weeks my eyes are constantly swollen, watery, bright red and weepy. I have seen three doctors who all concur it's allergies. I take daily allergy meds, steroidal nasal spray, I use prescription eye drops and regular dry eye drops...cold compresses don't do much, I can't wear my contacts and some days it's so bad I can't even see to drive. It's 100x worse when it's sunny. If it's really bright I have a hard time keeping my eyes open. And even on ""good"" days, my vision is so blurry I can hardly see. (Right eye is worse.)

Itchy skin success cutting out fragranced soaps,"So for a number of years I've had really random itches that jump all over my body, never lasting more than a couple of minutes, never really causing a rash or anything. One minute I'll be insanely itchy on the ankle and then the next minute I'm itchy on some random spot on my back for a second. Then it jumps to my hand and my face and back to my leg again. I could never understand how to even approach this because it wasn't like eczema or anything, where someone gets itchy somewhere in particular and it comes with a rash or hives or anything. 

I also do have a bit of hayfever and sinus problems, and I do get hives from a number of insects and things, so I figured I was just a bit allergic to life.

Anyway recently it got really bad, to the point where anywhere I'd shaved days prior was suddenly freaking out itching, and I was literally crying from how itchy my legs and everything were. 

I decided to finally try cutting out things that might trigger it, so I went and got some soap-free bar soap and body wash made for sensitive skin. The stuff with no fragrances etc etc. I also stopped using any body lotions that have fragrance in them. I'm just using a boring sorbolene cream for sensitive skin on my body. 

And LO AND BEHOLD I haven't been this not-itchy in years?!?! It's been two months now and I am having the most relaxing time of my life in terms of calm skin.

I just wanted to share this in case it helps others. If you suffer with itchy skin, try the things - actually try cutting normal soaps and stuff out for a bit. 

I feel really stupid for not having tried this earlier but I think I'm just so used to nothing ever working for my medical issues that I just didn't even consider that the most basic thing might work. ""Learned helplessness"" as they call it. Also because it wasn't like a rash so I didn't realise it could be allergy based 🙃",0
Kenalog-40 and side effects,"Hello,

I’ve been experiencing seasonal allergies for the first time this summer season, which initially started with Eustachian tube dysfunction about 4 weeks ago and subsequently progressed on to possibly the worst cough and nasal congestion of my life over the past couple days. It got to the extent that I could barely sleep because I was coughing up a lung every 5 minutes - and so I went in to an urgent care today, where the doctor promptly diagnosed me with allergic rhinitis and suggested I get a Kenalog-40 shot since it’d give me allergy relief for a long period of time. I agreed and got it, but I’m also a huge hypochondriac and made the mistake of looking up side effects and am now freaking out about how people have claimed to have gotten depression, anxiety and insomnia (not to mention weight gain) after the administration of Kenalog and it’s honestly freaking me out because they’ve also claimed some side effects to be “permanent”. Has anyone who’s taken Kenalog had side effects as adverse as these, or has it been relatively normal/nothing at all? Thank you!

Current washing/drying machines causing terrible allergies with my bedding,"I have cat allergies and two cats. At my previous home, I used the same washer and dryer for all my household clothes, bedding and towels with no issues.

I’ve had seasonal allergies forever. I’ve been on a rough anxiety journey over the past couple years after having a baby. My new fear is anaphylaxis. I have no food or drug allergies, just pollen/dust.

I literally just cannot sleep because when I lay down my throat gets even more dry and makes me cough, which is like some loop of keeping my throat sore. Occasionally I can clear my deep in my throat, but it’s not like phlegm. 


My doctor gave me Singulaire/Montelukast, but I was trying to avoid taking it….just seems extreme for a first crack at my symptoms. May finally give in tonight.",0

Seasonal allergies causing nausea?,"From what I read they don't really go hand and hand. But that makes little sense to me. I feel like my seasonal allergies are very bad this year and are making me nauseous all the time. Day and night.

Does this happen with anyone else?

The best way I can describe the feeling (sorry for sounding gross) is like some of my postnasal drip is being ingested and not sitting well in my stomach causing nausea. It could also just all be in my head because of the taste of mucus is annoying me. Sometimes I'll start coughing to much and I'll get sick and end up puking. Could be something else besides allergies and just congestion related even though I do not feel very congested all the time?",0
Post Nasal Drip for over 3 months,"Had a nasal drip for over 3 months now and it's driving me absolutely insane. Initially had a really sore throat for 3 days from what I assume was a viral infection which cleared, then had a nasal drip which I figured would've cleared after a week or so like the previous colds I've had however 12+ weeks later it's still as strong as ever. It's disrupting my sleep as I'm continually sleeping with my mouth open and wake up with an incredibly dry mouth and crusty lips so I'm continually tired or under the weather.

So far I've had two repeats of anti-biotics, oregano oil capsules, d3, vitamin c, nasal sprays, salt water, steam inhalation aside from some short term relief, nothing has done much. I'm typically very allergy free and healthy, aside from the occasional hay fever and I've certainly never had anything last this long and I'm at a loss as to what's causing it. Have booked in to see an ENT specialist though that is still a few months off.

My diet probably isn't the best right now and I'm a little overweight but certainly excessively, that probably isn't helping but I can't see that it would be a major issue that would be causing it to be chronic. I typically have recovered from illness pretty quickly and fortunately have very rarely get sick.

Would appreciate any recommendations and personal stories of how it was cleared, have read comments about how people have had it for years and that sounds absolutely terrifying so hoping there is some positive news out there.",0

What do you take for sleep?,"I have seasonal allergies that are present for most of the year.
The worst symptom I get that harms my day to day life, is messed up sleep.
I essentially get so congested at night time, that I can’t sleep throughout the night. 
This leads to severe sleep deprivation that harms my mood, my mental clarity, work performance, gym performance, and overall health.

I’ve tried reactine, Claritin, NAC, Sudafed,you name it.
The ONLY thing that’s works is Benadryl.
When I take Benadryl I actually sleep throughout the night.
The only catch is that if I take Benadryl every night, after a few days, I have this hangover brain fog affect, that’s harmful. Benadryl is also bad for longterm brain health as it’s neurotoxic.

Now I noticed if I pair this stuff with NAC, the brain fog reduces drastically, but this stuff is still not good to take every night.

What is a supplement or over the counter allergy med, or even holistic herb that I can take every single night, that will destroy my night time congestion and allow me to sleep throughout the night?",0

Contact dermatitis to everything,"Im a male, mid 20s, and my issue started after using a steroid antifungal cream for my privates around 6 months ago.

Ever since using this my skin has been dry, if any fluids touch it other than water it reacts by turning red and having a hot/burning/flush feeling in this area. Ultrasensitive moisturisers , vaseline, anything causes this even urine but this has seemed to subsided. Friction also seems to be problematic.

Drs have so far treated me for fungal, bacterial and even stds (negative) but they just dont seem to listen when i voice my opinion on potential damaged skin barrier or contact dermatitis.

As you can imagine this is very mentally challenging and i hope this will be solved soon.

Thinking about getting the sofa steam cleaned by professionals,"starting this year, I started to show dog allergy. every time I make direct or indirect contact with my dog, my skin starts to itch with red bumps.

as a last resort, I am planning to hire someone to steam clean them. For 1 L-shape sectional sofa with 2 individual sofa chairs = $500. it is a lot of money and so before I make any final decision, did anyone try steam cleaning to get rid of allergies? did it  work?",0

Sick of these bad allergy days,"Seeking sympathy more than advice at the moment...I have chronic allergies with runny/stuffy nose, sneezing, and sometimes a sore throat or itchy eyes or ears. On my doctor's advice I take a double dose of cetirizine daily as well as a dose of singulair, and the singulair has made a difference, but recently I still keep having days where my symptoms get bad and I have to take benadryl. And then sometimes there's a day where even the benadryl does nothing and I'm just stuck like this, clutching a tissue to my face to relieve the itching and catch the drips. I'm using up my sick time at work on this, and having to cancel social plans...it's the worst. Just wondering if anyone can commiserate because sometimes I feel alone with this problem.

I just finished “Coraline” by Neil Gaiman,"For those who haven’t read it, it is a brief and short novel about a young girl named Coraline. She finds a door in her house that is bricked off, and when she finds that door with the bricks mysteriously gone, she goes through to the other side. What she finds is an alternate version of her home, but one that is eerily perfect and has alternate copies of her parents that are too eager to have her stay there. Coraline leaves, but she finds that the other mother has kidnapped her real parents, so Coraline goes back into the alternate world to save them. 

I’ve read a few Neil Gaiman books now, but this is the first one that I’ve read that wasn’t targeted towards adults. It’s a little strange how his writing didn’t feel less mature; it instead felt similar to his other novels, but much more brief and skimping on details he would have otherwise included. It’s also baffling that he wrote this at the same time as *American Gods* (which I’m in the middle of as well), because that and *Coraline* couldn’t be further apart in tone and content. I really enjoyed this book, and I’d recommend it to those who are interested in it with the caveat that it is aimed at younger audiences.

I have some thoughts regarding it, and Neil’s writing in general:
- *Coraline* feels very similar to *The Ocean at the End of the Lane.* They both share a quality that I can’t quite put my finger on, but it’s almost like *The Ocean at the End of the Lane* was written to be a similar story for adult audiences. One to read when you’re young, the other to read when you’re reminiscing on being young.
- I have a tendency to envision (male) talking animals to sound like Keith David, so when I found out the cat was voiced by Keith David in the movie adaptation, I actually laughed. 10/10 casting. 
- Much like *The Hobbit,* I wish I actually read this as a child. That being said, I can’t wait to give either this book or *The Hobbit* to my future children and experience that childhood wonder through them. 
- This is one of the few books that I’ve read in a single day. It’s a great detox book when you need a day to take a break from your other books/hobbies.",0
"People who read the same book annually/Bi annually, why?","I (34F) personally read Dracula once a year and have done now since I was 17. My friend (who isn't someone who enjoys reading) noticed I was reading Dracula once again and was absolutely baffled at the idea of re reading books. She understood the idea of it being my favourite book but couldnt see the point after 2nd maybe 3rd time as you know the story fully. I tried to explain that its more  that just my favourite story but that I almost use it as a measuring stick for personal growth year to year. 
I find this book to be so layered and complex that each year I come away having noticed something I hadn't before  or taken a different interpretation of certain symbolism. In the early years it was ever things as simple as learning new vocabulary.  

So my question to you what book do you re read and why?",0
What makes you decide to listen to an audiobook versus reading the book?,"I have recently rediscovered my love of reading and have been doing so with the written word. I’ve listened to a very few non-fiction audiobooks, but I’ve heard such great things about some fiction audio, that I’m interested in expanding into fiction audiobooks. My struggle is that I really love reading the written word, so I don’t know how to decide whether I read a book or listen to it.

How do you decide to listen to an audiobook versus reading it with your eyes?  What goes into your decision-making process, if anything?

"I regret reading ""An Arrow's Flight""","Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, very well written, and in some respect I think you're not supposed to \*like\* it. It's a story about the AIDS crisis, basically, but with characters from Greek Mythology (Achilles' son, Pyrrhus, is the protagonist).

Reading this book was like having a friend commiting suicide in front of you in slow motion. There are some scenes and passages that still haunt me around despite having finished reading the book a couple of weeks ago.

I have never regretted reading a book until now. I wish I could just erase it from my memory. And yet... despite the fantastical elements, this is something that happened to a lot of people. As a young queer that didn't live through this crisis, I'm glad I read it despite being so painful, I'm thankful that it allowed me to see and connect with that suffering.

I'm not sure what to do with these feelings.",0
Artemis by Andy Weir.,"Another astounding space sci-fi thriller by Weir. Surprising that this hasn’t been made into a movie because this is what an action/comedy/thriller space sci-fi needs. This book keeps you hooked for the most part. Why most parts? Well because some parts are just Jasmine “Jazz” Bashara the protagonist prolonging a normal convo. It’s not bad though just my opinion. Really liked how Weir portrays her; a woman who is happy go lucky and doesn’t give a fuck about almost anything and also funny.

This book does contain many space/moon tech technicalities which you have to reread to grasp it. Like “The Martian” (another must read by Weir) this books deals with the cruciality of time. I think this book’s climax could be made into like an Ocean’s Eleven kind of movie replacing the casino scenes with >!Jazz and her team trying to destroy the Sanchez Aluminum.!<

Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton,"After finishing Sphere, Andromeda Strain was highly recommended to me as my next Crichton read. I just finished it and…well, I was underwhelmed.

The premise is amazing and though I didn’t connect with any of the characters, i found them all effective for the plot and fine enough. My issue was >!the book just kind of ended. Like, things are moving along and scientists are underground dealing with a deadly organism from space only to have it mutate to eat rubber instead and hey everything is okay now!!<

After the ending in Sphere, the ending in Strain really fell flat for me. I also felt the book broke off into science discussion and history far too often.

Just Finished Parable of The Talents by Octavia Butler and just wanna talk about it,"Trigger Warning: SA 

This book was SO good. Probably one of the rare times I prefer the sequel to tue first book. Firstly (and big old spoiler warning) Fuck Uncle Marc. All my homes hate Uncle Marc. What a conniving, back stabbing little piece of shit he turned out to be. Maybe it's because I have a young kid but I was so SO angry that he kept her child from her and all for himself because he couldn't admit the people he was with were a bunch of animals. What a self righteous piece if shit. ""I guess I just wasn't ready to share you with anyone"". I hope he suffers. I wish bad and painful things on him. The author absolutely NAILS Zealots as a group of monsters who see themselves as good people akd it makes me furious and scared at tue same time. I truly loved how introducing her daughter as someone READING the journal were given a more objective view of the main character. And I sort of agree with her daughter, Olaminas main goal should've always been to go after her daughter and Olamina IS a manipulator who uses her super empathy to better get inside people's heads. In an interesting way, the MC doesn't see anything wrong with what's she's doing. And I guess she never uses this power for evil but she is absolutely using it to control and enthrall people. She's dangerous. In an interesting way, I don't think she ever sees anything of her own absolute faith that she's doing the right thing (cause it's for the destiny) reflected back at her by her Christian captors, or even Marc. The ending was bittersweet, but overall hopeful which was nice! Overall 9/10, it's worth it to read the first one just to get to the second one.

Quick edit to say that I also loved how she never used the word Teacher for her captors, always ""Teacher"" with quotes. Like she never gives them the satisfaction of the title.",0
Why do people want to read fast?,"I was just thinking the other day that my wpm is average, sometimes below average. If I do want to try and read fast I can get to 308 wpm. But there’s people out here who read naturally or strive to read at like 300-400 wpm which is too fast for me. 

Like, I read in a way where the rhythm of the book is important to me. I purposefully read sometimes below average because I want to- need to add a certain tone or cadence to something in order for the book to make an impact on me. 

For fast readers, I just want to know why you read fast? Are you able to get the same results out of a book when you don’t take longer to think about tone or rhythm? Or are you able to still do that? Is it just about training your mind?

Edit: the replies may have just affirmed that I probably have a learning disability. Been needing to get that sorted out as a kid so thanks guys.",0
So I just read Song of Achilles for the first time,"I know, I'm like super late to it. I always meant to read it but my tbr list has been incredibly long for multiple years now.

Anyways, about the actual book. I am INCREDIBLY unwell. Like, I've been processing it for about 12 hours now and the sad feeling in my chest keeps getting worse as more time passes. I knew Greek mythology so I knew how it would end, but oh my god it hurt so much more than I thought it would. Seeing the relationship between Patroclus and Achilles evolve over however many years they knew each other was absolutely incredible and the ending successfully ripped my heart right out of my chest. The worst part for me was how Patroclus was kept from the underworld and separated from Achilles for so long. I can't even begin to imagine how painful that situation could be. As gut wrenching as it was, though, it's seriously one of my favorite books that I've ever read. Their entire story was perfect imo. All the tender, passionate moments as well as the few times they fought or disagreed over an issue. I don't normally cry because of books or movies, but I was basically sobbing while reading the last couple chapters. I honestly think this book has completely changed my brain chemistry and I am in love with it. I probably won't ever fully emotionally recover, but honestly I don't think I want to. 

Overall I think Madeline Miller did an amazing job at telling the beautiful story of Achilles and Patroclus. I would love to share these thoughts with someone I know in real life but sadly my one friend who's actually read it does not like Miller's writing style so she didn't really the book.",0
Is reading an active or passive activity?,"I've been reading for a few years now and I have talked with lots of people about this and there seems to be different opinions on the topic.

For me, reading is a very active activity, I have to be mentally prepared and ready to catch all the information given by the author. Maybe its because I usually read 800-1000 pages epic fantasy which generally has lots of information and the world building is quite complex, but in my experience reading is not something I can do at any time of the day. In addition to this, I'm usually not able to read more than 1h straight because I literally get so tired from it. I don't understand how some people can read for +5 hours without a pause.

What I've been able to recollect from others opinions is that for them reading is something to disconnect, something that they can do when they are tired and not having to think too much. For me it's quite the contraty.

Diary of an Oxygen Thief,"If you’ve read diary of an oxygen thief please let me know what you think of it !

Caroline in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,"How exactly does Poirot hope to spare Caroline Sheppard the pain of finding out that her own brother (Dr James Sheppard) was the murderer? Poirot prevented Caroline from attending the final gathering of suspects, and he offered Dr Sheppard the option to take his own life, which Sheppard says will ensure that Caroline does not find out the truth. 

But presumably Poirot will tell the other suspects (Ackroyd's household) who the real killer was, or they will figure it out by process of elimination when they see that none of them is accused. Given Caroline's fondness for gossip, she is sure to find out the truth from someone in the village, not to mention grow extremely suspicious when her brother commits suicide the very next day without telling her what happened at Poirot's gathering!",0
Suicide Notes by Michael Thomas Ford.,"Where do I even begin?

I can't get myself to talk about this book. I've tried formulating a coherent opinion on this but I won't even bother. I can't. Instead, I'll present you with a few excerpts from this book and let you decide for yourself.

As of April 28, 2023; there are 2,117 people reading this, 92.5k people who want to read this, and 38,772 who have; on Goodreads. I couldn't have been older than fourteen when I first read this book, even then, all I could think about after finishing this is how I will never get back the time I spent on this.

I was so disappointed. This was such a good concept, such wasted potential. The characters are just plot devices, they serve no other purpose than push the plot forward. The sludge must go on. Every single person in this book is just a cardboard cutout, there's no real depth to any of them. All the dialogue is on the nose, the author seems to know no subtlety, except for one particular scene which I admit was actually sort of emotional, but of course it fell apart the minute it started getting somewhere. The author's knowledge on mental illnesses, therapists and psych wards seems to be limited to movies and tv shows.

The protagonist tries so hard to be witty and it's really overdone in the first half, and the second half (I'll get to it later) totally abandons this persona, only vestiges left from this snarky and sarcastic self that he shows in the beginning.

The book features the characters making fun of a girl who had 'snapped' and mocking her for it, the protagonist going as far as asking the doctor if the girl has contracted a virus. This is justified by 'maybe that’s how nutcases handle things like that.'

Jeff has the maturity of a paper straw. Half the time I was reading the book I was wondering if he had actually slit his wrists or if it was someone else's deed. He doesn't seem like a person who tried to take his life. The very next day of attempting suicide, he goes to call his doctor 'cat poop'. He also refers to him by this when discussing sexual assault, another suicide in the ward and his own attempt. In fact, one of the only indications of character growth I could discern was him calling his doctor by his actual name. The term 'cat poop' comes up at least 170 times in the book, I had counted it on an e-book but I can't be arsed to waste any more time on this abomination.

Jeff also remarks how he wasn't really affected by looking the scars and didn't mind the blood-stained carpet. Even Sadie, another character who had previously tried to drown herself says how she feels happy when she looks back at her attempt. I'm sorry, this is just ridiculous. I would imagine someone who had attempted suicide would at least feel sad when remembering the event, while our protagonist seems mildly irritated at best and his friend is straight out happy.

Apart from calling the hospital 'nuthouse', or the patients 'whack-jobs' and 'nutcases', the portrayal of the very thing its supposed to be about - mental health - is.. to put it lightly, inaccurate.

Alright I've said enough, let me show you what I mean. I'll write down some of the most iconic quotes from this masterpiece. Here goes:

>""First you have your generic depressives. They’re a dime a dozen and usually really boring. Then you’ve got the bulimics and the anorexics. They’re slightly more interesting, although usually they’re just girls with nothing better to do. Then you start getting into the good stuff: the arsonists, the schizophrenics, the manic-depressives. You can never quite tell what those will do. And then you’ve got the junkies. They’re completely tragic, because chances are they’re just going to go right back on the stuff when they get out of here.""

Girls with nothing better to do. I'm sorry, girls with nothing to do? Generic depressives? Boring?

Another excerpt similar to this:

>“No, she is. She was all into heroin and stuff. I guess she ODed a couple of times.”  
>  
>“Wow,” Sadie said. “I’m actually kind of impressed. I thought for sure she’d be into something really girly, like cutting herself.”

Something really girly. Like cutting herself. Impressed.

>""Afterward I just lay there watching everyone kiss while I died, thinking how cool it was to be on my bedroom floor bleeding while everyone in America celebrated the end of my life and the idiot hosting the countdown smiled his goofy fake smile on the TV like the Angel of Death doing a toothpaste commercial.""

Cool.

>""Cutting myself felt so good. It was sweet the way the razor opened up the skin and this red line appeared, like I was pulling a piece of thread out of my wrist. The blood came really slowly, not in some spastic blast like I thought it would. It didn’t even really feel like my arm. It was like I was watching someone else’s arm in a movie. I kept thinking how great the camera angle was and wishing I had some popcorn.""  
>  
>""That’s when I did the other wrist, and that was even better because I knew—knew what it would feel like, knew what would happen. Man, did it feel good, like slicing open the ribbon on a Christmas present you’ve been staring at under the tree for a month and been dying to open. Then it’s finally time to open it, and you just kind of hold your breath while you rip off the paper, hoping that what’s inside will be what you want it to be. And for once, it was.""

No comment on this one.

>""I tried to get back to sleep, but I couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes I could feel Rankin touching me, feel his breath on my neck and his skin against mine. Why did I do that with him? Why did I let him stay? I don’t know why. But I did, and now I feel like crap. Dirty.""

Alright alright some context here - this Rankin guy sexually harasses him. When he has to come clean about this with his therapist, this is what he had to say:

>“I meant that you’re certain you didn’t encourage Rankin in any way.”

..

Fine, let's move on. Oh great, the friend with whom he almost had sex with had committed suicide the day prior and his therapist discloses that at this very moment, when talking about sexual assault. I'm gonna admit, this scene was probably the most emotional one. He was in denial and couldn't accept it, but it was a drastic shift from his overly 'witty' persona and he forgets about it in a bit anyway.

What Rankin had done wasn't even seen as sexual assault. In fact, he even comes to the conclusion he's gay because he enjoyed having sex with Rankin.

>""After the stuff with Rankin, and what happened—or didn’t happen—with Sadie, though, I know that I won’t get over it. It’s what I am.""

Worst of all, he is justifying it.

>""I had to think about that one. I mean, Rankin’s the one who’s started it every time we’ve done anything. But it’s not like he’s ever forced me to do it, and until last night I’ve never exactly told him not to do what he’s done.""

I really can't get myself to finish this review, there's so much that's wrong with it. The first half of it was okay, then it falls apart. It feels like a completely different book after the first few chapters. This book has all the humor of a dried lettuce. I was disappointed at having spent so much time on this book and if you deem your time worthwhile, take my advice and don't waste your time on this.

I can only imagine a person suffering from some eating disorder reading the thing about them usually being ""girls with nothing better to do"". The way how self harm was portrayed as a girlish thing, or how suicide was romanticized.

What started off as me trying to be unbiased and rational has fallen apart faster than this book's tone. At least I can rest assured my awful review can't be worse than this wretched book. This guy must've left the hospital more traumatized than he ever was when arriving.

As much as I'd love to get all overcritical and pick out every single thing in this book, I've got to drown my bookshelf now. Besides, I don't want to waste any more time on this book anyway.

I haven’t read more than 5 books in my lifetime and they weren’t difficult to read books.

What's with the chapters ""A boy in the night"", who've seen two men doing shaddy bussiness in the garden.
A. I mean who is that little boy... is it Cinnamon ?
B. What's that thing those two men hid in the ground ? And what does it signifies ?

2. 
What's with Nutmeg and for short period of time Toru as well, curing the women whoes in between thirties and fifties ?

3.
What are they (Nutmeg, Cinnamon and Toru) trying to built at vacant house ? Is it just passing some time till Toru really finds his way to go otherside of well ?

4.
Whats the significance of the men who has mark on right cheek and they are the only who can hears the cries of wind-up bird ?
A. Whats does it mean, when it appeared and disappeared on Toru's cheek ?

5. 
What is the wind-up bird anyway ? I have my view for this as well, but would really like to have some other perspective.
A. What's the connection of different character with it ?

6. 
Cinnamon's connection with ending.

7.
What is the deeper symbolism and interpretation of the well and the ""place beyond the well""?

If you are also wanted to discuss something out, lets discuss.",0
How open minded are you when you start reading a book? Are you aware of particular expectations?,"I sometimes try to avoid reading books that have been reviewed exceptionally well or have the ""classic"" designation. It's partly because I become very impatient with these books.

Maybe it started in high school where I was forced to read various books that were considered classics but which I hated. So maybe even as an adult, those memories are shaping my choices. 

It's like a meal that somebody says is the best they've ever had. Or a restaurant they say is among the best. So you go in there and right away think the waiter is taking too long to come to your table, or a particular appetizer does not taste so good, or maybe the prices are way too high. In short, you are quick to feel disappointed.

Of course, I don't want to pick a random book either, because there are like, what, over a million books published every year (just guessing), and I don't want to waste time reading something that is not well-written or is not about a topic that interests me at all.

So what I do is sort of go somewhere in the middle, pick a book that got some positive reviews, and I read to make sure it is a topic of potential interest, then I start reading.

Anyhow, I totally feel like my expectations are ruining my reading experience. I envy people who are so open minded and read widely and give books a chance. I really wish I could one day be like that.",0
Steinbeck's King Arthur and His Noble Knights: Does it get better?,"Hi,

I wanted to read an account of Arthurian myths that is at once relatively brief, that didn't stray much from traditional accounts and that was suitable a ""modern day"" sensibilities; by the latter I mean  mostly that its characters had psychological depth to them, and not two-dimensional cardboardy ones.So I picked up Steinbeck's ***The Acts of King Arthur & his Noble Knights*** because 1) it was an abridged retelling of sir Thomas Malory's ***La morte d'Arthur*** (arguably the ""ultimate"" account of Arthur's life and adventures), 2) it was written by a Nobel Prize winner, so I assumed it would be a carefully and beautifully crafted prose and 3) I was ""promised"" a certain psychological depth by the Wikipedia article on the book.

So far none of my expectations was fulfilled. I've read the entire first part of it and I've found it to be pure exposition, with non-existent character development. Completely unsuitable for a modern day reader. For example >!lady Igraine just accepts the fact that she was raped and impregnated by Uther Pendragon disguised as her husband, while her actual espouse was being killed in battle by her rapists's armies. This was the same woman that urged her husband the duke of Cornwall to flee from Uther's court because she suspected him to lust after her and attempt some sketchy shit. So she was raped, impregnated and a made widow on the same day, and she just marries the perpetrator immediately after, like no big deal. I'm not narratively bothered by all this. This makes no human sense for modern day writers but misogynistic narratives of this kind were the norm and very much taken for granted back in the day. The thing is that, misogyny aside, it doesn't even makes sense for the character of Igraine. Like even if she accepted to marry her rapist and husband murderer, even if she accepted to bear his child, both very plausible in ancient times, why would would she not place any objections or show any reluctance after urging her first husband for both to flee from Uther's lust.!<  Likethat shit is the exact opposite of ""exploring the the psychological underpinning of the events"" that Wikipedia promised me. And I'm not being just ""woke for woke's sake"". I can deal with problematic or outright unethical stuff in fiction, but I would've hope Steinbeck would care to address and attempt to give some insight on her thoughts on the whole thing, if anything just to give consistency to an arguably important character.

Anyway, if the entire book it's gonna be like this, I'd much rather read ***La morte d'Arthur*** or any modern retelling of the Matter of Britain.**So my question is: Does it get better as it goes or will it keep sucking ass?**

I don't mean to offend anybody tastes with this post. I'm just venting and looking for some guidance.Thanks in advance",0
Indications of good classic books on Kindle Unlimited,"From time to time, I end up discovering that a book that I would like to read for some time was already in the Kindle Unlimited catalog. Sometimes, I even end up buying some unnecessarily.

"Has anyone ever successfully trained themselves out of *constantly*, no matter how much they're enjoying the book they're reading, hurrying through the end of a book so that you can get onto the next thing on your reading list?","I read everyday, but since my late teens/early 20s (I'm in my early 30s now) I've almost always, to some extent, 'powered through' the second half of books in order to get to either a) the next one I know I want to read or b) the opportunity to choose from the vast selection of new books that will interest and the backlog of books I mean to read at some point. 

I've theories as to why this is:

\- the awareness, as we get older, that time is limited. 

\- a greater awareness of the endless books and topics out there I'd like to read.

\- less time to read as an adult with adult responsibilites, thus less patience with texts. 

\- Goodreads's 'Reading Goal', something I've used for about a decade out of habit, but not something I feel too consciously beholden too now (in my mid-20s I do remember keeping an eye on it and planning reading accordingly in November and December).

"Gladwell's ""Talking to Strangers""","Reading this book, about halfway through. I know I should finish reading before bringing this up, but I can't help but to get the discussion going. Has anyone else found some of the examples used to defend the oh so prevalent ""default to truth"" theory a little thin? Specifically when talking about transparency and ""The Friends Fallacy"". I do get his point at large but also, couldn't the judge that let the potential murder (man who's gun jammed when trying to shoot his ex girlfriend) not just be that he naively bought a ""remorse"" narrative from defendant's facial expressions, but all sorts of rationalizations rooted in sexism (a women's life not as important as a man's) that could be occurring even subconsciously in that judge's mind. I find it hard to believe also that judges, after decades of experience, could fall so easily for a ""sad, remorseful"" face. I find the examples to be sort of brushing over the inherent sexism that could be at play. I see the angle: this is why we victim blame, because it is human nature to believe that the simple answer is most likely the right answer, and well liked people getting accused of pedophilia is not a simple answer.

"Ridiculous vocabulary in The Netanyahus, by Joshua Cohen","I just finished reading this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.

This post isn't really about the book in general, but about its vocabulary. I've noticed this same issue in many books I've read, where it feels as though the writer is trying to make a point by using really obscure words, but that point is completely lost on me.

In this case, the story is in first-person, so are we supposed to assume that the narrator is ... stuffy? Learned? Intellectual? Showy?

It's really not clear, because aside from those crazy words, he's not really any of those things. He's a professor of history at a middling university, but in his conversations, he seems like a normal, slightly self-effacing guy. He sort of calls out another character for using words like peripety and climacteric.

But then, the narrative leaves that behind, and hits us with tons of words just like that.

So what's the point? Maybe we're just supposed to think that the author is smart?

I contrast this to books like Lolita, or The Debt to Pleasure (both of which I loved) where the high vocabulary and style is perfectly suited to, and compliments, the character that we're learning about.

Here are some of the words I mean:

Cathexes, strappado, carceral, horripilation, pentimento, sudorific, pelage, pontonier \[EDIT: It was actually ""ponton"" as in: the car was ponton\], capirote, hyemal,  lucubration...

And then there were some that I knew (or kinda knew), but still classify them as difficult words: caudillo, nugatory, gloriole.

Lastly, he used some words in a weird way, so that I looked them up just to see if there was a definition that I was missing. Unfortunately, though I remember one was ""menial,"" I can't remember the context.

Anyone else read this book and felt the way I feel?

EDIT: ""logopoeic, propaedeutic, patriotic sentiments were emanating from her....""",0
I read all 190 Hardy Boys books,"See title, during the pandemic because I was bored and they're really easy to read. 

It took me about a year and a half, I think, mostly because I took a few long breaks when it started to get stale.

A few highlights: #1 The Tower Treasure, #3 The Secret Of The Old Mill,  and #11 While The Clock Ticked are probably my favorites out of the lot. Honorable mentions to #94 Breakdown In Axeblade and #99 Dungeon of Doom if only because they were *very* different.

The worst of the bunch was #59 Night of The Werewolf in my opinion, and that one still had some redeeming qualities but it's where the quality started to take a dip. Most of the rest of the bad ones don't really stick out because they were more dull than anything.

Edit because I forgot: Would I recommend you do this? No, unless you really enjoy reading generally lifht-hearted kids mystery novels or want to see how the series developed over the years.",0
2nd hand bookstores,"I will continue to sing their praises for so many reasons. 

1.  You can't beat the price.  I just placed an order for 11 books and only paid 80 dollars.  (And it was only that cost because I did pick up a book for 20 bucks). 

2. Although selection is generally slim you can almost always find books that your local store doesn't have (Ulysses and The plague are two that I can't find anywhere in my region). 

I personally use thriftbooks and is the reason why reading has become a hobby of mine.  I know that most other countries have their variation of this and like the idea of reading becoming more accessible to a wider audience (because not everyone can pay between 15-30 dollars a book).",0

I hate buddy reading with my friend and I don't know how to tell her (a mini rant),"I met my friend online a little over two years ago and we bonded over our love of books. She strictly only reads fantasy and smut. I like to read really anything and don't care too much for romance/smut. I like it but it's definitely not something I absolutely NEED to have in a book. Over these last few years, she has recommended me books that she likes that ended up just being really bad, poorly written fanfic type of books. I'm just not into that and that's totally fine that she is. She's gotten offended when I've said I didn't enjoy them or I just stopped reading them. I'm also realizing as I write this that we never read anything I'm interested in but like I said, she's strictly fantasy romance. 

Anyway, we started reading a big fantasy series recently and I love the series itself. I just don't really like reading it WITH her and I feel like shit for it. Here's why: 

- I think I just don't like the pressure of buddy reads. I don't like the pressure of slowing down or speeding up to be at the same point in the story with her.
- Spoilers actually ruin things for me whereas she doesn't care about spoilers and will kinda taunt me with what she knows.. idk I just think it's kind of weird?
- If she is ahead of me in the story, she will 100% spoil what I haven't read yet.
- So there goes that pressure of having to speed up my reading so that I'm sure she won't spoil anything for me in the future 
- When I don't feel like reading for one day, she gets annoyed and again, pressures me into reading faster and it gets to the point where reading just isn't fun for me anymore 
- There's also big, interesting things happening in the books but she never talks about them with me. She only really focuses on the romance and spice and tension (which is like 5% in this series) and thinks the rest (95%) is boring so ????

I've told her many times to not spoil things for me. I've also told her how I don't read 300+ pages a day like it's a normal thing. Sometimes it's 100, sometimes it's 10.. i don't know... I've tried getting her into the main plot and she just doesn't care what I have to say which is fine if you're not into it but like why do I have to listen to you scream about the way this man looks at the girl??

I don't think buddy reads are for me. I like to read books on my own, at my own pace and when I'm finished, I like going online to discuss with other people. I thought that since we both liked the first series she introduced me to that this would be fun but it actually kinda sucks. I don't really know what else to tell her. I think she'd be very mad and hurt if I just suddenly said in the middle of this series that I don't want to read with her anymore. I don't know if I should tell her that I just don't want to read anymore (even though I love the series) or just finish it and probably never read with her again lol. What would YOU do? 

I'm also very aware of how small and stupid this ""problem"" is... kinda just wanted a place to rant lol so thanks if you read all the way through :)

TL;DR: I don't enjoy reading with my friend anymore, she spoils a lot for me, doesn't want to talk about the book, I feel pressured to read faster or slower to keep up with her, I don't know if I should tell her or keep going until it's done.",0
I finished Sleepers by Lorenzo Carcaterra,"I get why this book was so contentious when it first came out now. 

Stylistically speaking, it has a lot of passages that read like a novel, not an autobiography. Like, nobody's remembering conversations where they were just shooting the breeze for a bit verbatim after thirty years. At other times, he's using the one-sentence paragraphs for extra impact, which tends to be more common in novels than in nonfiction. 

Of course, most of the controversy stems from how a lot of the details surrounding the court case have never been verified, despite the fact they should have been easily verifiable. A case where someone who used to be a guard at a juvenile detention centre gets murdered by two people who'd been detained there should have been big news; especially when he posthumously gets outed as a pedophile over the course of the trial. 

I feel like with a lot of the people who first started digging into it, what actually set them off was probably the writing style. So much of it just reads like a novel, and so much of Part III came off as something straight out of a revenge fantasy that it just seems a bit off. 

I really wanted to believe this story was true, too. Of course I think abuse happens in juvenile detention centres, and I think it's an issue that's probably massively underreported. But after almost thirty years, you'd expect for there to be a bit more than Lorenzo Carcaterra's say-so that his story is true; especially when a lot of it involved conspiracies and multiple victims.",0
"I read ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" today and it was incredible!","Today I was going through a book fair and noticed a book of two F. Scott Fitzgerald short stories, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""Head and Shoulders"". I was taken aback because I had heard of (but not seen) the film and did not know Fitzgerald was behind the story that inspired it. I read it in an hour while on the bus back home and actually was on the verge of tears by the time it was all over - not so much because it was a tragic story, but because of how how unbelievably human it all felt, and how human *it made me feel*.

It is one of those pieces of art that just captures our permanent struggle to understand the limited time we have here - and the even more limited time of our youths. Above all, and this may sound weird, it felt to me like a work that could only have ever been made by us, by our briefly-lived little species. It has so many themes that are expressed so subtly and beautifully (from the inevitability of age and death to the incapability of others to accept reality when faced with a break in normalcy) that I honestly think it summarises so many of my anxieties about life incredibly well. 

The progression of Button first hanging out with his grandfather (two old men, despite one having just been born), then with his father (people think they're brothers at one point), then with his grandson as a kid, and ending up all alone in kindergarten forgetting everything he ever did as the only kids who know him grow up normally and move to other grades, may be one of the most brutal things ever put to paper.",0
Neil Gaiman - is he done?,"Seems like every time I go to my local shops, they've devoutly stocked almost all of Neil Gaiman's novels but there's never anything new, just endless reprints of his back catalogue with new covers. He's does seem like the go-to guy for book intros and cover blurbs- him and Stephen King- but King is consistently putting out new and generally interesting stuff. I see no such evolution with Gaiman. I know he's got a huge and loyal following, I was one of them for awhile, but it's odd to me how his output drops off around 2017-2018. I would totally check out a new NG adult novel but seems like that ship has sailed, hit an iceberg and sunk. And the reprints and adaptations are fine, they'll always be new for someone, but I can't align the god-like esteem he's still held to with a lack of new published work. Thoughts? Not aiming to be antagonistic, I respect and admire his work. I'm just surprised there haven't been new novels or short stories published in recent years.",0
"What are your favorites books that really speak to your senses? For example, they draw a vivid picture of a dance, describe food in mouth-watering details, or bring to life the sensations of those first touches of a budding romance?","I enjoy reading books that really speak to my senses. Partly because I'm kind of always in my head, so books that make me aware of sensations allow me to leave my head and go into my body and explore it a little more in terms of my bodily memories or sensations or desires.

One example is the book Chocolat by Joanne Harris, which I read after I saw the movie (with Binoche and Depp).

Here's a quote from the book, just to give you an idea of what I mean:

>In glass bells and dishes lie the chocolates, the pralines, Venus’s nipples, truffles, mendiants, candied fruits, hazelnut clusters, chocolate seashells, candied rose-petals, sugared violets . . . Protected from the sun by the half-blind which shields them, they gleam darkly, like sunken treasure, Aladdin’s cave of sweet clichés. And in the middle she has built a magnificent centrepiece. A gingerbread house, walls of chocolate-coated pain d’épices with the detail piped on in silver and gold icing, roof tiles of florentines studded with crystallized fruits, strange vines of icing and chocolate growing up the walls, marzipan birds singing in chocolate trees . . .

I had a description from another book that was really just mouth-watering, making me want to run to the kitchen and make brownies and cakes, but unfortunately can't find it.

Blackwater saga by Michael McDowell,"Anyone who'd like to talk about the Blackwater saga by Michael McDowell?

Authorial whiplash from McCarthy to Sanderson,"Has anyone else experienced serious whiplash when moving from one author to another?

Earlier this week I finished Blood Meridian by McCarthy and as much as I enjoyed the book I felt I needed something lighter afterwards. Going through my to-read collection, I chose Oathbringer by Brandon Sanderson knowing it'd be lighter in tone and an easier read.

What I didn't expect was the shift between authors to be so impactful. It's almost unpleasant.

Prose between authors is an obvious difference. I struggled getting into Blood Meridian because of McCarthy's writing style. A lot of information is conveyed in very few words while artful descriptions paint the journey of the kid. Returning to Sanderson has been easy because his style is so direct and conventional. Sanderson takes his time to explore character feelings and remind readers of previous moments. What Sanderson spends three pages holding our hand through, McCarthy throws down with a single paragraph and expects us to clean it up.

I'm not saying either author has a better style of story telling. But jumping from one to the other makes apparent the different writing styles. I'm almost bored reading Oathbringer because it takes Sanderson so long to reach the point.

However, it's the approach to violence from both authors that's really affected me. 

McCarthy's depiction of violence is sickening. It's vivid, horrible, upsetting, unrelenting, and overwhelming at times. When the kid witnesses someone being clubbed in the head, the reader is going to experience what it's like to see someone being brained. Meanwhile Sanderson depicts violence as a morally bad, but an ultimately dismissible aspect of life for his characters. Early in Oathbringer one of Dalinar's chapters features him cutting his way through an army. Dalinar just slices and dices the enemy without a care. Soldiers are dying left and right but that's the extent of all we hear. He then wipes his sword of blood and quips to himself before carrying onto the next plot point.

Going from a brutal description of someone being maimed to a handwavey ""and he defeated the whole  army not wearing armour because he's so cool, you guys"" has really caught me off guard. It's almost like violence is trivialised now, whereas before it was reveled.

These novels are completely different. They have different levels of engagement aimed at vastly different audiences. But jumping from one to the other has really caused me to think about different writing approaches. We're not comparing apples and oranges; we're comparing apples and chicken nuggets.

Has anyone else experienced this? What authors gave you whiplash when jumping between the two?",0

Has anyone here heard of Martin Middleton?,"He's a fantasy author from the 1990s era (when I found the first book of Circle of Light in '05, it was already well out of print).

I never see anyone mention him, and wonder if people actually know of him, or if he's one of those guys that never really took off. I see the first couple of books of the 6-book series in 2nd hand bookstores all the time, but rarely do I see the others. 

Anyway, have you heard of him?

A little about the books:

*A magical kingdom is threatened with ruin unless a long lost prince sold into slavery years before - can return to claim his throne. Four soldiers embark on an epic journey to find the prince and save the realm. They are joined by Teal, a young bondservant who has a hidden destiny.*

There's magic rings with powers, a unifying destiny, and the very definition of sword-and-sorcery magic. I feel he's very underrated and underappreciated, and would like to share some love. 

I love the fact it's like Lord of the Rings if you remove a good 70% of the descriptions and throw in some Zorro-like shenanigans. It's 1st person, but it's one of the few I can stand, so he does it right.

He's also written the Living Towers Trilogy, which is darker but not as good, I never seem to be able to finish it, it's 3rd person and a lot more jarring. But Circle of Light is gold!",0

I just finished a great book about one of my favorite art groups.,"Yesterday, I finished reading *The Pre-Raphaelite Language of Flowers* by Debra N. Mancoff, and I could not recommend it more. At only around 80 pages, and with half of those pages being paintings, it is a very quick read, but extremely rich in content. I've always been fascinated with symbolism in figurative art, and this book focuses on the meanings of flowers in the artwork of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, one of my favorite artistic associations ever.

One of the principles of the Brotherhood was to study nature so that it might be effectively represented in their artwork. The importance of nature is emphasized in paintings like 'Spring' by Millais and 'The Soul of the Rose' by Waterhouse. Throughout the book, Mancoff introduces readers to the Victorian and medieval symbolism associated with various flowers, from the heliotrope and sunflower to the rose and daisy. This use of flowers, combined with the characters, results in every piece of art effectively presenting a narrative. Even if the viewer is unaware of the exact narrative behind the painting, the sense of symbolism is obvious, and one can be assured that this is art that *means something.*

Another principle of the Brotherhood was the belief that art should have a level of spiritual integrity and heartfeltness. Mancoff's commentary in this book does a great job of introducing the reader to what these artworks meant to their creators and commissioners. Whether it is the sorrow of 'Broken Vows' by Calderon, the maternal patriotism of 'Queen Victoria With Prince Arthur' by Winterhalter, the aestheticism of 'Sunflowers and Hollyhocks' by Hayllor, or the real-life romances and scandals behind 'Ellen Terry' by Watts or the Portraits of Georgiana Burne-Jones and Mary Zambaco, by Edward Burne-Jones, this is more than just a showcase of pretty pictures, but a glimpse into the lives of some of the Victorian era's greatest artists.",0
Unwanted Books,"Hello everyone, sorry if this kind of post isn't allowed but I'm not sure where else to turn.


I inherited a very large book collection from my grandmother. I loved reading through her library and just simply looking at all the titles when I was younger so there's a huge portion of the collection I want to keep for my own shelves.


However, there's a sizeable portion of the books I will probably never read. (Mostly Danielle Steel book and old Gothic romance titles.) I don't want to throw these books away and most of the little libraries I've found hold nothing but kids books and I don't think Danielle Steel would be appropriate in most cases. What would you do with almost 150 books that are in good condition with no markings?",0
Have you found that your taste in audiobooks is different than your taste in books otherwise?,"I’ve always been and remain a very avid reader but for some reason, for all of my life, I’ve been resistant to audiobooks. I don’t know why and don’t think that it was snobbery, I had no problem with anyone else using audiobooks and never considered them to be a lesser kind of reading, but I had no interest until about 18 months ago. 

Also, although I read and love all sorts of books from all sorts of genres and authors as varied as Ovid and Heinrich Heine and Edith Wharton and Zadie Smith, science fiction — with a couple of exceptions like A Canticle for Leibowitz* and *Gravity’s Rainbow* which are atypical of the genre — is a genre that I’ve never been able to sit down and read, despite actually being interested in a lot of the concepts. I do like to listen to podcasts and lectures when I’m doing work or laying down so one day I tried to listen to Ursula K Le Guin’s *The Dispossessed* and I loved it, since then I’ve “read” most of Iain Banks’ *The Culture*, several books by Philip K Dick like *The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, VALIS, The Divine Invasion, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer* and *Radio Free Albemuth*, Octavia Butler’s *Xenogenesis* trilogy and I’ve just finished Kim Stanley Robinson’s *Red Mars* and am about to begin *Green Mars*.

What’s interesting is, I’ve purchased copies of most of these books, either to read along or to keep reading when I can’t listen to an audiobook for whatever reason, but I still find these books, which I really enjoy listening too, unpleasant or boring to read.

Have you experienced anything similar?",0
Do you read books that belong to an unfinished series?,"I like being able to read a whole saga back to back. Otherwise, if I have to wait several years before installments, I forget about the story, realize I should re-read the previous books and fret about re-reading stuff when there’s so many books out there. 

Do you feel the same way? How do you approach unfinished sagas you’re chomping at the bit to delve into?",0
Annotating books - yes or no?,"I love the looks of it and honestly envy people who annotate their books but I just can’t do it. I’ve tried twice but it always ends up feeling like work: having to have a flat surface to write, having to line up the tabs perfectly, coming up with a system in the 1st place, … It makes it difficult for me to even pick up the book knowing I’m gonna have to tab and write in a sitting position. 

What do you guys think?

This is genuinely not meant to be hate or a „I’m not like the other girls“ kinda bs. I love the looks of annotated books and would LOVE to be able to read books that have been annotated by sb before. I’m thinking maybe I’ll give it a try with a book I’m re-reading.",0
"When you travel to another country or city, have you ever been to their bookstore or library to check out their book collection? I found a lot of interesting books by doing that.","When you embark on a journey to another country or city, do you make it a point to visit their local bookstores or libraries in order to explore their extensive collection of books?



I do that quite often and discover interesting book collections, such as encyclopedias or books that I have never heard of before. Many times, when I visit a bustling and noisy big city, it can be overwhelming, but upon entering the city library, it becomes a serene and peaceful environment. The library feels like stepping into another world, an oasis within the city, where you can take a break, relax, and delve into wonderful books.Think about it, there are not many places in a city like a library where there is quiet and relaxation.

"Finished The Stand, don't get the ending criticism","I feel like the ending was perfectly telegraphed through the rest of the novel. Maybe my expectations colored this because I've heard so much disappointment about how the ""final showdown"" happens but I feel like the entire last third of the book was the final showdown with Flagg recieving L after L until Trashy brought the A-Bomb. Wish Larry, Glenn and Ralph didn't have to die but I appreciated their sacrifice, and how confident and at peace theywvere at the end--especially Larry. Great character. Speaking of great characters...

Tom Cullen is amazing, I love him to death. That's all there.

Ultimately, I feel terrible about Harold. So much potential and I wish that there was a possibility that Harold in some other life could have a second chance. 

Really happy I finally got around to reading The Stand. The most horrifying part to me is the sequence that flips around to the different survivors and how they all met their end, especially the one about the boy who ends up with a broken leg or legs in a ditch who dies of either exposure or starvation. Shit hit me hard.",0
"Taking Notes is stopping me from reading books, I don't understand what should i do","I really like reading non-fictional books like Sapiens, Homo Deus and other scientific and philosophical books but it always remains inside of my head that what if I forget some really important ideas or something about what I""m reading also by creating notes I can recall whatever I had read.

And Because of always care about creating notes of what I'm reading, I'm just not being able to read, and because of this perfectionist nature of mine, my notes are too long and take time. I think this is not the correct approach to reading that's why I'm asking here, since I'm not that experienced with reading.

What should be the approach to reading and what about creating notes?

Anyone else who doesn't relate to characters?,"This may be a really stupid question. I've heard time and time again people describe certain characters being really meaningful as they can relate to them so much. I totally understand where they're coming from, but having been an avid reader since I was a kid (40 now), I can't say that I've ever taken any situation from a story and applied it to my own life. 

Just wondering if anyone else can relate? (pun intended!)",0
"Stop saying they are ""forcing her to choose""","Listen I'm not really into love triangles personally,  but when people say things like "" they're so toxic,  forcing her to choose"" it basically comes across as ""they are bad people for wanting to be with someone but not being interested in a poly relationship"". 

Now I have no issues with polyamory itself but I also think there's nothing interested in that kind of relationship; especially if you're only interested in one person. It's like calling someone a Heartbreaker for nor reciprocating your feelings.


Also I'm using female pronouns because this never seems to be an ""issue"" with people when it's one man and two women.",0
Do you ever get random damage on your books and wonder where it came from?,"I just went to grab my copy of the Great Gatsby and noticed some bluish-gray scuffs on the front cover. Admittedly, they aren’t all that major, but I can’t figure out how this happened. This book has been in a temperature controlled, low humidity environment for months, and this is only the third time it’s been touched. It’s been sitting below three other books the past few months, but it isn’t as though they’ve been vigorously rubbing against each other.

This doesn’t really bug me too much because I accepted a long time ago that this is just the price of owning books. Have any of you ever had moments like this where you wonder how the hell this happened?",0
Done. All major prize winning books read.,"I’ve been on a reading mission for several years to read every Pulitzer (US), Booker (UK) and Miles Franklin (AU) award winning novels. 200+ books.

I coincided the conclusion with my Camino de Santiago pilgrimage, which I’ll also complete in a few days. I just wanted to commemorate the moment with my fellow readers here, as I’m travelling solo so there’s nobody about to high five. 

BTW. I get literature awards can be problematic and aren’t necessarily indicative of the best novels of that year. But it was a fun goal to chase and satisfying to complete.

Ever get caught off guard by when a book was written?,"When you watch a movie or TV show you can automatically put it into a ballpark of when it was made by seeing the lighting, set Design and effects. The only thing like that capable of dating a book by sight is its cover Design and they will get updated to look new with new additions.

Sometimes grab books from the library and notice peculiarities that make me question things. Why does this book about counterinsurgency mention do much about the Greeks but never anything about Afghanistan, and why is he constantly mentioning the French in Vietnam and not the Americans. Look to the copyright date to discover it was written in 1964.

Similar things happened when I was reading a book about the CIA and the author mentioned how he remembered the boar war that happened in 1905. I didnt find out the Dave Grossmans on killing was written in the 90s till 3 years after I read it.

I've also had the reverse, expecting a book to be publicly before 2017 for it to mention Tik Tok like Holly Black's book of night or to mention the Corona Virus like 2034.

Anybody else have experiences were the books were written way before or way after you originally thought they were? Are there any major words like Covid or Tik Tok that let you know it was definitely written recently? Does the way you pick out what books you read make it so you always know when they were written?",0

Please help me understand this quote in Before The Coffee Gets Cold.,"“Water flows from high places to low places. That is the nature of gravity. Emotions also seem to act according to gravity. When in the presence of someone with whom you have a bond, and to whom you have entrusted your feelings, it is hard to lie and get away with it. The truth just wants to come flowing out. This is especially the case when you are trying to hide your sadness or vulnerability. It is much easier to conceal sadness from a stranger, or from someone you don’t trust.”

Absolutely loved this line, but I really didn't get the relation between emotions coming out with people you have a bond with and water going from high to low places? Please someone explain like I'm a child... I actually don't get the relation of gravity at all.",0
"Do you like to imagine the main character as ""you""? Especially in first person voice","I was talking to a friend recently, who mentioned some books they read, and that they didn't like some of the books because the first-person narrator was too far from their own selves. It confused me for a bit -- of course a character would be different from you!

But they had assumed first-person was that way because it's meant to be ""you"", and you're supposed to project yourself.

I had assumed first person was like you listening to someone tell you a story, like when you're at a party and you hear a friend tell you about this wild thing that happened. 

I'm sure many stories exist on both ends of the spectrum, but I realized it's probably explains my negative feelings toward some recently first-person books I read: I viewed the main character as a total self-obsessed narcissist, but if it's meant to be \*you\*, then \*you\* are assumed to be justified in your actions, and that's part of the escapist fantasy.

There is literally nothing wrong with any style of reading, so this is not meant as a judgment -- just as a curiosity to see what's in your mind as you read. When you read a book, do you insert yourself into the narrative? I suppose a similar thing would be creating an avatar that looks like you in a video with a create-a-character, like The Sims or Skyrim.",0
How does Eric Hill keep writing new Spot books when he's been dead for 9 years?,"Eric Hill died in 2014. I haven't done an exact count, but there have been at least 30 books in the Spot series released since his death. Every single book is attributed to him.

[This Penguin Random House page on the series is surreal.](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/DVG/spot?page=1)

I hate that they do it this way, because Hill's Spot books are very cute, but the new ones are miserably soulless. Does this happen a lot? I know they're still churning out Curious Georges and Cat in the Hats, but they attribute those to the new author (or at least don't claim Rey/Seuss wrote them).",0

Ever Felt Like You Read a Great Book at the Wrong Time?,"I predominantly read non-fiction books due to their educational value and my desire to learn. However,  there have been times when I've felt that I'm not fully realizing the benefit of the book due to my life stage at the time of reading. I've experienced a few instances where, although the book is excellent, I've felt that I would extract more value from it if I were to read it at a different stage in my life.  
  
For instance, I read 'Think and Grow Rich' while I was still in school. But in retrospect, I think this book would have been more relevant and beneficial to me had I read it now. Has anyone else had similar experiences? I'm contemplating revisiting the book.",0
To anyone looking for a new whodunit rec: The Decagon House Murders,"Since whodunits are having a revival, I feel like a lot of the mystery recs on this sub have been pretty similar. For anyone who’s read a majority of the OG classics & modern day classics, it’s hard to find one that will actually surprise you in a satisfying way.

The Decagon House Murders by Yukito Ayatsuji is legitimately great - it’s originally Japanese written in the 80s but should be available most places with its English translation

The premise is VERY “And Then There Were None,” - the characters themselves talk about it in the book. It’s about a bunch of college kids who go on a trip to an island to stay at the Decagon house and start getting killed off one by one.

As a warning: the writing, especially in the beginning, is not that great. I’m not sure if it’s the translation but I think it’s just that it’s the author’s first novel and he wasn’t very good, technically. Choppy sentences, not great flow, extremely mediocre prose. I was actually close to DNFing it lmao because I thought the quality was so mediocre, BUT once it gets going it’s really impossible to put down. The plot is addicting and the atmosphere is tense despite the writing limitations.

The reveal is excellent - it’s that perfect “omg I should’ve seen it coming duh there were clues I noticed but didn’t put together” while simultaneously being shocking. The type where you go back and reread the reveal because you can’t believe it.

 It’s not completely airtight—there’s a little suspension of disbelief/“what would the villain have done if X thing happened” etc but overall I think it’s incredibly good and satisfying. 

Unfortunately Ayatsuji’s follow up Mill House Murders is the complete opposite: written well but boring/predictable/solvable in the first 20 pages lol. 

But anyway highly recommend Decagon for anyone who’s read all the popular mysteries and looking for something new!!",0

"I feel like I only read books to pass and occupy my time, not because I want to be genuinely educated or immersed","I've never really been a book reader. Most of my time growing up was spent playing video games or watching YouTube. But now that I'm an adult WFH, there's a lot more free time I have between when I'm working and when I'm not. Most of that time is still occupied by video gaming, but some part of me thinks it should be more productively spent and that I should be ""doing something"". So I thought ""Why not spend it reading?"". But I only get through about a quarter or half of a book before I grow bored of it and put it on the shelf. 

So my urge to read only really comes from a place of feeling the need to occupy my time. Not because I want to read about some great adventure or romance plot or even something historical. And, as I said before, once I grow tired of that topic, onto the shelf it goes.",0
The Wonder by Emma Donoghue,"A story set in the 1980s’ Ireland of an English nurse to take care of an Irish child or more.

This book really brought me out of my Reader’s block so kudos for that. It’s more of a psychological thriller with the elements of Christianity/Spiritualism entwined. Really loved the way how the Author has put the book together despite the climax was a bit of a meh to me. The book starts off slow and keeps you intrigued till the end. >!Will the child die or not?!< It kept me hooked that I finished it within two days (a big deal because of this long readers block I’ve been having). 

The tension between the English nurse and the Irish is another intriguing aspect of the book. Despite the English nurse (or nurses in general) who should be specialized in sympathy deters from it when it comes to the Irish people. The way she is apathetic towards the Irish and condescension towards their beliefs and virtues is wrote well that you as a reader feel furious at her prejudice towards them. The more you read the more her character develops but later onwards you  are more inclined to believe that her way of treatment towards them is right (Don’t wanna spoil why). 

This story is based on some real life incidents that took place in Ireland during that period where >!overtly religious people going into the delirium that they can survive without food for God’s sake.!<This isn’t like any other thrillers where you’d have twists that will make you gape your mouth but moreover like not twists but revelations of what happened/happens. Especially one of the revelations is hard to digest not because of the reliability but of the act itself.",0
“Bones and all” is far worse than I anticipated and I am upset about it,"This book has one of the best premises I have come across so far but it’s just so shitty it makes me frustrated! I saw the film first and I was pretty disappointed with it especially because I usually love Luca Guadagnino’s films. I figured he might have been outside of his comfort zone and I read online that the book is very different so I gave it a shot.
Besides the first 3 chapters which I thought were pretty good it’s a hot mess.",0
"What author from at least a hundred years ago, do you think writes in a very modern and easy to read style?","For me, it is Robert Louis Stevenson. He gets across some endlessly intriguing concepts (subterranean cultures, the duality of man) in a very straightforward way.

A Scanner Darkly by Philip K Dick is the best book I've read in a long time. The dialogue is outrageously entertaining and he manages to completely transport you into someone else's mind - which is an especially crazy feeling given that the main character is spiraling into drug-induced paranoia,"I finished reading it weeks ago, but it just keeps circling back around in my head. This is one of those books that I know will change the way I think for years to come, and gave me a new sense of empathy for what addiction feels like.

Here's the setup (no spoilers, in tags just in case you like to go in totally blank slate):

>!Substance D is a new drug sweeping the nation and slowly destroying the minds of its users. As the connection between the two halves of their brains degrades, they grow increasingly disoriented and confused before suffering irreversible brain damage.!<

>!Fred is an undercover narcotics agent working to uncover where the new drug is coming from. But to find the source he has to pose as Bob Arctor, a user, and soon Arctor is as addicted as the junkies around him. Can he see through his paranoia long enough to tell which leads are real and which imagined? Or will he be consumed, like his friends, by substance D?!<

Despite the gritty, near-future setting and the serious themes, the book is funny pretty frequently because **the dialogue is so good**. Our characters may be drugs addicts spiraling into addiction, but that doesn't mean they don't act like normal friends ribbing each other and cracking jokes - at least when the times are good.

There is some very cool stuff here about **the theory of the mind and brain physiology/biology**. and even better, those facts perfectly set the stage for the twist halfway through the book so that it feels surprising but also totally in keeping with those (real) brain facts that were dropped along the way.

A big part of the reason the book feels so real is probably because it is real - Dick has said all the books he wrote before 1970 he wrote on amphetamines, and **Scanner Darkly was written as a reflection of his time as an addict**, and was the first book he wrote sober. He dedicates the book in an afterword to his friends who died or suffered irreversible brain damage from drug use - and the list is way too long. It hit so hard it made me tear up (literally, not figuratively).

If you want one of those rare books that helps you see the world through someone else's eyes (while being wildly entertaining at the same time), this is it!

"John Grisham's ""A Time for Mercy"" Theory","So the ending left me wanting...something.  I had a theory brewing through the back half of the book that was never confirmed nor denied: Brother Charles McGarry is the father of Keira's baby.  
Evidence:  
\#1: The mere presence of the McGarrys (and specifically young Charles) is an obvious Chekhov's gun.  There is no real reason for him to keep popping up in the story, and the fact that he has a healthy baby boy with his wife is a reminder to the reader that this guy... gets after it.  
\#2: Brother Charles making house calls, especially with no one home besides Keira, is... odd.  Grisham clearly has no qualms about showing the ugly underbelly of American institutions (the court system, law enforcement), so why should the clergy be any different?  Brother Charles is new, doesn't know what he's doing, has a pregnant wife and is human... it might not have been force-able, but he tried to reach Keira on an intimate level and gave in to his human weakness.  
\#3 The time matches up.  If Brother Charles sowed his seed that late night in December, that lines up with Keira's due date, her knowledge of probably being pregnant the night Stu was killed, etc.  
\#4 Stu's idea to look at Keira seemed novel in the first chapter.  If this was a true first-parent perspective on his thought-process, it does not seem like the sort of thing he would think of as an afterthought.  The physical/verbal/emotional abuse was 100% happening... maybe the sexual abuse was embellished.  
\#5 Juror Carpenter calling out the ugliness we all know exists: Teenagers lie to get out of trouble.  Teenagers growing up in trauma are not 100% innocent.  
\#6 Stu was the perfect patsy.  He deserved everything he got for what he did to Josie and the family...but maybe the last straw to finally off him was to blame him for Keira's pregnancy, get Charles off the hook, and get him out of the Gambles' lives.  
No blood test, the adoption closed... not saying the Brigances knew anything, but it could be the byproduct of a cover-up initiated by the Gambles.",0
My Takeaway from David Goggin’s Can’t Hurt Me,"I decided to read this book blindly after seeing it mentioned in a self improvement type sub. I have not consumed any other material from or about David Goggins. This is an honest and unbiased review.

From the get-go I’m not fond of this books structuring which jumps erratically from point to point with no linear progression.

Three chapters and it’s just a sob story about his difficult upbringing. Nothing about this man’s life is happy so far. Then the crazy starts. Goggins goes off physical punishing himself through over exertion and food restriction. If a women wrote this book she’d be called out for promoting EDs.

Goggins is the definition of a loser so far.  
Failing high school, morbidly obese, in a dead marriage, failing the ASVAB, the “medical dismissal”. David seems to be achieving nothing. Getting himself another medical dismal, 30k in debt and getting his ex-wife pregnant.

The more I read the more insufferable David seems. Running an ultra marathon unprepared then burdening his wife with cleaning his piss & poop. Not once has this guy mentioned anything he’s achieved so far that wasn’t a completely selfish act. 
 
At about chapter 8 David seems to final gain some form of normality. And goes on tour doing charity events.

David is like the one person you know whenever you talk to them something bad has happened. He ends up having a cardiovascular emergency. Then the book skips that and start on more military stories.

David is starting to sound like his old hard ass BUD/S instructors, I guess you become what you hate.
Hoggin is unable to make Delta and fails a WR attempt.

The final chapter has some positivity.
David final breaks the WR and does some self reflection. This stood out to me:

“Hiding all my insecurities and trauma.
It was a lonely journey from there to here. I missed out on so much. I didn’t have a lot of fun. Happiness wasn’t my cocktail of choice. My brain had me on constant blast. I lived in fear and doubt, terrified of being a nobody and contributing nothing. I’d judged myself constantly and I’d judged everyone else around me, too.”

There’s an update on Trunnis Jr who seemingly had a normal white collar life.
Interestingly, there is no mention of David’s first born since the announcement of his ex-wife being pregnant. 

Takeaway:
In the end, I do not find David Goggins story aspirational or healthy. Goggins does not seem to conquer his demons. Goggins, like an addict, abused himself physically to the point he needed surgery and rehabilitation. Call me an angry liberal but Goggins also seemed to have misogynistic tendencies. When he was doing well he regarded himself as “macho” and “alpha” but in moments of failure he’d say stuff like he needed to “hem his vagina”. 
His fortitude may be applicable to achieve short term goals like passing an exam, losing weight, completing a project etc. But I don’t think the mindset depicted in this books is sustainable.",0
Terraforming Earth,"Guys. I read through this book a few times as a kid but didn't remember a whole lot about it now that I'm nearly 30. Was at the library with the wife, saw it, and was like ""Oh, neat. I'll give it another read, why not?""

Then I started my adult life and naturally had less time to read - a book or two a day became a book or two a week - and that was fine. I discovered fanfics and book reading went down, but I was still *reading* and through the years I went back and forth between published books and fics, and it was fine. 

I've been in a slump though. I don't mean a recent one, it's been ongoing. I stopped being interested in any traditionally published book, but I told myself that was okay because I was reading fics, and then I stopped reading fics, but that was okay because I liked audiobooks and that's really fine because even if it's listening, I'm still reading books. 

But now I can't get very far through an audiobook before I'm turning it off and sitting in silence. I get books from the library and read the first few chapters and then return them because I just can't be bothered anymore. 

It's not that the stories aren't interesting. It's not genre burnout because I've been switching it up both genre and reading level wise, including ones I usually avoid full stop, just to try. It's not that I need something new because I can't seem to care about it, and it's not that I need something loved and familiar because I tried that and didn't make it past chapter 1. 

I can't even blame my mental health. I'm in therapy and on meds and in a better place than I've been in years, and I've been in this good place for a while now so I can't even say it's an adjustment period. 

I used to *define* myself by my love of reading, and without it I feel adrift. I was so passionate about it and now I just feel nothing. It's like yeah, those are words on a page. They just don't ensnare me like they used to. Instead of being something I get lost in, they're still just words on a page. 

There are books that I've powered through, and a couple that I enjoyed more than this sort of midwave of bleh that's seems to have taken over the excitement I used to feel about reading, but even the books I finish are less of ""I love this and have to know what happens"" and more ""I mean, I made it this far, might as well finish I guess"" type things.

I don't want to be over reading, but I think I might be. Has anyone else experienced this? Have you recovered your love of reading? I've tried so many things and I just don't know what else to try.",0
"The Pathless Path by Paul Millerd, Not the Traditional Path!","This is my note of a book called ""The Pathless Path"" by Paul Millerd. It was talked about by Ali Abdaal.

\- interesting quotes make us rethink the traditional path  
\- “The ease of having an ambition is that it can be explained to others; the very disease of ambition is that it can be so easily explained to others.” – David Whyte  
\- “With so many options it can be tempting to pick a path that offers certainty rather than doing the harder work of figuring out what we really want” – Paul Millerd  
\- “The desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same things” – Alan Watts, Zen Philosopher  
\- “Instead of thinking about what you want to do with your life, you default to the options most admired by your peers.” – Paul Millerd  
\- “The educated, hardworking masses are still doing what they’re told, but they’re no longer getting what they deserve.” – Seth Godin  
\- “Many people will override their own desires to meet the perceived expectations of others.” – Paul Millerd  
\- “For example, in Taipei, people in the previous generation were able to purchase property with only a couple of years of savings from an average job. Now Taipei is home to one of the highest price‑to‑rent ratios in the world, and this same goal can take more than twenty years and for many, it is simply impossible. While the economic situation has changed radically, many young people orient their lives towards this same goal.” – Paul Millerd  
\- Your intuition is wrong! 97% of people think “A person is successful if they have followed their interests and talents to become the best they can be at what they care about most.” according to research.  
\- Having previous impressive credentials can open doors, BUT it hasn’t translated into a high income for the author, especially, with some of the more creative things he’s done like writing or online courses.  
\- Targeting a mass audience is the traditional(default) path of thinking.  
\- Riding a ladder the pathless path means accepting that you might not know what you are doing and you might look like a fool.  
\- What to do  
\- Figure out what you have to offer. Ask a few close friends “When have you seen me at my best self?”  
\- Disconnect yourself from traditional work for a bit like 1 month.  
\- Be patient.

What is the worth of your book collection? 🤑 💰,"This morning, I woke up with a purpose to clean and arrange my bookshelf. 15 minutes into this activity, I got motivated to list down all the books that I have. Opened MS Excel with Amazon opened in a chrome tab. I sat down and listed all the books (kindle and audible versions) included. The total cost came up to be around ₹65,000 ($790) and I am in a state of shock. 🫨 
This includes around 150 books.
Now I have to try not to buy any books for atleast 2 more years 😭

Which writer can you not get into even though they are universally loved?,"I've tried reading Terry Pratchett, colour of magic more than once and really didn't get into it. I love the genre and wanted to like the book but didn't. I also tried the wheel of time books and they didn't grab me. Do I need to persevere or should I make my peace with the fact not everyone likes all the same things?

Does anyone feel unable to read a (somewhat) recent book by someone who killed themselves?,"Especially when said book is about problems that are pertinent to our living situation. 

The two that come to mind are Infinite Jest by DFW and Capitalist Realism by Mark Fisher. 

There's something about reading a book by someone who didn't make it that makes our predicament feel kind of... hopeless.

Like they had a diagnosis of a problem we face. Maybe even the start of a solution...

But there was no happy ending for them. 

Or, worse, acknowledging and confronting the problem just lead them no where in the end anyway.

So everything they wrote in the book feels kind of like a dead end. 

I know that's not the point and this isn't a great way to think about it, but I just can't bring myself to read them for this reason. 

It's just a very sour feeling.",0
"If you wanted to take a line or passage from a book and frame it so you can look at it often, what would it be?","Sometimes you come across particular lines or passages in a book that interest you because they are really funny, intelligent, unexpected, or whatever. But you don't necessarily want to look at the quote multiple times a week. Then, there are those quotes that you do want to have around, maybe even frame them and put them on the wall so you are reminded of their truth or power.

For me, there is one that usually helps me when I feel I have little control in life or that nothing I do matters. So I like to have it around to look at it again and again. The line is the following, from The Fellowship of the Ring:

""All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.""

Context:

“I wish it need not have happened in my time,” said Frodo. “So do I,” said Gandalf, “and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.”",0

Books that you are surprised by its oversea popularity,"Which books are you seriously surprised by their popularity aboard? And why? 

Reading r/books, I am surprised by the popularity of Umberto Eco's *The Name of The Rose*. Here, in Italy, it is notoriously known for being a difficult book. Not only, in the original version, it presents a good mix of Italian and Latin, but it also presents different reading levels: from a ""superficial"" historical mystery nevel, to a philosophical questioning over faith and rationality. The book also presents many references which kind looks like the labyrinth itself, also a theme of the book: each discussion with other characters can be farther expanded and analysed individually.",0
Examples of authors writing well in multiple genres?,"What are some good examples of authors writing well in multiple genres? Two of my examples include Noam Chomsky (linguistics and politics) or Stephen King (horror, non-fiction, and realism).

Have you ever read a book from an author in one genre and then hated their book in a different genre? Or do you think an author's talent can pass through different writing topics and styles? 

I think that the ability to write in totally different genres can be praiseworthy. Sometimes is demonstrates the author's breadth of knowledge but other times it is just an example of their creativity. But it can really depend. I'd love to hear this group's thoughts on this topic and get examples of authors who have done this well.",0

How did your employer handle your cancer diagnosis?,"I have a question for everyone in this subreddit: How did your employer handle your diagnosis?

When it came time for Fall Semester classes to start they turned on me and fired me for ""not keeping up with my classes"" - I was only 3 hours short of classroom time of where I should have been. I had never been written up, never called in sick, and only been late once in nearly 4 years. My Union representatives wouldn't even file a grievance for me.

Tomorrow, on Tuesday, my dad is getting his first session of immunotherapy. I am very very nervous because that is the last treatment he is getting. He did really well with chemo and radiation but I am super scared that this will take a toll on him. Are there any advice I should do while my dad is taking immunotherapy? I have to say this as well, my dad has been very very depress ever since he found out that his tumor is not surgically possible and that the cancer is slowly, slowly spreading. I have been trying to encourage him to enjoy life and to be outside than him just him sitting in bed and watching the and sleeping but he just won’t do it. I asked him if he’s in pain and he says not yet so to me from what he’s telling me he’s not in pain. I’m just really scared and nervous about his depression and his immunotherapy.

Cancer Patient Travels,"Hello,

My Dad Has Lung Cancer,"My 89 (almost 90) year old father recently got a biopsy done of a 5/6 mm nodule . It turned out to be adenocarcinoma in early stages (there's no sign of spread to other organs or lymph nodes). My parents went to the thoracic surgeon and he said that my father was a good candidate for surgery because he's in ""good"" condition for an elderly person. He said it could be a ""cure"" for the lung cancer. My father wants radiation and his PCP and oncologist recommended radiation. The surgeon very bluntly said that he would have five years of life if he had surgery and only 2 years of life if he gets the radiation therapy. He said if my dad is okay with 2 years of life than he should get the radiation.

:/

Has anyone gone through this with their elderly parent or other relatives? What were their experiences like? I just want my dad to be comfortable no matter what choice he makes.

Looking for help on options on end of life facilities for niece whose aunt can no longer care for her.,Not sure if this is the right place for this but not sure where else to go.

Did anyone had a biopsy on a 5mm lung nodule?,"Hi everyone,

My father 60, no history of cancer

He recently underwent a CT scan that revealed five lung nodules, all measuring between 4-5mm. One of these nodules is spiculated. From what I've read, spiculated nodules have a high risk of being cancerous, with some sources indicating a likelihood of up to 90%.

Unfortunately, due to the small size of the nodules, the doctor has advised that a biopsy is not an option at this time. Instead, we will need to monitor the nodules. However, given the high risk associated with spiculated nodules, we are very worried and would like to explore any potential options without delay.",0

Refusing treatment full stop,"I have been reluctant to post this as I have been trying to be sensitive to those who desperately want anything that will keep them alive.

I am posting because I want to see if there are any others like me out there.

I am 68, single, live in the UK and have no family other than a daughter in New Zealand whom I am no longer in contact with. 

Diagnosed with breast cancer last August during a work up for gender affirming chest reconstruction and had a double mastectomy.  

I knew there was one lymph node in my armpit affected but I refused to let them do an auxiliary node clearance because of the risk of lymphodaema as already had problems with that arm that hindered my driving. 

I was given a prognosis of 83% chance of making 5 years. 

I refused to take any anti oestrogens due to potential side effects. 

I also made it clear on a number of occasions that I didn’t want chemo or rad because of side effects.

Jump forward to March this year and I suddenly sustained a spontaneous fracture in my pelvis.  I was in my first day of going on holiday, so ended up in a hospital far from home. Scans showed that there were widespread bony mets in my spine, pelvis and legs. 

Got transferred back to my local hospital where they are still trying to persuade me to take various meds and have even lied about one of them not being chemo when the pharmacist who wasn’t in on the ‘game’ told me three times it was.

I have therefore lost all trust in them. 

I have had a referral to Palliative Care by my GP and am waiting…

I have never had a fear of death and at 68 I don’t feel my future quality of life is anything to get excited about.  I am very much about quality over quantity

Is there anyone out there who 

has refused all treatment other than pain relief and found you have a battle on your hands with Oncology?

"Did anyone have a situation where codeine and morphine didn't work on their own, only with paracetamol and the pain relief didn't last very long?","My mum is really struggling with pain and only getting pain relief for 1.5-2 hours before it flares up again. If she takes paracetamol on its own, it will work for that period of time. If she takes it with codeine or morphine, the outcome is the same. If she takes codeine or morphine on its own, she is still in pain. Those two hard-hitter pain meds have no effect on her pain. She is often crying or making noises due to pain. No position is comfortable enough. It's devastating.

She has advanced, incurable liver and bone cancer and her pain is in her upper thighs (with stiffness, heaviness as well), lower back and upper arms and shoulders. We have been to A&E twice because of her pain but nothing is helping in the long term.

Have any of you been in the same situation with codeine & morphine? What ended up working for you?

She has only recently been diagnosed, had her biopsy 2 weeks ago to find the primary and had her MRI this week but she has been in agony since March. We're waiting for results but both of us are completely in the dark about what is going to happen next - there is no communication - so all I can do is help take care of her (luckily I work part time). Sometimes I feel like I need help with this from someone who is properly trained to administer meds.

She often needs paracetamol an hour before the 4 hours she is meant to wait or she cannot cope.

I took a break even though my cancer was at a standstill, I needed some normalcy in my life. I’m also epileptic and was diagnosed with HIV at the same time as my KS diagnosis. I am 6’1 and weighed 116lb when I was diagnosed with both, my cd4 was 74 I was very sick and just happy they could finally figure out what was wrong with me. I had been going to the er for blood in my stool and throat for months and they couldn’t tell me what was wrong. I had a negative HIV test from just a few month prior and had always been on PrEP. Finally after googling and googling my symptoms I asked for more testing and was relieved when I was able to get treatment.

I can’t do it anymore I’m exhausted my body is exhausted. I’m posting on here because no sees me on my bad days. And no one really understands how terrible it is to go through these illnesses and I wanted to vent without making any of my family or friends upset or say the same things again or tell me how they’re aunt died of cancer and I’m lucky to be alive.

Update: Today I was feeling very sick and am in the hospital with pneumonia. I decided I am going to stop all treatment involving my cancer. I will continue with my ARV and Keppra and discontinue everything else. I want to thank everyone that commented it made me feel better and that making this choice isn’t a selfish decision",0
Stage 2 Renal Cancer,"I got diagnosed with stage 2 Renal Cancer this week. I've been struggling with chronic vomiting without nausea, loss of appetite, and early satiety since Christmas that led to anemia and 50 pounds of weight loss. Spent 3 months chasing doctors when all my GI tests kept coming back clean. Finally got ordered into a CT scan in Monday and woke up Tuesday to multiple urgent calls from the hospital. I have a 13cm mass on my kidney and I'm having a full nephrectomy next week. It's been a chaotic whirlwind this week. It never really crossed my mind that I could have cancer. I'm not sick like cancer presents in the media. I'm tired and I would like to be able to keep food down. That's it. 

I'm pretty overwhelmed. 

Everyone around me is relentlessly positive and I'm just sitting here worrying about if it's spread. Imaging says no, but once the docs get in there with the knives, I'm worried they'll find more. I have friends and family lined up as caregivers for a week+ post surgery. Some other friends started a GFM and I just feel awkward about it. I guess it'll cover door dash and my mortgage this month. 

I'm just in this weird mood. What happens next? What if it's worse? What if it's not and I feel like a fraud? After all, cancer is losing your hair and constant puking and chemo and depression and misery, not tiredness. I guess I got the puking down pat though. I just feel so weird emotionally.",0
Trying to understand and not constantly question other treatment schedules,"Hi all - I continue to be so overwhelmed with the varying levels of information, especially related to treatment and it’s leading to me doubt my team/care plan. My husband says it’s fear which I don’t disagree with on some levels but we’ve also never done this before. I say that to say, seeking out the crowd sourcing responses of Reddit to bounce ideas off . Stage 2/3 Osteosarcoma, unk if metastatic.

1. My doc is hesitant to give a stage, is that normal? Does it come later? 

2. My treatment is 6 cycles of AP + Methotrexate which per the doctor is the “standard approach to osteosarcoma” . If I look at each drug, that will be “18” individual treatments. I’ve had surgery to remove and now we’re going with a “curative” approach. I see other osteosarcoma patients describe their treatment and there are comments that they have had 20+ treatments. I see that and think “I’m not getting the best advice” . “I should be seeking a second opinion” . 

3. I am feeling somewhat skeptical every time the doctor says we’re taking a “curative” treatment path, like I’m being set up for unrealistic expectations. Interested to hear thoughts on that. 

4. When I ask about tumor/cancer resistance the doc tells me are no tests/indicators for osteosarcoma but I found an osteosarcoma clinic that says some genetic markers do matter. 

My husband wants to take the approach of trusting the doctor (we’re at Duke) and team and to focus on the path forward. I am feeling a little salty because I think the diagnosis is delayed but also a general fear that this is the biggest decision in my life - if we get it wrong - if the doctor gets it wrong - it’s irreversible. Is this the mental game or do I pursue it further? TIA!",0
Lumbar puncture question,"Hey guys, so i had a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) on Thursday,and they apparently got a good sample and put some chemo in too. Ever since i’ve had a pretty horrible headache which only seems to calm down when i’m laying flat. I’ve already contacted the hospital, who have just told me to keep laying flat. Has anyone else had something similar happen after a lumbar puncture?",0
Not so great PET scan result today,"Had surgery 3 weeks ago to remove another piece of rib, 4th surgery I've had so far. Pathology report came back and it was negative for any residual malignancy, despite it looking like it was cancerous at one time. I had some hope that the immunotherapy was kinda doing its job.

Well, had a PET scan today, and I apparently have another bone lesion. This time on my pelvis, in the socket where the right femur locks in. Oncologist messaged and said it's time to change treatment. I'm anxious about having to do more radiation and a more aggressive chemo, and of what this means for long term prospects.

This sucks.",0
Update and vent,"Hi!! 

So just over two weeks ago I did a bit of an introduction, vent and ask for advice and I have a bit of an update which. Really sucks if I'm going to be honest. 

I had a quick preliminary call with a Neurologist about three weeks after my MRI, where they said - as if it was facts - that my tumour was hopefully benign, small and livable. I wouldn't need treatment unless it grew or spread. 

So, it's been nearly five weeks since my MRI and I've heard nothing. Today I pushed and pushed, like I have for a week, and finally got to talk to someone. Turns out there's a five week delay on MRI results within the NHS. That preliminary call was mostly possible outcomes and hopes, not facts. 

The fact is, I have to wait up to another five weeks for my MRI results and properly clinical appointment to know what my brain tumour is, how bad it is, what treatment to do if any. And it's terrifying. I'm experiencing such severe seizures that are putting me in hospital, so I'm finally on some treatment and medication for that but - has anyone else experienced this type of wait? It's absolutely terrifying. I feel completely frozen in place waiting for this. 

 They've got me in contact with some groups and things ready, they've given me tons of reading and advice for the I guess worst case scenario. Just, scared. Needed to vent. See if anyone else has experienced this. 

Thanks all

Bladder Cancer,"Hi.  I was officially diagnosed with bladder cancer yesterday after a cystoscopy.  This is all new to me.  I've never known anyone in my family to have cancer.  I don't know where to begin.  I don't know how to feel.  I'm lost in space and feel like everything has already moved on without me.  I find myself stopping and blankly staring into space without realizing it.  When I come back to, I have no idea how long I've been standing there and mentally checked out.

How did you take the news?  What did you do to take back control?  How are you dealing now?",0
Am I burnt out,"I'm tired... I've developed a ""Deal with it attitude""... I feel like I just don't care anymore. Is this what being burned out means? I'm expected to excel at work then come home to be a pseudo ""Husband/Father"" when I'm a 23 year old single childless man. Started my new job 2 weeks ago and my sister and mother are upset that I don't ""talk to them"" despite me feeling mentally exhausted and physically exhausted. I constantly work my schedule around my sister and my mother. I'm always on edge when my mother is with me around others as I dont know if she'll embarrass me blowing up, like she does on me and my sister. I get that I'm the oldest. And for years I've done my best to position myself in a way that my sister can live without dealing with the stresses I've lived with but with consequences of its own. My sister is spoiled. She's irresponsible, clumsy, forgetful. I never had that privilege growing up. I find myself at times that I feel envious of her being the youngest. Whenever I try to do stuff on my own to just to catch a break, it is always a problem. I guess I'm not entitled to a break.  For years I've struggled with suicidal thoughts hoping to drown them out with the ministry and working on myself but they are always there in the background. I have come to terms that I resent my mother and father unfortunately... no matter how I try to view my family situation I hate it. It's unfair. I hate that my role in the family is skewd due to family boundaries being blurred. It sucks having to always deal with the negativity from my outside extended family because my mother always gets involved. It sucks having to work my finances around my mother being financially irresponsible and needing to borrow hundreds of dollars that ""she'll pay back"" but never does. It sucks not being able to save my money because as my mother says I'm considered ""selfish"" or ""cheap"". It sucks that I've given my mother over $20,000 yet shes in more debt now then she was 5 years ago. For years now I've done my best to budget my finances to never ask my mother for money. She's been in debt for as long as I've been alive and will not learn to be financially smart. Not to mentioned getting diagnosed with Cancer(Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma)last year at 22 years old was a nightmare. The saddest part was that I somewhat felt relieved thinking that I'm about to die soon... I went through 6 sessions of chemo in 4 months. Those 4 months was a nightmare with the constant stress of my mother and sister constantly arguing. I'm still alive so far but am stressed out dealing with possible set backs in the future... I feel like if I was able to run away from my life I would. I just don't know what to do anymore...",0
Oesophageal Cancer,"Hey everyone 👋 

I’m 34 and was recently diagnosed with stage 3 oesophageal/stomach cancer. 

I am half way through a course of chemo/radiation before heading towards a total oesophagectomy.

I am somewhat fortunate that my adenocarcinoma narrowed my gastroesophageal junction to the extent where I was unable to swallow. I was initially diagnosed with achalasia before biopsies said otherwise. 

I now have a nasogastric tube but because my oesophagus is so narrow I cannot swallow my own saliva so constantly spit/vomit saliva (making talking near impossible). 

I have 2 little kids and a really supportive wife and family. It’s an absolute nightmare at the moment but I am confident in my treating team and staying positive about beating this shit.

I would love to hear some other stories/experiences out there :)",0

My father has stage IV pancreatic cancer. We're looking for an ointment used to reduce black marks on left hand.,"During his first chemo he was administered the drip via left hand and was prescribed thrombophob ointment for the black marks. However, the marks have been up for over 2 months while the left hand has been utilised only once and it has had very little reduction. On the other side the right hand, despite having been utilised thrice shows remarkable improvement in black marks reduction. The doctors have suggested to keep the same ointment twice. What alternate medicine could we use?",0
"Rectal cancer with liver mets, partial obstruction and nutrition concerns","My mom was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the rectum last week. She also has mets to her liver, where a 5 cm lesion has grown 4 cm in the last 6 months from her previous scan. Also has some localized mets to nearby lymph nodes. The tumor in her rectum is around 10cm and partially obstructs, which means she has to be on an all liquid and purée diet for now until it can either be reduced or removed.

I was her full-time caregiver prior to this diagnosis and will be with her 24/7 for the next 3 months as she starts treatment for this. I also live with her and will provide care after I go back to my regular job. 

She has lost a considerable amount of weight during the last six months (around 50 pounds) and has been advised that she needs to focus on weight gain and increased calories during this time period because she will likely lose weight from treatment. She has been encouraged to drink/eat smoothies, protein shakes, milkshakes, creamy soups, grits, yogurt, mashed potatoes, and even consume baby food if she has to in order to get the nutrition that she needs. She can’t eat anything that is hard/crusty, has rough edges, spicy, bread, or chocolate (sadly) due to her specific stomach issues.

Does anyone have any ideas for creating meals or snacks that would be appetizing for her? Suggestions for adding calories to her very limited diet?",0
Stage 1 - 40M - Renal Cell Carcinoma 3cm,"Hello All, 

I was diagnosed with Stage 1 Renal Cell Carcinoma. It was found during another exam that I was doing for my stomach. CT showed that it measured 2cm and the MRI that was done a month later showed it a 3.2cm. Due to the growth, I was advised to remove the infected area asap and surgery was scheduled a week later. The surgery will be a robotic partial nephrectomy. I am very nervous and scared but heard many successful after surgery stories. My Dr was very optimistic that he is able to remove 100% of the infected area.

I am wondering after surgery. How did everyone feel? I am advised to leave that day to rest for a week until the follow up.",0
Relief for muscle spasms and pain?,"My mom was diagnosed with extensive Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) in December. She’s been through chemo and radiation and is currently doing immunotherapy. One of her most troublesome symptoms has been these painful spasms that seem to move throughout her body and strike randomly. 

All the doctors she’s seen (oncologists, neurologist, specialists) are completely baffled by this. These are some of the foremost experts in this type of cancer in the country, probably even the world. She’s been tested for paraneoplastic disorders (autoimmune diseases that can occur with lung cancer), nutrient deficiencies, basically anything else possible and come up negative. The strange thing is, the spasms went away when she started chemo. Then they came back after she stopped chemo. 

This problem is really reducing her quality of life and making it difficult to do the things she enjoys. All the pain management team will do is prescribe opiates, which she doesn’t want to take (she wants to be lucid and able to do physical things). I’ve suggested CBD gummies (I have no experience or knowledge in this area, but it seems like something that might work). I think they’re going to try acupuncture as well. They’re also going to look for other opinions since there are a lot of highly renowned cancer centers relatively close by. 

Has anyone had similar experiences or had any success with pain relief through non-opiate means?",0
I’m bummed,"I’ve had a weird pain in my back on the lower part of my right side rib cage for just a couple of weeks. 

I thought it’s just because I’ve upped my game at the gym. 

Today I felt a mass there. It’s about the same size as the last mass I felt when I first found a mass in my left shoulder. 

I already scheduled an appointment with my oncologist. I have hopes if it’s cancer again that it’s the same type as before and they can just cut it out. Hopefully before it grows to be 10lbs. 

I could use some positive vibes. Thank you!",0
Can anyone please help with how I should tell my husband the news?,"Hey guys, I’m really struggling.  I read my path report Monday (tumor) and Wednesday got to hear it for the first time out loud by my surgeon, I’ve got cancer.  Meeting with an oncologist next Friday.  

I am now riddled with guilt for not telling my husband immediately, but I just don’t know how. I’m living in my head and overthinking everything.  I seem to be completely hung up on this step because it makes everything “real” and at the same time, I know very little information.

I’m 40f, no familial history of cancer. Pretty low contact with my parents.  I am in no way worried that my husband will leave me or be anything but supportive, I am scared that I’ll destroy him with the news and he’ll see cancer first, for the foreseeable future. 

Any advice, guidance, opinion will be appreciated from how you told your friends/family to how you would have like to have been told.  Thank you immensely

Update: hey y’all, thank you from the bottom of my heart for the incredibly generous words of support and advice, I feel all the love.  

I told him… it was awful but I feel so much better.  He is my human and we can do anything/everything together ❤️ he told me to stop saying I’m sorry, that he was sorry I had dealt w/ this in my mind without him. He wants to stay positive and absolutely go to my appointment next Friday. 

It kind of came out suddenly because I got a letter today stating I was being called for jury duty. Really? Like after my month? This was the worst news to date. I had already submitted a preselection juror survey that should have immediately removed me from the pool. He was worried about the dates (11 ish days in July on top of the 2 days in June) since I work night shift and don’t have a good medical reason to not serve. I just sort of stared at him. I told him the surgeon will sign it no problem. He disagreed.  I said well… we need to talk about that…

Lots of hugging and a few tears, but overall doing ok. He’s in shock. I told him he could tell whoever he needed to.. I’m here for him but it’s also really important to have people to talk to outside of us. 

Again, thanks for all the love & advice. I’ll probably update next week after the appointment. Side note, whoever said that “saying it out loud is the hardest” was dead on… it was a mind fck I wasn’t expecting.",0

"Dr said tumors had shrunk, 2nd opinion says they have grown.","I'm halfway through 12 rounds of chemo. I have an oncologist at the clinic I go to where I live and I see another as a 2nd opinion via telehealth.

I had an MRI about a month ago and met with my oncologist in town a week later. I had PET, MRI, and CT scans from 5 months ago to compare too. They reported that the tumor on my liver was shrinking, and gave measurements to show by how much. We never saw the scans or were told anything else just that its shrinking and it means chemo is working and to continue.

Now today, 3 werks later, we had a telehealth visit with our 2nd opinion oncologist. They pulled up the scans that were sent over. They tell us, and we can visibly see between scans, that the tumor had grown.

How could this possibly be? My wife and I can literally see the difference between the scans and they LOOK bigger. How is it my oncologist and radiologist in town that read the scans determined my tumors were shrinking WITH MEASUREMENTS. 

My Dr here said chemo is working and should continue, now our telehealth Dr says it's not and I need a new regime. Our telehealth visit he compared my recent MRI with a past CT scan and PET scan but for some reason didn't have a past MRI scan to pull up. Our telehealth Dr is very personable and shows us all my scans and goes over them with us. My Dr here is not personable and just walks in and tells us the results and that's it.",0
"Colon cancer & brain mets, what are we looking at?","My mom just got diagnosed with colon cancer with brain mets. 
2 weeks ago she was a perfectly healthy 65 year old, although a smoker all her life. Suddenly she seemed ""off"", as in not her own self and seemed confused all of a sudden. Couldnt tell what date it was, what year etc. I called an ambulance, thinking she had a stroke, but MRI showed 5 brain mets. One large at 3cm on left frontal lobe which is the one causing cognitive problems, and 4 smaller ones at 6mm at the back of the brain. She has large amount of edema (7,5cm diameter) around the largest tumor. She was started on corticosteroids immediately, which has helped, but she is still not herself. 
Today we found out on CT scan the primary tumor is in colon, 10cm length of one tumor. Seems like rest of the body is clear. 

Colon cancer never gave her any symptoms, still doesn't, but the brain mets were causing symptoms which let us to believe something is going on. She doesnt have any pain and feels like she is fine. 

This all has happened in 5 days. We are all confused and dont know what to expect with this. Doctors said they are waiting second opinions on both, colon and brain mets. The most likely approach (according to doctor) would be surgery for colon and radiation for brain mets. My mom tried asking the doctor today for prognosis, but doctor just replied ""I dont like giving numbers cause they are always off"". 

I have been googling like crazy and everything says that this has a very bad prognosis. My mom seems happy with this, I dont understand why. I guess she thinks this is better than lung cancer with brain mets or something. 
They are saying that she will be discharged from the hospital tomorrow, and going home to wait for the second opinions and treatment options. I live 1,5hrs away and my mom lives alone. I got 3 small children and I work 5 days a week, but can work remote. I am thinking about moving in with her and try to take care of her, she wants to return home so badly.

Caregiver burdening patient emotionally,"Background... I have stage 4 breast cancer, Tnbc. 1 cm tumor in breast and metasticized to supraclavical and sternum lymph nodes. I'm on Taxol (as maintenance chemo, non-curative. Life prolonging purpose) as well as Keytruda immunotherapy

To say its been a rollercoaster is an understatement. I can deal with my side effects, and my own coping methods and emotions...

What's causing me issues is my own husband who is grieving my condition and very emotional but does not seek outwardly help.. (only from me.. The patient..). He's very up and down and all over the place. I honestly don't blame him for this but he won't seek external help such as therapy. We spend all of our time together... I try to convince him to get out with friends and get our hiking, he loves nature and adventure.

Sometimes he gets emotional and cries and cries and I am in a position of having to console him, over the loss of what's happening to myself. I deal with this on top of what I'M feeling... So I'm dealing with emotions for 2 when I'm just trying to stay as healthy as possible, while managing my own fears about my diagnosis, dealing with my own side effects from chemo, which are ever varying.. My own emotions...

For reference, I am 42, and still active. They've switched me to a new drug that is much better tolerated so I'm able to do most things.. Not much has changed with respect to ""caregiving"". I still do most housework, dishes and do laundry, gardening. Usually my husband makes dinner and I do dishes... It's been that way since before my diagnosis so no change there. He gets groceries once per week and sometimes I go with him. Sometimes he helps with driving my kids to activities... I drive myself to chemo now and sometimes he comes with me to clinic appts...

I feel like my cancer has taken a toll on his emotional and mental health. I have been seeing a counsellor for a year now to discuss my emotions about the cancer. I suggested to my husband to talk to a counsellor to help... And his response was ""nothing anyone can say to me will change how I feel about what is going on..."". I absolutely do not agree with this.. I feel a counsellor could help him manage his emotions about it and come up with healthy coping strategies as well as help with how he interacts with me...

I feel like I can deal with what I'm going through but that it's unreasonable for me to deal with that and also on top of that deal with consoling him over my disease and manage HIS emotions also... It's too much... I understand he's hurting but there's only so much I can deal with.... I have a terminal disease and I'm taking on his emotions.. It makes me feel worse and feel even more stressed.

Newest thing was he had been getting drunk every weekend for multiple (around 5) weekends in a row until I told him I really didn't like that.. And it felt like he was trying to drown away his sorrow by drinking.

How do I deal with what I'm going through but also deal with him, when it feels like he's burdening me rather than helping and that he's adding additional stress?

Any ideas, thoughts or suggestions welcomed... I'm at a loss and really upset about this",0

"Diagnosed with Sarcoma today, can't believe it","I had what was thought to be a cyst excision last week of a 2.5cm mass that started very small over 20 years ago, but steadily grew over the last 6 years

They said last week sarcoma is what it could be so I read a lot about it, which doesn't look good for me, unless it's local. The surgeon I talked to today seemed optimistic, since it's small and indolent, and he thinks with another surgery that clears the margins it will be effectively treated, but I have to see if it spread with a scan

Sketchy scans and disappointing drs,"I'm not sure I trust scans anymore  The last scans I had were assessed improperly. I have this large tumor on my calf that started growing outward. It became the size of a large grape fruit in the span of 2 months. When my scan came back it said that I had no significant growth. I was so confused. Then I came to realize that the reason they didn't comment on any growth is because they only measured the length and width of my tumor but didn't measure the height. I was really pissed off because I think its a fairly dumb mistake. Its pretty fucking basic that tumors are 3 dimensional and even if they don't normally measure the direction my tumor grew in you would think they would have someone do a visual comparison between the previous scan and the current and see the very obvious growth. Not with the imaging place I go to, apparently they just mindlessly plug in numbers. My report was changed after the fact, after my actual oncologist came back from his break and saw that the tumor had obviously grown. 

I also don't really like my team anymore. I had a lot of pain from my tumor being so large and had to quit my job because it was too painful to do things like walk or stand. I was referred to radiation and received it for 10 days straight. It did shrink it quite a bit (now it's more apple sized than grapefruit) but I now have chronic lymphedema and it hurts to stand and walk now by default. Everyday I wake up to a swollen foot and smoke weed so I can walk around without feeling it as much.

I absolutely hate my lifestyle. I have no job, no income, no real hobbies and no social life. Everyday I just smoke weed, watch YouTube, and eat. My life feels so empty and I'm so angry because I feel like it was all forced on me by the treatments. I keep telling them I want an amputation because I don't want to deal with the chronic pain of the lymphedema and just all the pesky tumors and the side effects.",0

Feel like contributing,"I feel like this sounds stupid, but does me constructing a ep or lp based on my experience having cancer and going through chemo sound unrealistic? Like it’s more so for my own therapy but also I feel like I should at least try to do it because maybe my truth will help someone else get through their own struggle with cancer/chemo.

"Is this medical malpractice, or something else?","A bit of an odd one, and I've not been able to address it sooner because 1. I'm terrified of my oncologist, and 2. I've been to ill during chemo to have the energy to manage it.

I had and continue to have pre-existing conditions before cancer, specifically mental health problems in terms of this concern. Before my cancer diagnosis, I was due to receive treatment within a month to help me manage this. My oncologist decided (and ultimately, was expected to know best) that this should be delayed so that I could start chemotherapy. I was scared and my parents also pushed me to start treatment (I had recently turned 18). I didn't want to, but again, I thought I wasn't the one expected to know best.

Turns out, my oncologist had pretty much tricked me into delaying the treatment I was expected to receive for the entirety of my cancer care. This has been nine months, and even still, she is trying to push it even later. This has left me actively suicidal the entire time and at very high risk. My mental health has significantly deteriorated, and I've been in severu danger for a prolonged time, all at the hands of my oncologist.

I tried on multiple occasions to express my concerns, resulting in breakdowns every time I have been in her office, involving a lot of tears (considering I don't cry, is pretty shocking), and self-harming in her presence (scratching my skin open, hitting myself, banging against surfaces)—all uncontrollable and against my will, I need to add. I was in that much of a state I fully lost control of my function.

I don't intend to take action against her, but if others agree her actions have been as seriously negligent as I do, I do think I should be reporting it to the hospital at the very least. I mean, she has fully dismissed me, my concerns, and my actions every time I've talked to her. That's worrying enough. Surely me, as the patient, should have the ultimate say, and she has definitely prevented me from having this at times where it's evidenced there was very little risk to my health (and much less than my suicidal behaviours)? I don't doubt mental health training should be provided to her at the very least to try and prevent this risk in the future. I cannot express how primarily reliable she'd have been for my suicide if I were to have attempted, and how preventable it would have been had she tried to listen and made alternate decisions.

Finally, I believe she is expected to be my follow-up consultant over the next ten years whilst I'm in remission. I'm not sure if I have alternate options for care providers in my hospital but, if I do, does anyone know the best option to go about changing oncologists? Would it be worth going through this process? Should I put up with her for check-ups, and seek a change if the worse is to happen and I need to return to care?

I'm lost and quite frankly have been traumatised with my experience with her, and it's so frustrating. She's not a bad person, either, she's just completely incompetent in managing patients with complex mental health needs, or medical needs extending typical conditions or cancers.

Thank you for any help.",0

Chemotherapy advice needed,"Hi guys! I am in Canada right now and my mom who's in Delhi just got diagnosed with lymphatic cancer and has to undergo chemotherapy. I am in a fix as I want her to get the best treatment and care possible wherever it is, I am dicey between having her chemo done in Delhi or in Canada depending on the better cancer specialists and reliable doctors. The pros that I see in Canada are that I find the hospital corruption to be low and doctor's reliability to be high as the value of life is more over here + I find the doctors over here to be a bit more accessible in the sense that they will be in constant touch with you and your family if they have taken your case and the MAJOR con is that the waitlist lines are really long and NOTHING can be done over here through referrals or contacts. The pros that I see in Delhi are if we get it done in AIIMS, I have heard and read that it is the best in India and is not as corrupted like other private hospitals. Along with that, a lot can be done in delhi through referrals and contacts + there is no such thing called a waitlist if you know a senior doctor anywhere in delhi.

Apart from the location, I want to know if the hospitals in Canada would take my mom's case as soon as she comes here and not make her wait for months which won't be of any use to her in which case I will go there and start her chemotherapy over there only.

Perimenopause caused by treatment,"Well it's happening, the one thing my family feared most once I went into remission. I'm going into perimenopause at the ripe age of 21 as a result of my aggressive treatments. I know my family is going to lose their minds about it and act like I'm dying all over again, but honestly I'm not torn up about it. I knew this was a possibility since I started chemo and radiation at 16, and honestly every time I bring it up my parents act like I'm joking around about it. I'm their oldest, so me having kids was always their #1 thing. Out of all the side effects I've had from chemo, this one is the one that I'm the least upset about. I've had long lasting symptoms that disrupt my day to day life and make it impossible for me to live normal and comfortable, but it's upsetting to know that the one I'm least affected by will be the one they're most upset about. It's almost comforting that it will force them to give me a moment of peace about parts of adult life that I never wanted to partake in.",0

I'm broken or Chemo rage,"I feel like I am broken. I have been crying non stop for the last few hours. Not for sure if it's chemo rage or the fact that I'm just sad.

Background:
I got diagnosed with AML. I dealt with being in the hospital for a month getting chemotherapy. Being giving my second cancer diagnosis in the last 2 years.I start my second round tomorrow to keep me in chemo remission until I can get a bone marrow. transplant.

Issue:
However simple argument with my two sisters has broken me. I've been crying and I can't get it out of my head. Am I being stupid? I made a simple mistake. My sisters made me feel like a bank robber and my feelings were ignored. (My little sister even said why did you pushing this back onto me I didn't verbally abuse you and don't bring your illness into this. It has nothing to do with it.)
Argument:
I was giving permission to use an audible account to download some books to listen to while I was getting treatment.

The problem was I purchased book under the wrong account. I fixed it but my little sister called and screamed at me for using something she said no too. I started crying because she wouldn't believe it was an accident. And my twin agreed with her.

So , I'm crying because my happy bubble of family helping me was bursted and my feelings weren't validated because of a stupid incident.
Twin didn't have empathy for me and my little sister could give a s*** because I did something bad to her. At least in that moment . 

Am I overreacting or is this a type of chemo rage?",0

Questions about pain meds,"I’m (40f) currently in treatment for breast cancer. I just went though 12 weekly doses of Carboplatin/taxol, 2 weeks ago I started doxorubicin which is supposed to be every 3 weeks. 
I’m in a ton of pain. I’m at the Dr’s office every week and every week they ask me how I’m doing, and I tell them the same thing, “I’m in a lot of pain”. 
The first suggestion was to take ibuprofen or Tylenol. - I can’t take ibuprofen, and I told them that. Also c’mon Tylenol? Tylenol. 
My bones hurt and you want me to take Tylenol. The next time she suggested taking Claritin, she said it helps with neuropathy. 
What? 
They’ve also suggested Benadryl and other anti histamines. 
They finally gave me gabapentin. But after the doxorubicin I didn’t have the neuropathy as much. 

Am I crazy? Why won’t they give me a Rx for a decent pain medication? 
Are you guys in pain? I have zero history of drug abuse/addiction and I doubt it would start now. Do any of you have a rx for something that works?

Stage 4 esophageal cancer at 32 years old,"Sadly I have been diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer. A 7cm adenocarcinoma tumor was found on my lower esophagus with spread to several local lymph nodes. Currently no other spread to other major organs. Confirmed with biopsy via endoscopy and CT scan.

My only symptom prior to the endoscopy was slight dysphagia. At the initial meeting with my health professional I was told this was most likely gastritis but recommended an endoscopy as a precaution.

A further PET scan also detected lights in my neck and under my tongue. Doctors are unsure if this is related to the same cancer or if I’ve been unlucky enough to also have a separate lymphoma cancer. More testing is required to confirm this.

Needless to say I’m absolutely devastated. The doctor has told me this is not curable but I may be able to prolong my life with chemotherapy.

Before I can start chemo, I am waiting for biopsy results from the potential lymphoma in my neck. This may take a few weeks before being confirmed, then I can start the right treatment for me.

If anyone has any advice for me that would be much appreciated. My family still think there is a chance I can reverse/survive this but from reading online I have severe doubts about this.",0
Baron tumor decision time,"I posted last year. 

I have a meningioma tumor in my head. It’s a benign tumor but has been growing for at least the last 3 years. 

I’ve had operations in 2021 and 2022 to reduce the mass. There is no accepted chemotherapy for this type of tumor. For the last 6 months they’ve put me on an experimental treatment where i take a pill everyday and one injection a month. This was supposed to stop the tumor growth but has failed. I am meeting the chemo doctor this week. I am planning to stop this treatment. What the hell good is a treatment that doesn’t work. The tumor is still growing, I will still die when the tumor starts attacking some part of my brain. It’s located near my optical nerve so a good possibility is that I will go blind soon.

They will not do any more surgeries and radiation is off the table. So what little wine I have left, I will not spend on pointless treatments.",0

Struggling with isolation and social withdrawal,"It's been about eight months since I had chemotherapy and radiation. Despite no evidence of disease at this point (although I'm awaiting results of a recent biopsy and have some concerning symptoms), I'm struggling to overcome the overwhelming urge to remain socially isolated. Has anyone else experienced this after treatment? How did you cope?

Before my diagnosis, I experienced many years of unexplained chronic illness. My symptoms became so severe that I lost my consulting business and spent most days in bed. I couldn't walk through my yard. A few times, my husband had to carry me back into the house because I just collapsed onto the lawn. I didn't have health insurance, but in prior years, every doctor I saw was pretty useless. I gave up hope.

Getting a diagnosis was a bit of a relief, but my cancer was stage IIIC at that point. Treatment hit me extremely hard. I was in a wheelchair for months, often couldn't lift my head, and sometimes could not speak. Nausea was horrible and unresponsive to medications. My worst memory is spending hours on the floor violently dry heaving then lying awake all night afraid to move my eyeballs because the nausea would get worse. One week, a surgery damaged my throat, and I had to use an app to speak to my husband. 

I thought getting rid of the tumor would signal the beginning of a new life, but I've been in a decent amount of pain since then. I can walk again, but my legs hurt, and the fatigue is crippling. I feel almost the same way I did before the diagnosis. Not quite as bad, but still disabling. I have never felt so broken, mentally and physically.

Anyway, the mere thought of interacting with people is painful. I've struggled to respond consistently to texts from the few acquaintances who reached out. I have one long-distance friend, no local friends or family. 

I have always been an introvert, and I enjoy solitude, but I also experience loneliness. The loneliness along with lasting effects of treatment (and the looming possibility of recurrence) is making it difficult to remain hopeful much less rebuild my life much less socialize. Trying to connect with people feels like a pipe dream. 

On the one hand, I want to escape social isolation or at least respond to people in a timely manner. On the other, the thought of participating in even fleeting social interactions feels like putting my nerves into a meat grinder. I'm not just exhausted--I have some sort of block, almost like a trauma response, to possibilities of social interaction. Any thoughts?

Side note: I have no health insurance, a negative bank account balance, and no income. I received care for cancer through a charity and they cannot help me even with issues related to the cancer (like tinnitus from the Cisplatin or severe hot flashes from the radiation). I cannot afford to see a therapist. I'm just looking for insights from fellow patients or caregivers who have experienced/witnessed the same thing.",0
A little bump to my nephrostomy tube,"Hi all,

Well, we had some fun and games today that I wanted to share with you in case it helps someone else. So I have a nephrostomy tube and bag to drain off my right kidney as my unwelcome guest was squashing my ureters (drainage tubes from kidneys to bladder). Every week I have the dressing changed and this last time, two days ago, my nurse didn't put a nice padded dressing on top of the regular dressing which holds everything in place, under the sticky sterile plastic covering. Sorry I'm not explaining this very well!

So my tube is a little exposed (not to the air, but I can see it), and today when I got up from a chair, I very lightly knocked where it goes into my back. It hurt a bit at the time but I didn't think much of it. Later when it came time to empty the bag, I was horrified that there was blood in it. I called my local cancer ward (what I'm supposed to do out of hours) and they gave me instructions to take my temperature and monitor it, keep an eye on any bleeding, and to go to the ED if there was still blood in the bag after emptying it a couple more times and they'd pick me up from there to deal with it.

Despite being on blood thinners, the very small amount of blood that had pooled around where the tube comes out of my back had coagulated, and later on, there was no blood in the bag. My temperature was normal.

Talk about a nasty scare though! It's still a little tender but I'm out of the woods for now, with instructions to keep an eye on it and monitor my temperature. I'm still in the 7-14 days post-chemo so at much higher risk of infection. Next week I'll ensure my nurse puts the nice padded dressing on top, before covering it in the sterile plastic covering!",0

How to deal with parent in denial,"My dad (67) got diagnosed with 4th stage prostrate cancer, when he learnt that the cancer had not spread, he seems to have let loose on the seriousness of his condition. The cancer while contained in the prostrate has been identified as an aggressive form. 

After being presented his options for treatment, he seems adamant on not going through chemotherapy out of fear of the pains, trouble and potential undignifying experiences from its side effects. He has also said he is old and is afraid the side effects from treatment would diminish his quality of life. 

He has been instead feverishly seeking out information on alternative medicines and Im afraid he is slowly being brainwashed by quack theories and medicines. Furthermore, he has been deferring his appointments with his doctors and dragging his time out to go for tests instead saying he wants to take
things ""one step at a time"".

It doesn't help that my mum who is also a cancer survivor but at zero stage is extremely critical toward traditional medicine and prides herself in her knowledge of healthy eating that she claims is what keeps her cancer in remission for the past 5 years. She herself has gone for surgery (which was not an option based on the doctors advice in my dad's case).

My siblings and I have tried my best to get him to seek out more opinions and perhaps to speak to other patients who have successfully undergone chemo; however he seems apathetic and asked us not to rush him. 

We're kinda desperate for him to get a grip of the danger of his condition and to get treatment decisons before it spreads or worsens but we're at our wits ends.",0
Is Stoicism unhealthy/Rant,"I’m feeling a little conflicted right now, things have changed considerably and I won’t lie I’m worried.

Heads up about abvg chemo potential long lasting side effects,"I wanted to give this heads up in case a MD here conveniently leaves out this potential long term side effect from ABVG chemotherapy 

Lucky me the Physical Therapist I saw has had Ehlers danlos syndrome patients before AND specializes in cancer rehab. She told me things to look out for with respect to me surviving cancer between the chemo and radiation. That no other MD told me before. What the hell y'all 👀 like apparently the specific chemo I got (abvg) is neurotoxic (explains the neuropathy), and can cause potential heart problems 5-10 years down the line after stopping it. Be on the lookout for atrial fibrillation because of it (which means avoid stimulants whenever possible short version, because being diagnosed with AFib can potentially increase the risk of stroke or heart attack).

She also let me know that for ehlers danlos syndrome, it's extremely common for us to have lower blood pressure and slightly higher heart rates (the HR is how we compensate for the slightly lower BP). It's also normal for our hearts to ""flutter"" with the beats per minute about 10-15 (so say between 100-110).

Monday comes and I think I have time to deal with it, hubris, apparently, because the sensor ripped off the sticky part, that I had attached with skin tac for reassurance that I would make it to the next shipment, on the door frame of the car getting in.

So I get home and call the supply company, and first they told me I can't refill the dexcom yet, oh wait, that's pump supplies... Nope, the Dr didn't sign the prescription last time they sent a refill, that's why it didn't automatically get refilled - call back Friday to check if the Dr has sent it in.

So I called the doctors office after hanging up, and make sure they know it's an urgent fill. Call the supply company on Wednesday, they've got nothing. Apparently they forgot to tell the nurses it was an urgent fill, that I was without coverage that my pump depends on, so nobody chased down my Dr between appointments to sign the form. It was filled out on Monday, they were just waiting for a signature. 

They got it sent in on Thursday, but I had an echocardiogram that day, and that took all my spoons,dealing with that. Found out when I called Friday, but oops they need a prior authorization, which could take 24-48 hours when marked urgent.

Now, only good part, it didn't, it took about an hour or two, and was out the door by 6pm PDT. 

It's going to take a week to get here... It will be Thursday before I can stop low level panicking when I wake up and feel off blood sugar wise (now because I'm running high this past week).

On top of that I'm ovulating, and need to run my higher basal insulin dose profile, but I'm new to the pump, and I'm in perimenopause, so my cycles are funky, and I depend on the dexcom to tell me when I need to switch profiles back - because of frequent hypos...

...but if I don't have my dexcom I run the risk of hypos low enough to trigger my seizure disorder. Oh and just for funsies if I go too high I trigger my seizure disorder too...

I haven't been without a dexcom for this long in at least a year and a half, and I recently tightened up my control so that I wasn't having frequent seizures, because of thw t-slim pump and control IQ...

Just needed to get it all out...",0
Ice cream is indeed bad...,"But I take half (or less) the amount of insulin for a pint of Ben & Jerry's,  as I do for a thing of macaroni and cheese.

High numbers,"Hey people, I need some wisdom thrown my way.  I’m type 2 and my numbers keep going from hanging around the high 80s - low 100s on the days that I’m working (my job involved a lot of sitting), to staying between 120s-150s on my days off when when I’m nonstop active.  For example, last weekend I was camping and horseback riding all weekend and my numbers refuse to come down the whole time.  I eat less on my days off, but stick to my normal food items.  So it’s not like I’m eating junk food on the weekends.  Is it all the extra exercise? The heat? It was around 80F the last couple weekends.  Should I be worried? Or just continue on as usual? I don’t have another Dr appointment until mid July so asking them will have to wait.",0

How likely is my dad to come out of his diabetic coma?,"Last night my 35yr old dad went to the hospital with undiagnosed diabetes, he was completely unresponsive and loopy. He had been sick for a couple of days before hand and they had to go out of state for work, as soon as they got back my mom called an ambulance for him. IIRC he had a blood sugar of 2000+ and had been out of it for a couple of hours before he went to the hospital. 

He’s now in the ICU and has a breathing tube in and a hour ago his blood pressure dropped really low and his heart rate skyrocketed. The doctors said he is a very sick man and could not say whether he’ll make it or succumb to it. 
Can someone tell me his chances of him getting though this? 

Sorry if this doesn’t belong here.

Edit: his blood sugar level was 2500

Thanks so much for the support guys my mom said he is a little bit better since he came in. His bp had gotten normal and his heart rate went down.

Apparently he went in for a scan and they think he had a massive stroke so the DKA is basically over with now but it’s “a whole different ballgame now.”",0
% in range increased by 25%,"So normally I run at about 65-70% in range. The last two days, my in range time has been 91%. I’ve been having lows-just switched from Levemir (12u at night and 15u in morning) to Lantus Solostar 10u at night and 15u in morning. Made the switch about 4 days ago so I’m still adjusting that. 1:6 ratio for humalog. I just had a medium Oreo blizzard from dq (117 carbs-I thought it was 90 so I even underdosed) and I had zero increase in my blood sugar… it’s decreased slowly over 2 hours and I had to eat some fruit snacks at 67. I’m tottering the Lantus after starting at 15u at night and 15u in morning. Is Lantus different than Levemir? I know the dose is not correct bc I’m having lows at night and one or two during the day. But I’m frightened by the lack of increase after SOME but not all meals. I at a hotdog on a bun for lunch with ketchup and mustard and hit 200… so I’m very confused why I’ve cream wouldn’t increase my bs.",0
"Diabetes is controlled, but not fixed","Hello!

I'm currently being treated as Type 2 since last year (negative for type 1 antibodies / lada / mody but endo is convinced I'm too different from all his other Type 2 patients). 1000mg metformin daily. I use a Libre 3 to track my glucose.

A1c at diagnose was 9.3, and has been steady at 5.5 since about 6 months ago. I usually eat lots of plants, get good exercise, lots of protein, and low on the carbs. Sometimes I eat carbs and my glucose goes to about 160 or so and comes down.

But sometimes I eat something apparently egregious -- maybe a flavored latte, or a waffle -- and it spikes high, 250+. It comes down after 2 hours to 140 but it's that interim that scares me. Is this very risky? I know that ideally I shouldn't eat the things that make it do that but my diet is pristine 99% of the time. Am I just going to have to get used to this and permanently strike off certain foods from my diet?

I know that it never gets ""cured,"" but I was hoping my insulin sensitivity would be higher these days.

Any and all advice is welcomed. Thanks everyone!",0
A warning about those on G6 that like to swim. Learn from my mistakes.,"Hey all. Just thought I’d share the weird experience I had today. After years on a G6 and enjoying a dip in a pool whenever possible, this was a first. My glucose was trending high while swimming and after multiple doses, I noticed the adhesive part was lifting off on one side so I decided to stop swimming and dry off and find some tape.

Id had fries with lunch so I assumed it was just a stubborn high. In the next two hours I dosed repeatedly trying to bring down my blood sugar from its high reading. Eventually it was too weird that it wouldn’t budge at all and I checked against the finger stick which read 100+ points lower than the sensor reading. 

With my sensor only three days old, I kept trying to calibrate it lower for over an hour and testing against the meter. It kept popping back up as 100+ over the meter. I’m lucky I caught it before I dosed myself way too dangerously. I suspended basal for two hours to let the existing doses finish their work.

Not sure what happened there as the sensor was firmly attached still despite one side lifting. I don’t think the filament was exposed in any way. Either way, something went off. If y’all have funky highs after swimming, test against the meter to be safe!",0

How did I used to eat so much? (Half-genuine/rant),"I just finished lunch where I managed to eat about 2 ribs and a small spoonful of green beans. I’m full. Even if I were allowed to eat all the carbs I want I can only consume a little hummingbird amount of food before I’m feeling bloated. Everybody has the amazing advice of “you gotta eat more” and I can’t relay how obvious or unhelpful that tip is because they’re trying to help. I miss having mass. I don’t even want my brothers to see me. Hell one of my brothers is already upset that I’m complaining because he’s overweight. It’s infuriating, and it doesn’t feel like there’s a solution.",0

Long term anger,"Sort of a rant, sort of looking for advice. I was diagnosedwith Type 1 about two and a half years ago. I thought I was handling my diagnosis pretty well, but for the past few months I've found .yselr to be really angry. Angry that my life is completely different. Angry that I dont always feel like I have control of my life. Angry that I feel so lost  I've also been seeing a therapist, and that's been helping a little.

"Allegedly T1D, but Ozempic got rid of need for insulin?","I’m 22 and was diagnosed with Type 1 last year. The T1D diagnosis (as opposed to Type 2) was based on testing positive for GAD65 and Znt8, and my BMI of 23 (in healthy range). However, my C peptide levels were on the low end of normal, 0.85. 

I seemed to require a lot of insulin relative to my bodyweight the first year. I was taking about 28 units of basal and 12-15 bolus per day in order to stay in range. 

I started taking Ozempic two weeks ago and everything has changed. I have lost 6 pounds but the bigger effect has been on my insulin needs. I no longer need insulin most days. Every other day or so i’ll take a couple units of Humalog for a high carb meal. That’s it. If i took basal, I’d go low. I stay between 70 and 140 all day even after meals.

I know it would be impossible for a true type 1 diabetic to not need insulin anymore just because of GLP meds like ozempic. Sooo what does this mean for me? 

Both types of diabetes run in my family and i’ve always been suspicious that i either had type 2 (i used to be overweight which may have contributed ?) or that i have a combination of some sort. I don’t think i’m honeymooning because i still had high insulin requirements that first year?",0
Beating myself up over sugar spikes that I can’t make sense of.,"I got a sample CGM to understand more how my sugars are affected by the food I eat. I eat carbs, but I do a pretty good job of eating complex carbs where I can. I brought my A1C from 13 to 6.3 in five months, lost almost 25 pounds, cut a massive amount of carbs and reworked my entire diet and lifestyle, and take the max amount of allowable Metformin. But I still spike from things I wouldn’t expect to spike from. And maybe it’s normal, as it comes down eventually (for bad spikes it can be 4-5 hours), but it does. 

This was supposed to help inform both my food and what treatment to take on next, if any. Given my A1C was so good, I didn’t expect these spikes to be such an occurrence - all after meal ones. Am I beating myself over nothing? What’s a normal spike vs. a dangerous one? I’m starting to think using this CGM was more of a curse than a helper - it was much easier when I just tested two hours after I ate instead of watching the spikes immediately after my meal (i do confirm highs with a stick and it matches).

I don’t even know what to tell my doctor - my diabetes diagnosis has gone back and forth given I have LADA that was caught very early on. They’ll be looking at all my numbers and notes but I don’t even know if it’s me, am I really still eating bad, is it my treatment, and do I need a type 2 drug or do I need insulin?

I don’t know if anyone has gone through similar experiences and has some insight, otherwise this may just end up being a rant. But I’m really and truly just lost on what direction to go now, and I’m not entirely confident the doctor will even know (even my endo found my situation peculiar), so I have to have my own input ready to give.",0

CGM Pricing question.,"I'm seeing my endo on Wednesday and I need to change what CGM I have. $80/month for my dexcom 7 is too much.

"Hello, perhaps a stupid question about blood sugar and cheat days","Hi! I was diagnosed a few years ago as t2. I'm pretty asymptomatic which is why it took so long, even when blood sugar is at 20 on the meter, I don't feel much worse than usual.
Despite this, I've been on a low carb high fat diet for a few weeks, not ultra strict, but pretty seriously. Thing is, I'm bursting to have some comfort food today. I know it takes a few months of healthy sugar levels to possibly put t2 into remission, so what I guess I'm asking is: will one day of high blood sugar render the last few weeks worthless and make me have to start over?

Thanks in advance!",0
Woke up with a bad low and had to call out. Got some questions,"Hey all, so this morning I had woken up with a low. A bad one that I needed my lady friend to help me drink some OJ from and also resulted in me having shakes and mental clarity issues. Needless to say, I was out of it. She called 911 and they showed up to assist and make sure I was ok. My question regards this next bit though. So, I work blue collar and had a voluntary overtime day today on a different jobsite than my normal one that started at 6am. My alarms went off well before and when I didn’t get up she realized something was wrong and realized me shaking and having an episode. I had to call out and miss work for the day. I’ve been told It’s fine and after I apologized later on I asked the foreman if I was in trouble and he said, “I don’t think you are”. In that lays my uncertainty and poses my question of, can an employer discipline you for having to call out due to my condition? It would have been unsafe for me to go in and I never call out. This was a first time call out due to a low blood sugar episode and it’s been quite some time since I even had a low. I’m worried about being disciplined for needing to take care of my diabetes today and if I am, do I have any legal recourse to fight the discipline? Thank you dudes",0

What could cause excessive insulin resistance other than infection?,"I am getting blood work done to see if I have asymptomatic infection. I am high af alot and taking 2-4 times the amount of insulin I used to take. Type one. Not pregnant. Scared and frustrated. Oh and endos have sucked btw they did not even suggest I test for infection, someone else did.

I also want to say the amount I take now would have killed me a year ago. I became more insulin resistant in March. A1c has always been bad. Then a few weeks ago insulin was not working at all almost then 5 days had perfect sugar. Then the insulin needs increased again.

I distance run so I am all muscle. Weight is stable. I don't have periods as I take continuous birth control. Thyroid is good. No allergies other than gluten.",0
How’s everyone’s feet?,"Yesterday my wife and I took the kids to an amusement park. We have teens and a 15 month old. I walked a lot with the young’en to keep him appeased.

Lyumjev has replaced Novorapid with no change in how much I’m taking but the Tresiba is a high dose to try to replace the 2 high doses of split Levemir that I was taking to try and keep my sugars level that wasn’t really working too well and I’ve been trying to get changed for about a year (only been in it a year and a half). Slowly lowering the Tresiba by 2 every 3 nights according to doctor’s instructions (plus almost 24 years experience of being a diabetic) but I’m still having lots of lows. Waiting for a check in with my nurse about all this. Anyone else switch from Levemir to Lyumjev and having similar issues?",0
For those of you who clip your insulin needles if you can throw them in the trash is it still considered biohazard? Should I wrap them in something still?,"Right now I have 2 options. I can throw needles away at work for free with the sharps containers in the restroom, you just have to put them in 1 by 1. Or buy a sharps container and when it’s full dispose of it at my local hospital if I remember to bring it when I go. I can leave the sharps container in my car but the tops always seem to open and used needles spill everywhere. I don’t by BD which is the best, they’re so expensive.

Insulin question,"So is it a possibility I’m becoming intolerant to my long lasting it’s supposed to bring my levels down  it brings em down 3.4 average overnight and I wake up and throw up constantly but when I don’t dose the 3-5 units I don’t throw up and I wake up to normal numbers 4-6 I know the puking is related to too much insulin so should I just stick to my fast acting as needed as I currently use 

It’s Saturday I can’t get in touch with my doctor till Friday so I’m trying to get some other insight

Am I getting healthy or am I over medicated",0
Low levels question,"So I honestly never really encounter many low levels, and I have only had a few minor crashes before. Anyways, today, right before dinner, I felt weird. I started getting shaky and a little nauseous and so I checked my blood sugar, and it was 118, so it was lower than it was at lunch. I was confused because I know what having a low feels like yet I was still in the normal range. Something I was told but I never exactly looked into it and confirmed it and just took it was that even though it was normal when doing a check, I could have been crashing and it was still going down and that I need to correct it. (I see now why a CGM would be helpful in this scenario)

My question is if this is true. I feel like definitely yes because it does make sense, but I just want to have someone confirm it I guess.",0
I am at my wits end...,"56 yrs old, Diabetic since my early 30s. Started taking care of myself 3 years ago. I became a vegan which helped tremendously.

Anyone use Ozempic?,"Hi there! 

I was suggested this medication by my Endocrinologist a few times, seeing as I have Type 2 and it's supposed to be a great way to manage it - with the added bonus of weight loss, which is a concern for me as well. I haven't been able to go onto it because it's so expensive, but I'm starting school soon so I'm hoping my student benefits would help cover it. 

My question, I guess, is... How do you find it? Have you noticed it helps better or worse than oral medications? 

A few people in my life have mentioned that it's being reccomended by a lot of doctors for a lot of things, so I'm worried it's a situation where they might be getting insentives to do so, so that concerns me a little bit!

EDIT / UPDATE: I've decided NOT to go with this medication due to the sheer numbers of people who have not done well with it. Of course I want my numbers in check and to lose weight, but I don't want to feel sick constantly or deprive my body of food to do it, so I think I will explore other options!

Anyone else 1.5 and on Mounjaro?,"I started seeing an endo after having insulin resistance, high fasting bg and pre-diabetic a1c . He started me on Mounjaro and everything improved. Unrelated, I did Trialnet (research for T1 family members) and found out that I have GAD antibodies. Was then diagnosed 1.5 and given a cgm. At this point I was on Mounjaro 12.5, I wasn’t seeing any weight loss for 2 months and my cgm data was all over the place -highs and lows all day long. Moved up to 15mg this past week and my bg levels have completely leveled out. I have no way of knowing what my bg would be like without Mounjaro but based on the limited info I have, I am worried that over time 15 will become less successful at controlling my levels and I can’t go up from here. Mounjaro is so new, I’m wondering how it’s been working for others that are taking it for T2 and are wearing a cgm. What do your graphs look like on different doses?",0
HbA1c 143(15.2) at diagnosis to 49(6.6) in just over three months,"Just starting down the lifelong path of diabetes.

At the start of the year I had a blood test for unrelated reasons and since I hadn’t had one in a few years, my GP decided to add on a variety of tests including an HbA1c.

They contacted me immediately the results came through to tell me that I was diabetic and had an A1c of 143 and I was to pick up a testing kit and insulin prescription they’d already set up for me (UK - NHS for the win!).

They’ve diagnosed me as T2 despite (retrospectively) obvious T1 symptoms (weight loss, thirst, peeing more), although that might be more understandable as I currently don’t have any of the big three GADA antibodies showing T1 or T1.5. All a bit weird but my Endo and Nurse say we won’t be sure on the diagnosis until after a year.

Just had my first post-diagnosis A1c and my Diabetic Nurse is quite happy with the result of 49 and having looked it up it’s not too bad, especially from where I started!

Been lurking since diagnosis and this is my first post here.",0
Went from 11% to 5.1% in 3 months after diagnosis,"Last Feb before my bday, I was rushed to ER due to difficulty in breathing and vomiting. My blood sugar by the time I was hospitalized was at 500+mg/dL, HBA1C is at 11.0%. Almost died in the ICU if not IJ for potassium drip since my potassium dipped down to 1.2 (dangerous) as a byproduct of insulin drips to treat my DKA.

Three months of balanced diet, exercise (mainly walking 1-2km every morning and 20mins of cardio every day), and insulin shots that went from 38 units glargine in the morning + 6 units apidra every meal to only 20 units glargine in the morning if I'm above 80mg/dL after 1 month. Being asian, I still eat rice (it's hard to give up), red rice every lunch and dinner. More on fish, chicken and veggies. Then my breakfast and snack is always tuna sandwich with TLC and fried egg.

Today I had my first lab test for **HBA1C**, result was **5.1%**, though FBS is a bit low at **63mg/dL** (may be the reason why c-peptide is also low at **0.37ng/dL**). Other tests were also okay aside from Uric Acid which was a bit higher than normal. Still waiting for GAD results to verify which type it really is. My endo's looking at 1.5 for now but I'm initially diagnosed as T2.

Also had my eyes checked earlier to check for diabetic retinopathy, thankfully the doctor didn't see any problems, eyes were still a bit blurry by the time if this writing due to dilation.

Will have my results checked by my endo by Monday to see if I did a good job managing my sugar levels.

Can't help but share this achievement in this sub-reddit since I feel proud of what I accomplished so far. Managing diabetes while living alone in a big city is scary as it is. But I have been a silent reader on this thread since I was diagnosed and reading other posts in here makes me feel like I belong to a community.",0
Emotionally Raw after DKA,"I went into DKA very unexpectedly in early April. I was in the ICU for 3 days. I was diagnosed Type 2 in March 2921 and my A1C has been around 6.5 for those two years. I was on Invokana for a year because Metformin made me too sick. My numbers were fine leading up to this. A bit higher than I would like but nothing crazy. 
One day I started feeling nauseous and getting reflux all day. The next day I was vomiting and lethargic. In the middle of the night my roommate heard me struggling to breath. (Khussmal breathing) She called 911 and I was admitted to the ICU. I don’t have any recollection of this. I woke up in the ICU late that afternoon but still groggy. The doctors were confused about why this happened. I had euglycemic DKA. Which is rare. DKA of any kind is supposedly rare in Type 2s. 
They did tests that took over a month to get back that confirmed I have LADA. I had suspected that might be the case but the reality of being insulin dependent for the rest of my life is overwhelming. I feel like I’m starting all over again. Adjusting to the insulin, finding the right dose, getting early morning lows that effect me for the rest of the day. It’s been exhausting. 
I also have a long history of anxiety and depression and this isn’t helping matters. 

My real question is how have others felt and dealt with the aftermath of DKA? I feel so emotionally raw, like I could cry at the stop of a hat. This isn’t like me. 

I’m seeing a therapist but it would be nice to here from someone who has had this experience.

In need for some encouragement,"Venting - I just had my endo visit and my A1c dropped from 9.2 to 7.1 which I know isn’t the most optimal reading  but still I would say I am on the right track. Now I lipid panel readings are still really high but again way better than the previous tests. My endo didn’t say a word of encouragement which I was looking forward to, all she could say was you need more meds to control your readings.!I agree but just be a little encouraging when you see some improvement lol. I left the docs office feeling bad about myself 😢",0
I got diagnosed this month and I have a question about vision for y’all.,"Hey everyone! I got diagnosed earlier this month after a quick lil jaunt to the ER from a 570 blood sugar reading, and I’ve managed to get down to an average of 140 over the month, which is cool, but I had an interesting experience I wanted to ask about here. About two weeks ago I had a Spider-Man moment where I put on my glasses to drive and I realized they were actually making my vision blurrier, and when I took them off I realized my vision was sharper than it’s been in YEARS and I could read signs from really far away. I was stoked but now it seems like my vision is kind of dulling back down a bit. Has anyone here had a similar experience? Is there like a vision boost you get for a little while when your blood stops being tasty syrup? Got any second hand advice from your optometrist you can share?",0
T2 post-surgery crazy highs,"Hi folks,
I'm T2 and since I started Ozempic in Feb my BG had been very well controlled. Last week my A1C  was 6.0.

My usual range recently is about 4-8mmol.

I had a fairly minor knee arthroscopy on Wednesday,  and now my numbers have shot up to around 15mmol! 

 I'm barely eating except for chicken soup, and certainly no carbs that would send me this high.

No sign of infection or anything.

Public Holiday weekend here so no luck getting in touch with my Endo.

I still have Basal/Bolus insulin from before Ozempic, wondering if I should start with insulin again to get my numbers down?",0
HELP! How do I set my Freestyle Libre 3 on vibrate?

Follow up question about alcohol,"There was a post the other day about a guy who found his BG lower after consuming whiskey. I can’t find it anymore but was super interested to read your responses. Especially the ones about how the liver can only process one thing at a time so therefore when drinking spirits your blood sugar will get lower but obviously you risk other health concerns. 

My question I wanted to ask and didn’t at the time is this. What happens to the sugar I have consumed while I drink a scotch. So let’s say I eat a high glucose item and I have a scotch. My new understanding is that my blood sugar will actually lower because my liver is currently processing the alcohol. But what happens to the sugar? Does it pass through my system and go to waste? Or does it just wait there for my liver to be ready and then go through there?? 

I hope my question makes sense.",0
Travelling as a diabetic,This is my first time (since I was diagnosed) that I'm going to be flying anywhere. I use a dexcom with an Omnipod 5. I guess I'm nervous about being stopped and searched by TSA because of the omnipods in my bag. It's not that I'm carrying anything I shouldn't be but I just wanted to know if anyone has had trouble getting through the airport with their insulin and medical equipment. Should I bring syringes just in case for some odd reason the 6 extra omnipods fail? (I'm only going for a week but still),0
School Documents,"I'm wondering if anyone has had issues with schools wanting their own documents filled out rather than what the endocrinologist and pediatrician send over for T1D documentation. My son is finishing Kindergarten and I had issues with trying to be proactive before he started last year with a 504 and providing documents but was basically blown off by the principal and staff. They also lost the documents that I sent over for him during the summer because they changed head nurses and made me jump through hoops to get it to them not only the first week of school but throughout the year (they asked for proof of diagnosis after the first month of school and more documentation from the dr for why he has so many sick days).

Fast forward to the last week of school and they want his medication forms filled out again now, which I feel like they'll just lose during the summer, and his endocrinologist didn't listen when I asked for them to fill out the school provided form that I had provided. I'm really just looking for a polite and firm way to tell the school this is what you get, I'm an exhausted single mom taking care of a T1D, leave me alone.

TL:DR School wants me to fill out forms constantly that they provide, not what the Endo types up, constantly loses forms and needs to verify every little thing about his T1D.",0
Libre 3 problem,"I am a new diabetic (5 months) I haven’t had much problems and everything is still easy to control. I started of with the libre 2 sensor and it worked pretty well.

Carbs,Recently diagnosed. Will be taking a diabetes education class through my health insurance provider. They’ve sent me the workbooks etc and I noticed they are suggesting 2 to 3 carb servings at each meal with each carb serving being 15g. I didn’t look at the snack section.

Changes to the body after 6 years,"I am 39F, diagnosed with type 2 about 6yrs back, which i attribute to poor dietary choices, lack of sleep and smoking. I’ve stopped smoking since my diagnosis, made some dietary changes but in all, never exercise except for the occasional walk. My work nature is rather sedentary rn. 

Currently I am on 850mg metformin 3 times a day
5mg glipizide 2 times a day
5mg Jardiance in the morning

However, lately i noted the following:

Dwindled appetite. I can skip lunch (and one metformin) and be okay.
But i do get random soda cravings - about 1 to 2 times a week. I try to control myself but alas the flesh is indeed weak!
My weight has dipped a bit but fluctuates around 3kg give or take. Currently at 94kg - been at 103kg the last 4years
I have a recurring itch on the mon pubis area/prepuce area. No redness or foul discharge

Any ladies experiencing the same? Blood sugar has been ok lately. No random spikes or dips. Just not sure what’s going on. Tia!",0
BG when sick,"So I’ve learned the wrong way to watch my BG even more closely when I’m sick, which sucks bc I’m more likely to stray from my diet when sick.

took my meds, 

15 min later, my alarm goes off, and I'm at a 3.8, and dropping fast, so I eat 15-20g of carbs(cereal)  
15 min later, I'm at a 3.0 and still dropping. (have the shakes, tired, sweating, blurry vision, confusion)  
15 min later, it stopped going down, and I'm at a 2.2, and it started to go up (eventually to a 5.1)

Mildly infuriating retina screening,"I was at a standard retina screening yesterday and the woman putting the drops in my eyes started making conversation asking me how long I’ve been a diabetic and if diabetes is in my family.

She then says “oh I bet she loooved chocolate then huh” “ my daughter has a big sweet tooth and I keep telling her to eat all that chocolate if she wants to get diabetes” all while laughing.

Opinions needed: Up my basal or adjust my carb factor,"Need some opinions. In the am I’m about 1:6.6. No surprises there.

Doctors and nurses tried to see what it is like to manage diabetes,"Had a appointment today, was told the doctors and nurses at the practice just did a exercise to “live like a diabetic person” They were instructed to record their blood sugar 3 times a day, take their “treatments” (box of raisins) 3 times a day before meals, measure every carbohydrate that they ate and keep prefect record for 2 weeks. 

It was just the tip of the iceberg of what managing diabetes can be like but they all failed into week 2!

Just wanted share, I found it interesting, and thought maybe it was nice they are at least trying to empathise with their patients a little?

What would you add to their challenge if they went for 2.0?

She got me on a no sugar diet for almost a week now and my sugar levels are significantly lower like 75-99 every morning without food. There is this one time where I ate my breakfast and my levels went up to 158 but went down to 91 after 2 hours. 

My doctor said that I don't need to see another specialist and won't need insulin shots. I'm really bothered for my baby. I tried searching what Overt Diabetes mean but can't understand it well.",0
Mounjaro (and real endo) seems to be working well for me.,"Writing this out, it turned into a LONG story, but TL;DR is that I thought I had type 2, then things went crazy (covid-caused?), but now with Mounjaro I’m super well-controlled.  And I’m  seeing a real endocrinologist!

For about five or six years now, I’ve had type 2 diabetes (I was told), and taking Metformin daily.  With the metformin, my A1C was stable at about 6.6-6.7 every year (I didn’t go for testing every three months, just annually).  Seemed well-controlled.  My diet was always reasonable, but not nearly enough exercise, and I’ve been overweight the whole time (obese by BMI, which I don’t trust much—5’7” tall, weighing 210-220 pounds.  I’m a 60-year-old male).

My GP, at each physical, would tell me that I should lose weight and get more exercise, but that my A1C, for a diabetic on metformin, was reasonable and not a problem.  

Then in late January, I got covid (for the second time) and got better in about 5 days.  Not very sick at all (fully vaccinated).  At the same time, I was suddenly fired from my job after 13 years, without cause.  So that was a time of stress, but after the first few weeks, I figured I was actually able to retire, so I started eating even better, and walking 4-5 miles, 4-5 days a week. 

I was feeling better, healthier, more relaxed, than I had in years.  I went for my annual physical in early April, expecting everything to be the same or better than it had been for the past years.  

But a couple of weeks later, my GP called me with a very angry tone. My test results had come in, and my glucose was 310, with A1C of 11.2.  He was very blame-y and curt, assuming (it seemed) that I was binging on sugary sodas and not exercising at all (neither was true).  He said this was “life-threatening” and that he was doubling my metformin dosage and putting me on Januvia, and told me to come back in “three months.  No, two months.”

I was really upset and worried and mystified.  Especially I was wondering why he wasn’t even curious about how my diabetes went so far out of control, so suddenly.  And why, if things were so serious, he was willing to let it go for two months without any further monitoring.

So I decided to make an appointment with an actual endocrinologist who actually specialized in diabetes.  I got a recommendation for a very good one (unfortunately, she doesn’t take any insurance, but I’m lucky enough that I have the resources to pay cash).

She made a huge difference!  First of all she told me that no matter what, even in the best case, the double dose of metformin and the Januvia would take my A1c down to maybe 9.5 or 10. An improvement, but not a big enough one.

She took a lot of blood, put me on a GCM, and started me on Mounjaro right away.  (Took me off the Januvia but kept the metformin going)

The test results came back, showing that the glucose and A1C really were that high, but she also actually tested for the c-peptides and antibodies (something my GP seemed to not even know about).  The lab screwed up the antibodies, but from the c-peptides, she could see that my pancreas was making only a trace amount of insulin.  Not 0, but nowhere near what it should be, and nowhere near what would be expected if I had had type 2.  She said what I had was most likely LADA, although we will test again for the antibodies when I next come in. 

Meanwhile, after a week on the Mounjaro, from the CGM, my glucose was staying in range about 80% of the time.  She put me on a little bit of insulin every other day, just in case.  Although I really haven’t had any lows.

Now it’s been four weeks on the mounjaro, and my glucose is right around 100.  I even drank a bottle of root beer this week (to test, more than anything else) and had only a tiny spike, not even out of the green zone on the CGM app.  

Mounjaro is controlling this so very well, that I I’m curious (and will ask the dr) if it’s really type 2 after all, or just that my pancreas is producing a bit of insulin, still, so the mounjaro is helping that work better. 

I also am thinking the whole thing might have come from covid. The endocrinologist says that’s possible. She’s read that it happens, but long-term studies aren’t available yet.

The mounjaro gave me some stomach problems starting just at the end of the second week of taking it.  Not serious (I did vomit once) but some unpleasant nausea and stomach pain for about 5-7 days.  Then it went away.  The endocrinologist said that was normal, and that it would probably come again, for a shorter time and milder each time, until it stopped being a problem.  But I expected the side effects to start within a few days of the first injection, not 5 days after the second one.  

I’m definitely feeling the difference in my appetite and fullness—eating less, feeling full with smaller portions, and I have lost about 10-15 pounds so far.  That’s also to be expected, I’m told.

The doctor says she might take me off the insulin, when she does another round of tests.  My real conclusion here is that I think the mounjaro has been a great success for me!  

Long-term, though, I don’t know whether to expect this to stay a good solution, or will my pancreas get better, or will it just stop completely and I’ll be in a different state in terms of insulin.  

But at least now I have a doctor who seems to really know what she’s doing, who actually talks to me and answers questions (instead of blaming and yelling at me).  She even answers the phone when I call, returns emails in less than an hour, and looks at my numbers from the GCM even when I’m not having a visit.",0

"Does anyone experience a ""noxious warm glow"" in their body whenever they get high blood sugar?","My a1c is 6 and I'm prediabetic but I get the described symptom really consistenty whenever I eat say.. pancakes or sugary crap. I rarely eat pancakes or sugar anymore but,  notice it will slowly come back if carbs build up over time. It always happens after I've completely lowered my blood sugar. Stopped carb intake, and then go back to eating rice. Rice is the worst for me because I love rice. 

Wondering if I'm the only one who gets this symptom ? This is the only symptom I ever have. I can make it go away by cutting sugar, carbs, eating fiber / whole grains... drinking lots of water or having a dry wine.

I would just like to know if it's just me. What is this symptom called? It's pretty nice because it keeps me from eating too many carbs and going full blown diabetic.

need advice plz - diabetes burn out - how to stay motivated to keep going?,"hi guys,

i  want to mention first i can’t afford private health insurance/an insulin pump. i’m a 27 y.o autistic woman with no family/support apart from my twin, & struggling to get by.

I was diagnosed 8 months ago. i was taking really good care of my diabetes for months, averaging 85-90% in range on my dexcom.

a few times i had slacked off due to depression but managed to snap out of it & take care of myself again.

however, the last 2 months i had to move house during a rental crisis in my city, while working full time & going to job interviews. during this  time i was so stressed i stopped taking my insulin . things have  progressively gotten worse & i struggle to give myself 1 needle a day, most days it’s nothing at all. it’s become a habit to skip my insulin completely for days/weeks . i think i was on the verge of dka  recently but reluctantly gave myself insulin until i felt normalish,  then gave up & went back to skipping it again.

i  know i risk diabetes complications & it’s terrible, but im so sick of giving myself 4+ needles every single day of my life & can’t  bring myself to care anymore. i tell myself i don’t want to live long anyway so why bother about complications in future - which i know is stupid. the thought of a foot amputation somehow still isnt motivation enough for me to take care of myself? wtf is wrong with me.

i  looked at my clarity app earlier & cried for hours because my stats are sooo bad, i don’t want to share out of shame/embarrassment.

how do you all have the motivation to  keep going? to keep giving yourself needles everyday? i have bruises & red dots all over my stomach, the injections often hurt & the  basal insulin burns inside me. I cant take it anymore, i feel completely burnt out & i haven’t  even had this shitty disease for a year. out of all the illnesses i  could get, i get one where i have to give myself 5 needles a day or die?  fml

ik i need to take my insulin, and the rational thing is to just simply take it. but it’s becoming so hard. thinking about having to give myself so many needles daily for the  rest of my life makes me feel hopeless. i need motivation to take care of myself again but i can’t seem to find it anymore. if anyone has  advice on getting out of diabetes burn out, i would be so appreciative",0

Still getting spikes - even on keto and liraglutide 😞,"I’m on liraglutide (victoza) for the past 4 months or so. It’s going well and no side effects.

The big spike you see earlier today was a salad (lettuce spinach rocket tomato and cucumber) with prawns in a home made low carb Marie rose style sauce. 

The small gradual increase from around 3am is probably dawn phenomenon combined with exercise at around 8. (No breakfast)

Need advice on Ozempic...,"So my diabetes story is long and complicated. Haven't been diagnosed for long, but probably suffered with Type 2 for well over 5-6 years as high blood sugar just wrecked my body, mainly due to me being an alcoholic. I didn't report anything to my doctor until the symptoms of constant high blood sugar levels started to really affect me. Even to this day my average range is between 300-400. I don't eat a lot, but as I said I'm a functional alcoholic that's *trying* to cut back and eventually quit, hopefully.

I'm suffering with a lot of nerve/muscular issues that may or may not be related to diabetes. But I'm sure the combo of T2D, alcoholism, and a general depression that causes me to not want to exercise or cook healthy food for myself. I guess you could just call it laziness lol. Either way, it's not good. I need changes fast and the help from medications to get this crap under control.

So I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with Ozempic. It's not cheap, even with insurance, and I honestly don't like the whole ""may cause thyroid cancer"" thing, but I've also read success stories online, and the fact it's only a once weekly injection really appeals to me. 

However, I'm concerned about mixing it with metformin. Also concerned about whether or not drinking while on it will mess everything up.

Any advice or experiences would be great. I really need to get the blood sugar under control so I can feel better and start working on other things. I'm taking it seriously now and I just hope it's not too late.",0

A reasonable accommodation?,"I am a teacher, and have a small refrigerator in my classroom. The sole purpose of this appliance is to keep insulin and small cartons of juice for when I am low. 

Yesterday afternoon, the top dogs in my school district sent an email to all faculty that said all small appliances must be removed from our classrooms, and we must use the ones in the teacher’s lounge at the front of the room. My problem with this is two things:

1) Every faculty member in the school (as well as their children) has access to this. I don’t want my life saving medication where everybody can grab it. 

2) if I were to experience a low during class, I would have to either wait until the end of class to go get my correction (at the front of the school, when my classroom is at the back) or leave my students unattended, which is a big no-no according to my district.

my pump pisses me offffffff,"I have been diabetic for 23 years. i’m 24. I’ve been on the pump since i was 2 years old.

Ive never had a pump that has done this, and yeah it would happen VERY VERY RARELY in the past where my sugars would sky rocket because the tube was kinked and i didnt actually get my insulin. but it seems like the insulin flow on this one is blocked over 50% of the time when i put a new site in, so ill rewind it sometimes and keep the site on just to see if its a problem with the wiring, but most of the time i have to change the whole site and i feel like i am wasting SO MUCH supplies and half of the time i feel like its a false alarm.

I need advice please :(,"Hi Everyone! So I’ve had GI issues all my life I am 28 now and started having issues since I was 12. It progressively gotten worse every year since that age. I have multiple diagnosis(s) such as Endometriosis, POTS and Fibromyalgia. In regard to my GI related issues I was only ever diagnosed with IBS-M , dairy intolerance and a gluten intolerance. I’ve went to several GI doctors around 3. I’ve only had blood testing done and 2 endoscopies done. First endoscopy as a child came back fine. My 2nd one which was in 2021 also came back fine but they also did a Sigmoidoscopy which showed inflammation and and a rectal ulcer. I had to repeat the sigmoidoscopy several times (awake) every time the biopsy would come back the same, showed “inflammation”. The GI doctor seemed to not know what to do or say and kept saying the results were not specific. I winded up moving and not going back to him as I wasn’t getting answers.

Now forward to this year and it’s just been worse I have rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, mucus in stool (usually just mucus by itself), nausea, abdominal cramping, anal pain/pressure, abdominal distention and I can’t seem to eat anything without feeling horrible or paying the consequences.

I was able to get in with a IBD clinic to test for IBD but the appointment is not for another 3 1/2 months…I’m really struggling and am seeking advice. I’m not sure this is IBD, the symptoms are consistent with it but I also have endometriosis which can can cause these symptoms as well. Will I be safe to wait it out 3 months? Any suggestions would be great as well as suggestions for relieving this severe pain.",0
I am at a loss!,"So I woke up this morning in so much pain like contractions in the center if my stomach and the lower right side of my abdomen , I was told to take a 50mg dose of prednisone today and the 40mg daily for a week and then decrease it by 10mg, I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease when I was 22yrs old I’m 36 now and iv had more episodes of stomach pain and constipation with in the last 3yrs than I have ever had, I think it’s time for another colonoscopy and upper endoscopy because something is causing this disease to flare up almost every 3 months and I just can’t live like this I can’t give up I was really hoping Humira would be my miracle but iv been on know for 3 months and I am already flaring! Ugh I almost feel defeated!",0
Negative calprotectin but symptoms ruining my life?,"I (27F from the UK) have had classic IBS symptoms since I was a pre-teen. I was diagnosed with Coeliac aged 20 and have been on a GF diet ever since which has been fine. For the last 6 months I’ve been having what I can only describe as a prolonged flare up of debilitating symptoms which include:

- Alternate diarrhea and constipation, there is no middle ground despite a really balanced diet. 
- Weight loss (about 20lbs in 4 weeks). 
- Fatigue to the point where I sometimes just pass out from sheer exhaustion. 
- Explosive and urgent diarrhea with about 30 seconds warning. 
- Pinching and burning sensations. JFC sometimes my intestines feel like they’re on fire. 
- Abdominal pain 24/7 that gets much worse when I eat anything at all. 
- Bleeding (bright red) with BM’s. 
- Painful BM’s. 
- Abdominal spasms (centre upper area) that I can literally watch happening. 
- Absolutely zero appetite. 
- Noisy ‘bubbling’ sounds in upper abdo. 
- Nausea. 

I had a FIT test and a separate sample sent off. Both came back negative. Leading a normal life is becoming impossible, I feel like I can’t trust my own body. When I’m having a few golden hours of relief, they can come back full force with no warning. My GP has given me a ‘non-urgent’ referral for a colonoscopy due to the weight loss. 

Has anyone had a negative stool sample for IBD and gone on to get a diagnosis/found a different root cause of symptoms?",0
treating a flare with no insurance,"hi all - this may be unadvised but it’s the only route i have at the moment. i am experiencing a mild to moderate flare (a little blood when i wipe, soft stools/diarrhea around 3-4 times per day) but i do not have insurance to go see a doctor at the moment.

I do however have a bottle of 10 mg prednisone from a previous flare. can i self administer pred? if so would a low dose (10/day) do anything? please do not advise to see a doctor it’s just not possible for me at the moment - thanks in advance!",0

treatment,"hi guys, just looking for some advice.
A year ago I had a colonoscopy that showed mild ileitis. was briefly treated for crohns & then the treatment was stopped (not my choice) because my pillcam at the beginning of this year was normal. i had ANOTHER colonoscopy a month ago and i still have mild inflammation in my terminal ileum.
i’m not exaggerating when i say, even though it’s mild, it’s fucking kicking my ass. i’m in pain so often, bad bowel habits, fatigue, etc etc. but they’re now saying the most recent results are of “questionable significance”.
i’ve had this for over a year, and i’m struggling a lot with it, how are they being so dismissive!? surely the longevity of this is suggestive of something ACTUALLY going on right?
just any advice on how to advocate for myself to get some treatment/ taken seriously would be appreciated:,)",0

Is this calprotectin test positive? Possible IBD?,"Symptoms: very mild cramp-like pains (24/7) in my abdomen for past 7 days and my stool consistency has changed to a sludge / porridge like consistency - but I am still only having one BM per day, which is normal for me. This was triggered by an episode of really bad cramping after eating dinner one night, since then the pain has become a 2/10 and is really very mild but it does seem to be with me all the time. 

Tests: negative celiac test. I had a positive home FOB test but I do have a fissure and haemorrhoids so I guess it could have been due to that.  The attached photo shows my home calprotectin and lactoferrin test - according to the instructions, any line in the T area, no matter how faint, is positive. Looks to me like there is a faint line for both? 😔 

Does this warrant further investigation with a GI doc and a colonoscopy? Or should I give it longer and wait and see if my symptoms get worse or go?",0

IBD with little to no bleeding?,"*not looking for a dx or medical advice, just curious if you have an IBD with no bleeding. The novel is just because I needed to vent. Thanks for listening*

I am getting an endoscopy and colonoscopy next week finally after two years of horrific symptoms… I’ve bleed once but generally have pure liquid diarrhea 10-15x per day. Severe vomiting episodes (will puke 20x a day) , I’ve been on a PPI for a year and it just barely stops them. Really bad pain in lower right side, mouth ulcers, horrific fatigue, and joint pain so bad I can barely move. If I don’t eat, I feel a lot better. Sometimes I get randomly really constipated. Anal itching/pressure. Occasionally I get burgundy coloured stools that happens when I get bad pain in the middle of my upper stomach. 

It got bad 2 years ago, but before that I started getting a fullness feeling in my lower right side. They found cysts on my ovaries and we chalked it up to that. 

Generally I get SI pain and mouth ulcers when I get the pain in my lower right side. 

Thing is my inflammatory markers are normal, so no drs are taking me serious. It’s so bad I’ve lost my entire life. I can’t work, had to sell almost everything i own, and can barely leave the house. 

Part of me feels like it’s just IBS. And I’m fine with that, I don’t want to be sick, but it’s been two years of agony and if it’s just IBS there’s nothing they can do and I have to keep living like this 😭",0
Seeking Advice: Recommendations for Fiber Supplements to Alleviate Ulcerative Colitis Symptoms?,"Hello everyone,

I hope you're doing well. I've been experiencing a flare-up of my Ulcerative Colitis and have been prescribed Prednisolone for the past two weeks. Initially, I started with eight tablets a day, and now I have reduced it to six tablets a day as per my doctor's instructions.

Despite the medication, I'm still facing urgent and explosive diarrhea shortly after eating. I'm wondering if anyone could kindly suggest any fiber supplements that have helped them in bulking up stools? However, I would prefer recommendations that don't contain prebiotics or probiotics, as I recently tried probiotics and unfortunately experienced worsened symptoms.

Thank you in advance for your help and suggestions. I greatly appreciate any advice you can provide to ease my discomfort during this challenging time.",0
TMI Warning (photos)… I’ve noticed blood in stool,"Last weekend I had excruciating pain in my lower abdomen, unsure what could be causing it as I hadn’t changed anything to my diet. 
I felt like I need to pass gas really bad all day but either couldn’t or it felt like something was coming with it. So when I got the chance to make it to the toilet I decided to just let it go (sorry!)
When I did nothing came out, not even a bit of wind. So sat there for a while until a passed a tiny amount of wind and felt something. 
When I wiped I found this yellow mucus looking stuff on the paper. 
The pain continued all day and when I got home I felt like I needed to open my bowel. Hoping that would solve all my gut pain problems I went straight to the bathroom. I didn’t open my bowels, I found I couldn’t. However instead I did pass this weird ball of “mucus” laced with blood. It’s more of a deeper red too. And when I wiped there was more there too…

I have gone to the dr and she has ordered me for testing. We are waiting results. But I’m the mean time does anyone have a similar experience? If so what did it turn out to be?",0
Does it get better or should I get used to this diet?,"I’ve been on a BRAT diet for about 4 weeks. I’ve expanded a bit but the only thing I’m *safe* to eat is pasta, rice, potatoes, chicken, fish of any kind, eggs, toast strawberries, grapes, a small bit of zucchini and squash. Anything beyond that is Russian roulette. This diet helps but my symptoms are still there. 

I ate outside of that this week and I PAID for it. I had a work event and was served filet mignon & a burrata salad. I know,  shouldn’t have eaten it. I made it home and had bloody diarrhea for two days. 

Anyways…. I get a colonoscopy and endo 6/12 to officially diagnose something. Background; I have had “IBS” for years, occasional blood in stool, occasional mucus in stool, high CRP, high ERS, low vitamin D and most recently was put in the hospital with colitis. I’ve seen many docs about my stomach and I’ve thought for years I’ve had IBD of some sort. GI always blew me off saying it’s my celiac and IBS they never did scopes. 

Most recently, GI didn’t want to do the scopes immediately because of the inflammation in my colon so they’re making me wait 6 weeks although we’re thinking it’s probably crohns. In the meantime, I live off of Bentyl and Zofran. 

Once I’m on treatment, should I expect my diet to expand beyond what it is now or should I start getting used to eating like this? Any suggestions on what to try?

Edit: also no caffeine, dark sodas, dairy, fried foods, no red meat (learned my lesson), no leafy veggies. This is all per GI until my colonoscopy.",0
"Suggestions on how to deal with IBD, IBS, chronic pain, eczema, anxiety","1. **Hey all, I have been thinking of finding a holistic doctor to deal with my variety of symptoms. But I do not know if I should find one in my local area australia sydney or consult one online in the US. And i am having mixed views about testing, idk if its waste of money or needed...**

**I was going to consult dr ruscio institute (I am not sure if its good sounds too good to be true, promotes no testing and cheaper costs??) , or coreperform (dietician in the US, bit too costly) if I chose the online option. In my local area, I am still not sure... bit costly.**

The thing is im really concerned about the cost, esp testing and if its going to work or not. I am a university student so I have cost constraints.

**2. I have had colitis and ulcers since birth, now diagnosed as crohns but in ""remission"" meaning there is still some ulcers and inflammation but all I can do is monitor it because not severe enough to take medication**

I was told to go on a low fodmap diet, which i didn't because it doesn't really solve anything and kind of implies I have to be on it forever, because if I stop it will come back.

I have IBS- C, bloating, indigestion, etc. many food intolerances, mouth symptoms like ulcers, burning, sourness, bitterness in mouth and white coating on tongue which get worse with some foods,  reflux,

I also have mouth eczema, for around 8 months now

**but the main issue** I struggle with now  chronic pain and muscle tightness in my body. It has been 4 years since covid it started. I had on and off knee and foot pain for years, fatigue, brain fog, anxiety for a long time...

Ive been told it was fibromyalgia, but not anymore. and that I have chronic myofascial pain syndrome, which is not even a useful diagnosis. **And I have benign hypermobility.**

**3. Right now I cope with my symptoms to help using:**

probiotics, aloe vera drink, Traditional chinese medicine

avoiding gluten, dairy, citrus foods (for my mouth eczema), processed foods, sugary foods, fried, spicy, oily I have to avoid, high formal also I try to like garlic and onion makes me mouth peel... and like very dry

...but once I stop it all comes back

For lifestyle I try to do meditation, journalling, qigong, which I try to do consistently, as well as sleeping earlier. My anxiety and obsessiveness around my health is **bad**, but i am trying.

I go physio once a month but it seems kinda pointless just manual therapy and the effects last like 1 hr when I start walking and moving it comes back the tension. 

and the physio can’t give me any simpler exercises , it usually makes the tension and compensations worse . I expected exercises that help with my twisted tightens  and posture I feel , and give relief , but did not get that. So idk if I should find someone else or another modality, but honestly bit tired of it I tried lot and hard to find any better ones in Sydney ….  

It has improved a bit, less extreme pain since the first two years of having chronic pain and tension, and also i started getting more body awareness of the positions and how my body was tensing up. But progress seems too slow and maybe worse...  cuz I ended up having mouth eczema and still having bunch of symptoms...

&#x200B;

**4. I honestly don't know what is the main part of my symptoms, should I sort out my gut, or anxiety, or biomechanics? i question if it is due to my anxiety and trauma, because I've heard people heal symptoms of gut issues like through mind body work, based off the theory of dr john sarno's work of TMS (tensomyositis syndrome).**

**Or should I just stick to what I am doing now for symptom relief and get my routine, in order?** I am quite overwhelmed and struggle to stick to routines or time management. also quite anxious already. But I don't think or know what im doing now if its going to heal permanently or just feeling sub par forever,",0

Just been diagnosed with crohns and looking for advise,"It’s happened very fast and I don’t know how to feel as I’ve never had any problems or symptoms before hand only some joint pain and fatigue

I first got symptoms near the beginning of March this year and it came on very suddenly. I was fine one morning and the same evening I was having extreme stomach pain ,diarrhoea and a lot of blood loss.

I went to the hospital and they found I have very serve inflammation of my bowel and since then I have been on high dose of steroids as everytime I’ve gone down lower than 25 mg on the steroids it flares back up again and I’ve had to go back into hospital each time and I’m now going on Adalimumab next week as a long term solution to help keep it from flaring back up.

It’s just all happening so quickly I haven’t had time to process it and it’s all so new to me and I’m not sure what to expect with the biologics or how’s it’s going to be as I’m already having side effects from the steroids. 

Does anyone have any advice going on the biologics ? Or any ways I can help myself during a flare up especially with the constant joint pain and fatigue I’m having?",0
Medication,"Hey, so long story short, I got diagnosed with UC in early March. I've tried salofalk foam enema, salofalk granules, clipper steroid, octasa suppositories and I'm not getting any relief. I've had the appointment with my Gastro Dr today and he's given me three options going forward. I can have oral Pred but he is reluctant for me to have these as I have a history of mental health issues. Next are immuomodulators and finally humira. I'm going on a pretty important and epic trip at the end of august and I won't have any healthcare without flying out and therefore my GI is keen to try and get me some relief by the time I go. He seemed to be swaying more towards the Humira because he thinks it is more likely to induce remission. 
Can people please give me their opinion on all three options as I'm struggling to make a decision. Humira seems a little drastic as I haven't tried everything else yet but at the same time if it induces remission I'm game. 
For reference, I'm in the UK so insurance etc isn't an issue.

Does mucus/blood in stool strictly depend on diet with IBDs?,"Hi, I'm waiting for my colonscopy. 
I've been seeing lots of blood in stool on and off for years with no other symptoms, but since a month it looks worse and mucus is a new-entry, with also some rare stingy sensation around colon area. GI prescribed probiotics and blood analysis, which are ok except for GOT(182). He didn't say anything yet, other than I surely have an inflammation, so I'm panicking but I guess I can exclude cancer at least. 
As I'm waiting for my colonscopy, I noticed that both blood and mucus radically stopped thanks to a super basic diet (no caffeine, no sugar, no milk, no dry fruit. Only fruit, vegetables, rice, white bread/pasta, fish and meat). As soon as I cheat it seems that blood comes back right away, even if it was a mini-cheat (like a taste of ice-cream one time and a mini-muesli dose the other one.). 

Could such a strict link between blood/mucus in stool be IBDs or is that a way too simple thing to be related to IBDs?",0
"Bloody Stool and a Lot of Other Symptoms, Does Anyone Know What I Should Do?","Hello, I'm a \~5'9"" 130 lb Caucasian/Filipino 21M living in California. I'm not currently taking any medication (besides Tums and 2 days of taking Prilosec), nor do I smoke/drink/etc.  


I've been have quite a lot of symptoms for the past few weeks and they've just been progressively getting worse, so I don't know if I should go to the ER or not. My GI said its UC, Chron's, or cancer; I have a pending colonoscopy mid-June. I don't know if I'm going to be okay, if I'm developing toxic megacolon (or something similar), what I should do, or really anything at all; so if anyone has any insight they can give, it would be really really appreciated.  


Some of my symptoms include:   


Bloody stool, constipated stool, very gaseous (today in specific, which weirds me out hardcore because nothing similar happens to me at all), a huge amount of tightness + pressure + pain all throughout stomach but by far most in the upper middle stomach area right below chest, lots of stabbing pain in the lower left stomach area, fair amount of intermittent stabbing pain in random areas of stomach, incredibly dizzy, a huge amount of tightness + pressure + pain all throughout stomach but by far most in the upper middle stomach area right below chest, lots of stabbing pain in the lower left stomach area, fair amount of intermittent stabbing pain in random areas of stomach, diarrhea (sometimes even just pure liquid), very irregular bowel movements in general (have to go often and it is often light green, very liquid-y, has white-yellow mucus included, or is brown but hard and pebbly), constant headaches, very hungry lately, potential worms in stool (most likely just sesame seeds), near 24/7 100 bpm or higher (I noticed it spikes to and stays around 130-140 when needing to use and while using restroom). All pains above are around 4-8/10 pain, with the average probably being about 6. There are definitely more symptoms than these, but these are just what I could compile right now.  


Again, I don't know what to do or what is happening to me, but I'm just very scared of toxic megacolon or some other potentially fatal disease. I don't know if I should stick it out and wait, go to the ER, or something else. If anyone has any insight or advice at all, I would appreciate it a ton, thank you.",0

Anyone with microscopic colitis? Am I being dramatic?,"33, male. 

I’m a pretty healthy individual, overly anxious (hypochondriac) when it comes to GI stuff after a bad experience about 4 years ago that last 7-8 days of me having 6-8 bowel movements a day and all tests came back fine.

I get these weird feelings that feel like I need to have a bowel movement or even have flatulence but the rectal cavity feels “hot”. Like I just drank a glass of wine or ate a hot pepper and it went straight to the receptors down there and when I know I haven’t had spice, it triggers me to believe there’s inflammation..

I’ve had my Calprotectin checked last spring and as recent as 2 months ago along with other GI tests like fecal fat, pancreatic elastase, stool culture, and pH. Everything came back normal or negative and Calprotectin was at a 7. I know that’s well within normal range but when I get that ‘hot sensation’ it worries that stomach acid or something is causing stuff to be undigested. Don’t really eat spicy foods, had chorizo yesterday with brunch…

I typically defecate once a day in the morning and have actually had 3 days in the last 8 where I didn’t go. (I’m overly scared of going multiple times a day thinking I have some sort of infection). My GI has stated there is truly no need for a colonoscopy at all unless I do want to check for colitis but I feel like I’d have other hallmark symptoms? I have no stomach pain, occasional sensations of nausea but that could be the anxiety..

During other testing I asked for ANA to be checked, it was 1:80 and homogenous. Saw a rheumatologist and she ran about 14 diff types of tests and all those were negative.",0
Newly diagnosed (ish) and medication question,"So just got diagnosed with an IBD although it seems non-descript - I’m not sure how common that is? I’ve just had a colonoscopy and gastroscopy due to elevated calprotectin and nothing was seen in my colon or in biopsies but I had a lot of lymphocytes in my small intestine. I also have chronic gastritis. 

My GI has started me on 3mg of budesonide twice a day and salofalk granules 1.5mg once a day. Are these doses standard or on the low side? 

I’m very anxious about taking new meds because of terrible reactions and past medical trauma, and I’m emetophobic but I know that I have to take these to try to feel better.",0
Any late responders to Xeljanz/Tofacitinib or able to come off IV steroids successfully after second course of them?,"Have been on Xeljanz for nearly three weeks now and still not entirely in remission - doctors are convinced if it was going to work it should’ve ‘rescued’ me by now (2 weeks in total but last 6 days has been 3x 10mg a day, CRP still 16 although they want to attribute that to the IV steroids). Very negative doctors pushing for surgery. 

I have read about so many late responders and people who achieved responses after a few weeks but the doctors do not seem to be convinced by it. 

As a second question, has anybody failed to come off IV steroids the first time when transitioned to oral (especially after 7 days of IV), only to flare and to be put back on them then successfully transition after a second course of treatment? The doctors are sure I will flare again once taken off them today but I’m hoping I will be fine and avoid surgery. Would love to hear some success stories. Last time my CRP went back up to 62 from 26 but that also coincided with many stressors and external problems I had which I’m convinced helped contribute to the flare. The gastroenterologist at the hospital doesn’t seem convinced that bad interpersonal problems, lack of sleep, etc I experienced in those days could’ve contributed so much despite things like those having always made me sick the next day throughout my illness the last few years. 

I guess it’s one thing to treat IBD and another to live with it. 

Appreciate any responses",0
Your experience with Picoprep?,"Hi all, I have a colonoscopy scheduled for tomorrow, probably my fifth or so. However, it's the first time I'm using Picoprep. Before, I had to drink two pitchers of a disgusting liquid.

It took longer for me to show an effect than I'm used to. What freaks me out a little is that I drank the first glass four hours ago and I've only really felt it in the last 1-2 hours.

When I drink the second glass tomorrow, will it take hours again to show its full effect? Cause I've got to take public transport to my colonoscopy, and (due to construction) it takes me one hour to get to my doctor.

Any advice for me? Could I just get up super early and get it over with? I also suspect I didn't drink enough after the first glass because I felt so full. Could that be why it took so long to take effect?

IBD + AS + HPV - Treatment options,"Hello everybody,  
(Long story short) I fit the bill for IBD, Ankylosing Spondylitis and unfortunately have HPV manifesting as genital warts. I'm currently at the end of my two-month Budesonide+Paracetamol treatment suggested by my GI. The treatment helped a lot, but I still get a nasty bowel and joint flare about once a week. I would like to pursue a more aggressive treatment. However, my first colonoscopy is scheduled for the end of the month and I expect my doc to suggest DMARDs or biologics. My fear is that the HPV infection might bloom due to immunomodulators and I will have to stick with steroids and joint pain all over for about two years. Has anybody had a similar experience so far, due to HPV? What were your options and what was your doc's treatment of choice? All opinions are welcome. Thank you all in advance.",0
Biologics experiences?? (Humira/Remicade/Entyvio/Rinvoq),"Just looking to hear from folks with first-hand experiences taking different biologics... My GI wants me to decide which biologic to start after recently having a reaction to Stelara & having been on Entyvio last year with minimal results, and I am overwhelmed with anxiety and fear over what route to go. 😓 They all seem like they have scary side effects and increase your risks for all kinds of awful outcomes. I seem to be the person who always gets the side effects, and after my recent reaction to Stelara, am worried about trying anything new. Would love to hear from folks with any experiences like mine who are usually susceptible to side effects but have found success?? Help?",0
Symptom Tracking App,"Can anyone recommend an IBD symptom tracking app? I’m on Entyvio and doing fairly well but still having symptoms 1-2 days a week.

Colonoscopy all done and looks normal! Feeling frustrated.,"My symptoms were having diarrhoea up to 8 times a day but than also constipation, elevated calprotectin, positive ASCA, constant mouth ulcers, continuous low iron that iron tablets don’t even help, anal fissures, bleeding and mucus in stool. I Had my colonoscopy/gastroscopy on Thursday and the only things that came back were that I have hemorrhoids, hiatus hernia and fundal gland polyps. The gastro did random biopsy’s but I doubt anything will come back and they will be all normal. I’m happy but at the same time still have no answers so I am frustrated too. Maybe this is just my normal 😩",0
Wildly different calprotectin levels despite similar symptoms.,"F25.

I've been having gut issues since forever, but always put it down to a variant of normal. Last year I was sick for a month 6+ BM/day with +/-mucus/blood. Also had night sweats and a low grade fever throughout that month. Lost a bit of weight and went into the underweight BMI.

I eventually went to the GP who ran some tests. Results were borderline low Hb and calprotectin at **2300**. I was  referred for a scope but eventually turned it down since I felt somewhat better and didn't want to waste resources on probably nothing (I work in medicine).

Spent the next few months with on/off diarrhoea with mucus but rarely blood. Recently went back to the GP who ordered bloods that showed lower Hb (100) and ferritin (6) than last time as well as slightly raised platelets (marker of inflammation). The GP suggested repeating the calprotectin and getting referred again if the result was high.

The thing is, despite getting frequent diarrhoea with blood/mucus again my recent calprotectin came back at **44**.

Not quite sure what to make of this. I'm assuming if I still have symptoms the GP will have me repeat the stool test again in a few weeks/months and will monitor my iron levels.

Has anyone's calprotectin varied like this without doing anything?

Edit: Tests for parasites or bacteria (including C diff) were negative on that first stool test. Coeliac screen was also negative.",0

Small Bowel Enteroscopy,"I posted recently about my symptoms and positive ASCA. Since then, I had my MRE and it showed very focal thickening in my terminal ileum. My GI told me he wasn’t confident he could get to the spot with the traditional scope, so he sent me to a specialist who performs small bowel enteroscopy. I had that done yesterday. The doctor who performed the procedure said everything looked pretty normal. I got my pathology back today and everything was normal except my terminal ileum showed “prominent lymphoid aggregates”. Not too sure what that means (I mean I know what it is, but I’m not sure if there is any clinical significance) or if anyone else has experienced this. I will call my GI doc on Monday. I’m just so frustrated. I’m losing weight, having HORRIBLE pain, urgently using the restroom multiple times every other day (it’s mostly mucus and bright red blood), and my energy level is dwindling. I’m actually getting to the point of depression. Of course I don’t want it to be anything serious, but I’m sick of being told it’s IBS and nothing works. Sorry for the rant!",0
passing nifedipine ointment?,"a little TMI but my doctor had no answers and i can't get the right combination of terminology to get any info on if this kind of thing existed in clinical trials 

does anyone else find that about an hour or two after using nifedipine ointment, you pass little bits of yellow ""gunk""? no stool. i originally thought this was mucus but after logging symptoms for a few weeks consistently i have realized this only happens after using the ointment.

edit to clarify: i imagine this is just what of the ointment i haven't absorbed, i don't believe this is any new ""symptom"" of anything! i just don't know if this is normal, or if it's a sign i am using too much, or if it means looking to a different compounding pharmacy!",0

Very Confused about Biopsy + Follow-Up Results,"Hello,

I've been having anal GI symptoms (fissures, leakage) for probably 15-20 years, along with fatigue that's been worsening.  However, for the past 5 months and after a gastroenteritis bout, I've been feeling much worse: joint pain (specifically knees, hands), nausea, and occasional vomiting.  I've seen a rheum. and all my joint imaging came back normal (e.g., normal SED + ESR, x-rays, ultrasound).

A few weeks ago, I had a colonoscopy, which came back with ""focal active colitis"" (FAC) in the rectum from the pathologist's biopsy analysis.  Also, the GI found that I have a mildly prolapsed rectum.  The GI said the FAC was from the prolapse, but I can find no mention of such a thing (inflammation being caused by prolapse) in the literature.  I'm wondering if this diagnosis makes sense or if I should seek a second opinion.

Also, re the FAC, I haven't abused NSAIDs, have no current infection that I'm aware of, and the literature I've read indicates that FAC is only a symptom of bowel prep in cases where people use phosphate prep., which I didn't (I used propylene glycol + biscodyl).

Thanks in advance!!",0
What other tests should i ask the gastro doctor for? Warning long post!,"For the past few years ive been having gastrointestinal issues that have become more recurrent. The main symptoms are loose stools several times a day where I have to wipe a ton and the smell is pretty bad. They arent straight diarrhea (sometimes they are) but not solid either. It seems like I feel the urge to have a BM almost immediately after eating. Most of the time it feels incomplete. Some days ive also felt constipated and only pooped little round balls but thats more rare. Also experience a lot of gas at times and some heartburn which i take famotidine for. Lately ive started experiencing stools that look odd to me.. the color is a lighter brown with a yellowish color to it. The stool itself looks fluffy and soft and breaks apart.  I recently had a colonoscopy/EGD ordered by my gastro doctor and the results came back with nothing concerning, no H.Pylori. The only thing noted was Chronic inactive gastritis and I was given a fodmap list from the surgeon, so im assuming he believed me to have IBS. I never got to have my follow up appointment with gastro to discuss results but I will in September..long waits here for this speciality. I was wondering what other labs/tests I could ask for to rule out other things besides IBS at my next appointment? 
The tests ive had already are:
 fecal calprotectin ( this showed moderate inflammation),
C diff (negative) 
Celiac test (negative)
 Lipase bld (normal)
 Abdominal ultrasound upper rt 
(did show a borderline dialated common bile duct 0.7cm but they werent concerned)  
Enteric bacterial panel (negative) Cryptosporidium (negative) 
Hepatic elastase (negative) 
wbc, rbc are always fine
platelets moderately elevated 450-490
potassium usually lowish range 3.4-3.6

what should i do?,"suspected ulcerative colitis here; inflammation found in my lower left colon from a ct scan back in march and stool samples confirmed the inflammation… ive been having issues with my stomach for about 6 months now, but yesterday i was struck with really uncomfortable stomach pains in my lower left part of my stomach where the inflammation is and it’s incredibly different to the fleeting stabbing stomach pains i often get. it’s not super severe, im still managing to eat just fine and i don’t have (worse) diarrhea and blood than what i’m used to, and the pain isn’t leaving me bedridden but i did somewhat struggle to sleep last night because of it, and im understandably worried as i haven’t had this kind of pain before and im not sure if it’s wise to wait for my sigmoidoscopy that’s booked for next wednesday… what should i do? leave it and wait it out until wednesday or risk it getting worse and becoming seriously ill? …i have awful anxiety regarding hospitals and anything clinical and i don’t want to go to the hospital if it’s unnecessary and wasting their time but im just understandably so worried. im scared i’ve left this untreated for too long and now im gonna become seriously unwell :(

i know it’s bad to google stuff but i’ve read something about toxic megacolon? but im not sure because they all say that symptoms are *severe* stomach pain and things like fever which i don’t have… apologies if i seem extremely paranoid, my anxiety has revolved around health for years so now i’m actually faced with genuine health problems im not coping too well… i thought it would be good to get some advice from people who have the same issues to see where i should go from here.",0
Smoothies for Early Morning Prednisolone Dose with Ulcerative Colitis?,"I recently started taking Prednisolone for my Ulcerative Colitis flare up. For the first week I took the enteric coated tablets on an empty stomach at 4am but I've since switched to the non-coated version so I still want to take it at 4am to avoid disrupting my sleep.

However, I struggle to eat right after waking up as I train at 5am before work. After trying different diets, I've found that an OMAD (One Meal a Day) diet focusing on high protein and low carbs works best for me. I usually eat my one meal around 9-10am but taking Prednisolone then disrupted my sleep.

I'm thinking of incorporating smoothies into my morning routine to have with my Prednisolone dose. Has anyone else tried this? I'd love to hear about your experiences and get some ideas for what to put in these smoothies.  

Any input is greatly appreciated! This is a tricky balance so I'm open to any recommendations.",0
"New flare, left-sided abdominal pain","Hi pals,

I’ve got indeterminate colitis (definitely MC, but sometimes have bleeding and had visible inflammation on scope) and had been in remission on remicade for about a year. Then I had a deeply stressful event happen about three weeks ago and BOOM. Abdominal pain and liquid urgent shits multiple times a day, all getting worse, ever since. I’m about to start budesonide because prednisone makes me a crazy person but in the meantime, any ideas for how to cope with the abdominal pain? It’s worse this time around than my last flare. When my GI touched my belly it made me gasp because it hurt so much on the left side.

Atlanta GI recs?,"Hi everyone! I just moved to Atlanta and am looking for a GI doc here. I've had UC since I was 19 (32 now). I don't care about the gender of the doc, mostly I just want a doc who won't prescribe that big nasty jug of awful prep juice (Golytely)! I've had 3 different types of prep: 

1. Mixing miralax powder with gatorade and taking miralax pills. This prep was my fave bc the powder was tasteless and I could easily keep it down. 
2. Suprep bowel prep: this one tasted nasty but it was a smaller amount so this was doable as well. Tasted like grape salty thick water :'( but I was able to keep it down. 
3. Golytely / (Golytely, Nulytely, Moviprep, Plenvu, Gavilyte) - the big massive jug that is the absolute nastiest thing to drink. I really could not keep this down as hard as I tried. 

I did have an appointment already with a doc at Emory but she said she'd only do the Golytely for prep even though I told her I couldn't keep it down last time. I'm wondering if anyone sees a doc near the Atlanta area who is open to other prep options? Thanks in advance!",0

IBD and Twins?,"Hi all, 
I have been having GI issues for 3 years. I am in my early 20s. The past year has gotten worse - resulting in over 40 lbs of unintentional weight loss, some of the worst diarrhea and stomachaches I’ve ever had, and started approaching starvation from lack of appetite. 

I finally decided to see a GI doctor. We did blood tests, and she decided to skip the stool tests altogether and go for an endoscopy + colonoscopy combined. 
My vitamin D was the only thing abnormal, at just about 10ng/ml, so a clear deficiency. My scopes are mid June. She prescribed me sublingual hyoscyamine for the meantime until my scope as well as a vitamin D supplement. 

Hyoscyamine has increased my appetite somewhat I will say, but has been lacking in what it is actually supposed to do. It dulls the average stomachache a good bit and will somewhat harden stool, but the bad cramping/wateriest diarrhea are too much for it. I am still struggling with extreme cramping and profuse watery stools 1-3 times a week after popping a sublingual tablet. I will take it preventatively some days even and it still will not help. 

Where I am concerned is if scoping and everything ends up being a waste of time and I just have IBS. I am an identical twin and my twin does not share the same GI issues. Sometimes they do have some run-ins with the ‘’runs’’, but it’s not a consistent thing like mine is. My doctor did say it was a bit more unlikely for me to have an IBD if my twin doesn’t have IBD symptoms either. I know most cases of IBD are genetic, but is it possible I could be unlucky with an environmental/lifestyle cause?

I’m just curious and at a loss of what to do. In a lot of pain and weak and tired. 

Thanks everyone.

*TLDR; I have IBD-like symptoms but my identical twin is normal. Should I still seek testing for IBD or look towards IBS?",0
Are these symptoms IBD?,"Hello.

21M

I've been having constant flareups for over a year now. I've been diagnosed with multiple things by multiple doctors, but all of the medication they gave me got my flareups even worse.

By own experience - I cant eat: dairy, gluten, anything raw, red meat, high in fiber foods, fried, spicy, salty, sweet, extremely intolerant to nuts and almonds...

My symptoms during flareups are:

- strong pain in lower left abdomen (concentrated), maybe lower-center or lower-right (above appendicitis) and basically nowhere else;

- extremely strong bloating;

- tiredness;

- constant constipation.

I did colonoscopy, I had literall cuts in my large intestine (2 spots) that were still bleeding and looked like cat scratched the walls.

I also got diagnosed with dysbiosis (disbalance of gut bacteria) and with bile reflux (gallbladder juice going up in the stomach). Most recently, with IBS. even tho they were diagnosed by analysis, the medication got me worse with the flareups symptoms.

My everyday diet consists of only: Boiled chicken breast (without salt), boiled buckwheat, boiled carrots and potatos, banana or grated apple (without skin). oat breads.
I drink 3 litres of water minimum and am physically active. (only now I feel better from symptoms, with this strict diet)

Pain in the lower left abdomen first started when i was relaxing in silence. as soon as i would relax my abdomen, pain would emerge with bloating and would not stop for hours.

I am really out of choices and confused. I dont know what to do to live my life again. Anything you think I could use, I would be glad to hear.
I dont even know what I have.
IBD community is my last hope.

Thank you in advance.",0

Has anyone else had these symptoms?,"Hey guys! I (21 Born F) have a GI appointment tomorrow & am not seeking “medical advice"", just wondering if anyone has had similar symptoms because I’ve been toiling over this since it happened (Content warning, its very gross)

Ive had disordered eating for the majority of my life. In college I had pretty bad IBS symptoms, constipation & urgency but never medically concerning. The day before yesterday I was a bit stressed about my work hours but not even close to as anxious as I was every single day at past jobs. My full list of symptoms & timeline is as follows:

symptoms:
brightish red in stool (started with clear & yellow mucus, which was present for rest of day, with occasional leaking) 

constipation+diarrhea, frequent unhelpful bathroom trips

lower gut pain (enough to wake from sleep, more stress = more pain, slightly debilitating. All stomach pain was concentrated around & below bellybutton) 

trouble regulating temperature (too hot then instantly too cold)

shortness of breath 

lightheadedness & heavy nausea

physical weakness

timeline:
3am-7am: went to bathroom a few times, restless with light pain, constipated but didn’t check stool 

9am: clear & yellow mucus (present for rest of the day) pain continues to increase until ~5pm

10am: able to do small bowel movements, noticed blood in stool (small piece & spots of blood)

11-3pm: a little more blood in the next stool, stool afterwards had most blood (appeared on toilet paper)

3-6pm: went home, took softener+laxative, pain lessened & able to fall asleep

today: having no symptoms other than light stomach pain & some constipation. possible spots of blood but not even close to amount from yesterday.

Ive also had two general blood tests recently. This could easily be unimportant, but the only listed abnormalities are as follows:

4/11/23 - A/G ratio 2, Carbon Dioxide 23

5/3/23 - A/G ratio 2.3, Carbon Dioxide 19 along with LDL Cholesterol Calc at 107

I am REALLY confused as to how my symptoms could get so bad then largely vanish so quick. Id be really interested to know if this is the worlds first original experience or if anyone else has had symptoms start then stop so suddenly. Again I am not seeking “medical advice” as I have a GI appointment tomorrow, Im just anxious & can only think about this. Thank you so much for reading this, ill be updating tomorrow with any additional info! EDIT: reddits weird formatting issues lol

Has excessive Vitamin E from a skin lotion caused my unexpected flare up of Ulcerative Colitis?,"So I'm currently experiencing an unexpected flare up of my Ulcerative Colitis that's not easing up with my usual treatments. I'm trying to determine if any recent changes in my routine may be the cause.  

One possibility is that I've been applying Palmer's Cocoa Butter twice daily for the past 2 months for laser tattoo removal. This product contains high amounts of Vitamin E. 

After researching side effects of excessive Vitamin E, I saw that diarrhea is a common symptom. 

Could the Vitamin E in this skin lotion that I apply daily be the cause of my UC symptoms flaring when I didn't make any other changes to my diet or medication?

Does this excessive Vitamin E absorption through my skin sound plausible as a trigger for my UC symptoms worsening after being controlled for so long? Any insight is appreciated.",0
IBD diagnosis pre-endoscopy,"Hello everyone hope your all feeling well
Could do with some advice to ease my mind with abdominal cramps but no other symptoms 
I'm 29/m from the UK
So in February I lost my job of 7 years which caused massive amounts of stress, started a new job pretty much the week after but the new job is very demanding and constantly end up doing 12 hour shifts, my eating schedule got really messed up and due to finishing late every day I ended up having fast food every day for about a month.
Along with at least 6 coffees a day to keep me going. 
In early March I started getting very light abdominal sharp pains, not enough to call pain but enough to notice, a quick massage of the area would see the pain disappear.  
2 weeks after I thought ild book a doctors appointment. Dr instantly said gastritis caused by stress/caffeine and use of Ibuprofen 
I've suffered with rheumatoid arthiritis since I was 9. Suspected ankolysing Spondylitis is a recent diagnosis from 2021. 
I was taking Leflunomide 20mg for around a year for arthiritis but stopped taking when the pains in my belly came.
Always taken Ibuprofen on bad flare days from RA and back pain but stopped taking those with the gastritis diagnosis
Anxiety levels have been crazy, not even wanting to get up to go to work most days.
Booked another appointment 4 weeks later as the sharp feeling was still present, it comes maybe 10 times a day and lasts a few seconds.
DR ordered a FIT test and a stool sample.
FIT test was negative for blood but feacal calprotectin levels were 427.
All blood tests are 'perfect' he says.
I've been reffered to gastro and have my appointment on the 1st of June.
My DR now says I have IBD as it could be linked with RA, but reading up most people with IBD have constant diarrhea 
At the time of my 2nd appointment I had a few weird looking mouth ulcers and alot of spots at the tops of my legs which have since cleared up.
Im 6ft and always weighed around 11.5 stone, I've lost half a stone over the last 3 months, but i have completely cut out fizzy drinks and started bike riding every weekend.
My stools have been pretty much normal over the last 3 months, with horrible diarrhea lasting 1.5 days only once after eating a pizza :S
I can sometimes go 2-3 days without a single pain or discomfort, but it always comes back

I don't get constipated, sometimes have small pebbles at the start but a normal stool follows 

Does anyone else with IBD have no diarrhea?",0
Diagnosed with IBS-D but it's responding to Humira???,"I (30F) have been on Humira prescribed by my derm for close to three months now for psoriasis, PsA, and HS. It is my first biologic and honestly has been life changing so far. I've had skin, joint, and stomach issues since early childhood. I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy when I was 23 which was negative for IBD and celiac. I don't think any biopsies were taken. I was told I just had really bad IBS-D and some hemorrhoids that they left alone. However, with how bad my symptoms are I've long wondered if the doctors were somehow wrong. Also, none of the medications prescribed, psychotherapy, or diet changes for IBS have been remotely helpful. 

Since starting Humira, this is the FIRST time in my ENTIRE life I have been almost symptom free for any of these 4 conditions. My stomach issues are not totally resolved but they're astronomically better. The amount of times I have to go to the bathroom most days is now once or twice a day, sometimes not at all. I still have bleeding sometimes, but not as bad as before. I'm now even able to tell what foods piss off my stomach the most. Before it didn't matter what I ate. 

My question is, has anyone else had something like this happen to them? I don't know if it's worth me going back to the gastro (who I haven't seen in 4 years cause it felt pointless) or to a different gastro for a second opinion if things end up well managed on this medication. I know IBD can be very serious, and I want to make sure I'm doing what I can to care for my body regardless of what it is, but especially if it is in fact IBD and not IBS. The fact that I haven't had to have a surgery or a hospital stay does make me hesitate about it being IBD. Ultimately I don't know how to make sense of it all.

You can do this don’t stop now” the last one was a comment I got from my yoga instructor. Im almost done with a 200 hour yoga teaching program and that’s where I get the most of these comments. 
I finally found a community that I enjoyed and now 1. It feels like I’m failing. Falling behind everyone else because the hot yoga is too much for me right now. And 2. The support I want is ACTUALLY to be supported.

What questions do I ask doctor?,"Hi everyone. I’m not sure if I’m the right group or not, but I figure this is a good place to start. I am seeing my new-ish GI doctor on Thursday and I don’t know where to start. I’ll try to give a brief rundown:

38yo female, history of constipation

March 2022, I had my gallbladder removed after having an attack with classic symptoms including nausea, vomiting, RUQ pain. This included a CT scan with contrast in which they noted that there were no dilated or thickened bowel loops noted.

June 2022: started getting pains again in the area where my gallbladder had been. It ran from the site of the missing gallbladder straight down to about 4 inches directly to the right of my bellybutton. Returned to surgeon complaining about the pain. They did abdominal ultrasound and only findings were fatty liver (non-alcoholic) and a small liver cyst and slight widening of the common bile duct. In September 2022 I had an upper endoscopy done (I also have a history of reflux) with no remarkable findings.

The abdominal pain continues off and on. Sometimes it lasts for weeks, then will go away for weeks.

November 2022: I move to a new state. Have to get established with new doctors everywhere. The move was very stressful. Can’t see the new GI doctor until March 2023.

February 2023, I have abdominal pain so bad that I go to the ER. They perform a CT scan without contrast. They suspect that I have kidney stones (I don’t). The report says “colonic diverticulosis with evidence of acute colitis.” That is the only abnormal findings other than a repeat of non-alcoholic fatty liver and the small liver cyst. Nobody at ER even mentions the diverticulosis or acute colitis and they send me on my way with an steroid shot only.

March 2023, I see the new GI doctor and I’m still having the localized pain, only now it is almost entirely in the right middle quadrant, about 4 inches right of my belly button. He thinks I might have SIBO and thinks my abdominal pain is stress related. I do the SIBO test at home and it’s negative. GI doc says take miralax daily and come back in June- he doesn’t even acknowledge the results from the recent CT scan.

May 2023, I’m still having the localized pain and it’s still in one spot only. I’ve been taking miralax (half cap) daily because a full dose gives me diarrhea. The half capful gives me roughly 3-5 BMs daily and they are all sort of loose BMs. I’ve also seen blood in my BM now, so I called the GI doctor and they are finally having me come in sooner- next week.

So my questions are: what questions should I ask the doctor? I really am confused if my most recent CT scan is something to be concerned about. And why didn’t the diverticulosis show on my CT scan back in March 2022? I’ve also been googling and of course everything says colorectal cancer, so I’ve also stressed myself thinking what if I’ve developed CRC and that’s actually what it is instead of diverticulosis and the colitis? That could also explain the blood. But the only things I can think of for localized pain are IBD, IBS or CRC. So that’s why I’m here, to ask all of you how I can get a diagnosis for the stomach pain and blood in BM.

Anyway, any feedback would be appreciated. I am pretty certain that I need a colonoscopy to get some real answers but I am worried I’ll be brushed off due to my age.",0

should I go to the hospital if this keeps up?,"I have been having violent bouts of diarrhea everyday for almost 4 weeks now. it wasn't so bad when it happened every 2-3 days,but now it's everyday and nothing I do is stopping it.

Was dr wrong to not biopsy?,"I am a 23m, since past month now, had been suspecting ibd or inflammation of some kind to explain my symptoms. I asked the doctor doing colonoscopy to take biopsies, but when he didn't see anything, he said he didn't, although he still should have based on my concerns, symptoms, and recent lab results. He just recommended I take miralax once a day for constipation which doesn't even address the problem. Was he wrong to not take biopsies despite concerns and asking  or am I wrong?

Problem symptoms (worsened over at least 1 year now):

- persistent (all the time), worse on eating, burning and bloated type, hurts to even inflate belly, pain on movement, 6/10, abdominal pain outlining all of colon in multiple regions like right, top, left, bottom.

- feel like a block, inflammation, swelling in rectum where tail bone is, which causes constipation but my stool is as stated below

- weight loss over all despite eating well and enough

- severe pain flares, 9/10, lasting days to weeks, radiating down from upper abdomen in gut. Have had these at least 2-3 times now

- stool is always on yellow than brown, not compacted, easily seen food bits, semi diarrhea paste structure, disintegrates in water easily

- not sexually active, but got 2 utis and feel like rectum is always warm, inflated, and close to urinary system internally (colonoscopy dr said he didn't see fistula)

False negative biopsies?,"Anyone ever gotten one from a colonoscopy but were later diagnosed as positive? I think I may have been given a false negative 2 years ago and I have suffered ever since and am thinking of getting another colonoscopy. During my initial colonoscopy  they found colitis, ulcerations, and inflammatory polyps, and my GI thought I would have been positive for ibd but it came back negative. Later I have developed anal fissures and I for many years had an anal skin tag until I had it removed. My main issue is discomfort, like a pressure when I sit around the rectum (along with tailbone pain), but I also get diarrhea too sometimes but that's a mild issue compared to the sitting discomfort which I think is caused by inflammation. I think I may have perianal crohns but I'm so disheartened by a lack of a diagnosis.",0
UC flare & pregnant,"As the title says, I’m currently pregnant and am in a flare. I have been in a flare for the best part of a year on and off. With only a couple of weeks respite between bad bouts. 
I must have conceived during a flare and have heard that if you conceive during a flare it usually lasts the whole pregnancy well, so far this statement is living up to be true. I have to add that during my flares I’m not so bad I need to be hospitalised but I am at my wits end. I have been back and forth to the GP no end of times and they’ve referred me to the hospital twice (urgently - so should be seen within 2 weeks) and I have had nothing! The hospital keep cancelling my appointment because they say I don’t need it as my UC is ‘mild’. This condition is debilitating, I barely leave the house, I can’t walk round the block without needing to get to a toilet urgently - I am having bad braxton hicks which makes it worse and I just really honestly don’t know what to do! I have never been on any medication for UC as I’ve never been so lucky as to get to see a consultant after my diagnosis through a letter they sent to my home. 

Im really at a loss - someone tell me it gets better! Im 25w pregnant and i am seriously depressed that I’ve got another 15 weeks of this potentially.

Former UC patient with an Ileostomy - Issues with wearing tucked in shirts,"Hello everyone!

As someone with an Ileostomy, it is very difficult for me to wear pants with a tucked shirt. I always leak, and it can get very embarrassing and cumbersome during my work hours. I recently matched into a residency program in the United States, and part of the dress code, is wearing tucked shirts during outpatient clinic hours. 

I have tried multiple belts and stoma guards, but they are both uncomfortable and cause leaks to routinely happen. 

I am very frustrated, and have no idea how to go about resolving this. I have tried nearly every product under the sun, and nothing works. 

If anyone's had similar issues or advice on how to overcome this, I would love to hear about it!

Can I take enteric coated Prednisolone without food?,"I have been prescribed enteric coated Prednisolone tablets, but my doctor said I should take them with food. However, the purpose of enteric coating is to allow tablets to be taken without food, right?  

I am wondering if it will be okay for me to take my Prednisolone without food since I wake up at 4:00 AM and do not eat until 9-10 AM. I want to take the medication at 4 AM so that it has sufficient time to wear off before I go to bed at 7 PM.   

When researching online, I found conflicting information about whether or not it is okay to take enteric coated Prednisolone without food. Some websites say that it's fine, while others recommend taking it with food. I'm unsure what to do, so I'm hoping someone here can provide guidance based on their experience with enteric coated Prednisolone. Any input would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance.",0

My symptoms have not been this bad since I was diagnosed, and have also lasted much longer than normal, leading me to make my first GI appointment in several months.

Bloody diarrhea with uncomfortable stomach and terrible gas for a month,"Hello,

Like the titles says, I started having bloody diarrhea about a month ago and it started out with me going to bathroom probably 5-10 times a day and has now slowed to down to 1-2 but still bloody diarrhea.I have been passing gas a lot that smells HORRIBLE. Like bad enough for a whole room to question what I’ve been eating. Before this started, I was having a bowel movement about once a day but still feeling kinda constipated. Occasionally saw a tiny spec of blood on toilet paper but assumed it was hemorrhoids due to constipation. Assumed constipation was due to high protein diet as I do take the gym pretty seriously and eat pretty decent with high protein. lower back has also been a pain for a while now but I just attributed it to lifting since I workout everyday.

Something I found weird: the diarrhea started about a week after I switched to pretty aggressive cutting diet of around 2200 calories. At one point it seemed like it was only blood coming out and no stool. That only lasted the initial week and now I am having regular diarrhea with some blood in it. 

FYI, I currently have an appointment with my PCP scheduled for 5/25 but still have questions:

Does this sound like IBD to those who have been diagnosed? Could it be anything else after it’s been happening for a month? Stool culture said there was no infection like E. coli or salmonella.

Should I go to the ER? Will they even be able to do anything for me? (Also very costly) and I don’t necessarily feel bad although when I need to use the bathroom I need to go quickly. I have still been living normally for the most part.

Also, whenever I exercise, my stomach feels completely normal and I’ve never had to use the bathroom at the gym, even when it first popped up and I was going 5-10 times a day.

Please just lmk your guys thoughts. I am aware I need to see a doctor and plan to but have another 15 days until just the PCP is available ( I know I’ll likely have to wait again to see a GI).

Thanks in advance for any thoughts or suggestions.",0

Not Going Well,"This is going to be graphic, but I’m confident y’all can handle it. 
Started a yoga teacher training program in may, by march I was experiencing constipation for 2 weeks, which led to an internal hemorrhoid. 
Started adjusting my diet (so I could poo) and then comes the blood. Some of you might be able to relate but I also struggle with anemia, so when I see blood in my stool I take note. Before my diagnosis my hemoglobin was at a 6, so it’s something I have a lot of anxiety over. 
It wasn’t too bad and getting better until Saturday night. Imagine squeezing red food coloring into the toilet. Steady stream, just blood. It was like a faucet. I’m calling it a “watergun for blood” 
I went to yoga the next morning bc I was feeling okay and it was not a good practice. I felt so weak and woozy so I called my dad and told him what was happening and he told me it was time to go to the ER. Long day and lots of tests, inflammation, hemorrhoid, AND gallstones. And today I think I have a UTI. I hope it’s just whatever that stuff they put in my IV for the CT scan is being flushed out but it feels like a UTI and that would be just peak bullshit. 
Idk man, my body is working against me, I don’t know what to eat anymore. Anything I eat is going to make one thing or another feel worse. I feel defeated. And tired. I didn’t give myself the compassion at first, “oh you’re tired? Everyone is tired, get over it” “oh you don’t feel good? Tummy ache? There are people dying, you’re fine” but today it’s like I can FEEL everything that’s going on in my body and I just feel sad. That’s it. I’m just sad. I don’t know what to eat, I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to deal with this anymore. Does anybody have any words of encouragement to get me through at least today.",0
How mild can symptoms be?,"I’m 27 and trying to prove a point to my mom. Last week, I ended up in the ER for what I thought was my gallbladder going bad. Tests revealed its colitis. WBC & platelets were high too on blood work. Also have had high inflammatory markers that no one has figured out for the last few years. 

For as long as I can remember I’ve had gut issues. It’s been brushed off as IBS & my celiac. 

Symptoms: 
Off and on diarrhea (sometimes with blood) 
Fatigue 
Joint pain 
Low vitamin d levels 
Stomach pain
Food sensitivities 

I saw my PCP and GI and they’re unsure if it was some type of infection that caused the colitis or if it’s IBD related. PCP believes it’s IBD and it’s fueling the joint pain. 

After doing research, I’ve convinced myself it’s crohns. I get an endo and colonoscopy in early June. 

When you were diagnosed how mild were symptoms? My mom is convinced it can’t be IBD because “I’m not sick enough”.",0
Anyone with IBD also struggle with acne?,"I was diagnosed with Crohn’s in 2000 as a teenager, and though it’s been 20 years, I still struggle with (usually cystic) acne.

I feel like the only middle aged person on the planet with this issue.

Some of the things I’ve read about acne and our gut say that often if you have an imbalance in your gut (ie, Crohn’s or UC or another autoimmune disease) it often shows in your skin. 

I’m not sure what magical answer I’m hoping for…just curious if anyone else deals with this or has any suggestions or just can commiserate. It’s really affecting my self esteem.",0
When is the best time to take Acidophilus Probiotic Tablets?,"I recently purchased some Acidophilus Probiotic Tablets and the instructions say to take them one hour before bedtime. However, I've read that taking acidophilus on an empty stomach can cause diarrhea and gas.

Possible IBD,"Hello friends. I’m not looking for a diagnosis since I’ve already been diagnosed. However, I’m not convinced I received the correct one and want opinions I suppose if you’ve dealt with anything similar.

Almost a year ago now, I started having cramping with my bowel movements and it was almost all diarrhea. It started out of no where. I thought it was a bug but it didn’t go away and I let it go about a month so I went to my dr. They did a stool test and told me I had white blood cells in my stool. Gave me antibiotics and the symptoms stopped while taking the antibiotic. Started back the day I stopped them. They sent me to a gastroenterologist and they did several blood tests checking for autoimmune issues including celiac and crohns. Everything was normal with that. Gave me a colonoscopy and endoscopy and biopsied me for several diseases. The dr told me I had gastritis and “self limiting colitis”. What I thought was odd was my symptoms stopped the day after my colonoscopy. Like the cleanse cleaned whatever it was out of me lol. I almost went back to normal. They did another stool test to make sure I didn’t have anymore white blood cells in my stool and they said it was all clear. But about a month later I started having the diarrhea again on and off. Not near as bad and crampy but still. And now it happens at the most random times and my dr doesn’t want to see me because I’ve been checked for everything, they say. Telling me I have ibs now. I have huge health anxiety and I’m so worried it’s ibd and it will get worse without treatment. I can’t find very much information about self limiting colitis on the internet. Could this have caused permanent damage to my colon?? Or should I change drs and dig deeper? I was told I wasn’t inflamed enough for it to be considered ulcerative colitis or crohns and that it was very mild. I’m just concerned and don’t really know how to handle this. I carry anti-diarrheal pills with me everywhere now because I never know when it will hit and I don’t think it’s good to take them regularly. I’m 27 and my dr told me this is about the age when autoimmune diseases hit the average female. The only auto immune issue that runs in my family is psoriasis. Could I just be unlucky and maybe I developed ibs from this? I don’t have great insurance and can’t afford another colonoscopy. I can’t seem to pinpoint any of this to a certain food I’m eating but I’m not keeping track very well. Sorry if this is all over the place.",0
Can Cortiment budesonidedo be taken on an empty stomach for ulcerative colitis flare-up?,"Hi everyone,

Luckily in the office I sit far away from his desk but somehow the perfume still finds a way to get to my nose.

Maybe it's like for cilantro that some people think it is delicious and others think it tastes like soap (I am team soap).

Does your society have a tendency to make you feel terrible for being with Migraine,"Hi I am new to this community!

There is something on my mind and I really hoped to be answered. As with title. Does people in your city/region have a tendency to make you feel bad/terrible/guilty for being born with an underlying condition such as a chronic migraine?

In my city, people here do. They’ll look and treat you differently as if you’re an inferior being, or someone that has gravely commited a sin. 

They’ll attribute it as being your karma and behave as though you ought to be ashamed and remorseful for being born with one. They’ll really try to make a point that you deserved to treat harshly as such since you probably might have done something terrible in your previous life, hence you are now born into this life with this condition. Some would also attribute their mean behavior towards you as them being benevolent, so as your past misdeeds in your “previous life” will be finally redeemed through your suffering through them.

I would really appreciate your experience coming from where you are from. Regardless if you did or never did.

If you could share which societies are more empathetic of such underlying condition and free of such misguided belief, please do share as well. I do not wish to spend the latter half of my life putting up with these.

It’s really cruel to myself if I continue to allow myself to be subjected by these terrible experience.",0

Pain relief fantasies...,"As someone who deals with a variety of debilitating head pains on an (almost) daily basis, I've come to develop some pretty wild - and primal - thoughts about how I might relieve some of the pain in my skull. I've never acted on these thoughts, and do not plan to. Though... I do fantasize about them often. And, I wonder if anyone else here has similar thoughts. I'll list some of the pain relief fantasies I have down below:

1. Drilling a hole into my skull to relieve pressure. I know this is actually a real - and very ancient - medical technique known as ""trepanning"". I've had thoughts about doing this for awhile, even before I knew what it was. Since my head sometimes feels like it's going to explode, I wish I could just drill or hammer a chisel directly through my skull. I like to imagine a very satisfying sense of relief would result, but probably not. 

2. Using a scalpel or blade to cut the arteries in my temples to drain excess blood. Sometimes the arteries in my temples start throbbing with pain, usually during stressful situations. I fantasize about draining the blood to reduce the pressure in my head. I imagine a calming sensation after allowing the blood the flow.

3. Using a spoon or other instrument to shift (or completely remove) my eyeballs to relieve pressure. Oftentimes, my head pains derive directly behind my eyes; it feels like there's a ton of trapped air pushing my eyes forward. My instincts tell me to push my eyeballs to the side or remove them to allow the air to escape (I'm aware that there's no actual air - it just feels like it). I imagine a sense of euphoric relief after allowing the air to escape my sockets. 

These are just a few of the weird and primal pain relief treatments I imagine sometimes. When the medications don't work, sometimes you just feel like taking a more... direct approach. 

Though, like I've said, I've never acted on these thoughts before and don't plan to. I'm currently seeing a medical professional for my head issues and I suggest everyone do the same - find a renown headache specialist in your area.

My grandmother just passed away today and I came here for a little rant. Basically as the title says.

I just spend about one and a half hours crying on the phone, and then some more afterwards. And as if the feeling of mourning someone's sudden death isn't bad enough, crying gives me the WORST migraine. Like the kind that makes you wanna squirm and cry even more because the pain is so unbelievably unbearable.

Like... Can we catch a break? I get migraines from the sun, some types of food, excersizing, lack of sleep... All of which are horrible but understandable.

But I get the absolute worst migraines from crying?? Like I'm clearly already suffering since I'm crying, why do us migrainers need to get punished even more from being sad?? Cmon man. On the bright side, I can't really think right now cause my brain is busy trying to crawl out of my skull or something. 

In case anyone reads this and gets worried, I will be fine. I just get really emotional around this kind of stuff and it takes time to process.",0
"Anyone else get these odd symptoms? Painful ears, pain under jaw, olfactory hallucinations. Doctor couldn't care less.","Trying to find one who will actually investigate, but there's nobody accepting new patients. Current doctor says ""that sounds like a migraine"" and that's it.

My primary symptoms when I get a migraine are pain in one side of my head, especially in the front and near the eyes, but also at the base of my skull. Sometimes both sides. Sometimes my teeth, cheekbones, and bridge of nose hurt. Olfactory hallucinations 99% of the time, but never bad smells. Almost always food. I get this even without migraine though, just less frequently.

Everything gets 100x worse when I stand, especially if I'm lying down. I'll get up, make it 10-20ft, then get this incredible spike in pain that'll last for a minute or more. Sometimes it brings me to my knees in pain. 

I've gotten my first visual aura (like flashing rainbow electric arcing around the upper right borders of my right eyes vision) recently which was really freaky, and now the new symptoms are pain in the same ear the rest of the pain is on, as well as pain under my jaw (like where you'd find lymph nodes) and I guess maybe in my soft palate area, but far back.

Doctor was completely uninterested in the new symptoms.",0
WHAT MY MIGRAINES WITH AURA ARE LIKE - WHO CAN RELATE??,"Hello, i’ve had insane migraines with aura since i was 2 years old, a baby. My mom took care of me. Saw top neuros, did all scans when i was younger age about 8-18 ct, mri, sleep tests, etc. all turned out okay. Never had a doctor understand my headaches or correctly identify them. They are not normal, also never found anyone with similar experiences. 

This is what they are like for me, are yours similar?? What did you do?

1. Always occurred about semi-annually (twice a year on average) 

2. Always occur out of sleep. Seemingly always have vivid dream / nightmare as precursor.

3. Mid vivid dream, not fully asleep, then aura suddenly occurs - never any indication before aura or in days before headaches. 

4. Always have an aura first. Aura is extremely debilitating, and painful. Like a full shaking of the head and almost feels like a semi shock.

5. Following about 5 second aura is insaneee shock to the head occurring for about 5 seconds, following aura and massive shock vomiting almost always occurs. 

6. After 5-10 minutes of vomiting no pain but extreme sensitivity to noise and light that will induce another aura and shock and vomitting cycle. 

7. Almost always last 1-2 weeks (7-15 days) of complete incapacity, debilitating sensories, auras and shocks + vomitting.

8. No medicines ever prevented or stopped them. Tried a lot, suppositories because of vomiting, sumatriptan injections, triptan medications, all the way to nasal lidocaine sprays to numb receptors. 

DOES ANYONE HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THIS?!",0
Are daith piercings worth it?,"I, a 29 yo F, have had migraines since my late teenage years. As the years go by they get worse. I'm now at the point where I have a headache every moment of everyday, and they become migraines at least half of the month if not more. My neurologist has no clue what is causing them because all my scans are normal. No medication works for a preventative, and none work for acute treatment either. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope, and I want to figure this out. I have a few people tell me to get my daith pierced and that will help, but I am worried that it will only be a short term solution. Has anyone had it for a long time and it has helped?",0
Jealousy,"I’ve been having one of those low months (well several months) where I feel hopeless. I’m consumed by jealousy for people who can eat candy and chocolate with reckless abandon, enjoy smelling perfumes, drinking and staying out late…the list goes on. I’ve been not making plans with friends or joining them when they go out and I’m worried they will stop asking me. When the migraines are really bad my social anxiety gets worse and I hate canceling plans on people. I have a lot of things to be grateful for like a wonderful partner and a career I love.. I guess I just need to work on acceptance. I’ve been starting to meditate again and I’m hoping that will help but I’m just so sad every day. And I can’t cry or I’ll get a f***ing migraine. Suggestions for zen level acceptance or commiseration are welcome!",0
Chronic migraine going on 10 years. Medication (CGRP) starting to become less effective. What works for you?,"Hi. I was diagnosed with chronic migraine when I was 28. I woke up with a migraine one morning that never went away. I went to the hospital over 40 times the first year. I was pumped full of fluids, IV opioids, Reglan, Magnesium, D.H.E. 45, triptans, Zofran, and Fioricet. I tried Depakote, amitriptyline, Topamax, birth control pills, propranolol, and many more “preventatives.” I developed a severe dependence on the IV opioids and had to be hospitalized for detox. I never had a single day without a migraine for 5 years, with only about 2-3 hours of relief at any point in time when they would administer Dilaudid. I went to sign up for a study for CGRP medications that had not hit the market yet at the time. So there were no CGRP meds at the time available at all. I was not approved for the study but was told the medication would hit the market “in a couple years.” So I waited and then one day I went into my neurologist’s office and was ready to give up when he handed me a sample of Aimovig. I immediately administered it in his office and was desperate for it to work. I started to feel better the next day it seemed. With each day, I started to feel like a normal person again. I got off opioids, off disability, got a job, started a small business… and then about a year ago I started to have more than 5 breakthrough migraines per month again. We went up on the Aimovig, and it calmed down a bit. Now the Aimovig seems to not be working as well once again as I am having pretty frequent migraines again and they are intense. I started to use some Fioricet again but my doctor is very weary of prescribing it. I also have a hard time remembering things and work is difficult from the side effects but I can’t work at all with the migraines. I’ve tried Nurtec and it did not work for me at all. Anyone have any experience with CGRP medications and what has been your experience? Is Qulipta or Ajovy any different from Aimovig? What do you use for breakthrough migraines? What has been your chronic migraine experience?",0
Can I be experiencing migraines without head aches ?,"I’ve been very dizzy for a whole year now. Nothing moves, but I feel very light headed and overstimulated by light. I feel like there is a wall between me and the world. Every doctor I’ve been to told me I have nothing and the neurologist told me I could be having migraines without headaches. 
But I doubt that is the case with me because my dizziness is constant. Can you have these type of migraines for so much time during the day and for so long ? They do go away in the night and during the winter it is better. I just wanna know if I am in the right group here.",0
What did you think was going on before you were diagnosed with migraine? Did you just know you were having migraines/chronic migraine?,"Apparently my grandma had migraines before I was born, but I otherwise didn’t know anyone with chronic migraine before having it myself. Those with episodic pretty much said it was a really bad headache a few times a YEAR. So when I started to have migraines everyday (for years), I had no idea what was happening. 

I was throwing up constantly, so tired, barely able to get out of bed, in sooo much pain, couldn’t stand any sensory input. At first I went to the ER when it didn’t go away for a few days, and they said it was a migraine. But I was like what?? It’s been days and I’ve never had one before and this is a zillion times worse and just so drastically different than a headache? And then the symptoms didn’t stop for years, and I had all sorts of other health problems when the migraines started. I didn’t understand at all I was experiencing chronic migraine and it took doctors way too long to tell me that, by the time I could get referrals and a doctor who listened and rule out other things. I thought I must be having some weird type of seizure or have something like MS or idk, some other rare disorder. Until I had a doctor say these are typical migraines, these are common symptoms, you have chronic migraine, etc, I was CONFUSED. 

Did anyone else not grow up watching people with chronic migraine and had no idea what was happening when it started for you?? Or did you somehow know right away, ‘oh guess you have migraines now’? Did you know from knowing other people with chronic migraine or you were just educated on all migraine can be and that it can be truly chronic before it started for you? I feel like I can’t be the only one super confused by what was going on at first!",0
Migraines due to hot weather,"I find that too much sweating / exercise / exertion on hot summer days can trigger migraines. 

Dehydration is an obvious component I'm sure.

2 month long headache,"Hey, I am 17 and am in seemingly good health. So I’ve had a constant headache for the last 2 months. When it started, I thought I was getting a migraine. I have probably had like 5 or 6 migraines in the last 5 years. My head does not usually hurt when I get a migraine; I just get auras and a lot of numbness, and it goes away in a hour if I sleep it off/ or stay in a dark room. This time my face started tingling/burning, and then I started getting pressure in my eye that turned into a dull headache that still remains. The following days I had a really stuffy nose, so I thought maybe I had a sinus infection. The doctors agreed, and they put me on a course of antibiotics, and after no avail, I got a sinus CT, and it was clear. Sometimes the top of my head tingles, and my jaw and neck hurt. I have tried NSAIDs, the chiropractor, acupuncture, antibiotics, vitamins (magnesium, b complex, turmeric, etc), but nothing has seemed to help. Before onset of the headache, my neck was hurting for a couple hours. Also about two years ago, I was having off and on headaches (some would last hours some days), but they went away when I started seeing a chiropractor. Something else that is notable is that I am like 10 days late on my period; sometimes, I miss my period if I am stressed. I also got my braces off 10 days before I started experiencing this headache. I have had tmj and ear ringing since I was like 10, but it has never caused issues. I also have anxiety. The headache pain ranges from a 2-6. It gets worse when I am not doing anything. Sometimes when I go do stuff, it gets a little better, but I can definitely still feel it all the time. I am not light sensitive. The first week I was nauseated, but now, I rarely am. This whole situation has made my anxiety a lot worse. Before onset, I was not unusually anxious. I do not eat the best, but I can’t see how that would cause such a long headache. This is starting to really affect me, and if it lasts much longer I will seriously loose my will to live. I think the onset is really strange between the neck pain and runny nose, so I am just confused. I am working towards seeing a neurologist/ headache specialist. I am really struggling, and any two sense or suggestions would be helpful. I really want to get this figured out/ managed before I go to college in the fall which is making me even more stressed.

Suggestions please,"I’m peri menopausal and have chronic migraine. Hormones have always been one of my biggest triggers so the last few years have been particularly difficult. I was doing really well the last few months. Trying some new treatments that were helping and because I hadn’t had a period in several months, things were looking up. Until last week, when I had what clearly felt like a hormone migraine that started last Sunday. And I thought, well, that was a good run, but here we go. The only thing is I never started bleeding. Everything else happened. The migraine, cramps, fatigue, nausea. All the symptoms that normally happen, but the period itself still hasn’t made an appearance. Which whatever. I wouldn’t care so much, except that it’s not ending. It’s been a week now, and I’m still having to take my abortive medications multiple times a day just to take the edge off. I’m waking up in the middle of the night having to take more. It’s miserable. I wish I would just either get the period and get it over with, or be done with the migraine. This never ending misery is exhausting. Has anyone else experienced this? And what worked for you to get through it? It has to end, right?
I plan on calling my doctor on Tuesday, but there’s not much I can do right now with it being a holiday weekend, and it’s not bad enough to go to the ER. Not worth the hassle or the expense.",0

Headaches the day or two after sex,"I'm trying to understand something here.

Prevention Meds,"Let me cover the basics first. I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow afternoon. I do *not* have a neurologist as mine passed away, and the three I have been referred to are not taking on any more patients at this time. 

I would like to suggest a couple of medications to my GP that I could go on for prevention. I’m really, really suffering daily. I am in Canada, and I do not have health coverage/insurance. Things like the CGRP meds are out of the question due to the cost. The other complicated aspect is that I only want to try meds that I can take safely while pregnant, as we are hoping to start trying soon and there’s no point in me finding a medication that works if I’ll have to stop it when I conceive. I refuse to start trying before we get the migraines under control. 

Medications I have tried with no results: 
- Magnesium/coenzymeQ10/riboflavin combo 
- Amitriptyline (still on it for other reasons but has not helped the migraines, even at an increased dose) 
- Toradol 
- a few others when I was younger but I forget their names and would be willing to try them again anyways 

So far I want to ask about Lyrica and propeanolol. My migraines are chronic, triggered by weather and stress. Not hormonal or diet related. 

I realize none of us are doctors but I’d love to have a list of suggestions I can pass on to my GP. Thank you!",0

Painless Head Pulsing/Eye blinking when Eyes closed or laying down,"Hey guys. I don't think I get migraines very often, maybe here and there. But Im posting this here because I was wondering if any of you guys can give me some information on this. For a few months now, I've been feeling a strong painless pulsing sensation in my head, like behind my forehead. sort of feels like its in the middle of my head. I would get pulses in my head but very few times in my life. Now its constant. I dont really feel it when my eyes are open, except very very little but its negligible. but when I do strong activity, I feel it more. When I close my eyes, my eyes blink with the pulsing sensation of my head. Like even if they're closed, they'll close tighter with each pulse. And Ive actually told people to watch me, and they say they can see my eyes blinking. If I'm laying down with my eyes closed, its even more prominent. My GP says its probably anxiety but he might order a CT if it continues until the next appointment. I do have a history of depression/anxiety for 2-3 years, but this has just started a few months ago. My blood pressure is normal, only at times its slightly elevated, but usually its like 100-120/66-84. I do have high cholesterol and low Vitamin D. but ive had this for a while now.",0

Recent Abdominal Migraines (AM) Diagnosis After 5 Years Of Symptoms. Anyone Else? Suggestions For Relief? TIA.,"Hello, all! First, I’d like to offer my warm thoughts to everyone suffering with any migraines! 

To make a very long story short, I have recently been diagnosed with AMs after dealing with 5+ years of cyclic nausea, severe cramping/bloating, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding (sorry tmi), motion sickness, and fatigue. I have 3-5 days of relief out of the month.

I feel relieved to have a diagnosis, but saddened to find out how rare this condition is—especially in adults. Of course people around me have stopped showing concern after finding out my condition is functional (affecting the function of an organ rather than the physical tissue or structure). 

All my scans and blood work had good results, and I’m left fighting these symptoms with OTC relievers that barely take the edge off. I’m trying so hard to be optimistic, but it really sucks being in excruciating, ongoing, exhausting pain while everyone around me treats me like I’m being lazy. Some days the pain is so intense I can barely move or think clearly. On the days I can move I’m met with fatigue and motion sickness. 

Is there anyone else struggling with AMs, and what lifestyle changes or OTC products have you found to be helpful? Thank you for making it to the end of this post.💕",0

How am I supposed to complete my education with this?,"I tend to get migraines with aura as a cluster usually before examinations. They do happen irregularly at other times too but when it's most severe it's usually around that period so I think the 'main' trigger is stress.

The visual disturbances, the migraine itself and the brain fog afterwards makes it very hard to study, I'm very lucky if I can at least focus. The uncertainty of the timing of the migraine attack makes me anxious. Whenever I see a flash of light that resembles the aura, my heart starts to race. 

I've tried most of what I can - exercise, getting enough sleep, having enough fluid, 'trying' to manage stress by thinking that the marks I get don't really matter, prophylaxis, regular visits to the doctor...

The fact that I only kinda know my trigger but cannot really avoid it makes me feel like I'm blocked my a brick wall on all four sides and it's quite exhausting. I don't know what else my GP can do for me. I've also tried accessing the services they offer at the university but extra time for completing the tests won't help at all. What can the school do other than tell me to manage my stress better or just drop out? It also feels like I'm using my migraine as an 'excuse' to avoid examinations every time I have to let the professors (+ friends and family) know of my situation, and it feels horrible.

Current medications

I don’t know what cause my head pain.  But over the past two month I have been feeling this weirds squeezing pain on the right side of my head. Near temple area. It in’t really painful like the head pains I get. Feel weird. The closest I can describe it to is like a squeezing pain on your vein. On my other posts of mine I have described my head pains.     


Here is a description from one of my older posts: I started a log to track the amount of migraine or whatever pain this is and the last day of logging will be tomorrow. I have had 19 days of migraines in January. Then past months have been averaging 14 to 15.  These pains started in the summer of 2021 and got a lot worse by may 2022. My mom took me to see a physical therapist cause she was convinced it was just neck pain and posture and the x ray showed that I have neck spasms. I did 2 months of physical therapy and went back and extra two weeks In hopes it would get better but it hasn’t only worse. I have worked on my posture and made an effort the past month to consistently do excerise and take all my vitamins. I did physical therapy October and November and a little bit of December in 2022. In the summer of 2022 I made an appointment myself with a nurse at my campus and she did tests and after me following her recommendations and not improving she gave a referral to get a scan at a neurologist which ended up getting thrown away. The physical therapist said if the pain doesn’t improve I need to make follow up appointment and get mri. That never got made. I finally took it into my own hands and got an appointment at cleavland clinic with a neurologist in December and my mom decided to not take me. I have tried different over the counter medicines which don’t work. I switch between advil liquid gels and excedrin. My family recently got sick with Covid and I am sick also but I haven’t done a test yet so that doesn’t help me either. I had a call with my physician and she told me to try migrelief and it gave me bad side effects and only made it worse. I tried this cefaly and it also made it worse. This pain is around the base of my skull, neck, ear, also where the varix of the angular vein is. And I get random pain on other parts of my skull and face. I have been really trying to improve my self care of taking vitamins daily; having water, exercise, eat healthy enough, sleep in a bit more. I started chiro two weeks ago. First appointment went well second did not.       

I really need advice on the squeezing pain but also the main head pain. Anyone experience this? I will try anything at this point. Any ideas?",0
how to deal with migraine with study pressure?,"How can I deal with migraine attacks when there is a lot of study pressure, deadlines and exams, especially since I am a control engineering student and as you know this is difficult and **I have to be very follow-up in my studies.**

Sandomigran Droopy eye,"OK So this is a bit random.
Anyone tried sandomigran and found their eyes became less droopy?
So my right eye and eybrown are usually droopy about 90% of the time but 10% of the time both eyes are roughly symmetrical. It's quite noticeable. Like I've been asked if I had a stroke. I have chronic migraine and have some degree of pain/symptoms most of the time
I started Sandomigran about 6 weeks ago and just this last week or two noticed my eye has been normal most of the time. Otherwise my symptoms are the same and I have a few side effects from the sandomigran (eg aching muscles, feeling lazy, eating too much). But I'm considerimg staying on it if it's helping my eye, it must be doing something good right?! Or maybe just a coincidence. Anyway I'm curious if anyone has experienced anything similar?",0
How long did it take to emgality side effects go away?,"Besides the severe constipation it made me allergic to my own sweat, like I wanted to rip my skin off. I never had any kind of reaction like that before, and even one month after I stopped taking it, I still get itchy when I sweat.",0

Just discovered this sub and I have things to share. Lets compare notes.,"I've been getting migraines since I was a kid and I honestly feel like I've never encountered anyone who actually understood how bad they get for me. So hopefully some of you do.   
They started for me around age 12. Always light sensitivity/pain in my left eye and pain in left temple/brow. Usually subsides after vomiting. Usually lasting 3-6 hours sometimes all night until I sleep and wake up the next day. 

They got worse in my 20s. basically the all nighters. but they would become so painful that I scream and pull out my hair until I passed out.   
Nothing a doctor has prescribed has ever had a noticeable effect. The only thing that does help are the painkillers that contain, Tylenol, Aspirin, and Caffeine. But sometimes they wont work. 

The only other thing that soothes the pain is if I feel sad. For example one of the things I would do to try to soothe the pain is watch(or listen to rather) the saddest episodes of shows I like. That episode of Futurama where the Frys dog sits and waits for him after he got frozen until it dies of old age is a good one. Somehow being on the verge of tears would help.   


Now in my mid 30s they seemed to have eased. Less frequent, less painful, less debilitating. But still more frequent than I would like, more painful than I would like and more debilitating than I would like.   


Curious how you all compare.",0

Migraines started after COVID,"Hello all- I'm not seeking any medical advice, but wanted to post my story to see if anyone is going through anything similar. I never used to get headaches or migraines, but in August 2020 I caught COVID. The first few months I just had breathing issues, but once those resolved, i started getting headaches in early 2021. Since then, headaches/migraines have been a daily occurrence. 

I've been seeing a neurologist for awhile, and tried a multitude of abortives that didn't help. MRI came back clean. I had a couple decent months with Emgality, but the efficacy quickly waned. After Emgality, I had a series of nerve blocks done to no avail. My most recent treatment has been Botox injections, which has been great,  but the injections are supposed to last about 3 months, but after 6 weeks I'm scared it's efficacy is fading too. I've also tried amitriptyline, but it didn't work and the side effects were too significant.  

I've been out of work for about 12 of the last 15 months, and failed utterly in trying to work through the pain.  I'm very fortunate to be on long term disability, but am no longer employed.  

My official diagnosis is New Daily Persistent Headache or NDPH. My neurologist has very good credentials, but I still feel a bit hopeless because the prognosis is basically ""hopefully it will go away eventually. ""

Has anyone been through a similar treatment trajectory or having your migraines after having COVID? I'm just looking to see if this is more common than I realize or if there's any kind of hope out there. Thanks for reading!",0

Career change,"I’m 28 and have suffered from migraines since a child. I currently work in the ambulance service in the UK doing shift work. 
I take propranolol as a preventative and have rescue meds when I need them but they’re still ruling my life. I’m seriously considering a career change but I don’t know where to start looking that would give me that flexibility and hopefully lead to a reduction in attacks. I’ve previously been through the Migraine Charity in London who are very helpful and my GP is supportive.
Does anyone have any suggestions or been in a similar situation? I would really appreciate any help or advice.

Side note: I absolutely love my job, my migraines do not.",0
Migraines in a new place?,"I have had migraines my entire life and have always done my best to treat them (hide in darkness) and I’m somewhat okay at handling them. Recently though I’m getting migraines that feel like I’ve been punched straight in the face with the majority of the pain in my nose and migrating up to my head. My doctor used to say that it was face masks but I’m still getting them after Covid. I’m not sure what I should do and I wanted to know if someone has a similar symptom and how they treat it.  

My insurance won’t let me see a neurologist so I haven’t seen mine in ten years so I thought I would come to Reddit. These migraines are very painful and new in comparison to the migraines I’ve been forced to grow accustom to.

any migraineurs with POTS here?,"Lifelong migraine sufferer here, mostly ocular but also classic/typical. Starting treatment for MCAS last year seemed to really minimize my migraines. I was recently diagnosed with suspected hyperadrenergic POTS, and attempting to treat that has been a migraine nightmare. The drugs I've been prescribed so far have all triggered migraines for me - propranolol, ivabradine, and clonidine. Ironically, all of these are used to *treat* migraines, but with each of them within an hour or so I've developed scintillating scotoma that turned into full-on migraine. Clonidine was the worst - it caused my BP and heart rate to shoot up to scary levels that almost had me calling an ambulance (I rode it out and was fine). 

Paradoxical reactions (such as elevated BP in response to BP drugs) are pretty familiar to me. Just wondering if there's anyone else in the migraine world here with a similar story and/or any success in treating hyperPOTS?",0
Sucking can provide some temporary relief! (not this isn't dirty!!),"THIS ISN'T DIRTY--GET YOUR MINDS OUT OF THE GUTTER!

Hey friends, I am currently in the midst of a pretty bad attack. We are experiencing thunder storms for about 2 weeks straight now and it is supposed to go for another week (which is insanely rare where I live. It is more common for us to go a year without rain than it is for us to get half an inch of rain at once.) I just thought I would share something that has helped me in the past. I always carry a Brita water bottle with a straw because it 1) makes me drink more water and 2) that sucking sensation will help relieve some of the pain of my migraines. If they get really bad, sometimes I will get something like a milkshake that really requires a lot of force behind it and it seems to help. I know this isn't a permanent solution or anything but sometimes, we just need even the tiniest reprieve. I hope everybody is having a good day. You are more than your pain, even when it doesn't feel like it.",0
Silent migraines,"Hey I just wanted to see what everyone else’s experiences are with silent migraines. 
The couple days leading up to one I tend to have sleep disturbances. Usually the day of, it’s very hard to focus/stay awake and I’m obviously a little irritable from the lack of sleep. When the migraine hits, it’s this total disassociation type feeling (the aura) and inevitably gets to the point where I can’t talk or I stutter/slur my words. This is all accompanied by light and sound sensitivity. All in all it’s something that lasts somewhere around 30 minutes or so but afterward I am absolutely drained (like I’ve been hit in the head with a brick) and it takes a bit for my speech to come back to normal.",0
this is ruining my life,"it literally feels like i have brain damage.

It’s like i have a one track mind on bad days. My balance is terrible, i am hilariously uncoordinated and dizzy all the time. I can’t keep most of my food down because i just vomit it up in the next hour and i can’t watch much TV or anything. my dad treats me like i’m lazy for being in bed all day but sometimes it physically hurts me so much to just stand up that sleeping feels better than being alive. this is so miserable, i wish i could just be normal.",0

Namenda - I think it’s working?,"Let me start this out by saying that I have severe chronic migraine with a MIDAS score that varies between 80 and 115. I have had chronic migraine since I was a child with a strong family history and have multiple family members with daily migraine/headache (including myself). I have tried dozens of medications with only very moderate success with some. 

Now to get to Namenda — I have been on a very low dose of Namenda for around 2.5 weeks. I am slowly working my way up to the full dose of 20 mg over 6 weeks, but I believe 5 mg works for me. I have had several (>5) episodes where I felt a migraine coming on and I took my Namenda and it went away almost completely. 

I went after Namenda as a preventive because another NMDA medicine (Ketamine) works exceptionally well for me as an abortive. 

I will see over time if this is actually what’s happening, but I just wanted to post this here because if someone like me who has been trying migraine preventives for nearly 20 years can find something new to try… so can you! Do not give up hope. If you put in the problem solving work and find the right care team, you eventually will make progress.",0
Ocular Migraine/Migraine with Aura,"So, i have always had headaches on and off behind my eyes around my period. But thursday I experienced my first ever migraine at work. I had the bright white spot on my right eye and thought hm thats weird. Then it got worse and worse, spread to both eyes, I couldn’t see anything. Then I got the squiggly/flashing lines for around 45 min. Put my head down on my desk. My coworker came in shut off all lights and gave me a cold compress. After my vision returned the headache started. I moved to the floor of my office for an hour and took two tylenol. The headache would not let up so they wheeled me to my car in an office chair (embarrassing). 

My mom picked me up. Around 3 hours later the headache was almost gone but turned to a slight dull ache. I slept well. Woke up and still felt a slight dull ache. Went to work. Felt tired and out of it. Then the nausea and dizziness came back. I pushed thru. once home i felt somewhat ok. head still feels “tight”.  Slept fine. 

Woke up today and I feel worse. I took my daughter to gymnastics and sipped a coffee. Literally two sips. Im nauseous again. Very foggy. Almost like the fog I had with covid. Im having trouble concentrating, driving, just feel out of my body. Not hungry at all. Dizzy.

Is this the postdrome? How long until im normal again? Im frustrated I felt better yesterday.  Is this a cause for concern? Should I go to the hospital?",0

Anyone here also have POTS?,"I have CFS and POTS, my CFS has been improving since diagnosis and proper pacing and I could get back to doing half days at work/internship/last part of my degree. Now the half-days are pretty much the limit of my physical ability, I spend each afternoon in bed recovering. 

Also during that time I can rarely if ever lay down, so I get coathanger pain and POTS-headaches, those get better by laying down (would be gone after an hour at most) but by the end of my shift this always has also triggered a migrane which means I now have migranes at least five days a week.

Anyone experience anything similar/has any Tips?

Edit: I currently use bisoprolol, compression socks and increased my water and salt intake. I lay down before work and if possible halfway through, I work in the medical field so often it isn't possible. Exercise is something I'm considering but am wary of because of CFS. The last time I tried for an exercise regiment I crashed and was bedbound for months, so that honestly just scares me a bit (also I'm barely managing the job and keeping myself clean and fed so there isn't much energy leftover).",0

Also, all the medication he gave me has nausea as a side effect which is really annoying because I don’t usually get nausea except with my unilateral migraines.",0

Is it worthwhile to have a migraine alert dog?,"I’ve dealt with migraines for as long as I can remember (I’m 26 now) but within the last few years (~4yrs) they’ve gotten more intense and frequent.

Because of the lack of warning I’m often caught off guard when I’m out an about making things kind of scary sometimes too. My primary care and I have recently discussed whether or not a service dog would be a good idea for my migraines  as well as to maybe help with other health issues. My family has trained service dogs before and I know that can really help some people but is it worthwhile for migraines? Does anyone have experiences with having a migraine alert dog?

What did you feel the first time you took Topamax?,"I'm very sensitive to medications (I couldn't tolerate 100mg of gabapentin after 2 months despite the fact that it helped with muscle pain) and I took my first Topamax last night. It immediately (within an hour) dried me out to the point it was hard to swallow and I was already forgetting words - just entirely unable to recall how a sentence was going to end - by the time I went to sleep two hours after. I woke up with all of my muscles sore and aching and some slight stomach pain. 

I started at 25mg like most people and I know that many symptoms will go away with time. But I'm having a hard time looking up to see whether you're supposed to be affected quite so quickly. It makes me nervous to take another one tonight and the following nights because given the relatively slow half life, for the first few days I'll be adding to the amount of medicine in my system and presumably these effects will worsen.

Constant dull pain for a week straight is this normal??,"So I have been having a constant dull pain on the right side of my head at the top of my head for the past week, I have never had a headache or migraine before. 

It’s a constant dull pain and sometimes it starts to ache for about 5 minutes then it goes back to the dull pain. I will say the pain isn’t that bad when it aches but it is worse than the constant dull pain. It also sometimes tingles around the area of the headache. I did feel it ache down to my jaw and felt pressure behind my eye and roof of my mouth for 1 afternoon but then it went away. I can sleep fine and the constant dull pain doesn’t start until 30-50 mins after I wake up.

Migraines getting progressively worse after beginning only 6 months ago.,"I am 24f and had what I think are migraines develop only about 6 months ago. I’ve never had issues with headaches until one day where I got one and it lasted for 8 days before going to the ER. I didn’t have a problem again for a few months but then it happened again. Now, I have them every couple days and on the days I don’t I still feel like I have pressure in my head/ behind eyes and pain at the back of my head. I also will get floaters in my eyes. I have a neck injury from about a year and a half ago that never had headaches accompany the neck pain but I’m also not sure now if they’re related. I’m still also unsure if I actually have migraines or something else is causing this pain. I am seeing a neurologist and we did scans and they were clear but now he is doing another one since some of my symptoms are atypical (I don’t usually get light or sound sensitivity or nausea and laying down can help get rid of the pain). I’ve read about Csf leaks and I’m wondering if that’s maybe why my migraines are progressing so quickly is because they’re not actually just migraines at all.

Third world migraine problems,"I'm come for a short vacation at my home country and currently having a terrible migraine. Everything is extreme here, from lights to smell to sound.

Coming up on my migraine's birthday,"I'm new here, wish I'd thought to come here sooner but I guess it's only been a few weeks that I've known what this is, which also makes me even dumber than I originally thought I guess. 

I've had a really really bad year, I guess I'm looking for a bit of venting/commiserating and advice for anyone willing to chug through the mess to follow.

Roughly a year ago, I engaged in some extreme self harm, I ended up with a severe concussion as a result. As it would happen, I led a chaotic life when I was younger, I'm 33m now. Wrestled in HS and college, did a lot of dirt biking and mountain biking (poorly), and was generally accident prone- so I'd had what was likely many concussions before, and been knocked clean out unfortunately for a few minutes on at least 3 occasions. None of those had ever really fazed me head trauma wise in the past though, but this one did. Boy howdy did it. 

My balance was wrecked, I was hiding from light like a vampire, dizzy, nauseous, head pounding with pain constantly, and incapable of even simple tasks it felt like. A quick trip to the grocery store would put me down for 2-3 days. This continued forever it felt like- but some things improved quickly though- my eye tracking, balance, and quick thinking all improved, yet I still continued to have constant headaches, dizziness, and light sensitivity.

It took me 6 months after the incident to be able to see a neurologist the first time. They fixed up my meds a bit and things got a little better. It took nearly 6 months to see them again, and I was in a pit of despair. 

You see, people talk about headaches with that 's' at the end, like individuals that come and go, and I guess it used to be that way with me too. I got headaches occasionally like anyone else, I even had a bout with migraines for a year or so when I was 17. This past year though had been different, I haven't had headaches. I've had one headache. I've had it the entire time- sure it waxes and wanes, but it's *never*, ever, gone. It's there so day, every day. Waking, sleeping, resting or working. It's a constant companion, I almost feel like I should name it at this point.

When I saw the neurologist again a few weeks ago, they told me they believe that my concussion triggered a severe chronic migraine disorder. Which, gee, I feel like I should have started putting puzzle pieces together sooner myself, but I've just let it be some existential head trauma that wasn't healing and had no end in sight till now. You won't find many willing to testify to my intelligence.

It's damn liberating to finally know what it is and have angles to attack it from, and thankfully my wife has good insurance, she's dragged my useless carcass through all of this. The triptans all killed me beforehand, so they've got me looking at injections. Ubrelvey worked wonders- it's the closest I've been to not having a headache in a year. Most days I start around a 4 or 5 and end around 7 or 8 unless I exacerbate it by doing something, but an ubrelvey cuts it back to a 4. Unfortunately insurance won't let me have aimovig and ubrelvey, so I have to give it up to try the injections... Acupuncture has actually worked quite well too, I tried it for the first 2 times over the last 3 weeks.

I have real hope for the first time in so long, but at the same time knowing the likely limitations of the injections, it also feels like the last of my hope is dying. I've had this headache for so long, almost a year to the day, I don't remember the exact date, just that I went strawberry picking that day- I'm wondering if this headache is now just a permanent partner in my life, and I don't know how to deal with that. That thought is crushing me almost as much as the headache itself, or my inadequacy as a spouse and father resulting from it all. I'm failing so many things and my family every day, and I'm just an angry and bitter burden on them. I hate that so much, but there's seemingly no positive outcome for them- they're either stuck with this broken shell, or would have to deal with the horrible fallout of how I chose to leave. I haven't given up just yet, trying to take it one day at a time... I'm just really struggling.

To another day, and another way to disappoint the ones we love.",0
Feeling terrified about my headaches,"Hello everyone, I’m having a lot of anxiety lately (especially right now) about my headaches. To give some brief context, I started having nonstop headaches since mid 2020 I could barely sleep at night for 2 months with the pain and weird sensations and all the anxiety.

I did an MRI that came clear and also did a ECG with pulsing light to rule out seizures because I was scared it was that (I kept seeing little dots of light in my vision and it felt like my brain was going to explode any minute). 

I finally got seen by a doctor specialized in headaches and she diagnosed me with tension headaches and prescribed me amytriptiline which instantly helped (headaches were way less and I could sleep) and I stuck to it for a year. She then suggested I try to get off of it so I did slowly until I stopped taking it and I felt fine.

Then in April 2022 after playing some video games with flashing lights that always made me feel weird and triggered my anxiety because it gave me a headache I woke up one day a bit sensitive to light changes. Then a couple days later I could barely keep my eyes open because the light was killing me, I felt almost suicidal because I couldn’t do anything I just had to have everything dark the pain was so intense. It got better with time eventhough any flashing light would send me to agony, it’s like my brain would start squeezing itself and was going to collapse or something. That pain would subside more or less when the trigger was gone. 

I started having the tension headaches every day again but now with extreme photosensitivity and also some migraines (the one sided head throbbing headache). 

I have a hard time distinguishing my nausea, if it’s just anxiety or the headache. 

I went to another doctor and got back on amytriptiline and started feeling better again, still sensitive to light strobe/flashing but very manageable. Recently he suggested tomapax but I’m worried about side effects.

Yesterday I had a pretty bad episode at work because of light strobing and I got a bit panic attack, thinking I as going to have a seizure. I usually feel my head tightening on my forehead like in bursts and every time it happens I get more nauseous but idk if it’s just anxiety (I suffer from health anxiety). It’s like my brain is trying to escape from my head.

Idk if I should do more exams to see if it’s just migraines or if it’s more. 

Does anyone have/had these symptoms? What do you think? 

I just really want some opinions and to talk to other people who might relate

Thank you for reading im sorry if it’s too long",0
Nosebleeds with sumatriptan,"Hey,

Quick question, I have chronic migraines and after cgrp treatment they are usually not high intensity, but they are still pretty frequent. Maybe 3 times a week on average.

Sometimes if i take lots of sumatriptan, around the max recommended dose, i can get nosebleeds. Very light nose bleeds, but they always happen when i’m waking up in the morning as well. Does anyone else have experience with this? 

I’m seeing my neuro soon either way, just want to ask if any of you have been through this so i can ask about those solutions.

Thanks!",0

I have been getting reoccurring migraines that all start out the same way. I will get a sharp, pinching pain at the base of my skull [here](https://imgur.com/a/AXro8sF), either on the right or left side. I don't believe its ever been both sides at the same time **but** it has switched sides during the same migraine round.

&#x200B;

When the base of skull/neck pain starts, it *will* eventually turn into a horrible migraine and basically feels like someone is stabbing an icepick from the base of my skull to the adjoining eye like [this](https://imgur.com/Y7rdcQf). To describe the *type* of pain more clearly, it can feel like a piercing, shocking, and/or throbbing pain. The migraines also cause the typical sensitivity to light and sound, and I get some relief from heat but hardly any prevention.

&#x200B;

Please help. I already deal with enough stuff as is and wish at the very least, this one thing can be something I can avoid or fix.

Edit: This was my first time trying to cross post aaand i'm apparently bad at it seeing as how my added comment somehow wasn't posted along with it LOL. Anywho, this was first posted in another sub and I just wanted to clarify that I am **NOT** asking for medical advice on this sub nor am I using this sub as a replacement for professional medical care. Quite the opposite actually. I have **already** visited my family Dr about my migraines and he just suggested to try OTC meds and hot/cold compress.  

No one else I have talked to before this had shared the same migraine experiences and, now after talking to a few of you, has finally helped me feel less alone! I'm also glad I was able to get some suggestions for what type of specialist(s) to seek out because I honestly had no idea and my Dr didn't suggest any during the visit. I was a lot more ignorant about migraines than I initially thought. So I really appreciate all of the awesome insight and suggestions on how to make them a bit easier to deal with, as well as how/where I can go to get proper medical help for my migraines!",0

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/elemental-review-cannes/):

>With story beats and character turns that strain well beyond familiarity, Elemental matches formal adventure with storytelling timidity. Here is a new spin on the old formula, livened up by advances in technology and delivered with real artistry. The film is full of complex and volatile parts, all held together in the most elemental of containers.

Ford v Ferrari (2019) Is the Best Car Movie I've Ever Seen,"I don't know why I've slept on this movie for so long, given that I'm a fan of both Christian Bale and Matt Damon, but holy crap is this movie good! 

First off, I feel like it could be enjoyed by both people who are into cars, and people who just want to see a good movie with tension, drama, solid acting and heartfelt moments. 

The movie is less about Ford as an organization versus Ferrari, but more about the journey of Bale and Damon's characters as they try to build the best car they can, despite all the setbacks. It really shows their passion for what they do and the bond that these people had. 

The racing sequences are incredible, and never have I felt so much tension while looking at a rev meter on a car!

For anyone who hasn't seen this, I highly recommend it!",0
Gone Girl (2014): Did Amy love Nick?,"I'm not going to lie, I've read the book and seen the movie many times (there are differences between it) but I never knew if Amy really loved Nick or not?

First, Amy is a sociopath, I am not a psychiatrist, but what I do know is that sociopaths are incapable of love, they enter into relationships if there is benefits behind it (correct me if I wrong), but in the movie Amy did some things that baffled me, such as:

- Pretend to be a ""cool girl"" in order to impress Nick.

- Buy him a bar.

- Moving in with him to be with his dying mother, giving up everything.

- Most importantly, her face as she listens to Nick's interview on TV, killing Desi to go back to Nick, and telling him ""I killed for you.""

So, why did she does all this? Why did she come back to him in the first place? Is it because she really loves him or for some other reason?",0
What’s a movie that you absolutely love but know will never ever get a sequel or reboot?,"So what’s something no studio, whatever either touch, or care to ever make a follow up or reboot? And it’s gotta be something you adore. 

Mine is Small Soldiers! It's an absolute classic from the 90s, that I still watch every year and it still holds up! Also, throw in there Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hook, and Galaxy Quest",0
What’s a movie that you were really enjoying until the ending ruined it?,"I was really enjoying the movie “In Time” (2011) until the movie got towards the ending and I was just like “wow, this fell off really hard” and it pretty much made me feel like I wasted my time with the movie. So it got me to thinking, what are some movies that were really good from the beginning & middle then when it got near the ending, it just fell off? Because for me, I can mainly only recall TV shows like GOT, Lost, that had huge drop offs & horrible endings, not many movies. So what are some movies that had bad/horrible endings? Thanks.",0
Transformers (2007) in the theater,"So I guess to celebrate the return of the series this summer they started a theatrical rerelease of the original transformers (at least here in Korea) and I am more sure than I ever have been that this movie is GOOD

1) I know people don't like shia's character here but personally I love it. He's in the 11th grade and tasked with both saving the world and getting the girl as a nerd. Of course he's gonna be stuttering, swearing, and whining his way thru...but he has some nice character moments like telling off the sector 7 guy, killing megatron, and just generally standing up for the autobots. I also find his gags funny, sorry not sorry

2) McKayla is also pretty cool. No doubt bay super sexualizes her (the car scene...what a classic) but she also has a great amount of agency and ""badass"" moments like saving sam at the factory, her and bumblees contribution to the final assault, etc.

3) Some of the cinematography is very...in era...with lens flares up the ass and a general blue tint but no one can deny there are some crazy sexy vibes in this movie. The military troupe wandering the desert with the sun setting behind them? AMAZING. megatron on the top of the tower before transforming to a jet and going crazy? BEAUTIFUL. Those long shots of optimus and megatron going at it? 

4) The effects still hold up. While the way the transformers actually look has definitely contributed to the way the action got harder to follow the deeper the series went, the CGI of the transformers themselves still looks incredibly good and the actual explosions are still perfect (its michael bay so they better be)

Now I am not saying that its a masterpiece or anything close to the sort, but I really love this movie and I think that it has been maligned due to the reputation of the following movies. Probably the dumbest things in this one are the masturbation joke and the piss gag but they're over in seconds and otherwise the movie is just plain fun. Im not really expecting much out of this new one but Michael Bay did a damn good thing with the first transformers and I will always be fond of it",0
Why do some movies like Hero (2018) play the background music so loud?,"I'm watching this movie about Ulric Cross.  It relies very much on hearing the conversations to understand what's going on.  Meanwhile, a trumpet and other noise pollution makes it incredibly difficult to hear the actual conversations.

I like this movie, but my brain has to work overtime to filter out the non-essential.  Do you ever wish there was a way to wipe out all the background clatter in a movie?

Thank you.",0
Was Daryl Hannah a mediocre actress or did the public underestimate her becase of her beauty?,"I know she got a lot of stick for WALL STREET, it wasn't as if she was doomed for the start due to how poorly written her character was, though I do concede she was terrible in STEEL MAGNOLIAS. Even I can't give her a pass for it. 

Nevertheless, in SPLASH and ROXANNE, I found her lovely and engaging and likable. It isn't like today where you're asked to like the leading lady. Back in the day, the leading lady won you over with her irresistible charm. 

Even though she played many kind and sweet ladies, Daryl Hannah was even more effective at playing the psychopath which is surprising when you know her from SPLASH. In the KILL BILL films, she's deadly and vicious as Elle Driver and in BLADE RUNNER, she uses her seemingly sweet person to keep us assuming Pris, the replicant, is harmless until we see her creepy smile or when she attacks Deckard by twisting his neck.",0
Devil and Miss Jones,"A movie about a rich capitalist going undercover as an employee of his own firm to root the perpetrators of who is leading the employees to protest, what follows is a look into the life of a working class, which has aged surprisingly well. Its themes of unionization and how capitalists try their best to thwart the efforts of their employees to band together is an eye opener.

The movie gives us a harsh look into the life of employees who are trying their best to go through their everyday life, it is scary how little has changed over the course of eighty years.

I found this film to be quiet ahead of its time. It was even feministic for its time period, showing women take agency in relationships and all. 

I believe that this movie should be essential viewing as it showcases the plight of the marginalized like a few other. I really loved the performance of Robert Cummings as Joe O'Brien.",0
Positive Little Mermaid Discussion,"Maybe this will take off. Maybe it won’t. But I got back from seeing the Little Mermaid yesterday and was blown away by how much I liked it! It didn’t feel like a typical princess movie to me and both Ariel and Eric felt like their own characters. The themes were great. The songs were fun. And the final shot really got to me because as a father, I had to do that recently with a loved one (not literally but I’m sure you get it.) 
Lastly and honestly most importantly I thought seeing someone that looked like me and my children in one of these Disney princess roles was so spectacular. My kids loved it and it’s the first movie where they actually clapped at the end with the rest of the audience! 

I’m making this because I checked the official discussion thread and it was so negative. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but I know more people have had to genuinely enjoyed the movie so I wanna have this here for those people to discuss!",0
Did anyone find the incest angle in THE GRIFTERS cheap and unnecessary?,"I didn't like it because, aside from Annette Bening throwing the accusation, I didn't see any indication John Cusack was sexually attracted to his own mom, Anjelica Huston. 

The ending was cruel and devastating. Was Huston's Lily amoral enough to seduce her son to save herself? I don't know. In the first half, we do know she still has maternal feelings for Cusack, it doesn't seem like she sees her son as a nuisance. I had the impression a cloud of guilt shrouded her for not being more present in his life. 

I guess Stephen Frears wanted a Greek Tragedy.",0
Aftersun just broke me. Work of art. So now I’m watching Jurassic Park to bring some sense of normalcy to my night.,"I’m absolutely devastated. Aftersun is a work of art, as I haven’t seen in years. My heart is both full of love and broken. The movie is endearing and so well made; that summer tender boredom, the absolutely intimacy and caring between father and daughter, the melancholy in Calum, eating through his relationship with Sophie, the need to teach his daughter, the empty talks about the future. 

Paul Mescal is a superb actor. Even dancing. Seriously, his dancing is so full o meaning. 

I just wanted to hug him so much. There, there. 

So now I’m watching Jurassic Park to see if I can just, you know, cleanse my overly emotional mind. Dinosaurs are all I need now. 

That's it. That's the post.",0
Richard III vs Richard III?,"I’m exploring my Shakespeare on film and tripped over Ian McKellen is Richard the third from 1995. Loved it! I’ve never read the play before and I understand that some changes were made to the script, but Ian was spectacular in the film and it kept my interest due to the setting in the story and the acting.

Also, on HBO was a 1955 version of Lawrence Olivier playing Richard the third. I’m sure it is as of its time… That being said, it seemed a lot less accessible to me. You can tell it was a (relatively) low budget affair on static stages, and The most important part of the movie for Olivier was the script, not the setting.

Of course they are their own time, and it may be unfair to compare the two, but I found the Ian McKellen version superior (even though I read later that Richard the third was in his early 30s when he died, so that kind of aged Ian McKellen out of the role).",0
The physicality of Keanu Reeves and other 55+ actors inspires me to be better.,"Finally watched John Wick 4 yesterday. Keanu Reeves is 58, Donnie Yen 59, Hiroyuki Sanada 62. 

Being their fan, seeing them move with such swiftness, skill, endurance and agility never ceases to amaze me. But yesterday, with JW4's incredible cinematography, choreographies and music, it was outright touching watching these three veteran artists still at the top of their game. 

It happened to me too with Tom Cruise in Top Gun Maverick too. Watching them with that music score and the emotional beats of the story gives me strength not just to work on my health but to keep fighting to improve on my career, personal life, etc. I know I must accept I will slowly decline but they're such great examples that you don't have to ""go gentle into that good night""!",0
Vivo: The Individual Sand Dollars,"I love Sony Animation’s ‘Vivo’. Although, I have a question regarding the Sand Dollars. The Sand Dollars are a group of well-meaning but overzealous Girl Scouts.

Question for those who watched Fury,"The German sniper that takes out wardaddy at the end seemed very detailed and I wondered if there was any hidden message or something I missed, I took it as he was a hardened veteran just like wardaddy but I saw some people talking about it like it had more meaning pointing out his burns. I wonder if it was to contrast wardaddy like that's the German equivalent I don't know lol",0
Best Dragon?,"What would you consider the best depiction of a dragon (all geographic regions) put into film or show. This question was spawned after just finishing Shazam 2, which I must say has a pretty cool dragon. This overall question would include both animated and live action/cgi renders. Such a tough question I don’t even have an answer.",0
"Good Werewolf films besides An American Werewolf in London, The Howling and Dog Soldiers?","I absolutely love Werewolf films and have seen many but want some suggestions in case there are good ones I have missed.

An American Werewolf in London is not only the greatest Werewolf film of all time (That Ive yet seen) but also one of the best Horror Comedies and dare I say Horror in general of all time. 

Same can be said of Dog Soldiers. Ever since watching it as a child Ive loved this film. I still remember the DVD case 'Jaws, Aliens and Predator with a Werewolf twist'. Literally Aliens with Werewolves I love it.

But as the title are there any others you recommend? What are your favourites?",0
The Rocketeer is a much better movie than I expected,"watched it for the first time recently. I know it has a decent cult following but was worried it would be one of those movies you have to be a kid to really like. Luckily, this wasn't the case at all and I really enjoyed the hell out of this early 90s superhero film. Love how it is basically a superhero film but with a dash of Indiana Jones. Bill Campbell is perfect in the lead. Honestly this guy I think could have made a great Clark Kent/Superman if there had been a Superman film in the 90s. Timothy Dalton is just awesome as the villain playing both the charming actor part and evil Nazi part great and Jennifer Connelly, Damn! What more can be said about her. Loved the late great Paul Sorvino as the supporting bad guy. The moment where he turns against Sinclair is a great moment. Also this might be one of James Horner's best score. What happened to majestic scores like this? Movies will never be the same after Horner died. 

If I do have an issue, I just wish the movie was a bit longer and we saw a little more of Cliff using the rocket a bit more before the climax. Maybe a scene of him stopping some robbers or something

It's a shame that this movie didn't do very well at the box office when it came out. It would have been great if this had been a franchise. Guess it was doomed being sandwiched between Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Terminator 2 and not having any real box office draw.",0
Actors who have played multiple historical figures from the same time period,"Congratulations to Koji Yakusho for winning the best actor award at Cannes for the film Perfect Days. He's been in so many fantastic Japanese films over the past few decades. My personal favorite is from Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Cure. But he has also made a career of portraying famous samurai.

His breakout role was playing **Oda Nobunaga** in a major TV drama in 1983. TLDR: he tried to unite Japan and is perhaps the most famous person in Japanese history (see Takeshi Kitano's upcoming movie Kubi as well as the recently released epic The Legend and Butterfly). He had already played Nobunaga's less important son **Nobutaka Oda** a few years prior. In 2013, he starred as Nobunaga's top general **Shibata Katsuie** in The Kiyosu Conference, a historical comedy which still features both Odas.

In 2017, he would appear in Sekigahara as commander **Tokugawa Ieyasu**. TLDR: Sekigahara was the deciding battle of this era of Japan, and Tokugawa and his family would officially unite the country and rule over it for 200+ years. Pretty good film. 

Going back a few years both historically and contemporarly, Yakusho would also play **Takeda Shingen** in an eponymous movie from 1991. TLDR: He was the strongest regional warlord (and the subject of Akira Kurosawa's Kagemusha) and was killed by the combined forces of Nobunaga and Ieyasu. Yakusho and Yakusho (along with his son Yakusho and his general Yakusho) killed Yakusho.

He also plays **Miyamoto Mushashi** in a famous TV show. TLDR: He's a decent swordsman who is referenced pretty much anytime samurai swords are mentioned. Watch that trilogy of Toshiro Mifune films. He was born right after Nobunaga died and only possibly went to Sekigahara, but he's still around the same time period.

That's six very famous people who all more or less interacted with each other in real life played by the same actor. Are there other actors with a similar story?",0
"War of the Roses, 1989 is a great comedy","A very good movie, one that holds up well after repeated viewings. Even if you're familiar with the story, DeVito's methodical and precise direction makes it thoroughly absorbing all over again. This movie has the directorial perfection of a good Alfred Hitchcock thriller, but it's not either a thriller or a comedy; it's a unique mix of elements from several genres, that does contain some laughs and sardonic humor, but also has serious undertones, mostly thanks to Michael Douglas' three-dimensional character and surprisingly sensitive performance. Strongly recommended.",0
Question about Star-Lord for those who watched GotG vol 3,"After watching GotG vol 3 I feel like Star-Lord's story made a lot more sense if we discount his appearance in Thor 4. In the Thor 3 movie, Star-Lord seemed to have gotten over what has happened with Gamora and is mostly back to business, but in GotG 3 we see that it is otherwise.  


It makes more sense, the way GotG 3 did it, as he would be confused not having any closure. The film did a great job in giving us the closure that relationship needs,....and otherwise was a great movie too!

Looking for the name of a film,"My first post here so apologies if it breaks any rules. The trailer for this movie was before a few different movies around the 2005-2008ish time and I can't remember the name. It was a trailer with no music as far as I remember, just dialogue and sound effects. A man says goodbye to his wife as she is leaving for work in what looked like a major American city and a bit later he hears alarms and sees the military approaching, including jets. He runs towards the city shouting his wife's name and that was the end of the trailer. I can't find the trailer anywhere and always thought it looked interesting.",0
Matt Damon is honestly a on roll right now in terms of putting out one great film after another,"I feel like not enough people talk about this, but I feel like Matt Damon has been putting out one great film after another and not enough people talk about it. Here are some of the films he's been in the past four years:

* **Ford v Ferrari (2019), dir. James Mangold**
* **Stillwater (2021), dir. Tom McCarthy**
* **The Last Duel (2021), dir. Ridley Scott**
* **Air (2023), dir. Ben Affleck**

 His next film is **Oppenheimer**, which is almost guaranteed to range from good to great. I know he's pretty much an established name, but I feel like the strength of his filmography really isn't talked about enough.

Cool Hand Luke (1967),"Watched this movie for the first time today after finding it on the iTunes Store for $4.99. I’ve long been a fan of Paul Newman and, as this is one of the rare 100% movies on RT and contains #11 on the AFI’s 100 Years, 100 Movie Quotes List (What we’re dealing with here is failure to communicate.), I felt compelled to finally give it a watch.

To say it was more than worth the five dollars is an understatement. Newman played the title role brilliantly and there were solid supporting roles from George Kennedy as fellow inmate Dragline and Strother Martin as the villain, the Captain.

Its role as one of the earliest anti-establishment films of the Vietnam War era and its subtle use of Christian imagery are quite remarkable and the film certainly holds up after almost six decades. It is especially enjoyable if you’re a fan of other prison dramas such as The Shawshank Redemption as there’s a rather similar tone between the two films.

This one, in my opinion, has certainly earned its 100% RT rating and is well worth the watch. I was quite glad to find it at such a great price and highly recommend this for addition to your film collection if you haven’t already seen it.",0

Actors who are always changing their voices for roles,"Brad Garrett doesn't have the Robert Barone voice in real life which is bizarre given he uses the Robert Barone voice in literally everything he does

On the other end of the height spectrum Warwick Davis has a posh, sophisticated voice in real life which is a huge departure from the wacky, silly high pitched voices he's usually putting on whenever he plays aliens, monsters, leprechauns, etc.

Oh yeah and Tom Holland is always using his American voice in things",0
I enjoy every movie that I watch.,"Am I the only one who doesn’t know the criteria’s that make a good or bad movie? I really enjoy every movie that I watch and have watched throughout my life and get confused when I see bad reviews on movies.

 I mostly watch fun movies like Disney, marvel, animated movies and even horror movies and I haven’t come across a movie that I hated. I have a lot of favorite movies but I feel like it’s because I do not know what makes a good or bad movie especially if it’s at the cinema. 

For example, I remember LOVING “Cat Woman” with Halle berry growing up and then now that I’m older I check the reviews and turns out it was a really bad movie. 
Another example is avatar 2, I was so obsessed with the colors and was so drawn to their world and the story line but apparently a lot of people didn’t like it.
So what makes a good or bad movie in your opinion?",0
What are your favorite Romance films from the 40s/50s/60s?,"Lately I have been on a classic film binge. Mostly films from the 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s. I absolutely love films from this era.

I just finished watching Roman Holiday, with Audrey Hepburn, and I think it is actually one of my favorite films I have ever seen! I have watched so many classic romance films that I need some help to discover new ones.

What do movies get right that you wouldn't have believed until you were in that job or found out otherwise?,"Over the years, I've read a few posts that look at the things movies frequently get wrong.

"Marilyn Monroe usually played the dumb blonde but she was equally good at playing femme fatales. She's incredible in NIAGARA, a scheming adultress.","I love NIAGARA. Marilyn Monroe is such a bitch on that one but looking so good and glamorous in her pink dress, leaving all the men shaken by her beauty. 

A married woman scheming to get her husband killed while slurping all over her lover in the Niagara falls, this is a far cry from her going all Googilly googly goo in most of the movies she's did. 

But Jean Peters is also pretty good, as the neighbor who gets involved by seeing something she shouldn't have and taking matters into her own hands.",0
Thoughts on Coming to America (1988)?,"Coming to America turns 35 this year. This is considered one of the best Eddie Murphy films. I think it has aged well with time which is surprising because rom-coms have a mixed track record.

The film has a slow, sweet pace where character interactions lead the story. It has the usual romantic comedy cliches till the last moment. But the execution was good. I think the casting was brilliant and the film does have abundant comedic scenes. Loved the dudes at the barbershop having a good time.

The casting was really well done with John Amos as Cleo McDowell & James Earl Jones as the King being standouts.

It was interesting to see the lack of music in many places. Sometimes the movie felt awkward due to the lack of score and slightly weak editing. But overall the direction gets it home.

My rating: 7/10.

Obscure WWII or Korean War Combat Films (English),"Taking care of my elderly father (3+ years). He pretty much only wants to watch WWII and Korean War combat movies. We've gone through hundreds of American, British movies (and a few Australian and Canadian ones), but I'm running out of 'em. 

Any leads on obscure combat movies for WWII and the Korean War? I went through the WWII and Korean War movie Wikipedia pages and found nearly all of them (but it was missing some). Quality isn't super-crucial (b-movies work) as he isn't particularly picky. He's not into dramas or spy/espionage so much. It's getting rough to feed the beast!

His sight is failing, so they need to be in English (occasional subtitles for, say, German is OK). Subtitled movies would open a new world, but it's a no-go.

"Best ""Realistic"" Fistfights In Movies?","There are a lot of really great fistfights in movies, but what are some of your favourite, but realistic fight scenes?

I know of a lot of fights that are realistic in how they treat the characters involved. Oldboy, Daredevil, They Live, and Fury Road all show these great scraps which don't seem over choreographed and put a lot of emphasis on what it's actually like fighting someone for an extended period of time.

Then you have Bridgette Jones Diary which is just hilarious on how it handles its rivals trying to fight eachother via impotent kicks.


My favourites though absolutely come from Warrior (but I'll leave that post for another time)

So yeah, what are some great, realistic fights from movies?",0
What movie scene affects you …,"So much that you can’t watch the movie anymore. For me it’s the rape scene in The Accused. It makes my body anxious seeing it on tv. I have issues with rape or violence against children and animals. Also I have a tremendous fear of big mouths and teeth or both haha! My list as of today is: 

The Accused - rape

Marley and Me - animals

Fright night (original) - mouth and teeth

The Ring (quick closet scene) - mouth

Does anyone remember The Four Little Pigs?,"I’m sorry if this is the wrong group to post in, but I’ve spent most of my adult life trying to find proof of the VHS I grew up with called Four Little Pigs.

What movie is better when you watch as an adult than when you watch it as a kid?,"Just the title.


Question came to me by watching Lilo and Stitch again as an adult. As a kid it was a funny movie about a girl and her pet alien doing wacky hijinks in the face of her annoying older sister and funny aliens, and I remember it was okay.

Watching it again I realised it's a surprisingly heavy movie about a struggling older sister in poverty trying to keep her sister while not having the means to support her.

Also, I realised that the movie has no real villain and all the characters I percieved as ""evil"" as a child were just well meaning adults in a complex situation.


* Nani - was trying to parent a difficult child as a teenager after losing her parents
* The scary social services agent - was just looking to do what's best for Lilo. As a kid I though he was just cruel.
* The scary alien councilwoman - was just trying to capture what she thought was a dangerous terrorist

Closest thing to a villain this movie has are Jumba the scientist and Stitch himself.

Brilliant movie that completely went over my head as a child.",0

ip man 4 review in one shot,"https://preview.redd.it/bjkltwvttp2b1.png?width=220&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a168d48606aad87570403a5951ccadf9d48dfa40

Ip Man 4: The Finale is a fitting end to the popular martial arts film series starring Donnie Yen as the legendary Wing Chun master. While the plot may not be as cohesive or compelling as the earlier installments, the movie still delivers plenty of thrilling fight scenes and emotional moments that will satisfy fans of the genre and the franchise.

The biggest theme of Ip Man 4 is the struggle of Chinese immigrants and their descendants to adapt and find acceptance in America during the 1960s, especially in the face of racism and stereotyping. This idea is reflected in various subplots, from Ip Man's relationship with his son who studies in a U.S. school, to the conflicts between the Chinese martial artists and the Western boxing enthusiasts, to the antagonism between Ip Man and a pompous American army officer who undermines Chinese culture.

These topics add depth and resonance to the movie, but they don't always get enough time to develop or converge smoothly, leaving some of the supporting characters or themes underdeveloped. Nonetheless, the action scenes are where Ip Man 4 truly shines, showcasing the Wing Chun style's speed, precision, and adaptability against various other fighting methods. The choreography, cinematography, and sound effects are all top-notch, making every punch, kick, and weapon strike look and sound impactful.

Donnie Yen once again commands the spotlight with his charismatic and dignified portrayal of Ip Man, who remains a role model of honor, compassion, and wisdom despite facing personal and social challenges. The other cast members, including Vanness Wu, Scott Adkins, Chris Collins, and Danny Chan, also deliver solid performances, even if they don't get enough character arcs or motivations.

Overall, Ip Man 4: The Finale may not be as seminal or inventive as the first Ip Man, but it's still a well-crafted and satisfying conclusion to the series, offering a mix of martial arts spectacle, historical insight, and inspirational value. If you're a fan of Asian action movies or Ip Man himself, this movie is worth watching.",0

What are your examples of a 100% perfect film? Nothing can be cut,"Like it says, the film is perfect start to finish, every scene is essential, there is *no fat.* 



My pick is Spoorloos (1988) AKA The Vanishing



***!!!SPOILERS AHEAD FOR SPOORLOOS!!!***


From the moment the film starts with credits, there are shots of Rex and Saskia playing a game where they name things that start with a certain letter. Rex is teaching her to speak French. Both her lessons with Rex, and the specific game they use come into play when Saskia meets Raymond.

Seemingly silly things like the lighter Saskia buys Rex is the one he uses to light up his coffin(and it doesn’t last long because he’s used it for 3 years), and the price for the frisbee she buys is the same as the gift she wants to buy for Rex from Raymond. Raymond refers to many of these series of events as fate in the final act.

Anytime where someone is traveling from point A to B contains storytelling; Raymond walking to a work function sees a poster of a missing Saskia, and a conversation unfolds about why Raymond cares so much, and their conversation continues on how the coworker thinks kidnappers should be crucified, and Raymond asks what if it was him.

The longest traveling scene is when Raymond and Rex are together, and every bit of information you get from that point up until Rex is drugged is relevant. Even the conversation where the two are laughing about odd names, and Raymond mentions his neighbor’s dog name is Rex. Rex laughs about this in the grave as he shouts his name in defiance of the situation.

Rex running off when getting outside for a minute with his girlfriend ended up with him having the same floating egg dream that Saskia did.

Raymond’s brief scene in his classroom shows he’s an expert in Chemistry, therefore knows well how to use chemicals on his victims and how to mix them.


There are even more character details throughout this film, but at a tight 90 min, this film is meticulously decorated with detail, storytelling, and character development.

I don’t get the hate for Moonfall.,"I went into Moonfall essentially blind. I had seen one trailer in the cinema about a year ago but that was pretty much my only exposure. It was pretty good, a solid but flawed sci-fi picture. The characters were meh and the exposition was disjointed but it was a really fun watch. About a 68/100 I’d say. Then, I go on Letterboxd and am surprised by how many think the film is stupid. I really don’t see it. It wasn’t the most intelligent but certainly not stupid enough to be hailed as a 1/10 film. Can someone tell me why it’s so hated? I’m truly lost.",0
"The star, the team, the leader, or the critics and/or public. What drives you to see a movie, typically?","*The star being : an actor/actress*

*Leader being a director. Team being set of directors and or writer/cinematography.*

*Or lastly what websites aka critics say about a movie - or the general public.*

&#x200B;

For me, its typically the movie star, but that is why in my headline I put in ""typically"". Because sometimes its not always that. I've seen just about everyone of the following 4 stars movies but that doesn't cross out negative reception I may have for their films. Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, Angelina Jolie, Sigourney Weaver.

&#x200B;

I find that in 2023 more and more are going out and seeing hated movie stars films firstly out of curiosity, but sometimes and more often because of a score given - and how widely accepted their friends/family think of it. Those things are the least of my concern - so there it goes my question.

I’m not sure why they would be this ballsy, but I guess it had something to do with the fact that the studios were trying to avoid the G rating and they let their screenwriters have free range on the choice of words. What do you think? Are there any other 80s kids films that I know of that include profanity? Be sure to list them here.",0

Clarification of a sequence in Haneke's film Caché (Hidden) (2005),"Hello everyone!

I'm looking for information on a film by Haneke but I just can't find it, so I'm asking for help from those of you who may know something about it: the film is Caché (Hidden, 2005), and the information is this: without revealing nothing too much (for he hadn't seen it) in the film at one point an animal is killed, but I would like to know if it was really killed or is it a special effect of some kind.

The reason is that I love the film and would like to show it to my daughter and wife, but both are very sensitive to animal abuse.

Actually I am too: I can't stand the representation of any kind of violence against animals anymore: even the famous sequence of the ox and the tribe in the jungle in Apocalypse Now today I struggle to see it again (despite having seen the film dozens of times over the course of my life: evidently as I got older I became like this).

So: if anyone knows how that scene in Haneke's Caché (Hidden) was shot, and whether or not that animal was actually killed, please let me know.

Thank you!!!!

What are common movie tropes that are false?,"I'll go first. The ""popular"" kids bullying. Popular kids in highschool usually care about smoking/alcohol, relationships, and partying. Many are chill. You can get bullied by anyone in my experience. Usually people with low self esteem that if they make fun of you, they feel better. The only times I actually got bullied were by some racist kid and these two wanna be cool kids. The upper classman who were supposed to stuff me in a locker became my role models. And as a nerdy ass kid, my best friend was the captain of the football team. I feel that gen z’s highschool experience is different from the movies. Also, there are a lot of popular people who bully for sure, but I am just saying that many different groups of people bully. With social media everyone is more connected so the cliques in highschool will vanish more and more. These stereotypes definitely happen, but I feel that it’s changing. Also my experience is not everyone’s I am just saying that movies can warp reality a lot.",0

Recommendations for Legally Blind Person,"Hi! I didn’t watch movies much growing up, and I’m legally blind. My condition is regretory, as in it was worst when I was born, and improved until I hit puberty (ocular albinism, specifically). I still have a lot of trouble distinguishing people in movies unless they wear very distinct clothes etc.

As such, most of what I’ve watched as an adult has been sci fi, fantasy, or animated. Dramas and romance movies are typically too hard for me to watch without someone telling me who’s speaking because I can’t tell them apart. I am fluent in English and Japanese, but no recommendations outside those languages unless there’s a dub because, well, blind. I had to take a classics movie class in college and while I liked the singing in the ones that had them, the lack of color made it even harder to see what was on screen.

Are there any movies you think would be worth a watch for me- classic or recent? I’m fine with some deep cuts but it’s got to be visually high contrast or distinct enough and I’d like to step out of my comfort zone. I’m not a fan of audio descriptive movies, at that point I’d rather just listen to an audiobook.

"Why is it you like the film Angel Heart, with Mickey Rourke?","Enjoyed the first 85% of the film. A stylish, albeit by the numbers voodoo noir joint. Really dug that. Really dug Rourke too. I even love a twist ending, when it’s not a cop out.

But holy shit, that’s one of the absolute worst, most poorly laid endings I’ve ever seen. Dream sequences and weird flashbacks don’t qualify as laying groundwork for justifying such an ending.

John Wick 4?,"Sometimes it takes a second watch for me to enjoy a film, and I usually do as I start to dive into the intention of the director-and the symbolism of the story-but at face value I am not compelled like I was in the other films. I was really looking forward to the a story that both progressed and stays true to its original spirit-this movie looks like a regression to me-again, face value first watch-but it just added more characters-more friends without exposition becomes a tired trick when you then neglect characters from the past films ….and this didn’t seem like the same JW to me-he didn’t seem angry-he just seemed like a tired Keanu Reeves- still watching-I just feel like Hollywood is sticking more to conveying underlying symbolism for example consequences and friendships-that don’t show the meaning yet show what eventually happens-debt brings more debt-friendships more problems.

What was the movie that invented or popularized the use of licensed soundtrack albums with original songs by popular artists?,"I remember back in 2018 both the first Black Panther and Spider-Verse movies kinda started this trend, with albums containing original music both featuring in and inspired by their respective movies. Fast forward to nowadays, and every now and then some popular movie with blockbuster ambitions will release an accompanying official licensed original album featuring many artists with original songs, the latest case being the Barbie movie. Even the final season of Game of Thrones did it.


Was Black Panther the very first case/inventor of this type of project, or were there other movies that did this before? I thought of 2016 Suicide Squad, but I've checked, and it's just a compilation of songs that existed beforehand and weren't made for the movie.


Has anyone coined a more succinct term for this kind of album? Original Licensed soundtrack seems like a mouthful",0
The Big Bus (1976) review,"Before there was Airplane! there was The Big Bus, a good and charming parody of heavy handed disaster dramas. 

Coyote Bus Lines is  set to reveal their newest innovation in Bus travel with the unveiling  of Cyclops, a two story nuclear powered superbus complete with all the  luxuries of a cruise ship and promising a non-stop trip from New York  City to Denver. When an act of industrial espionage takes out the driver  and cp-driver of the inaugural journey, the injured/parking lot  confined Professor Baxter (Harold Gould) enlists his daughter Kitty  (Stockard Channing) to recruit Kitty's former fiancé and once great bus  driver, Dan Torrance (Joseph Bologna), much to Kitty's reluctance. Dan  has had a tough go in recent years due to an incident on Mount Diablo  where 110 passengers were lost to Cannibalism of Dan's co-pilot, but  because he accidentally ate stew made from a foot he carries the stigma.  Dan Agrees to pilot the big bus unaware that saboteurs have insidious  plans to keep it from reaching Denver.  


Released in 1976, The Big  Bus was released at the height of the 70s wave of Disaster films with  Universal's Airport series only on its first sequel and the Charlton  Heston fronted ensemble Earthquake only two years prior. Directed by  noted TV director James Frawley of The Monkees (who would go on to  direct The Muppet Movie) and written and produced by noted TV writers  Lawrence J. Cohen and Fred Freeman of Gilligan's Island, Andy Griffith,  and Bewitched, the movie went mostly ignored at the box office during  its initial run and eventually became overshadowed by the much more  successful Airplane! Four years later. The Big Bus aired infrequently on  TV after its release, not exactly getting a second life but did attract  a minor cult following from those who remember it, and rightly so  because while not as tight or sharp as Airplane it's a very funny farce  that plays up its silliness and camp in fun and inventive ways.  


Watching  The Big Bus it does almost feel like a first draft of Airplane! With  Ted Striker's character in airplane nearly identical to Dan Torrance  with them both being ""great pilots with tragic backstories"" and even  individual gags such as panicking the passengers over the intercom are  done in a near identical fashion here to how'd they be done in Airplane  four years later. This can probably be written off as mere coincidence  since most of these as delivered are funhouse mirror exaggerations of  the tricks and tropes seen in films of the Irwin Allen variety or the  Airport films, but it still is pretty glaring in terms of the  similarity. While The Big Bus doesn't have the extra level of polish  Airplane! Had, I think the movie still makes itself a worthwhile viewing  even outside of its historical curiosity preceding Airplane!.  


Much  like the disaster epics it spoofs, The Big Bus features a veritable  ""who's who?"" of talent with the likes of Joseph Bologna, Stockard  Channing, René Auberjonois, Sally Kellerman, Richard Mulligan, Ned  Beatty, and too many other to mention who all play the collection of  broad eccentrics with gusto fitting well in line with the cartoonish and  anarchic tone set by the film. From Sally Kellerman and Richard  Mulligan's on/off soon to be divorced couple who go from hurling insults  at each other to going just shy of full intercourse on the bus floor,  to Murphy Dunne as lounge piano player Tommy Joyce playing inappropriate  commentary/music at the worst possible times, the movie knows it has a  killer cast and does everything it can to put them in bits of sheer  ridiculousness that'll crack a smile on even the most harsh of viewers.  Everyone brings their ""A"" game treating the ridiculousness and madness  with complete seriousness as if they're actually in an Irwin Allen film.  The one downside would probably be in the film's antagonist, known only  as ""Ironman""(José Ferrer), who's just kind of there. His gimmick is  spending all of his time in an Iron Lung and his exchanges with his  henchman sabotaging the titular bus are unfortunately some of the major  dead spots in the movie that curtail the film's momentum.  


The Big  Bus may not be as well known as Airplane!, but it is an enjoyable  disaster farce that humorously treats its ridiculous nuclear powered bus  with the same reverence and melodrama seen in the Airport films and  turning the tropes on their heads into comic silver (not quite gold, but  on the cusp). It's a shame the movie isn't more widely known because it  runs at a quick clip keeping the sight gags, exchanges, and chaos  coming to mostly successful effect save for the occasional dead spot. If  you enjoyed Airpalne!, you owe it to yourself to see the film that  cleared the way for it.",0

Movie Request - For Friends Who Love Eachother But Aren't Going to See Eachother For a Long Time,"Hi everyone,

I have a movie night tonight with some really close friends that are moving from Australia to Canada and this will be our last time spent together.

I'm hoping to get any reccommendations for feel good films about love and friendship - prefferably that mirror the theme of ""until next time"". Any ideas? 

Thanks in advance!

The Incredibles is an allegory for Nice Guy Syndrome.,"I recently realized something about the Incredibles. I interpret it as an allegory for Nice Guy Syndrome. To be clear, I do not think that the writers intended it this way, that is simply how I chose to interpret it. 

Nice guy syndrome is when you feel entitled to romantic affection for simply behaving like a decent person. The flaw in this line of reasoning is two fold. First of all, being kind, treating your fellow human beings with respect and giving them what is rightfully theirs is an expected trait of every human being. If being nice were all that it took to not only get into a relationship, but also make the relationship work, that guy or lady in whom you are interested would already be in a relationship. Second, and more to the point, no one is entitled to a romantic relationship. It is called nice guy syndrome, because most of the people who suffer from it are heterosexual men, but women and gay men can experience it too. 

Nice guys syndrome is scary, as it can lead to such violent attrocities as the mass shooting committed by Elliot Rodger in May of 2014. Elliot Rodger was a now dead YouTuber and famous Incel when he was alive. Incel is short for involuntary celibate and it refers to man who is not sexually active or is not in a relationship, but desperately wants to be. In May of 2014, Elliot stabbed three men in his apartment, went to a sorority at the University of California, Santa Barbara to shot three female students (killing two), drove to a nearby deli to shot and kill a male student inside, speed through Isla Vista to run over several people with his car, had a shoot out with the police where in he recieved a nonfatal shot to the hip and eventually crashed into a parked car. Eventually, he was found by police dead from suicide carried out with his hand gun. Before committing this mass murder, Elliot uploaded a YouTube video titled Elliot Rodger's Retribution, where in he outlined his plan to kill several people, including himself. Here is a link to the Wikipedia page about Elliot:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014\_Isla\_Vista\_killings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Isla_Vista_killings)

Yeah, nice guy syndrome causes stuff like that. 

If you really think about it, Syndrome is like Elliot Rodger. Rodger held resentment toward women who would not date him and at men who got dates instead of him. Rodger felt entitled to a relationship. Young Buddy Pine felt entitled to be Mr. Incredible’s side kick. Just like no one is entitled to a relationship, Buddy was not entitled to be Mr. Incredible’s side kick. If Rodger where interested in a woman and said hypothetical woman decided to exercise her right to spurn his advances, he should have just moved on to a different woman. Similarly, if Buddy wanted to be someone’s side kick and Mr. Incredible decided to exercise his right to work alone if he so pleases, Buddy could have asked a different super for permission to be a side kick. Buddy proved himself to have genius level intellect, inventing weapons more powerful than just about any super power. Buddy could have become a super hero himself. 

When Syndrome monologues about his motivations, Mr. Incredible apologises for the way he treated young Buddy Pine. It is unclear if Mr. Incredible really meant what he said or if he was kissing Syndrome’s butt, because Syndrome was a threat. I really hope it is the latter. The truth is, Mr. Incredible did not mistreat young Buddy pine at all. Mr. Incredible was nice, he stood for photos and signed every scrap of paper Buddy pushed at him. Buddy had a bloated sense of entitlement and crossed a line when he demanded Mr. Incredible accept him (Buddy) as his side kick, entered Mr. Incredible’s car without his permission and refused to take no for an answer. If Mr. Incredible did not want a sidekick, it was Mr. Incredible’s right to work alone. Mr. Incredible is allowed to reject Buddy’s request to be his side kick for any reason, no reason at all or even a made up reason. When Buddy went to go get the police, he had a bomb on him. Mr. Incredible grabbed Buddy and removed the bomb. Buddy yelled at Mr. Incredible for wrecking his flight patterns. For over a decade after the fact, Buddy held resentment toward Mr. Incredible and never realized that Mr. Incredible saved his life. If Mr. Incredible had just let Buddy get blown up, Bomb Voyage wouldn’t have gotten away, the L-train accident wouldn’t have occurred, and neither would the genocide of the super heroes.",0
Passport Questions & Issues Megathread (2023),"**For the last few years we've been getting multiple posts a day on American Passport Questions. To help alleviate the amount of posts, and make sure everyone is getting the same information I've created this Megathread.**

#American Passport Information 

## How to Apply

[All Information can be found here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply.html).

There will be a form to fill out. Information on passport photos. What documents & IDs you'll need, etc.

##Where to Apply

[Then you'll need to see which avenue you'll need to apply at](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/where-to-apply.html). This could be an acceptance facility like a local USPS office, an actual Passport Agency, or via mail (for renewals).

[If you are applying Outside of the US please see this information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/outside-us.html).

NOTE: Many locations still have COVID protocols and do not accept same day or walk ins. 


##Processing Times Within the US
As of Late March 2023, times have been extended.

[You can find the latest processing times here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html).

Normal processing is around 10-13 weeks.

Expedited processing is around 7-9 weeks. (You also have the option to expedite shipping from the facility, that is an added cost is an additional add-on to Expedited passports.)

Urgent processing within 3 business days. And you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date if you've not applied before. If you have you can only call within 5 business days of your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.

Life or Death/ Emergency Service is around 72 hours/3 business days, and you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.

NOTE: This timing may not include shipping time. There have been issues in the past of USPS causing delays to and from the processing facilities and those delays are not accounted for in the official processing times.

NOTE: Some facilities may be quicker, others may take longer, the above time is the average. We have had users saying an additional week or two has sometimes been added onto the above processing times at certain facilities so do not assume the stated processing times are accurate. Do not book travel ""to the day"" of when the processing time says they could be done with processing the passport, because again, it does not include shipping times.

NOTE: It can take up to 2 weeks before your status changes to ""In Process"".

**Some people have gotten their recently submitted expedited passports quicker than stated times BUT NOT ALL. Do not plan on being lucky, get your application in early and expedited as needed.**

**Many people are saying that both Normal and Expedited processing is taking weeks longer than the above-listed processing time.**

#Frequently Asked Questions for Applying Within the US

### What is the status of my application?

Check here: https://passportstatus.state.gov/

### They cashed my check, does that mean my passport is coming soon?

No. During covid they have been opening the submitted paperwork and cashing the check first, and then often sitting on the paperwork for up to 2-6 weeks. Them cashing the check doesn't mean they are processing it or that everything is going well. 

Once they start processing it, if they find errors, or your paperwork, IDs, etc aren't in order you may hear from them and be told how to correct the issues.

### Can I get a same day passport.

Not likely during covid since they aren't taking walk in appointments.

### My trip is in a few days and I just realized I don't have my passport/it's lost/it's expired/whatever, HELP WHAT DO I DO?

In all honesty you are pretty much SOL. [It is almost impossible to get the Urgent/Life or Death/Emergency in-person appointments](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/emergencies.html). For these urgent appointments you must call them directly via the phone numbers on the above link. If you are trying to go that route you'll need to look at any location you can realistically get to INCLUDING flying to them. 

Note that many people have faked life or death/emergency reasons so this is making it nearly impossible to get these appointments.

Otherwise you may be better off calling all your pre-booked vacation expenses and see if you have any options to postpone or refund your now-not-happening-trip. 

### Can I switch my application from Regular Processing to Expedited? 

Yes. Expedited service costs an additional $60. If you applied and have not received your passport, you may call the National Passport Information Center at 1-877-487-2778 and receive instructions on how request to expedite your passport. 

NOTE: It can take 20 days to fulfill this request.

NOTE: This is just a request, sometimes it cannot be honored. Regular Passports are processed at a different facility than Expedited ones. So they need to FIND your application paperwork in order to be able to switch the processing. 


### I submitted my passport ages ago but my status hasn't changed/its been WAY past the processing times quoted on the website.

There may be a problem. Try contacting the State Department/Passport Office, or reach out to your state State Representatives. They actually can often help with speeding along passports and fixing issues when they get stuck in the system.

### My ""Status"" on the website says ""Not Available""

It can take up to 2-6 weeks for your status to change to In-Progress.

### How do I find my State Representatives who can assist me?

[This link will help you for your State House Represenative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) or [you can also try your Senator](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm). Once you are in contact and have asked for help on your passport application you may be asked to fill out a privacy form or other paperwork allowing your representative to work on your behalf. Make sure to follow up quickly to keep the ball rolling.

### Can I buy a flight that shows I'm leaving within 3 business days, get my passport, and then cancel the flight/Can I fake a family emergency? 

No, you'll need to provide proof of your emergency. 

### Can I buy a flight that shows I'm leaving in 2 weeks, book the Urgent in-person appointment that would be within 72 hours of that flight, get my passport, and then cancel the flight? 

Yes, but given that those appointments are still supposed to be for urgent/emergencies and right now those appointments are VERY hard to get even if you have a valid reason.

For those doing these in-person appointment, you'll get your passport within a few hours or a day or two from the appointment. They'll factor in your urgency, what wiggle room you have, and the other needs to figure out what priority yours will be. But you will get it within 72 hours.

### What about using a 3rd Party Rush/Expediting Service/Courier/Expeditor?

DO NOT USE THESE!!!

There is no magical service (other than contacting your state's house of representatives) that can get you your passport quicker than official channels. You are instead paying a shit ton of money for someone else to do any of the above steps and faster processing isn't guaranteed or possible. As well as there are many outright scam companies out there. I would not recommend you give them your personal information. [See the official government info here on why you should not use these](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/courier-and-expeditor-companies.html).

### I'm an American currently abroad and my passport recently expired. I need to quickly return to USA, can I travel on an expired passport?

Not any longer this ended December 31st, 2021.

## Other Questions

### Can I travel internationally by air without a passport book?

For air travel, the airline won't even let you on your first initial flight if you do not have proper documentation and visas. This is because the airline will be penalized and fined if you are held and deported due to improper documentation/visas. 

A passport card cannot be used for air travel.

### Can I travel internationally by land without a passport?

We frequently get questions on this especially for the USA/Mexico border. Officially no, you actually do need a passport. Unofficially some people have reported getting INTO Mexico without a passport can be easier than coming BACK into the US without a passport.

### Can I travel internationally via a cruise without a passport?

We'd recommend hitting up /r/cruise as it may depend on your specific cruise. Some may not allow you on at all without a passport, others simply won't let you do shore excursions if you don't have a passport.

### I have dual citizenship, can I travel on my other passport instead?

While USA has no exit immigration, so you don't need to show your passport to exit, you are required to enter the USA on your American passport. You cannot use your other citizenship to get a visa to enter America on your other passport. So unless you are going to get your passport abroad at an Embassy/Consulate before you return, get your American passport before you go.


### What is the difference between a Passport Book and a Passport Card?

Card is for Land borders and some sea ports of entry. Think Canada, Mexico, Caribbean, Bermuda. You cannot use it for air travel.

If you plan on doing any air travel within the next 10 years get the passport book.

### Since US Embassies are processing passports faster (less than 6 weeks), how can I send my application there to be processed?

You can't. Embassies only process passports for people in-person and in-country. 

Also, if your travel is soon and you are headed back to the US, you'll be given a limited-use Emergency Passport that can only be used to travel back to the US.

So the ""Why don't I just fly to Mexico on my soon to be expiring passport and apply at the embassy there?"" idea only works if you are in Mexico for 6+ weeks and if you have a current valid passport to even enter Mexico (or insert whatever other US Embassy you were asking about.)

### I've heard about ""6 Month Validity Rule"" what is it and what does it mean?

Some countries require the passport to still be valid 6 months after entry (or exit). This is to ensure you have valid documents to be able to exit the country. Some countries do not have this requirement, some require it to be 3 months, etc.

But the easiest way to think about it is your passport actually expires 6 months early. And so its best to renew it before that time.


### I lost my passport, reported it lost, and now just found the original one, can I travel on it?

No. Once reported lost/stolen its deactivated and cannot be used for travel. You should put a hole through a corner of the passport or otherwise make it clear it cannot be used so you don't accidentally bring it to the airport.

### I lost my passport, but have a photo copy. Am I okay to travel?

NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


### I got part of my order but didn't get my old passport/new passport/passport card/my ID documents?!?

They'll come in separate shipments.


### I forgot my passport was in my maiden name/former name. Can I still use it for travel?

Your ticket must match your passport name. 

Note: There may be issues if your vaccine card/info is in a different name than the passport/ticketed name, but use the COVID Megathread for that question. 


### How can I get flight confirmation/book a flight if I don't have my passport? 

Unless you are booking with a 3rd party agency that charges for every little change, pretty much all airlines allow you to book with nonsense numbers (all 1's) and at a later time update your passport info, or even wait until check in, in-person to do so.

Many people do not have passports when they book flights, or they lose their passport, or their passport expires. They are fully aware that until they check the passport day-of, the information might not be correct or valid.

Vietnam Tourist Visa Update...,"There have been quite a few questions regarding Tourist Visas for Vietnam on this forum lately, so here's an update, including a big change regarding expedited Visas which just changed in the last couple of days.

**1.)** Visa on Arrival (VOA) hasn't existed for ages now so the only option for most tourists is the E-Visa. It's good for 30 days and one entry. That's it. If you want to visit longer then you have to do a Visa run to Laos, Cambodia, etc. and pick up a fresh E-Visa, then reenter Vietnam.

**2.)** [Here is the official government website for the E-Visa application.](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/trang-chu-ttdt) It's a straightforward application that costs $25 USD and usually takes 3 - 5 business days to process, but submit your application with plenty of spare time because sometimes it takes longer and you can't board the aircraft to Vietnam without it. Lastly, don't use 3rd Party Vendors for the application, they offer no advantage over the official website.

**3.)** [Here are the countries that are eligible for the E-Visa.](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/documents/20181/117155/Vietnam-Evisa-nation-list.pdf/21e0f88f-d8a0-48b8-bfdb-a0f82b0853e2) If your country doesn't make the list then you have to apply for a paper Visa from the nearest Embassy, sorry.

**4.)** [Here is the list of airports, land and sea entry points that accept the E-Visa.](https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/documents/20181/117155/List-of-evisa-port.pdf/c774e24b-1ab8-4fb6-9ac1-dcdfaccecf8e)

**5.)** Visa Exemption: A few nationalities are afforded the luxury of Visa Exemption. The time period varies from 14 days to 90 days. All you need is proof of onward travel and you're good to go. There are about [25 lucky nationalities with this perk.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Vietnam) (And yes, you can enter on an E-Visa, then leave, then return using your Visa exemption or vice versa.)

**6.)** Expedited Services: Lastly, up until last week it was possible for a poorly prepared traveller to get an expedited E-Visa via some of the excellent 3rd Party Vendors that provide Visa services. [These guys are one of several examples.](http://vietnamvisapro.com/) There has been a new government crackdown on these services and expedited E-Visas by 3rd Party Vendors does NOT exist at this time.

**Bottom line:** Use the official government website and submit your application with plenty of spare time and you'll find that entering Vietnam with an E-Visa is simple and straightforward.

Happy travels.

**UPDATE ON APRIL 14th:** In the last few days some the 3rd Party expediters are back at work again after the government crackdown. So if you're a poorly prepared traveller and didn't apply for your E-Visa in time you can once again pay big bucks to get it rushed through before your flight departs. Good luck.",0
Xinjiang in seven days,"In late April of this year, I travelled in Xinjiang for a week. Being rather surprised by its beauty I thought I may as well share some pictures with you. The food was great too, 抓飯 forever!",0
"One week in Thailand, photos and thoughts.","This is the beginning of a 3+ month trip to SEA. I was apprehensive as I haven't done any long overseas trips but so far it's been super easy and smooth! So if you're on the fence, just do it! Thailand is very easy to navigate for English speakers and with smart phones now it's dead smooth to get around and find accommodations, etc. 

Photo 1: China Town. Stayed on a river front little hotel for $20/night and wandered the markets. Ate soo much good food. Favorite was grandma Noi's duck noodles, 70 baht a bowl!

Photo 2: Inside Wat Pho

Photo 3: Party boats going down the Cha Phraya River with a Wat in the background. 

Photo 4: Prawns at a night market

Photo 5: A Buddha head grown over by a bodhi tree. Blanking on the name of the Wat but it's in Ayutthaya.

Photo 6-15: Various temples in and around Ayutthaya. We took a train up here from Bangkok, 2 hours, 15 baht each. Stayed at a guest house on the river for 650baht/night. Ate a ton of street food from the vendors at the various markets. My favorite were the boat noodles, seafood omlettes, and rotti. 

One thing that made me apprehensive was a lot of the negative things I read online in researching Thailand. I haven't found any of the negative things listed in reviews to be bothersome. I think it's all about expectations. For example our first hotel, it was $20/night and lots of complaints online, like sure, it's not amazing and it's run down but you're paying $20/night! Don't expect a 5 star resort for that price.

The canals will be smelly, there will be traffic, there will be trash, there are stray dogs, yes it is hot. But that's just part of the experience. We've had an incredible time.

All this is to say don't let what you read online turn you off! This has been some of the smoothest and most enjoyable traveling I've ever done. The thai people are so kind! Just learning to say Sawati krap and kap kun krap goes a long way.

We've just been winging it as we go. Using Google and agoda to find places to stay. Grab app to get places if it's far but mostly walking around if it's under 3km. Discovered a ton of really cool alleyways and local spots that way. Point to the food you want. Lots of vendors speak a little English too.

We found the best food just walking around at the street markets and seeing what was popular with the locals. Our worst meals have been in the more expensive(relatively) touristy restaurants. 

As far as budget goes I was a bit worried about thailand being more expensive now but every room we've booked so far has been under $20, all private rooms non hostels with A/C. Food has been $10-20 a day just eating everything we want from street vendors. Walking around a lot saves money on transportation. The most expensive thing so far has been bjj and muay thai training. Got our asses kicked at a gym in Ayuttha, training in 100 degree thailand heat is something else!!",0
Hotel in Costa Rica missed a charge and are now asking me to pay it via email or phone.,"It’s a long-established and trusted hotel. They had my card on file for incidentals and have a website fully capable of receiving payments. They missed a lunch charge on my checkout bill and I got an email from the concierge asking if I would pay it so the waitress doesn’t have to. Of course, send me a link for me to pay. She responds with ‘we don’t use a link, please fill out this form’ and sends this word document asking for all of my credit card information. I tell her no, I need a secure form of payment. She says that the only other way to do it is by phone. I looped the hotel’s sales manager and financial advisor into the email chain.

Have you ever heard of such a thing in your life??? The email address is legit, the only thing I can think of is that she is trying to hide the mistake from her bosses (which I just effectively blew up her spot if that was the case). But what would you do in this situation if they don’t provide secure method of payment?",0
What happened on this flight?,"I worked in travel a few years ago and I was on an Emirates flight back from Perth to Dubai after returning with a work trip with the Western Australia tourism board and Emirates/Qantas but it was a pretty strange experience. When we boarded there was around 40-50 people on board including the 10 in our group and the crew and it was probably the least amount of people I’ve ever seen on a long haul flight! 

We take off and about 5 minutes from taking off the male flight attendant is looking out of the window from his seat and pointing to the female flight attendant near him. He seemed quite worked up and then the whole crew remained in their take off seats for around 30-45 minutes whilst talking on those phones that they have. 

About 30-45 minutes after take off, we’re told over the loud speaker that we’re expecting turbulence throughout the flight and to keep our seat belts on at all times (the sign literally didn’t turn off). The flight attendants then started to move everyone to the middle/left side of the plane and closed the window blinds on the right side. I asked if anything was wrong and why the male flight attendant seemed worried at the start but was just told that it was turbulence causing the seat belt sign issue and that he was just ‘admiring’ the view from take off (that sentence has always stuck with me). 

After about 11 hours of flying, we reach Dubai and we land at a completely separate part of the airport to the main terminal part. We had to wait for them to get stairs (I kid you not, the type you’d use to get on a Ryan air or EasyJet low cost flight), and arrange for a shuttle bus to pick us up and take us to the terminal. It was a pretty strange experience - We got inside the terminal and were scurried through by an airport rep but enroute they upgraded our entire party to business class for the Dubai to London leg with Qantas (presumably as the previous flight wasn’t a great experience) and no further mention of it was ever made.

I have just been talking to someone about this strange experience today and just wondered if this is protocol if something happens with an engine or an issue with the plane? I wish I’d pushed for more info at the time but it was a bit of a whirlwind experience.",0
"Firenze, Italy","Italian living in Italy. 
Sometimes Italians tend to forget the beauty of their country. For me, Firenze, followed by Rome, is just on another level if we talk about traveling and authentic atmosphere. The narrow streets, the bars, the funny accent, the caring macellaio that pats your back while you eat their handmade lampredotto, the architecture and so many other details make this city a top tier place.

Questions on Altitude,"I’m a pretty active guy; I’ve been doing martial arts for ten years, rock climbing regularly, love going for a good walk in the woods, etc.

I’ve spent the last few weeks here in Quito, Ecuador living around 3300m, and it seems like some days I’m okay with the altitude. Now that said, I also have days like this morning where I’m gasping for air walking up the few flights of stairs in my hostel. Is it normal for adjusting to high altitude to have these high and low days? Should that adjustment be linear? What’s the deal lol?

I’m going to be traveling in the Andes for the next six months or so, and I’d like to have an idea of how your supposed to cope with altitude.",0

I have a loose outline of where we would like to go but thought it would be great to get tips from more experienced people. In general I hate moving too fast, so it might seem like lots of days in somewhere you may stay less, but I want those days to rest and recharge.

Here is my basic itinerary (The nights in each place is fluid and can change) . We want a mixture of everything (nature, culture, party ... everything!)

THAILAND (we have already been to krabi, khao sok, chiang mai)

\- Land in Bangkok, 1-2 nights here (have been a few times before)

\- Bus / Ferry to Koh Chang, \~6nights here (I know this is a bit long but i really want to kick it all off with a relaxing beach time after the stress of moving out of our current home) 

\- Back to bangkok 1 night

\- Khao yai nature tour \~2 nights

\-Train to Chiang mai \~4-5nights

\- Bus to Pai \~ 4-5nights

\- Bus to Chiang Rai \~4-5nights (perhaps go see phu chi fa sunrise for one of these nights)

\- Slow boat to Laos (1night in pakbeng)

LAOS

\- Luang prabang 4-5nights

\- Train to Vang Vieng 4-5nights

\- Train to Vientiene 4-5nights

\- Fly to Pakse 4-5nights

\- Bus to Don Det 4-5 nights

CAMBODIA (bus everywhere here)

\- Siem Reap 4-5nights

\- Phnomh Penh 4-5nights

\- Kep 2-3nights

\- Kampot 2-3nights

\- Sihanoukville 3-4nights

\- Koh Rong 5-6nights

\- Back to Phnomh Penh

VIETNAM (here is where i am really struggling to fit it all in 30 days) 

\- Flight to ho chi minh \~3nights

\- Train to mui ne \~3nights

\- Overnight train to Hoi an \~4nights

\- Hai van pass to Hue \~3nights

\- Bus / train to Phong Nha \~3nights

\- Bus to Ninh Binh - \~3-4nights

\- Bus / ferry to Cat ba \~ 3nights (maybe a cruise)

\- Bus / ferry to hanoi \~1night

\- Hai Giang loop tour \~4nights

\- Hanoi \~2 nights

My questions:

1. Does anyone see any glaring problems with this route
2. Should we spend less time in laos and do a visa run in vietnam so we can spend longer here? Or less time in laos & cambodia and try fit in Malaysia for 2 weeks? 
3. I dont want to rent motorbikes because I am scared of an accident, I have heard /seen so many horror stories and even know of 1 death on them whilst riding in SEA. Everyone seems to report that this is their favourite ever thing they did though so i am a bit torn, just wondering if anyone else has chosen not to rent motorbikes? 

It seems a bit too ""planned"" which is fair, but this is just a loose itinerary that we would be happy to change en route.

EasyJet cancelled my flight 5h before departure and I'm wondering about my rights,"Hi,

I see similar questions in this subreddit frequently, but in my case I'm wondering about the fine print of the rights given by easyJet on flight cancellations.

I got re-scheduled on another flight, 2 days later than the original flight (there was no other option suggested by them). Because of this, I'm entitled to accomodation, transport and meal expenses.

But I'm wondering what are the spending ceilings for these expenses, if there are any? As for the hotel, they only told me to book a 3-star or less hotel, without telling my a price ceiling. Has any of you found out if there's any? And for the meals? Is it something like 50€ / meal / person ?

For additional info, this is regarding easyJet Switzerland, and the flight cancellation was due to a technical issue.

Thanks",0
Can you travel Central and South America with around 11K for 6 months? Is it a realistic budget?,"I'm planning to travel through some countries in Central and South America (Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala) for 6 months, starting October.

I can spend around 11000€ ($11800) on this without blowing through emergency savings for my (then likely jobless...) return. I know that Chile will burn the budget more than the other countries, but I do plan to see all of the country, particularly because it looks so gorgeous and is one of the ""safer"" ones in the region for female solo travellers.

I usually stay in hostels, but also cheap hotel rooms once a week to get some decent sleep in because I can't really sleep in hostels. I eat as cheaply as possible. I take public transport wherever it's reasonably safe. The one thing I don't save on are tours into nature / organized treks (vs. not doing them), because I love nature and don't drive.

In your opinion or experience, is this a realistic budget in 2023?

Thank you for your input!",0
12 days in California with roller coasters + nature,"Hey, I love roller coasters and amusement parks but where I live has almost none. I've been to Orlando in 2012 (Disney, Universal, Sea World), so I don't need to repeat these parks. Now, I'm going to California for the first time, alone, and I got a basic planning, but I need your help.

- Tuesday (June 13)  - Arrive on LAX after 20h flight, sleep and visit west hollywood.

- Wednesday (14) - Six Flags

- Thursday (15) - Warner Bros Tour, Space Shuttle Endeavour, Griffin Observatory, Santa Monica.

...

- Tuesday (20) - Dinner in SF.

- Wednesday (21) - Figma config conference in SF

- Thursday (22) - Conference part 2

- Friday (23) - Night tour on Alcatraz

... (probably Golden Gate Bridge and a few museums in the bay area)

- Monday (26, 5am) - Return flight.

There are two ways I thought about filling the June 16-19 void: either going to San Diego and from San Diego getting a flight to San Francisco, or renting a car and going from Los Angeles to San Francisco driving. I'm a bit scared about driving, as I got my driver's license 3 months ago and I'll be fully alone (like, what if the car breaks), but I know the highways are a straight line, so I accept the risk.

I also thought about visiting National Parks (Yosemite or the one with Sequoias) but they seem very far from the road. People say that going to Santa Barbara, Monterey, Santa Cruz, Big Sur and slocal (San Louis Obispo) are worth it, and I'm like.. If I go through the coast, I can't see a national park. If I go through the coast, do I go the full path, or take the highway until the half and then the other half go through the coast?

Final thing: I'll have absolutely no equipment to hike, so if I go to a park, it needs to be straightforward to walk with a standard shoe.

TL;DR:
If you had 5 days in California to go from LAX to SFO, what would you do?

- Rent a car, stop in a national park, sleep in a small city, keep traveling? 

- Rent a car, go through the coast stopping in every city starting from Malibu and Santa Barbara?

- Visit knott's berry, great america, Gilroy, six flags SF (not sure worth it)

- Explore San Diego and get a plane.

- You name it.",0
Cambodia: best way to travel from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh?,"From what I read, the bus is excluded, so it's either the flight or renting a private van/taxi. Do you have any recommendation or information about the road safety and overall comfort of the trip? Thanks in advance!",0
The people you travel with can make or break a trip,"My fiance and I just did Italy for 2 weeks with old friends of mine. First time spending this amount of time with them. They were so toxic and I learned so much about them as people I'm personally reevaluating the friendship. Both my fiance and I experienced physical symptoms of anxiety after 5 days with them. Behavior ranged from Fighting constantly, threats of divorce, meandering from one tourist trap to another while judging me for basic research on good local resturants, refusing to speak the local language, smoking and blowing it in the face of us (nonsmokers), I could go on. 

My fiance in particular regrets the trip in general and he realized he took 3 photos total, almost like he wanted to forget the first time he ever went to Europe. 

While this is a minor vent sesh, also take it as a lesson. Planning a trip and a frenemy is in the group? Nope. Unsure of your MIL being xenophobic about the local culture? NOPE. Any interpersonal question mark? Talk it out with them and establish boundaries and expectations. 

Travel is all about making memories and learning in the limited time we have on earth. Don't waste it trying to figure how to crop out the shitty people from it after the fact.",0
"Japan, Indonesia and Malaysia in August 2023","Hi all,

Husband and will be leaving to travel Japan, Indonesia and Malaysia on the 4th to the 29th of August. We planned to spend a week in each county however, have set aside nine days in Indonesia so we do have two days that we can add elsewhere. 

We are in our early thirties and this is our first time travelling. We are not into partying or drinking and are looking for culture, good food, an opportunity to see natural beauty and some days off to just relax. 

Our itinerary initially included Singapore but we have compensated in hopes that we can spend longer in each destination rather than feeling rushed. 

This is our current plan:

Malaysia:

5th Arrive into Kaular Lumpar 
6th Kaular Lumpar
7th Cameron Highlands
8th Penang
9th Penang
10th Langkawi
11th Langkawai

Indonesia 
12th Arrive into Jakarta 
13th Jakarta
14th Fly to Bali stay in Ubud
15th Bali Ubud 
16th Bali Seminyak
17th Bali Nusa Dua
18th Bali Uluwatu
19th Fy to Lombok
20th Lombok Gilli islands

Japan
21st Fly to Tokyo
22nd Tokyo
23rd Osaka
24th Osaka
25th Hakone 
26th Hakone
27th Visit and island off of Japan


This is what we have managed to come up with so far, please can someone that has been to any of these destinations critique our current plans and help make the best of these 3.5 weeks that we have. Also if anyone has any recommendations for food outlets or hotels please feel free to drop them as we are looking for accommodation. We are looking for mid tier accommodation, but are more than happy to splurge on hotels/retreats that are beautiful/scenic and offer a luxury feel as the trip is our once in a lifetime. We have a budget of 6/7k.

What happens at an airport?,"Hello! I’m traveling from the UK to USA in a few days and it’s the first time I’ve been on a plane let alone traveled by myself! 

I have a coach booked to the airport but beyond that have no idea how it works. I have all the paper stuff sorted and printed, booking comf, visa, covid etc. no ticket or anything but I assume I just check in with the American Airlines app? 

What happens at the airport? Where do I go first? When do I check the bags in? Or myself? Do I need a printed pass or will it be on my phone? Will they have me on the system? Do I pick a seat there or when checking in? If I can’t check in on the app is there someone I can speak to there who can? Are there people at the airport I can ask incase I’m stuck? 

Haha sorry, I’m just a little overwhelmed with it all and don’t know what to expect! If anyone could run me through what happens I would be so grateful! I’m flying from Heathrow T3 if that helps at all!

Reserving anything in Italy is annoying,"I’m not sure if anyone else has had this issue, but I’ve found it incredibly frustrating trying to make reservations or bookings for sites in Italy. I’ve been to 9 countries in Europe and never had as many problems as I’m having now. 

Every single attractions requires you to click like 8 different links, select from 20 different options, then takes you to a different site to pay, then requires you to create and confirm an account, then verify your card, and on and on. Obviously I’m exaggerating, but for the love of god just let me click “buy tickets” and then have a single ticket that gets me into the site that I can pay for right then and there without making any accounts. I’ve also found the ticket descriptions to be fairly vague a lot, meaning I’m not even sure which option to pick half the time. 

Beyond that, everything is always booked way in advance. Obviously that’s not Italy’s fault, but it’s frustrating when you decide to go to Italy a month in advance and all the major sites are fully booked until the end of summer. That one is totally on me, but just an added irritation.",0

Is it worth renting with Hertz over Alamo if Hertz is 25% cheaper?,"We are planning a trip in a couple of months and need a rental car for a week. We usually go with Alamo but got a great deal at Hertz for an electric SUV. The only issue is we read horror stories of Hertz having a practice of renting cars that were reported stolen (prior drivers never returned vehicles, Hertz later received vehicles but never updated their software to say the cars were returned, rented cars to new customers who get stopped by police on flag for stolen vehicles) having to drivers arrested by the police. We prefer to avoid a company that puts its customers through this but want to see if the company is worth the risk since the settlement in December.

Need Help with Sicily Itinerary!,"Me and my fiancé will be on our honeymoon in Italy next summer; we  originally planned to do 4 nights in Palermo before heading to Sorrento  to do the Amalfi Coast. But since we’ll be going in June, we decided to  skip the crowds on the Amalfi Coast and just do 7 nights in Sicily  before heading to Rome. My plan now is to keep the 4 nights in Palermo,  with day trips to Cefalu and The Valley of the Temples; And then doing 3  nights in Catania, with ideas for day trips to Taormina and/or Syracuse. I don’t want to rent a car, so having central locations in the  city’s without having to switch hotels nightly is very appealing. I  know most people suggest with only a week there to just stick to either  coast, but does this seem doable? I know it would include some long  trips on trains or bus but me and my fiancé aren’t partying so we’re  usually up and ready to go early. Just wondering if this seems like too  much in 1 week.

2 men stole our camera in Rome Italy at our hotel‘s parking.,"We are in Italy and in the morning while checking out some random guys stole our camera from our car. My husband was putting the luggage in the car and the car was unlocked. There was a random person in the parking who started asking something to my husband. While my husband replied him his friend came from behind and stole the camera out of the passenger seat. This happened literally in the span 20 seconds. When my husband notice they both were gone. He told the hotel reception the weren’t helpful at all about the situation and started saying we aren’t responsible for the parking even though it was there private parking. 
The manager wasn’t even showing the security footage. Upon insisting she showed the footage and everything was caught on camera. We could even see the face of the man who stole the camera from the car after that the guy tried to pick the suitcase but left. But the manager was insisting the he didn’t do it and was making excuses for them. 
Then we called police from there they noted everything took details and told us to report to the nearest police station. We went there the women couldn’t speak English she sent us to another police station. At this second one they said it’s an immigration police station go to another one. I told the police woman there about the situation oh it’s just a camera and then they gave us another address and there we were told the samt thing that it’s not a complaint center go back to the nearby police station. 
At this point we just gave up. The whole situation was fucking bizarre and the response of hotel staff and the authorities was the worst. 
Tbh we knew we weren’t going to get the camera back but we saw the faces of those assholes on security camera and we really wanted to at least report them so they don’t do this to somebody else. 
This was such a special trip for my family and we are so sad that we lost all the pictures on camera.",0

Which country is the cheapest for a one week holiday?,"Im on a tight budget this summer but I’am still looking forward to hop on a plane/train and chill out a week on a beautiful beach. Im planning to spend less than 550€ on the whole trip, my starting point is Budapest.

The countries I considered are Portugal, Albania, Turkey and Bulgaria but any other ideas are welcome. In which country would such a tiny budget worth the most?

I would like to know where can I find the cheapest food, and accomodation because obviously thats where most of the money goes other than traveling expenses. What do you guys think?",0
Rome in November,"The family (8 adults) is taking a trip to Rome over the US Thanksgiving holiday and staying for a week. Itinerary is in flux right now, but I’ve done a search of the sub and have a lot of great ideas!

My other question is about getting around in Rome. We plan to use public transportation and walk. I haven’t seen many people mention bikes tho. Would they be advised for tourists to use to get around?

Travelling advice - China/Philippines/Japan,"I'll be travelling the China, Philippines and Japan for a total of around 3 months, (2 weeks each in China/Philippines), and I've had some concerns about some of the destinations.

I'd like some advice on what is the best plan/route for my situation? I want to have the freedom to visit nature sites whenever I want but I'm unsure of the best way to access them, When I travelled Japan in the past it was really easy because of the 30 day railpass and extensive train network.

Is it possible to solo travel in the US at 19?,"I had plans to travel the entire US for the next 12 months. The main issue I’m having is hotels not allowing anyone under 21 to book.

I know there are hotels that allow anyone over 18 to book, but is it enough to comfortably travel to every US state without having to worry about where I’ll stay for the night? And if it is possible is there an easier way to find an 18+ hotel than just calling every single one in the area.",0

Questions about JAL (Japan Airlines) flight from US to Asia via Tokyo,"Just booked a flight US->Tokyo->SE Asia. It arrives at Narita, then there's a 19h layover and connecting flight is from Haneda. I wasn't aware when I booked that the 2 airports are far apart  which I now see.

\- how is the transfer done? I'm assuming JAL will take care of it and I won't have to pay or find trains etc myself? Do I need a visa? I wasn't told during booking so again I assume not? Will I need to collect baggage? Go thru custom/immigration etc?

edit - I realize now that the transfer is upto me. I wish the booking made this clear. If I'm going to exit and go into Tokyo, spend money on taxi, hotel etc I'd rather stay for a few days

\- this is Premium Economy which is the reason I booked since it was almost same price as economy on other airlines, and fares have increased a lot, almost doubled since Dec !!

\- JAL says they give PE lounge access which is another reason I booked the long layover. Can I choose where to spend the time between the 2 airports, and can I spend it all in lounges? My flight will land at 16.25 and outgoing flight is 10.15 so its an overnight layover

\- how are the airports in general and esp the lounge?

\- If any of above e.g. the transfer/layover is a problem, I'm assuming I have 24hrs to cancel with no penalty on all ticket classes. This was booked in the US and I believe that applies to all bookings?",0
Is it allowed to transit to low budget airlines in certain European airports?,"Hi, my girlfriend recently got an Irish travel short stay visa. She doesn't have a Schengen visa. 

We haven't booked our flights yet (from Kazakhstan) but just a short query regarding transiting. 

I know if I book a single ticket connecting flight with a legacy airline like Lufthansa likely through Frankfurt; she will face no issues.

However, I am wondering what the story is with low budget carriers. 

For example, if I booked two seperate ticket budget airline flights transiting through Frankfurt or a similar international hub airport, would she still be able to transit airside or would she be required to leave airside to check into her next low budget flight (which obviously she can't do). 

Obviously, I know she also wouldn't be able to check in luggage if we did it this and there's also the issue that the airline might not even let her board if she doesn't have a valid visa for the end destination flight from their own specific flight booking.",0
Help me decide which place to stay in Paris for 6 nights,"I narrowed down my choices for my upcoming Paris trip to three studios, which are just a little over $105 per night for my dates.

**Context**: I'll be arriving at 9:15 PM at CDG, so I may arrive in the city proper at maybe 1.5 hours after because I'll be renting a sim first and figuring out the train system so I won't get lost.

* I'm also contemplating just suffering a red eye and arrive at 8 AM Paris time, but it would be 14 hours of trying-to-sleep hell

First up is this studio in [Bastille](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10466472?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=f98cefed-c41d-4529-abad-1ae860f4f067).

It's the best one location-wise, but the catch is the check-in is a bit difficult. You have to get the key from a cafe that's approx. 800 meters from the apartment. Not usually bad since I'm a fit guy, but I'll be arriving at night + with a laptop + wheeled luggage and there's a chance it might rain (how rainy is October in W.Europe?). I also talked to the owner re: hard mattress reviews, and she said she fixed it.

The next two are near each other in Batignolles and are maybe 10%-15% cheaper, but seem to offer just as good if not better amenities because they're not as central as the first one.

This [one](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/829477575925096624?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=a9965779-b08a-4d64-a71a-9d577cde2953) has a washer and looks to have bigger space and a better bed. It also allows late check-in because it uses a lockbox than actually meeting you. This [one](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/845737265258588920?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=f8a50bbf-4d75-4cd6-bd7d-3b271a8c09e4) seems to be the most thoughtful in terms of amenities. Check-in is also a little later (just past 11 PM), but the way she worded is she'd meet me in person.

Thank you for your thoughts!

PS: They all don't have ACs, but since it's in October, I likely shouldn't need them but I'm ready to hear your opinions.",0
Recommendations cities to visit in Eastern Europe?,"Hi friends,

Are there any other cities you would recommend for me in that region of Europe, sites to see within those cities, or the order of which I should visit each city? I’m hoping to be as frugal as I can. I could also use recommendations on the cheapest way for me to travel!

Using U.S. credit card vs cash in a local bank account (Korea)?,"Hello, everyone!

I’ll be visiting Korea this year and was wondering about the best method of payment. 

I already have cash in Korean won in my Korean bank account. However, I was hoping to apply for a new credit card and meet the minimum spending requirement by using it while there (and take advantage of the bonus categories). 

The card won’t have any FTF, but I’m not sure how currency conversation rate comes into play. On one hand, I think it’d be beneficial to use U.S. credit card as dollar is strong, but on the other hand, I’m worried that there will be some kind of mark-up during conversion with the credit card.

Is there no difference whether I pay in cash or with a U.S. credit card as long as I request to pay in local currency AND the card has no FTF? And no FTF means no currency conversion fee as well, right? 

The cards I’m planning to use are Chase Sapphire Preferred (already own), Bilt Mastercard (new), and maybe Amex Gold (new).

Appreciate your experience/advice shared! :)

Btw we have a car, pisa and sienna aren’t really on our priority list (not fans of architectural and religious stuff), we try to avoid “tourist traps” and prefer local activities such as small/private wine tours, cooking classes and walking in towns. We don’t really have a limit to our budget, but won’t break the bank just for one activity since we already did with our private boat tour in the Amalfy coast 🤣

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",0
Question: Does hand luggage always get checked even with connecting flights? Or do you stay in the part of the airport where it doesn't need to be rescanned?,"I've never flown before as an adult so I'm not quite sure how this stuff works. I tried looking at the FAQ but I didn't see the info I'm requesting on it. If you have a connecting flight does that mean that your carry-on luggage has to be rechecked/scanned by security but not your checked luggage?

Or does your carry on not have to be rescanned because you stay in the screened part of the airport?

Also what about self transfers, does that mean you have to collect your checked luggage and go to a different part of the airport where you would have to check in again and everything rescanned?

Do non-self transfer connecting flights always automatically transfer over your checked luggage  to the next flight?

Thanks in advance for the help!",0
Best places to visit in Spain for anxious introverts that hate tourist crowds?,"My husband and I are spending 3 weeks in Spain this October (flying in and out of Barcelona) and we have no idea where to start with our itinerary. We are both quiet, introverts that enjoy nature, walking/hiking, beaches, cafes, pastries and other good food. We don't party or drink. We are looking for beautiful, mid-sized cities that have a quiet and relaxed vibe instead of being crawling with tourists traps and crowds. We don't want to be in total rural areas but will definitely be avoiding Madrid and probably won't be sticking around Barcelona too long once we get in. When we went to Italy last year I had a severe panic attack while we tried to navigate the crushing crowds of Rome which nearly paralyzed me in fear for the rest of the trip. On the other hand, the Amalfi coast was a dream (even though it was still touristy) it was beautiful and laid back enough for us to fully enjoy ourselves.   
We are also open to spending some time in Portugal or southern France as part of the trip. Cities that we've looked at so far are: Costa Brava area, Valencia, Alicante, Granada, San Sebastian, Porto.   
We are open to using transit/trains, catching some short extra flights, or renting a car for a road trip for part of the trip (hubby loves to drive).   
Any feedback?  
Thanks!",0
Cathay Pacific JFK to HNKG to HND,"Anyone ever took a Cathay Pacific flight to Tokyo Japan?   
How was it like?

How is the food?

I have a 16 hour flight and I wan't to know what im getting myself into.

Also is the vaccine required to board? I saw their covid guidelines but I heard from some a negative PCR test 72 hours prior is enough. That's just what i've heard.",0
Can i do the Machu Pichu trail if I'm fat?,"Kinda spontaneously got flight tickets to Peru and I'll be flying in about a month, with 2 friends of mine who are way more fit than i am to say the least. Didn't think about the physical part of going to these hikes at all in my stupidity, and now I'm kinda worried. I'm not fit at all and am kinda fat, although i really do want to do the hike, even if it is hard, or alternatively a shortened version. Do you think it's possible? If so, are there spesific trails and/or guides i should look into? Thanks in advance


Edit:
Thanks for the many comments, i really appreciate it. 
I want to clarify that my intention was not for the 4 day Inca trail. Although i would love to do it one day, I'll settle for the shortened version (2 days from what I've seen) for now. Reading all the people commenting about going on more walks before the trip gave me the motivation to walk about 5km, which is way less than any hike in Peru, but i want to think of it as a start.

Thank you all very much, i really hope I'll be able to achieve this goal",0
State parks better than national?,"So about ten years ago I went to the Tetons and by chance ended up at the state park. The crowds were less, parking cheaper, and the views seemingly the same. Are there other state parks next to national parks worth seeing or are the national parks inherently superior experiences? I’m not trying to see them all so I don’t care about that sort of thing",0
Thoughts on using delta for international flights?,Im planning to go to asia from us with 14hrs flights. Is delta a good airline to go with? I only plan to fly economy. Any thoughts?,0
Checked bags for 1 day layover,"My spouse and I are excited for our first business class ride through points but we haven’t been able to find an answer besides “depends” for whether we will have to recheck our checked bags during the layover.

We have a 23 hour layover in TPE both ways during the round trip.

ICN to TPE via Asiana

23 hour layover

TPE to LAX via EVA

Flights are on the same ticket bought through ANA.

We will have 2 checked bags each so we were hoping they’d be taken care of so we aren’t figuring out how to store 4 large bags while trying to check out Taipei.

Anyone have experience with this and whether we’ll be okay?",0
Driving up west Maui,Hello! I booked a trip to Maui this upcoming summer. I’ve read about the scary one lane/ clif side/ no guardrail roads on Highway 340 past the blowhole and would like to avoid these if possible. Would my best bet be driving up clockwise (I.e. mountainside) from Kapalua to the blowhole then doing a u-turn and heading back? Is this drive relatively straightforward with wider two lanes and guard rails? Any other tips for my trip? Just want to plan accordingly. I’ll be renting a car and will be there with my two older parents. Thanks!,0
Have any of you used Dayuse (website where you can book a hotel for a long layover)?,I've never used it before and have a question. What happens if you select a time block such as 7 AM-3 PM but don't arrive there until  9 AM? Do they just adjust the time to make it 9-5 or do you still have to leave at 3 where you lost 2 hours? I would be coming straight from an airport early in the morning from a redeye flight and just want to get a nap in  and relax before my next flight,0
"Do I need cash in Denmark, Sweden, Oslo and Bergen?",We will be traveling to these 4 places in coming months. Would like to check do we need to bring cash? Does cash still commonly use in these 4 places? Are payment cards are accepted for most of the places for spending?,0
