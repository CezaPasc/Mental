Got out of the Hospital yesterday!,"Rant / Vent because I can't really be that happy about it. My Uncle died, who I loved very much, causing me psychosis. Schizophrenia doesn't run in my family but my brother, so the genetics were there, I guess. Symptoms pretty similar to negative symptoms of schizophrenia were there for years, I think (Which I've told my doctors. It's probably depression, though) So yeah. I've talked with my brother a lot, asking for advice and such, which I got plenty of, so I think I'm good. I'm on 2mg risperidone. I was on 4mg, but that tired me out hellishly, but 2mg's still taking it's toll on me. In 3 weeks, I'll be on abilify instead. 

I wish whoever's reading this a wonderful day!",1
Ive been mentally exhausted for about 3 years because my brother is being “gangstalked”,"Hi my name is lupe and I’m 18 from southern California (sorry about getting so much into detail) but i have a brother who is turning 31 on June and for about 3 years since 2020 in my eyes he wasn’t himself anymore.

For about 3 in a half so maybe years my brother has been dealing with paranoia, delusions, and thats really about it, and i have been telling myself this doesn’t look like schizophrenia maybe delusional disorder, bi-polar, something of that nature but basically he believes he’s being watched from every single device from my game console to his phone camera, the cable box, he believes he’s being watched when he gos out to do something, he also believes celebrities, the government and other different agencies are in on it, he names different celebrities to me who are watching him, he believes he’s the most influential person, he says “I’m bigger than social media” he believes different celebrities want to be intimate with him, it goes on and on.

The thing is that he doesn’t deal with hallucinations (auditory or seeing things), he doesn’t have disorganized speech, he doesn’t have psychotic tendencies unless it involves the delusion, like hell get mad if i don’t agree with what he tells me about these specific delusions, in his case all of these beliefs are reality.

Its been hard dealing with this for 3 years especially since i live with him, i feel like i don’t know him anymore at some times, he was completely normal until boom he snapped in 2020, and now he’s just this now. Theres so much more detail that i can get into but its a lot to explain but i hope some of you people get the gist and have insight.

Me and my sister don’t have any mental health disorders, well i have ADHD and anxiety but i feel like thats common i was diagnosed when i was in elementary. But other than that my uncle does have severe trauma from jail which may have caused him to have a mental health disorder but my biological mom had 3 kids with 3 different dads so i have a different dad my brother has one and so, my grandmother says we don’t have schizophrenia in our genes as well, somethings i get scared ill end up like that, but at the end of the day i wanna live my life.

So i wanna conclude this on i hope you guys can give some insight on this, i also want to include that my brother has been through severe trauma like being ran over by a car at a very young age, doing narcotic drugs frequently like Xanax,Percocet’s, lean, pretty much ODing on them, also he got a yeast infection due to having intercourse with another girl, he also start smoking since high school until now but he stopped once he started to get like this due to panic attacks.

But thank you for reading and please if u can give me some insight on this.",1
Synchronicities,"They're everywhere. I've had like two today. All the time. They've been more frequent this week. Coworkers making Ludacris references last week, today my roommate puts on a random video parodying Ludacris. I'll be thinking about something, suddenly a coworker starts talking about it. I'll be wondering about a certain thing, and I'll run into countless random references. 

It's all tripping me out. I am very paranoid of everything right now. This has to be the universe fucking with me, or is it a schiz thing. IDK. This past two weeks have been weird.",1
I told my psychiatrist everything,"I did it. I told him everything about what's been going on. I told him about the feelings of strongly believing that something evil has entered inside me and that it's been controlling my thoughts and emotions. I told him about the self harming triggered by these horrible intrusive thoughts, and how I have no control over these urges. And I told him how these voices in my head are completely destroying me. He was soooo understanding and listened so well. I feel so relieved! I feel like finally I'm being heard and that I'm going to get the help I need and deserve. Right now I'm on haldol orally but he wants to switch me to the injection so it stays in my body longer to try and control symptoms. He said that this belief of feeling this darkness inside is definitely a delusion and that I'm not crazy, but that it is the illness and it's going to be okay. I'm also taking abilify again which I hope will also help me because these symptoms are really kicking my ass right now. I'm hoping the haloperidol injection wont make me too tired? And that there aren't alot of other side effects. He also said if I need a hospital stay to sort all this out that he will bring me in and see what he can do. Honestly I feel so much better after today's appointment. Does anyone have any advice about how they manage they're delusions and hallucinations? I completely broke down when I was talking to him because I've been feeling so hopeless. I just want to feel like me again. Any suggestions would be great",1
Some tips for management,"First of all, don't use any management tools including this to avoid seeking professional help. That said, let's keep it real. Let me give you a process and then some tools.

First, really get a grasp of the actual problem. I can't speak for you, but if I hypothetically had such an issue, I'd imagine what is happening is that I'm always very fixated on potential negative motives and plans of other people. There's a lot of paranoia involved in this, and what really would fuck this up is if your hyperfixation on this was ever partially validated. Because then, if part of the scenario you played out was validated, and you can process and think through all the rest of the negative scenarios, you necessarily believe then that anything you can conceive yourself is actually being done by others that have these detrimental motives.

What's the problem then? You will constantly maneuver and avoid or confront those things constantly. You can't function because you are in constant fight or flight.

How can you manage it? Well, easy, allow yourself to completely play thru the worst scenarios and delusions. Think about what the world is and your place if it were true. Realize despite it, you're still here. Whatever the worst thing that could come to pass is (most likely some sort of being killed), come to terms with it now and be amazed of the experience of life you've had and the potential opportunity to pull the cloak away before you slip back into the same aether you were pulled from before birth. Let go of your ego and your need to fight something that if actually is, is so much bigger and awe stricking than you that you should feel privileged to be the focus of such a thing. Allow the ultimate thing you fight every moment to avoid to consume and carry you away, it's OK. We all will turn into the same dust in the end, everything you do and experience will end in you fertilizing the soil exactly the same as your enemies. There are no winners. Allow what can pass to pass, if for nothing more than to witness it and be amazed.

If you no longer fear the meaningless consequences you were trained to fear by your doubts and conditioning, you will be free to just exist and observe, and whatever time you have there, you will be happy and you will be able to do anything you want.

Stop fighting, just let the forces push and pull. Let yourself be in danger, accept death knowing it comes exactly the same for anyone who plotted against you.",1
Please help me,"Whenever I'm around someone physically I get fully convinced that they can read my mind or even change what I'm thinking but when I'm on my own these beliefs seem really... dumb. That'snothow brains work.. but still whenever I'm around anyone it's like I lose the ability to challenge these thoughts and that's scary as well and I just don't really spend any time with anyone anymore now, it's been going on for about a month now, I just stay in my room all day. My dad tries to get me to do things with him but being the horrible daughter I am I completely freak out at the thought. I don't want to push him away and I tell him this in text messages all the time but it's like I lose myself when it actually comes to it. Please how do I push myself to not be like this. I love my dad I hate to do this to him.",1

I need some advice from you,"I have a hard time with all of my symptoms. And this will sound crazy, but I don't take medicine anymore. Because my career is in creative entertainment and cinema, and I honestly get all my creativity from my symptoms. When I was on meds, my abilities vanished until I had been off everything for some time.


I can, for the most part, handle the hallucinations. But the paranoid delusions are ruining my life.

I feel like everyone has ulterior motives. Everyone is out to get me. And that no one truly is acting in good faith or my best interests.

It doesn't help that I was actually hacked and had to get help from someone to secure my devices. Now I'm not sure who to trust, if I can and ever will trust anyone ever again.

How do I let go and stop being hypervigilant?",1
Recalling a time when I was in a psych ward,I remember one time I was in a psych ward really far from home. The staff did vending machine runs for the patients once a day and I had a 20 so I asked for something. They said they didn’t/ couldn’t change it for me so I couldn’t buy something. I was bummed when a lady I talked to a bit gave me a dollar. I remember telling her “I can’t pay you back.” And she said “Nothing in this life is promised.” I thought it was a beautifully profound thing and I think about that and her quite frequently. Does anyone else have experiences like this?,1

I feel like I dont have the right to be like this.,"I am feeling really bad and experiencing really messed up stuff. As my mom said, I dont have the right to feel and experience all these stuff, being depressed or suicidal ecc since I grew up in a household with stable income, loving parents (even tho they were very harsh on me at times and they have their own problems related to health).

My friends say I’m buggin…,"Right so I’ve known about this man in my house for a while, I have failed to find him time and time again when he comes out at 10 pm, so I’ve concluded he’s in my walls which is the only logical thing. He really freaks me the fuck out, when I was looking for him last night I was by the coat rack having a mini panic attack and went to my room where I placed salt at the door to establish a safe space so he can’t strangle me telepathically.

Additionally everyone says I should tell my therapist about this since it’s been about 4 weeks of hallucinations, this, a kid I can’t trust because I KNOW he’s gonna hurt me, outside of my mania. Regardless I got no fuckin clue why they say I’m buggin but if I am, I’m just sharing it here cause, why not lol.",1
My schizophrenic family is ruining my life..Any advice?,"I know the title sounds selfish and trust me I do feel selfish but I need help. I am only 21…I feel like I’m a mother to my mother , my older brother , sister & nieces . I love them dearly but I’m drained. 

My mom and brother are both schizophrenic. They are not willing to get any help nor take any medicine, they have been prescribed but refused. They don’t think anything is wrong with them. I live in a small city and none of the facilities will keep them longer than 72 hours. 

I recently got my own apartment. My mom stays with her boyfriend, It’s hell over there because my brother is extremely destructive and constantly tries to fight her boyfriend, he has put them out many times. So her last resort is obviously me, I stay in a small 1bedroom which means they’ll have to sleep in my living room, which also means, I can’t have company over nor enjoy my own privacy. My brother also leaves in & out, they argue all day, nosey, can be loud, etc. I’m a CNA who works 12hr shifts sometimes 16, and when I get off I just wanna rest in my..not deal with extra bullshit. I wanna invite whoever over , walk around naked, stay up as late as I want, etc ..

On top of that, my sister has 2 kids that my mother watches which means If they move in with me, that’ll be 4 people I have to watch after because my big sister can not get her own place ..her credit is messed up and no apartments will approve her.

I’m the youngest with no kids and I feel like I’m a parent . What should I do? I don’t wanna give up on them but I’m tired of tryninh to help people 

I wanna feel & be young & just live alone

Mother's schizophrenia destroyed my family,"My mother developed schizphrenia several years ago but me and my family struggled to recognise it and even treat it.

I [shared details about my experience in another sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/11jzp5t/mother_has_schizophrenia_and_wont_take_treatment) but a few months since then, the situation got worse and now my family is destroyed. My mother got extremely negative and combative and made life at home hell. She also mildly overdosed on her medication, but got back her to her negative, destructive self after recovery.

I and my wife, who were living with my parents for a bit, have now moved out and are looking for another home. My father and sister are disturbed, my wife can't stand my mother after the torture she experienced from her, and I'm mourning the loss of my mother ever being normal again.",1

It’s all part of their scheme, I discovered too much and they want to kill me by making me kill myself.

My Schizophrenic partner (24) is experiencing extreme and frequent depressive episodes and I don't know what I should do.,"For context, we have been dating about 7 months and we are long distance but he will occasionally spend a week or two at my house. 

He has had his diagnosis for nearly 4 years now. He is very dependent on me for support as I am his closest companion. He lives with his mother but their relationship is rocky so he doesn't see her as an emotional support figure.

He is medicated but he has always had episodes where he will feel very scared and upset and his hallucinations (mainly auditory) get really bad. 

Lately I feel like things are getting progressively worse and it's to the point that he's saying very concerning things like ""I'm not strong enough"" and ""I can't do this anymore"" and he just seems to be getting increasingly depressed with suicidal ideation. 

Being long distance I feel like I'm not sure exactly how to handle this. I feel like his therapist and psych team aren't doing enough for him or taking his well-being seriously enough and I feel like it's only a matter of time. He's having these episodes multiple times a day and I'm having to stay up with him to the wee hours of the morning every night trying to console him and talk him out of suicide. 

Should I try to get in contact with his therapist? What can I do to help him? I feel so useless and powerless.",1

My friend was able to identify that I'm in an Episode,"I went to visit a friend last night and she was able to identify that I'm in an episode. I had no idea honestly. She kept looking at my eyes telling me they were dilated and that my behavior was erratic. She said my sentences were hard to follow because i was jumping from subject to subject. I haven't been sleeping much and she said it's not normal to have this much energy after barely any sleep. What killed me was when she said ""This isn't you. Where is Maia?"" I asked her what she meant, and she said ""Youre totally different, everything about you, your energy, all of it is off"". Then she finally said it and it hit me: ""Maia, you're having an episode, I can tell"". I cried. No way. I didn't think so. I felt like everyone else was just moving slower than normal. Music sounds slower than normal. And now my head is fucked. All I can think about it how long has this been going on and I didn't notice? Other people have said little things like ""Hello, are you there?"" Cuz apparently i disassociate a lot, but i thought i was just spacey. But now I'm falling down the rabbit hole. Are my relationships real? Do people really care about me or are they just using me? Are these people even real?  I feel like I'm in the Truman show. I'm questioning everything and it's freaking me out. Everything looks like I'm watching a YouTube video instead of being in real time. I'm scared. I'm going to lose everybody.

experiencing first episode psychosis and I want to be alone,"(CW: ED, overbearing parents, undiagnosed)

Hi!! This is my second post here. This is also kind of a rant. I am doing not super okay since then but I need advice because I don’t think anyone has made a post like this yet. 

TLDR: my mom is feeding me too much, not leaving me alone, making me go from my house to her house and being waaayyy to overbearing  because of my mental health and hallucinations and I just want to be alone. Is it okay to be alone during this? Am I mad for no reason?

My mom is very overbearing and has been ever since I was small. I (20) live alone and she lives on in the middle of nowhere (farm) where there is nothing to do in a small house. I like my home and feel good living alone with my cats. but since two months ago, she doesn’t leave me alone. A doctor told her it’s best to not let me be alone.

Because of her work, she needs to be home.  She makes me go with her. I am very unhappy at her house and 60% of the week and time I am stuck in her house and the other 40% I’m allowed to be back home.

I have gained weight. have struggled with eating my entire life because of my parents eating patterns. Upset? Eat. Happy? Eat. I learnt to live a healthy lifestyle after living alone. I love working out and going for long walks but now, I am unable to do so because I can’t be alone. She doesn’t get how bad it makes me feel. 

I told my mom that I am upset the way she is making me eat and not allowing me to workout or go for walks. I told her it’s unhealthy how much weight I’ve gained in a short time and now I am very upset because I have absolutely no control over my life and it’s constant bad though and the voices are so awful I can’t stop them when I am like this. My mom said I’m not eating too much but I am. 

I just want to be alone again not because I want to do something unhinged but I am just too overwhelmed. I got taken off all my meds (adhd and birth control for hormones) and I just hate this I can’t take this experience anymore. 

The clinic that will help me will call me next week after a month of waiting to get in and two hospital visits later. 

Can someone just tell me I’m okay to be alone? She talks to me like a child now and I feel so useless here with her. I have no control over my life and don’t want to go from house to house anymore. I just want to be with my cats in my own home.",1
Why do people hate me so much?,"Genuine question. I am at my wits end because I very honestly do not know why people dislike me so much, and I genuinely want to know what the problem is.

Every time I see my therapist I ask him this same exact question and he tells me nothing is wrong with me and I just need to meet new people. I have met plenty of people in my 26 years of life and I am still mostly alone, apart from the LOML, but even he left me for a year during my psychotic episode.

Why were the nurses in the psych hospital so vicious to me? Why do my cousins that I grew up with never text me back but hold it against me if I don’t reach out to them? Why do my boyfriend’s friends treat me like I’m invisible? Why did my only friends during my psychotic episode make fun of me behind my back and right in front of me? Why did my former therapist and my psychiatrist both abandon me in the middle of my psychotic depressive episode when I said I was going to kms? Why did exactly 0 of the 6 mental health professionals I saw over a year suggest treatment for psychosis? What did I do???

As far as I know I am friendly and polite. I do my best every day. 

Any insight is appreciated.",1

I can see ghosts now,"I found out I had undiagnosed schizophrenia when i felt people staring at me all the time, and then I started hearing music and giggling that wasn't there, then I started hearing people say/whisper my name.
Recently I've been seeing these shadows out the corner of my eye, some are my height, others are taller, a lot of these shadows come by at night too. If not that, I feel a presence as if someone's behind me even though no one else is in the room

How can you help someone who is having a psychotic episode,"I’m meeting my partner soon and I experience psychosis a lot. I have these like breakdowns where I lay on the floor and like scream, shake, cry, mumble. In the state I get very paranoid and physically touch isn’t my favourite thing anyways. I haven’t found a way to be able to help that yet does anyone have any suggestions? I am meeting him soon and we are doing so in public so I really wouldn’t want it to ruin our first time meeting. Any advice on what he could do he is wondering and I don’t know what to tell him.",1
Tapering off,"Hi im tapering off Haldol, and I have nausea 24/7 and vomiting, is this a side effect?",1
Getting worse (again!),"Sometimes my symptoms are manageable. Sometimes they’re not. I’ve been doing good lately, I caught up in all my classes and I’ve been able to hangout with friends.
Then, I started thinking those friends are spying on me, I started thinking my skin was poisoned, etc. my negative symptoms got worse. No hallucinations yet, but I can tell things are gonna start getting bad again. Sigh. Here we go. I’ll be here a lot soon I assume :)

and for a bonus cherry on top, my girlfriend (who does not know of my illness) keeps making sz jokes. I think I hear something, I get “lol maybe you’re schizo”. She was having sensory issues and said “it feels like there’s bugs in my skin. Does that mean I’m going crazy?” (No.) why is this the second romantic partner in a row that tries to glamorize psychosis?? (my last one was obsessed with the idea of voices “I’m gonna listen to the voices in my head and go crazy”) 

It’s just so sucky to know that not only am I about to go back to struggling to make it through every hour of the day but I’m going to start getting more and more invalidated because everyone thinks it’s cool to have this disorder. 
Ugh.",1
Born to fail,"Life is 90% of the time a haze of confusion, fear, and paranoia. Then when my mind is somewhat clear I look back at life and feel nothing but existential dread knowing this is just how things are and I can't really do anything about it. I can see myself getting worse, but what am I supposed to do? 

They say ""get help"", I have tried this. I did exactly what I was told, and I can say beyond any reasonable doubt that ""help"" made everything worse. 

Go to the doctors, get locked up and dehumanized and abused for a week or two, beg the doctor every time you seem him to let you out of there as this is a horrible place to be, eventually get let out and despite the meds they put you on be notably more depressed, reclusive, and psychotic to the point that you try to game end yourself and end right back up in there bc you can't do a single thing right. 5 times. 

When I think about it, I'd rather do anything than go back into those hospitals. I used to sit down and pet my dog and that would always calm me down alot, but he's gone now and everything feels hopeless but I think it was always hopeless. I wish I would wake up and this was all a very long and awful dream",1
My dad was just diagnosed with schizophrenia,"Hi❤️ I’m a F23 with two troubled parents, I have BPD, my mom has ADHD and my dad was just diagnosed w schizophrenia today, he is 42 years old and has always been depressed and dissociative ever since I can remember. He begun having manic / psychotic behaviour beginning 2018. 

He is highly intelligent and sensitive, loves movies, music, video games and the cosmos. 

I want to be there for my dad. I want to know how it has been for those of u who are diagnosed to have ur condition and what to be mindful of. I also do have a few friends who are sc and I want to be as mindful as possible of what I can do to help when they are very triggered. I always make sure to ask them myself what they need too ofc in a soft manner.

I just got the «news» of his final diagnosis today, though he started experiencing drug induced (Ritalin / Amfethamine / Weed ) psychosis in 2018 and ever since then was he ever the same.

Up until now I thought he might be autistic with isolated incidents of drug induced psychosis’ that turned to the psychosis lingering for years after.

In his very intense episodes he mostly sees demons and wants to fulfill some sort of prophecy, and / or he thinks he’s being followed and is suspicious of everyone but me and my grandma.

I remember him as being calm, witty, sensitive and smart my whole childhood / young adulthood leading to 2018. Though, apparantly whenever he was ill I would stay at my grandma’s house and she would tell me he had a fever or stomach bug instead.. 

Since 2018 he has been aggressive, accusive, he breaks things (electronics, his windows and walls). He was recently forced to sell his apartment because he’s been screaming a lot, and broke things constantly and I guess my worry now is will he with his diagnosis and finally getting the right medication be able to lead a good life again?

I don’t want to be insensitive to my dad but I really miss the way he used to be so much, we were best friends and talked every day pre 2018, and I guess I thought there was a possibility that he would go back to his «normal» self again but I now understand that he has actually always been like this and I actually just never knew. He has been in a good psychiatric hospital for half a year now and after careful observation they finally diagnosed him 

I am curious to hear from those of you who have been diagnosed with sc yourselves in your later years and how it affected you. Also those who have sc parents and how it has been for u.❤️",1
I keep making mistakes,It seems like everything I do is wrong. My brain just malfunctions and gets so loud that I can’t do anything right. I move too fast but I can’t slow down no matter what I do. I feel like I’m getting into an episode and I’m so worried I’ll end up back at a hospital. I don’t even know what to do or what advice I’m asking for. I just need something and hopefully one of you can tell me what it is or have any advice at all. Maybe I just needed to get this out I don’t know at this point.,1
Looking for advice for my friend.,"He's my oldest friend (from elementary school, now we're in our 30s) showed schizophrenic & bipolar symptoms late in HS.  He's been forced into hospitals multiple times since HS when he's become too unstable. He was on abilify for awhile, but stopped because of gambling issues. I'm not sure what it is but he has a daily med but doesn't take it as far as I know. We're brutally honest with each other, no judgements.  He often turns to drugs like weed, alcohol, coke, x, acid and meth. His reasoning for doing crystal meth is it ""gives him clairvoyance"" I hang out with him almost every Saturday. We bowl, Frisbee golf and just chill. He was doing well working for a few years but he has a DUI case that has been hanging over his head for 5 years that has finally gone to sentencing but it has stressed him out and caused him to have manic episodes so he hasn't worked in months. And they can't sentence him because he's mentally unfit when he shows up. There are good facilities in the area, and therapy but he won't go because he doesn't want someone to change how he thinks. He's non violent but his mind races to the point he is no longer in control or his paranoia makes him lock up his computer or not trust anyone. This means he can't work and is fighting so hard just be in a limbo of surviving but not being able to make any progress towards his goals.. I don't know what to do to help him. If you have any advice or any other resources I can look into, I'm all ears.",1
Lost interest in my hobbies,"I kind of have no clue what's going.

First, I lost interest in drawing, TV/Movies, reading then writing.

Everything is boring, not engaging, or hard to get into.

I used to be an avid reader but now I find it hard to read fiction especially novels. I can't get into my flow state.

I was prescribed medication to help with it but I saw no effect.

It sucks because I have nothing to do this summer until the Fall Semester. I fear I'll become depressed again.

"Has anyone tried caplyta, vraylar or rexulti? How good are these APs at controlling your symptoms?","Just what it says in the title.

Im sick of schizophrenia forums being filled with “self diagnosed people” and liars,I got banned from a schizophrenia forum for calling out someone with borderline personality disorder for lying (and i wasnt rude) because they keep saying they have schizophrenia when they aren’t diagnosed with schizophrenia. It’s such a joke. Are there any forums with people who actually have schizophrenia anymore. I don’t think so. Even here every 4th post is “do i have schizophrenia”…since when did schizophrenia become so popular…,1
Pet peeves?,"Here are mine:

""You dont need medication, just meditate/eat well/other bs"" like I have an inbalance in my brain, it isnt gonna go away because I eat lettuce

""Its just in your head"" .....I dont even know what to say to that one",1

How effective are meds supposed to be?,"I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia last year but have been suffering with symptoms since 2013. 

I haven't been able to hold down a job for very long on average. However I took up a nightshift job at a supermarket in 2020 and been able to hold that done for 1 and half years before having a major psychosis period that lasted most of 2022. I have since moved on to day shift but have had to take 3 periods off sick because of my symptoms. 

My question is, is how effective are meds supposed to be?

I have daily paranoid and delusional thoughts at work and hear hallucinations regularly...

what happens if/when i get diagnosed?,"i’ve been seeing my therapist for a few months and he believes i have schizophrenia, i remember i started to hallucinate a year or two ago (im 19 almost 20) and they’ve been getting extraordinarily worse in the past 8-9 months, they’re more vivid and i can’t tell if what i’m seeing is real or not. along with this, other symptoms have started to show up/worsen as well. 

i hear whispers mostly, i can’t really make it out, lately the “heys” started being more regular. i haven’t had any command hallucinations which is one reason why my therapist wants to wait to send me to a psych. my personal hygiene has declined, i never go out anymore, i HATE mirrors and windows, i always see something watching me, i feel so disconnected from myself and everything else, i used to be super outgoing and now i can’t even go to the grocery store alone. my managers are starting to get upset with me because i’m never “present” anymore, telling me if i need time away from work to figure out my stuff until i’m “back to normal.” 

it sucks that i have to wait until my next visit in a month to start to get this figured out. i don’t like half knowing what’s wrong with me. essentially, i just want to know if i will feel better and feel like i’m not insane, i can’t even talk to my boyfriend without seeing or hearing something. i always feel like im being watched at all times and im so tired. 
does anyone relate? what will happen after a diagnosis? and how do you feel since being diagnosed and/or treated?

ps. i don’t typically write stuff for the internet bc i am super anxious, i just need support
from people who understand what i’m talking about, most everyone else treats me like i’m insane :((",1
Flat/hollow earth stupidity…,"Dear schizophrenics, 

I want to warn you about flat earth. I didn’t really study this stuff much when I was young, and got stuck in it for a year or 2, and had to study my way out of it… I was a slow/lazy researcher, and kept letting it get hold of me, and it would make me delusional.

Please don’t get caught in flat or hollow earth.

Do your best to study.

This stuff can really mess with your mind until you grow enough to understand it. Don’t become delusional with it.

Eratosthenes experiment isn’t the same on a flat earth… don’t let people confuse you about it. Think about what a shadow would look like on a stick at the North Pole, with the sun hitting it from the side, with parallel rays (not mentioning tilt). Hollow earth would have inward pointing shadows due to an opposite curve. Sticks in the ground with shadows really can prove a lot.

South celestial pole is not possible on flat earth.

Moon and sun somehow magically float on flat earth and hollow earth.

The North Star disappears once you go south far enough.

Clocks speed up, and gravity is less at higher altitudes.

Meteors somehow make it through the flat earth dome.

The flat earth excuse for seasons is the sun moving further out on the flat earth map, but that would technically mean a longer day due to the sun doing a bigger circle. And doesn’t explain the analemma properly, and in Australia in summer, the sun actually appears to curve south during sunset, due to the angle and tilt…  

Personally, I still think the moon and mars stuff is dodgy looking… but they aren’t 100% messing with us about the shape of earth… their camera angles do suck tho…

Don’t let yourself start thinking science is stupid, like I basically was… keep trying!",1
Tired of being treated like an addict because I want stimulants to treat the negative symptoms.,"Antipsychotic medications only seems to address the positive symptoms and I'm just anhedonic and bored all day I feel like a husk my life is so fucking boring.

Like even if I were to do meth it wouldn't be because I'm an addict. It'd be because I need a stimulant to counteract negative symptoms that my psychiatrist simply won't prescribe. I'd essentially microdose it and just take the equivalent to a therapeutic dosage of Desoxyn.

I'd rather just have my Dexedrine prescription back. I know it'd obliterate the anhedonia.

Wellbutrin worked for like a month or two then it just made me irritable and clench my jaw a lot. Dexedrine actually remained effective and made everything exciting. This was before I even developed symptoms.

I did eventually abuse it but that's because I was dumb and immature as I was still in highschool and just entering my drug experimentation phase at the time. I'm 19 now and I probably wouldn't abuse stimulants if I got put on them. Fuck I want them back life just isn't worth living with anhedonia.

Whenever I say I want stims for a legitimate and valid reason (reducing negative symptoms) people just say I'm an addict/recovering addict.",1
I do not understand myself,"TW

I struggle with everything. I find it hard to speak, I can’t make eye contact, I have sensory issues real bad, I can’t read very well, I can’t focus, I only have a few interests and that’s all I want, I don’t communicate often because I don’t know how, I am bad at social interactions.That’s just the start. I have autism but recently it came up that I have schizophrenia whilst I was getting a diagnosis. I don’t really believe it. I mean I feel like I’m being followed constantly.

My eye has been twitching too and it feels like something is wrong with me. But I always feel like I’m not alone. I constantly hear the sounds of people around me or a door opening. I sometimes see people outside my window in the dark staring into my window while I’m trying to sleep. I can’t stand loud noises and break down and cry over them. I don’t control my emotions well nor do I understand any of this. I sometimes feel like ripping my hair out or cause myself to be unable to hear. I apparently mumble about random things all the time. I do not notice these things. I can’t stand people touching my stuff for the fear of what they will do. I feel like the people around are just trying to hurt me. I have no motivation yet changes in schedule overwhelm me and I end up having a meltdown. I don’t know what to do. I’m going to see my therapist tomorrow so you think it’s a good idea to maybe tell her about these feelings. What’s your opinion on it?",1
How can I make a work safety plan?,"Hello, last week I (f20) experienced a bought of psychosis. I was afraid of mirrors, rain, my voice, and other peoples beings. I am on anti-psycotic medication so I am okay now. I wasn't diagnosed with anything. I've been telling people I'm on the schizophrenia spectrum? But Idk, it's kinda a self diagnosis. But my Counciler said it's a good possibility.

I'm a tattoo apprentice. My station has a giant mirror on the main wall where my chair lays vertical too from the other wall. When tattooing last week I just put up a dental sheet and I was fine. Heads a little loose but for the most part I'm screwed on, especially with medication. I told my mentor about my experiences with psychosis in the past and I had to let him know I was dealing with it again. I need to make a safety plan incase, for whatever reason, I go into an attack while I'm tattooing a client. I'm terrified of that happening. It'd be super embarrassing and low-key truamatic for everyone involved. 

Doe anyone have any tips or ideas for this safety plan? For work and maybe one at home as well?

It's been eye-opening to watch my symptoms get worse, especially the disorganization. I can't focus enough to watch a whole movie, even 20 min cartoons are too much. I used to keep a daily log of my activities and I've stopped. I'm going to a movie club recommended by my psychiatrist and I have nothing to say anymore while I used to be quite talkative.

Medication somehow works, even if I don't feel anything special while on it. Lack of medication is a killer. At least I'm convinced that I can get my life back on track if I secure a steady supply of medicine.

And the worst part is that it doesn't even cost much, just 17€. But I have no job because of schizophrenia and depend on my parents' help. Oh well, soon enough I'll get disability and those worries will be over.",1

In need of advice,"So I am not the one suffering from schizophrenia, but I am thinking my husband may.  My husband has been having paranoid delusions that have just gotten a lot worse this past year. Years back when we first got together there would be things he would say that would make me think something was going on with him mentally, some examples were that my mom was putting cameras or listening devices in our room, that she put a mic in our air purifier, that my mom was poisoning his food, he is severely disabled and so he had to use a commode in our room and he was adamant that when he would use it that my mom would be against the wall listening to him. Fast forward to the present, we have moved out of state and I thought that it was just because of my mom because she was the only thing that triggered it. Well now it’s the upstairs neighbors. About 8 months ago he started believing that they were drilling into the ceiling to put cameras in the ceiling, made me check the vents because he wanted to make sure no one put cameras in it, he wants to get rid of the microwave because he’s thinking there’s a bug in it. So those neighbors moved out and now a new neighbor moved in and now it’s this guy who’s “harassing” us. He says that the upstairs neighbor was following him because he could hear the footsteps wherever he walked. We were praying together the other night and he was sure that he heard the upstairs neighbor laughing at us while we were praying and that he was laughing like his mom. His mom died like 4 years ago or so. So I asked him how would that be possible because she died years back and he just said that they could have seen a video that his ex took of him from like 20 years ago. He’s also feeling these vibrations that I do not feel at all. He claims that someone is doing it on purpose. 

So I get home from work today and right next to the bed was our 9mm. He has never been violent or anything, but to see it out makes me nervous. I’m in a tough spot because he says I don’t fight for him or do more but I’m not going to call the cops on a neighbor who’s walking hard. I have no idea what to do. He tells me I’m not compassionate and all that. I get it because he really believes that this is going on but it’s not. There a lot more instances but it’s just too much to write.   I tried in the past the best I could to tell him that I’m not experiencing what he is and he got upset with me. I feel so lost and I feel bad that I cannot help him. Any advice would be wonderful!

Getting drinks helps,"I wanted to ask if it’s different for other or makes sense to others, but when I get drunk I hallucinate quite a bit less to a very noticeable degree even while inebriated. Does anyone else have similar experiences or any guesses to why? There are other changes but I take them up as normal drunkenness, but I noticeably hallucinate less and I don’t wake up delusional a night after drinking. Any thoughts or knowledge would help I’m just curious as to the reason.",1
Bad case of the “why me”’s,I’m a spiritual person and I am 1000% convinced that I was put on this earth to teach kids. I love my job. It’s my purpose. It’s in my birth chart and i’m good at it. My principal used to want me to be department head of elementary at our school I was that good. But I’m on mental health leave until next year not by my choice. Why would somebody who’s meant to have a purpose like this be made to have schizoaffective disorder. It doesn’t make sense. How can I be a positive influence when I can’t even be there. Towards the end of my time there this year I was consumed by anxiety and paranoia and I was suicidal. How is that good for kids to be around.,1

Should I ask this girl out?,"I’m still on meds (the lowest dose possible), I am unemployed (I sometimes help a bit in my parents supermarket and am pursuing a career in writing, i have written 4 books), and it’s been 3 years since ive been on a date. Theres this girl that works at a grocery store and she is very pretty. I feel like im missing out by not dating, so should I do it? I have no symptoms atm but sometimes I do have the blues.",1
Can anyone relate ?,"So I’ll try to keep it simple in this convoluted long story short as of currently :: so I’m I guess u could say a pseudo caregiver son to my mom , which is paradoxical and etc bc she always wants to help me and not herself . Recently the past 3 years or so she started talking to me as if I was someone else come to find out one of her delusions is that I have a implant in my head and “they” control what I say and do.” Well that’s one thing but not exactly the strangest part is that if she gets on the phone to her mom. She suddenly seems to almost change into the behavior of a child crying etc ? And being she’s suspicious paranoid etc of doctors it’s like I uno I need some kind of advice or something? And mind u this is only a piece of 30 years of this stuff as of late so … opinions experience advice? O and she is super obsessed with control and like keeping me with her or being with me all the time or she’ll freak out",1
Mushroom trip psychosis,"Hey guys, I’m writing this as best as I can because I still feel fragmented- like right and left are not connected- in my body or in the world. I don’t use drugs a lot. I guess you could say all the “weed and mushrooms are the new frontier and they will cure everything” talk got to me. A yer ago I tried a very small dose of weed edibles. I had a full on psychedelic experience where I was stuck in a time loop, nothing was real and time stopped making sense. I had what i now realize is a psychotic break. A year later I still wasn’t recovered. 
This weekend, stupidly, I did mushrooms. I believed all that talk about expanding drugs, how they can only help you, etc. it was even worse. I felt full on fragmentation, I could only talk in the third person referring to myself. I can’t even say it was myself talking, I truly was other people. Even now I feel my left and right brain as separate entities. I experiences the worst and deports terror I could possibly imagine, with no way out. No solution. 
It also confused me even more about time. I’m screaming still whenever I have to think of any temporal concept, time is sideways now. It makes no sense. I can’t function. I feel like I’m not here, time isn’t here, it doesn’t go forward. It’s all jumbled. 
I regret doing this. My brain is broken now forever. Do you feel this time perception with schizophrenia? I don’t have schizophrenia but when I was in college even smoking a little bit made me entirely paranoid, which is why I lost interest in drugs for my adult life. Fuck, even typing this the timeline doesn’t make sense of being in college then later then now.",1
My mothers bones are breaking and the doctor can't figure out why,"I am desperately looking for help and advice. I am the caregiver for my mother living with schizoaffective disorder. My mom is young at 46 years old, was very active, and very stable on her medications prior to these additional medical issues. 

Winter of 2022, Mom sustained a back injury resulting in 4 rib fractures. These fractures are where the rib meets her spinal cord. She was bending over to tie her ice skates when she felt pops and pain. X-rays confirmed the breaks and the doctors assumed this was a one-off occurrence and told her to take it easy so she could heal. She ended up healing very slowly but the pain remained and increased.

She has been sent to an Endocrinologist, has multiple tests done for bone density/degeneration. Countless X-ray/MRIs. Pain clinics. Nothing came back conclusive and the doctor cannot provide an explanation.

Not getting an answer as to why the ribs broke has caused a spiral.

The past 15 ish months have been horrific. Words cannot express the absolute derailment that has happened. Everything from medical delusions, fears that her medical team is trying to kill her,  psychosis episodes, etc. I have not seen my mom this way since right before her diagnosis. I have been advocating for her, booking appointments, speaking with her doctors, etc.

In April, she broke 3 MORE ribs after bending over to tie her shoe. 1 was a re-break, the others were new fractures. Again, doctor has no answers. She has been checked for signs of self-harm and abuse. There are no bruising or anything indicating that is was self inflicted. SHE IS 46 YEARS OLD! Why is this happening? Her medical care has been severely lacking and I wont get into it on this post but IMHO I believe it is because of her disorder that her concerns have not been taken seriously. I know they have performed tests but that took a year for them to be ordered and over 30+ ER visits and many hours of advocacy. 

I have been doing research this whole time and after speaking with a schizophrenia advocacy group, they told me about a linkage between anti-psychotic medications and breaking bones.

**My main question is - Do any of you know about or have experience with anti-psychotic medications leading to unexplainable bone breaks?**

I am desperate to find answers for my mom and am open to any questions or advice. If you need some extra details please ask and I will provide what I can. I didn't want to make this post too long. Thank you in advance.",1
How do you not attack others?,"This sounds like such a simple problem to ‘normal’ people, but when you think people are imminently about to kill/torture/rape you, how do you override your instincts to defend yourself? I’ve attacked a few people now; verbally and physically (staff I thought were trying to hurt me when I was properly ill in hospital) and it’s becoming more and more of a problem and I can’t think my way out of it. 

I get delusions where I think people are trying to kill/torture/rape me. Reflecting back on it, it’s clear they weren’t but in the moment I had felt no other way out than to defend myself against them when they did something that I believed was them starting to actually kill/torture/rape me. To make matters more complicated, people have genuinely attacked me in the past. I can’t distinguish between delusion and reality in the moment, only after lots of careful reflection.

When I’m not in crisis, I actually already underreact to situations because I’m so scared of overreacting again. For example, today I got hit (not hard) by a car and was so busy apologising and wheeling off that I didn’t stop to think how awful it was that he had pulled out of the pavement and ran into me without ever having looked down at me on my wheelchair. There’s lots of similar situations where I’ve allowed myself to get into danger for fear of overreacting. And yet, when I get ill, I’m so scared, I’m like a cornered animal.

Is the solution to just try to never react no matter what under any circumstances? If so, how should I override the primal urge to ‘defend myself’? What happens the next time I am actually attacked (either in hospital or outside in the real world)? How do I work around this? I don’t want to hurt anybody yet I’m also incredibly fearful of being hurt by others as I have been in the past.

Anybody have any experience with this? I’m at a loss. To make matters more complicated, my community team are currently trying to kill me so idk what to do?!",1
Is anyone like me?,"Seriously i know this question gets asked im sure all day everyday, but ive never even heard of another situation like mine and just, I can't find the words for this feeling. I think i just want to ease the stress in my head with relatability. I have 3 things: ASD, OCD, and finally schizophrenia but with a huge caveat; I have accelerated thoughts i cant turn off which I'm sure is normal to most reading this, but i also have a deep, unending, obsession to question myself on everything, all the time. ""Just because"" is not good enough. I HAVE to answer why, to myself, or to anyone listening. I HAVE to. Because of this i have crazy high insight into my condition. I understand how and why i hear voices, how I go into psychosis (the primary mechanism is doubt if you're curious), why i cant stop thinking, why my head just fills with void sometimes. Everything. I understand, everything. And its absolute hell. I feel like im just constantly micromanaging myself, and i can't ever stop because letting go and not caring risks psychosis. I'll be okay. I have the tools to care for myself, and the support. I'll be fine. But i feel completely alone, so i ask. Is anyone like me?

Addendum:
I'm in a little loop. At some point in my youth i was confused, and said ""i don't understand."" And was then asked to explain. And so i did, but i did it wrong. I have to do it again, but better. Ive been doing this for decades now.",1
"Other peoples, insensitive and hurtful, negative commentary…","I’m not talking about the voices that we are here for the negative “ inner monologue” that people tell us that we are hear, I’m not talking about our own view of our self worth. I’m talking about literally other people in the external world looking at us and watching us and harshly judging and criticising. Absolutely everything in anything we do, when they very well know but they’re commenting and judging a person going through what we go through! I mean it’s like the people that deliberately mess with someone’s head, just because they think it’s fun! To me that is more sickening that absolutely anything to induce a traumatic episode and experience, for someone is to literally put them through harm worse than any physical harm in my opinion. Because that physical wound you can heal from, but that mental wound is something that someone either cannot recover from, or it has to try incredibly hard to even come to terms with recovering. Anyone who knows anyone else has a diagnosis of schizophrenia and knowingly pokes find them and judges them is worse than any scumbag out there in my opinion. Because they are just trying to make anyone feel bad and project, their own insecurities there, too afraid to face in themselves. that’s cowardice. Anyway, I know it’s not just in my hair because I literally have voice recordings of my neighbours are looking at me and point to me and judging me for my diagnosis. And that’s a family too, encouraging the entire of their own family to poke and prod at me. I don’t know what’s happening to the world, but sometimes it feels like I’m in an ultimate reality. Where are things have gotten so bad and people do the wrong thing and that’s right and I do the right thing but it feels wrong",1
"Therapy trouble, need advice","I'm going to post this to a couple different places but I need help. 

So I finally decided to change therapists after:

• She's continuously told me everything is in the past and to just ""let it all go""

• Her advice for dealing with my agoraphobia and debilitating social anxiety is to just go to stores, stand in the aisle in the way, and just repeat to myself I'm okay.

• To just get into the car and drive to clear my head (when I don't have a license and terrified of driving) 

• Despite doing my intake, didn't know of my diagnoses and acted shocked when I had mentioned a hallucination (and tangent but also acted like a was a specimen or something) 

• Told me that sometimes the people we love hurt us because they love us and that's okay

• Told me I cant control anyone (i get that) and no one can control me or make me do anything. When I said I disagree having been SA'd more than once, she told me that I ""learned what I do and don't like"" and ""learned how to say no."" Which triggered me bad for the past month and has had me really messed up. 

After all this, the biggest thing is that I have (for pretty obvious reasons) have not been comfortable reaching out to her for support when I'm really struggling, so with much encouragement from my friends and family, I decided the next appointment I was going to talk to her about switching. 

She then no call no showed that appointment after I confirmed. (I did miss two prior to this from other appointments and honestly just couldn't get myself to go to the one immediately after the above.)

So we put in the change provider form with the secretary who understood... and then the therapist called and said that I can't change providers and if I don't see her than I won't be able to see my med provider. I'm freaking out and at a loss. It's taken so so long to get into the psych and now I feel like I'm being threatened because I want a new therapist and have ALWAYS been told that if it isn't a fit, we can change at any time. I don't know what to do. I feel so lost and hopeless, it's just affirming that they were out to get me anyways and that I'm just another paycheck. I can't handle losing my meds but I also can't handle seeing her any longer. My paranoia and anxiety has been off the charts since this. Everyone told me it'd be okay and I feel like I've been set up.",1
Advice for relationships,"Hi everyone, Im a 27 year old woman and have been in the talking stages with 30 year old man for a couple of months now. Recently we have gotten a lot closer, and are starting to take things to the next level. He recently told me that he has schizophrenia. Although some people have told me I should stay away, this does not bother me or scare me, as it is part of who he is and I love him for all parts of him. I have my own mental health issues (bpd) and do my best to not judge anyone based off of their own struggles. With that being said, I am looking for and tips and advise anyone has to give on being in a relationship with someone with schizophrenia, anything from how to better understand him, what to do/not do, and just anything anyone wants to share. I am doing my best to educate myself on his condition but there’s only so much you can learn from reading about something, so I am hoping that you all can share experiences of living with schizophrenia, or dating someone with schizophrenia. Thank you all in advance <3",1
Psych ward?,"Mom took me to doctor and they recommended some psychiatrists and what not, and the voices have gotten real bad and intense and very hard to deal with.

Im in really bad psychosis and have very real delusions and am hearing thinfs a lothd. I was scared to say anything beaides no. Should i have said yes!? Should i go soon? I want and need help.

What is a Respectable Term for People That Don't Experience Schizophrenia?,"I finally opened up to someone about what I been going through, I've been really concerned about opening up to someone about things cause I worry they'll use it to take advantage of me or become afraid of me suddenly.  But it went well and felt really good being able to finally talk to someone.

I feel like it would have been helpful to have a concise term for people not experiencing schizophrenia when I was sharing stuff with them though.  I've heard people use something like Neurotypical or something for people who don't have A.S.D.  I tried googling stuff but couldn't find the right search terms to get something useful.  Anyone familiar with a word that would scratch that itch? Or if you want to take a swing at minting a new word lemme hear it!

And just to reiterate:  Absolutely not looking for anything mean-spirited

P.S. I just re-read the sub-rules and got anxious that my post broke rule 10 about labeling people, I don't think it does but apologies if I misinterpreted.  I just want a respectful word that isn't ""normal people"" for people that have different challenges then me.",1

"My sister is deep in a delusional state, I need advice.","Hello and please, if I'm breaking any rules (I've read and reviewed them) please flag this post or let me know in the comments and I'll delete it. 

I don't know where else to turn, what else to do, and most importantly I don't know how I can be a support to my sister. 
She (35F) was recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, but she previously had a schizophrenia and BPD diagnosis. She's back on her medications (with an 8 year hiatus...my family and I hadn't seen or heard from her for nearly 5 years) but her medications don't seem to be helping. 
She believes people are playing mind games with her. 
She believes people are sending her messages through her Pinterest news feed.
She believes the people she was in partial hospitalization with are really her highschool friends in disguise.

I want to be here for her. I want to support her. I'm at a loss of what to say or how to comfort her. 
I guess my question is... What can I say? How might she feel comforted? Is there anything I can be doing other than being a shoulder, an ear, a compassionate heart? 
Again, I'm sorry if this violates any rules or if my asking for advice is hurtful, harmful or upsets anyone. I just want to be able to love my sister and make sure I'm doing everything possible to make her life a little easier. 

Much love to all of you. And really, if there's ever a time you feel alone or feel a lack of love in your life... I'm so sorry for that pain, but I promise you, you mean more to people than you realize 🤍🫶🏻",1

Should I quit before I get fired? (Suffering from schizophrenia),"26 yo male. I’m on disability, working 12 hours a week and I’m on the third month working at my local goodwill. I feel people at my job resent me for my limited hours. And I feel like I’m falling apart at work. 4 hours a day isn’t always overwhelming but many days I just can’t do it, I swear. 

Two things are going on that are concerning me. One is that I have attendance issues. I missed two days because of major blizzards that stuffed me in and I couldn’t get there in the morning on time because of my parents big driveway. Then, I was actually sick one day. I left early a day for an appointment, and left early another day because I was going through psychosis and didn’t feel safe being around people that I think are against me and or reading my thoughts or talking about me badly. I was once a pretty darn reliable worker before my onset age of 22.

As I said, I am on disability so I can fall back on that. However, it is nice to get out of the house. But I do have an employment agent at my local behavioral clinic that can find me a job for people like me(disabled).

They’ve been supportive and listened to my issues and helped find solutions. But the warmer it gets the busier it gets and the more tense it gets on all fronts. I just am having a hard time. And no matter how hard I try sometimes, it just gets impossible to focus even on antipsychotics. 

Oh and they told me I’ve used up a “year’s worth” of attendance points and will talk to me tomorrow about it. Fired from goodwill is not how envisioned my life going when I was a boy. Is it safe to want a fresh start?",1

Mind Control,"Anyone feel like they’re being mind controlled by the government or some agency? I think amazon is controlling me, and I was doing fucking well without negative symptoms then I smoked a shit ton of weed like a fucking dumbass and now here I am in my shit again.

Makes me feel like I’m fucked. I hate this shit. And on top of that I have some major social anxiety that is so beyond fucked that everything is completely fucked",1
Sleeping problems,"So I've been having some trouble sleeping having hypnagogic hallucinations, hallucinations while sleeping both tactile and hearing voices, talking in my sleep and responding to these hallucinations, and very weird dreams in general. I can't wake up even through extreme panic during sleep, until eventually it stops and before getting up; I dissociate in bed for a bit cause of the fear and chronic pain like I legit feel like I'm gonna passout from how tired I am from the dreaming and sleep. Sometimes I get lucid dreams and sleep paralysis.

I have a psychiatrist who prescribes me with Seroquel, Atomoxetine, Pregabalin, Valproate, ah that's all I can remember for now. I'm from Vancouver Canada where weed is legal medicinally and recreationally, and I'm currently residing in Mexico and have been for a little over two years. I know that an Indica would help me calm down and be able to sleep through the night with no issues or panic but it's illegal here so idk if that's an option :/

What can I do? I've already tried several atypical antipsychotics and even benzodiazapines since 15 years old. The only thing I've found that keeps dreams away is weed.",1
I did not know the audial hallucinations could be bad voices.,"Hi everyone,

I've written on this subreddit a few times. I have schizophrenia and my condition has always been very stable. I've always been positive and really my condition has worked out reasonably well, although it took a lot of time (years really) for it to become just a normal part of my life. I once wrote on this subreddit that the voices in my auditory hallucinations are my friends. This has always been true, the slight murmur of these kindly voices has always helped me. They tell me they care, and in some way are my companions. They are not very real just in the background really, but somehow I find them comforting - and certainly my medication helps me manage this constant part of my life (as it can be distracting.. amongst other things it keeps the energy low somehow).

I did not really understand that there could be bad hallucinations until recently. In my experience up until then I thought they (the hallucinations) could be tamed just by talking to them, or saying comforting things - I learned this as a coping strategy for when things seemed a bit surreal. It wasn't always easy with the voices there, certainly not all the time, and I could misunderstand how my feelings were projected by the voices - in a way they just respond to what's happening around me it seems. I have always loved them as a part of my life, it just makes me be me, although there were times I wished I could just be normal. In a way it was just that I was generally stressed at the time (it isn't easy finding out you have schizophrenia) - although now so long as I can find my peace, I just realize that I am normal.

However I did have a bad voice. I now think I did not understand how others felt on this subreddit, although I really did relate on people's situations. The way the bad hallucination spoke to me, I could tell the voice hated me. I don't know why this would have appeared to me, as my medication still works wonders. The voice really tried to torment me and wished every curse and hatred upon me.

I did not ever give up hope, and I knew this hallucination is nothing I personally consider about myself, and it has got better. Just by talking my way through it and staying strong I withstood it. I also distracted myself with plenty of other things to do - and filled my life with all the good things I could (as I try to do anyway). (I really like looking for free activities to do, or just stuff online etc.)

In a way this wasn't the first time a voice like this had occurred, but it had only ever lasted for a few hours - and so infrequently (maybe twice ever), I did not really remember or think of it as a bad symptom. There has been quite a lot of negative stimulus in the media which may have triggered it - and I find any negative stimulus can make my situation a bit worse (but generally I just don't watch TV anyway).

&#x200B;

So I just wanted to reach out to all of you, and say I really feel for you everyone. Keep safe, stay well. Wishing you peace.

&#x200B;

Edit: I should also say that it got a lot better, but it did take some time. I had to rest pretty much for quite a long time. Also I just did small things to keep active.

This hallucination was a new one also - it was very strange. I'm glad it's gone, but I'm going to look up some more techniques for strategies to cope in case something like this could occur again.",1
do you study with schizophrenia,and how can i focus while having this disability,1
Is this fair? Doctors are tryna change my diagnosis and I feel like shit,"So I’m in the psych ward now, I stopped clozapine cold turkey and felt so shit I ended up coming here. Basically it’s been a month and my positive symptoms haven’t come back. The doctors who’ve known me 2 weeks are basically saying I’m just depressed and never was schizo. I know diagnoses aren’t everything but it took me 6 months from when I was first hospitalised while psychotic (4years ago) til I was sane enough to accept I was schizo instead of just psychic and spiritually gifted. Since then it’s all made sense, I’ve had every symptom and I relate so much to every post on here. I just feel like it’s so not fair that doctors that didn’t know me when I was psychotic are telling me I never was . Like I went through hell while psychotic. They’re now refusing to give me meds bc they don’t know what I have , pretty sure they just think I’m depressed. Which I am because I feel so shit about them acting like they know what’s wrong with me better than my doctors of 4 years. Also they’ll take me off disability if I’m ‘just’ depressed. Honestly want to kill myself",1

Wondering if I'll ever find love as a psychotic person,"The meds make me fat. I'm 19m and never dated, still a virgin. We still don't know if it's schiz or drug induced psychosis but my doctor has a hunch it's schiz. Could go away in the course of a year though now that I'm off weed but it's been two months and still no improvement aside from what medication can do. I've been hearing voices for almost two years now but I've been smoking weed for most of that time with occasional breaks. Longest break was 3 months off cannabis with no improvement in symptoms so I just went back to smoking. Finally quit for good though. 

Only time I've ever truly felt love was on stimulants and it was entirely one sided. And my doctor doesn't want to prescribe any stimulants due to psychosis and past abuse of my ADHD meds before I had psychosis.

I've gone up to 193lb and I'm 6 foot. I can hardly manage to lose any weight on meds. Along with psychosis I'm also just generally emotionally unstable. I think about doing hard drugs because the only person I've ever truly loved doesn't love me or seem to give much of a shit about me. I don't even know if I'm in love anymore but I'm nostalgic and miss feeling in love and alive. Medication makes it hard to even feel love.

I just want to do opioids and amphetamines. My family will kick me out if they find me doing drugs other than weed, alc, nic, or kratom though even if they're just research chems, which fall under a loopwhole and can be openly sold despite being analogues and derivatives of common drugs. They just can't be labeled for human consumption.

I loved her so fucking much, hell man I loved her even when she was still going by he I just thought I must've been bi or something. And I don't know if I'll be able to find anyone with the emotional instability, amphetamine cravings, weight gain, and psychosis. I'm a mess. Incredibly self destructive too. If I had a plug for hard drugs I'd already be on them.

And that's not accounting for the fact that I may not even be able to feel love anymore because of meds. I just want to feel in love again even if it was one sided. At least thinking about her brought me feelings of euphoria. I miss the intensity. Feels like I'm doomed to a dull medicated life.

Sometimes the voices pretend to be her just to try to fuck with me. 

It feels like she doesn't give a fuck about me or see me as more than an acquaintance or just part of the same circle of friends.

I have nothing to talk about with anyone either because I'm too apathetic. Stimulants would help but my doctor refuses to prescribe them. If he doesn't prescribe me a low dose of Dexedrine I may end up on either meth or flourinated amphetamine based research chems. Telling him that won't do any good though. If it wasn't for me feeling sappy and self destructive romantically I'd just take low doses to medicate myself where my doctor is failing me.

Wellbutrin worked for like a month or two and after that all it did was make me even more irritable than when I was abusing stims and made me grind my teeth a lot. I never ground my teeth on Dex. But I did on Wellbutrin :/",1
How to support my partner,He seems completely normal then says something that reminds me that he thinks that that society/the police are watching him. He feels the need to kill himself before they do. He thinks he is being watched/followed. Is this something he will always think now? Or does it only happen during an episode? He had his first episode this weekend and I really don't know if he is still in it or if it's over and this is our family's new reality.  We are waiting to see a Dr but he is def schizophrenic in my opinion as it runs in his family and he fits all the symptoms,1
Is this tinnitus or hallucinations?,"So I have schizoaffective disorder but I find this sub better since it’s more popular. I never hallucinated before only delusions but I have tinnitus which is a very loud high pitched noise.

Could this be hallucinations or tinnitus? Just curious until I see my doctor",1

Trouble understanding my symptoms,"I feel like earlier on in my schizophrenia I was able to understand my symptoms and explain them to people better, but as time has gone on, it has gotten harder for me to explain the weird things that are happening to me, it feels like every time I try to put certain symptoms into words it just doesn't come out right, or won't come out at all. Being able to explain my symptoms was a good coping mechanism for me because I could think about it and challenge myself to explain something abstract, but now it feels like it's being taken away from me. I guess luckily I've been doing a decent bit better the past few days with an increase in my meds, but it still sucks that it feels like my understanding of things is being drained.",1

For the last 3 months or so I've been struggling with extremely delusional/paranoid thoughts, and since last month they've mutated into something resembling psychosis and hypervigilance.

Advice? I’m so exhausted,"Everytime I hear a voice and they do something it’s like I’m being urged to act out on it. Its crushing me. I’m taking medicine it’s not working.

Everything they do and say I can feel. Everytime I react or do something I feel dozens of voices reacting with what I’m doing, causing a ripple effect of interactions between the voices. I eventually start to snap and act out how they act in my head kind of like a tic. Someone please help me my psychiatrist sucks. Idk what to do or what medicine to take.

I think my friend had some type of episode.,"My friend has never previously had any sort of symptoms that I know of growing up but he recently developed anxiety. They put him on medication and i’m convinced that’s what changed things. One night he had a panic attack and started heavily drinking. He completely went off the rails thinking everyone was against him. Was tweaking like he was on hard drugs we had no choice but to call an ambulance and he continued to be agitated screaming at people etc. I want to do my best to help him. My ideas is to get him on some sort of dopamine detox because I believe losing touch with nature and being so consumed by technology especially since covid has negatively effected us all. I also know at a certain point this is out of my like capabilities as a friend, i’m not a psychiatrist. Anyone with similar experiences would be appreciated!",1
How to recognize upcoming psychotic episode?,"I go through periods of time in which I experience more hallucinations, disorganization and particularly delusions. Medication and therapy has made them less frequent and severe, but they keep occurring.

These is no regular timing and I have never found a pattern in them. It's hard for me to recognize when I'm entering such a period. When I'm in too far I am unable to recognize my own situation. I think recognizing it sooner can help me get treatment sooner and prevent my life from going further off the rails.

But, lately I've been suspecting an episode coming up. I'm not sure, but I'll bring it up with my therapist. It's better to have a false alarm than becoming too psychotic to function.

Schizophrenia and empathy.," I saw an old woman who has been begging in my city for years today, she is always covered in filth, wearing destroyed clothing, and mumbling incoherently while stretching her arm and forming a bowl with her hand. I used to think that she was a nuisance and should be locked away from society, but i realised, that maybe if i hadnt gotten  assistance early in life i would have ended up like her. Im not better than her. I have no idea what she has,   but it has been going on for decades without any help, that sounds like hell. I cant even get to class on time because sometimes my hallucinations end up keeping me up at night, and i see a psychologist twice a week and a psychiatrist every now and then. 
 Although, im 16, and i used to hate her a few years ago, i was a child and children tend to be assholes lol. But i do feel bad about how much i detested her, given that she hasnt done anything, besides begging. Its sad how society is organized in a way that fails people like her so badly.",1
Older schizophrenics how are you?,I am 20 and technically diagnosed schizoaffective but I believe it’s schizophrenia but I have not met very many schizophrenic people who were older and were doing ok. As the years pass I seem to keep getting more delusional and less attached to reality. I have slowly become a person who gets rewarded for doing dishes. It feels like my only two paths for my future are drugs or hospitals. I can’t work atm so I’m completely reliant on my bf which is exactly what happened with my ex. I cannot care for myself I don’t seem to understand how to do it. People don’t trust me alone and therapists have been extremely difficult to find. I don’t see a future ahead of me.

Hearing voices,"I hosted a house party with my partner once and I swear I could hear his friends talk shit about me and make fun of me behind my back. At times I could hear them say shit to my face but as I was the host, I somehow went through the night without confronting them or creating a scene. As soon as they left, I told my partner about everything that happened and he swore none of the things I was accusing his friends of were true. But I heard them loud and clear. It wasn’t even whispers. 

This has happened in the past too, whenever we meet someone in a social setting..people always talk shit about me/directed to me and my partner always claims that it never happened. How do I know what I am hearing is actually real ? I know I hear voices, it’s usually my own voice. But when I am with people, I hear them in their voice.

How do you deal with bizarre ideas that could be possible ?,"I struggle with the idea that some things can still be possible, no matter how bizarre.

A rant about being scared of “losing it”,"So I (in my 20s and f) am diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and got diagnosed at young age of 17 due to have multiple psychosis/manic episodes from ages 14-17. 

Background: The first episode I had at 14 resulted me into illegally (well trying) leaving the country with no identification because (according to the medical report) thought that I was being watched and followed by some type of form of government. I have no memory of the episode I just remember that one day I was walking to school then 2 days later waking up in the psych ward confused. That was my first ever major episode. Then up until I was 17 I had like minor ones but some not but some major enough to lead me in the hospital but I don’t really remember them just like the first one at 14. My last major one was at 17 where I went to go over to my boyfriends house and then he told me (later on after I was stabilized) I was “going crazy” and thinking that the police were after me which landed me also again in the hospital for 1.5 months and my official diagnosis.

Anyways I’ve been catching myself getting a little delusional lately like off and on and I’m even on high prescriptions of antipsychotics and having vivid dreams of where I’m watching myself in the dream becoming more and more out of touch of reality but this time in my dreams I never recover really and I’m like “stuck” idk I feel like if I do end up in another episode I feel like it’s gonna last longer than 1.5months. And I’m scared but I have talked to my psychiatrist about it and she wants hospitalization but I don’t cause right now I got an okay grip of reality and it’s on and off like I haven’t completely lost it and I’m using my skills I have learned in therapy to pull myself back but I still feel like one day they’re not gonna be enough and I can’t get back",1

Does weight gained from antipsychotics go away completely after you stop using it?,I've been on invega injection for about a year now and I gained something about 20 pounds.

i think i have very early stages of schizophrenia,"I started hearing voices 3 years ago.

How can I accept that the voices in my head aren’t real people?,"My mind is focused that the voices in my head are my apartment neighbors using some weird electronic devices to speak to me in my head.

I’m VERY slowly accepting that it’s impossible to do that, but I wish there was something I could think that can push me to the right direction.

I am fully aware that it’s impossible to use any device to hear what I’m thinking and to put their voices in my head… but theres something in me that wants to think maybe they’re in the military and have access to classified devices to do this. Something is just stuck in my head where I can’t let it go that it’s plausible to happen but %0.001 likely to happen.

Any advice with pushing me into that direction?",1
does anyone else feel like they don't belong,"All of my friends abandoned me in one way or another since I got diagnosed. I got one friend who said he's there for me, but he always has a commitment when I wanna hang out. 

So, I joined a mental illness support group, and it was great. Then they changed management and fired my support worker, and he was the only person I could relate to because everyone else was significantly older. Being a 24 year old in a program filled with 40-60 year olds males, it is hard to relate.

The psychward is scary, but I can always feel like I can find a clique when I'm in there.

Should I be concerned about being on 6mg of respirodone?,I've been on 6mg of respirodone for a while now I went from 2mg to 4mg to 6mg. I never felt and I definitely never asked to be put on a higher dose. I know I'm an outlier and maybe its because it's been so long since I've been on it or maybe I'm just not that observant I've never felt that respirodone has that many noticable effects. I know it helps me sleep and it has definitely given me ED but that's it. Not once did the difference psychologists I spoke to tell me why they where uping my dosage or even that 6 is a high dosage. Now after researching it I'm not sure but isn't 6mg like an extremely high dosage? Like I've really struggled to find people telling stories about there experiences who where on 6mg. I feel like I must of said something to the psychologists that concerned them but they didn't tell me what it was. They didn't tell me what part of what I was telling them concerned them and gave me the impression that things didn't seem to bad with me. I really don't feel like my schizophrenia is bad enough for me to be on such a high dose.

I think I had a night terror last night and I sleep walked for the first time.,"I've had these dreams a few times in my life that are hard to describe but it feels like either the world is going to end or that I'm going to die. I had one the other week where it felt very strange and felt like if I leaned to far left or right something would rip and I would die. I then got very scared and woke up and for about 3 or 4 minutes the fear didn't leave me. I've had these sort of strange dreams maybe 5 or 6 times but never close together. Except from now.

Last night I went to sleep and was only asleep for about half an hour where I had another one of these dreams. I can't really remember what happened in the dream but I became convinced I was going to die again. During this dream I sleep walked (which I have never ever done before) and went downstairs where my mum and stepdad where watching TV. I then told them I few times that I was scared, starting talking gibberish, walked into the kitchen and then went back to my bedroom. My sister then spoke to me through my bedroom door and I woke up but the fear didn't leave me at all. I was terrified that I was going to die and I went downstairs and told my mum to assure me that I wasn't going to die and it took the best part of 15 minutes for me to stop being convinced that I was going to die.

I'm a schizophrenic so that could have something to do with this but I'm 99.99% sure it isn't. This is something I've only experienced once when I was about 11 where I had one of these dreams and started crying in my sleep and saying that I'm not good enough or something like that. But that's about 10 years ago and I have never once in my life actually sleep walked other than last night that I know of. I'm wondering if anyone else has had these dreams before? I'm also wondering if this could be the start of more sleep walking? I really hope it's not. I'm hoping this was a one off. Any advice would be nice.",1

i know i make it worse but it makes it hard not to,"sometimes i’ll be minding my own business and then i get hit with this deep deep sense of awful dread and revulsion, and then everything starts to feel surreal like i’m in some kind of horror movie. and it’s not that i’m scared, it’s just deeply uncomfortable. like living in a psychological thriller would be. as if there’s no real monster but everything around me is wrong, evil, threatening. it feels like if i turn around there will be blood everywhere or if i look in the mirror my face will be messed up even if it isn’t. and it just feels like a kind of black hole i sink into. nothing else feels important anymore. i can only think about disturbing things, feel completely isolated, like someone has turned all the lights off for me only and no one else. 

and i want to keep living life like i used to, to go to lecture, watch tv, eat food i like, and laugh with my family but it just feels very very wrong. like i’m not capable of it. like i don’t belong there, i’m meant to wait for something big and world changing to happen to me. only it never comes.

How to express something kindly to a family member with schizophrenia,"Hello! I am the daughter of someone who has recently been diagnosed schizophrenia but has been experiencing symptoms for decades. I love my mom so much, more than anything in this world. I’ve tried really hard to be there for her by calling her almost everyday and visiting whenever I can, but I have been at undergrad out of state for the past 4 years so it’s been hard. I’m just recently finishing and moving back near her. Since being diagnosed with schizophrenia, my mom has lost her job and hasn’t found a new one (any advice on that would be great too). She has money saved up to afford a place, but I thought that when I move for my job I would get a two bedroom in case she has to move in with me eventually. This is where the communication I need help with is. I have always expressed to my mom that moving in with me is a last resort. Not because I don’t love her or because of her schizophrenia, but because I am 22, newly out of college, moving in with my serious boyfriend of a year, and learning to become an independent adult. Now, that doesn’t mean I don’t want her in my life. I’d love to live near her and see her often, even have sleepovers when she’s having a rough night or just for fun. But she seems to think that because I am getting a two bedroom that means she can move in whenever she wants. If she was ever about to be homeless or ran out of most of her money or needed a caretaker, of course I’d take her in. But I’d much prefer to be neighbors who see each other a lot but have separate places to go at night. How do I express this to my mom so that she understands without hurting her? Because of her schizophrenia she can get really emotionally volatile, feel attacked, lash out, and also comprehend things poorly sometimes which causes misunderstandings. I don’t blame her at all, it’s just shitty symptoms that happens when she’s not doing well with the illness. I was wondering if anyone here with schizophrenia or family members with it would have advice. Thank you!",1

I’m scared and have a few questions for experienced schizophrenics,"Edit: skip to the end if u don’t mind just answering a couple general questions.

Hi guys, I’m 19 and had my first psychotic episode last may during finals week from a combination of my adderall prescription, weed and stress. It was a terrifying 4 months. For the first half, I was manic believing I was telepathic with my d1 hockey dorm neighbor. For the second half, I was paranoid shitless that he hired a hit man to kill me because he was tired of hearing me. 

For 4 months, I kept hearing voices despite months of different medications. I was declared treatment resistant but Electroconvulsive therapy eliminated the voices completely. I was diagnosed with schizo affective disorder somewhere in that period

I stayed clear of all drugs but when I returned back to UW Madison this January, I started using weed and alcohol daily until I heard an external voice while riding my bike on campus. It sounded like a person talking about me within hearing distance but I turned my head and no one was there. This was my only psychotic symptom but scared me enough to stop weed completely(still sober from weed and plan to for decades). I heard external voices like this every 5 minutes but only while I was outside. It lasted for a couple days after last smoking weed then it went away. Then for midterms, I decided to buy a few adderall as I figured I’d be fine since I stopped weed. I combined this with little sleep and i heard external voices while outside for a few days then it stopped(exact same features as post weed). This was my only psychotic symptom as far as I know. Does this mean I’m close to a full blown psychotic episode? 


I haven’t heard an external voice in a couple months. But after my midterms, I noticed that EVERYTIME I thought about what someone is thinking of me, I heard the sentence I think they’re saying as loud as my internal monologue. Currently, those internal voices have decreased to a level im comfortable with. That level is around imagining someone else’s thoughts as half sentences and half non sentences(or a feeling). Please try this quickly by thinking of something you did recently that impacted someone and let me know if what you think they’re thinking is in sentences or non sentences? 



I have an addictive personality but have managed to decrease my alcohol consumption from 20 to 10 drinks per week since the emergence of these voices I experienced. Is this level of drinking likely to cause another episode eventually? and how long would you estimate it would take the average person? I currently don’t have any psychotic symptoms so I also plan to take 20mg xr adderall 4 times per semester(early, though, so my sleep isn’t effected). If this is dangerous in your eyes, I can definitely be persuaded to not take it to study for finals this week as Im not stressed about failing. I plan on limited by drug use to adderall and alcohol. If alcohol+adderall or just alcohol are the only drugs you use, what amount do you use if you have you been successful in not having another break? Last question: do second psychotic episodes generally have the same features as the first? 

I would appreciate any insight on your experiences with even one of my questions or any general advice you have for me. If you have any questions for me, I’d be happy to answer in detail. We’re all in this together.

PS: The only medical professional I have access to is a nurse practicioner who only knows enough about schizophrenia to prescribe meds and google doesn’t answer any of my questions

Fuck this life....but I hope it gets better.,"I guess that in God's infinite plan for you, everything that is happening to you, he's already seen all the possible outcomes of it and he knows how it all ends.

I wonder if free will really exists then.

Of course, being the good Christian that I am, the first voices immediately felt like demonic possession,...

Even after I was led to believe that I was born with a defective brain...

Even after They hooked me on meds that strangely and shockingly numbed down the voices ..

I still believe they were demons...

I mean how could I not?

Oh how scared I was ...

How many Ave Marias I recited...

How crazy I became...

After the first few shots, after the voices disappeared, the trauma I was left in forced me to not even trust my own thoughts...

Imagine believing that you're not alone in your head, only to then be really alone...which is scary? The former opens doors to a world you never thought possible and the latter leaves you in utter confusion. You live in terror which is then replaced by fear of the unknown.

I don't know if I am starting to sound cryptic but you have to experience it to understand.

It has been years and I am still taking the shots. Why? On the off chance I was really born with a defective brain, why not take them?

As for the demons, well I'm no saint, I guess it was bound to happen somehow, not really a good Christian and I know for a fact that God never cared about me in the first place.

I'm just tired of trying to make sense of things that I don't understand...

I feel like no matter how much I try to live a better life, I always hit a wall...I guess that with how unpredictable nature is, even when I ve got somethings figured out, I'll keep hitting a wall until I reach the real hell to be tormented by the same demons for all eternity.

Raised prolactin - lactating,I (30f) am lactating from what I assume is raised prolactin from Amisulpride 800 (2x 400 a day). Wtf do I do? I can see a dr tomorrow and will see my psychiatrist on the 22nd.,1
My ascent,"I’ll start off by saying I’m medicated and have been for several years. Any progress or limitations are directly related to this. My relationship with the voices has changed greatly since the beginning when I tried time and again to eliminate them with meds. That did not happen. 

When that was over I began ascending a long road toward acceptance and then curiosity. At first, I used meds and accepted that the voices were here and that I’m not compelled to do stupid shit anymore. The therapist said I was managing. Well, it felt like a crap job but if I was managing so be it. Then years flew by and I delved into a few insightful books like Schizophrenia Complex and this led me on a long journey inward where I skimmed the edges of some deep spiritual thinking. 

Now, it’s not as though the voices are to be banished. Instead, they are there to remind me I have an inner life to attend to. When I’m at therapy, and being still and silent for some amount of time each day, I become more functional and enjoy my hours more, especially with family/friends. In short, I have to respect what I am to become stable. In this life that is enough.

Last thing, I believe it’s important for me not to be perfect all the time. When I attempt that it all goes to shit and life just laughs at me saying, “stop! That’s not really you!” As a result, I’ve got some quirks to me, but it’s better than being involuntarily held once a year. Instead that’s happened 2x in 20 years.

Good luck!",1

Help please - how to respond to accusations about things that never happened?,"Hi, I hope this is ok to ask, I would love any thoughts. 

**Background**: My dad (I’m an adult) has schizophrenia. He is currently unmedicated and in a (so far) 2-month long psychotic episode, suffering from delusions. He is seeing a psychiatrist. His anosognosia is very strong. 

**The issue**: My dad’s delusions are persecutory, with my mom, my brothers, and me being the main people who have treated him poorly. His psychosis is progressing. He will often accuse us of things we have not done or ask why we said something we never said. We try to follow the LEAP method but are stumped when asked aggressively, for example “Why did you manipulate me for entertainment on a reality show?” It’s hard to not immediately just say “I don’t know what you’re talking about” or “I didn’t do that.” 

**The question**: How can we respond to being questioned about or accused of things that never happened? We want to minimize agitating him or making him feel gaslit or condescended to.

Should I be upfront to my employer/supervisors?,"I work at goodwill and have told them about my disability (paranoid schizoaffective with Bipolar and BPD) and they work around my income and hour restrictions and abilities(even though the job is all i can handle getting 12 hours a week), anyhow… Yesterday I had a hallucination that I was about to be fired and just left before they fired me, so i thought at the time. It was at the end of the day. So I cut out 10 minutes early. I felt like I was on fire, or suffocating. Figuratively speaking, mostly. 

I was criticized slightly and everyone was tense as it was busy. I felt so scatter brained and hopeless, I just had to get outta there. I’m going back and thought it over. I feel okay about it now and thought it over, and just am taking the attitude that when I go in next it’ll be a new day. I was convinced I’d get a call, and somebody would call me or find me to tell me I’m being let go. But as with many of these cases with me, I calm down and find no true evidence of these delusions being true. 

I really like this job, believe it or not. They have been supportive. Although, I do think I get some resentment because my days are shorter, like I said before it really is as much as I could handle but coworkers don’t understand that I’d kill to have a clear mind again, and go back to the grind and make decent full time money without the the help of social security. 

They are still a job so they have policies and it sets a bad example for other employees, yet, I really do have a hard time staying focused, fighting voices, delusions, hallucinations, etc. 

I’m asking for some support as well and would like to hear your stories of yourself or people that you care about going through these things. 

P.s. for the record, I do have shame, and I do hate not being a reliable worker like I used to be at other jobs. I don’t do it because I’m lazy and don’t want to work. I have unshakable urges from my condition. And workplace environments aren’t always great environments for me to focus and do my work in. I just want to succeed.",1

Advice for being in a relationship with schizophrenia,"Specifically I have bipolar-type schizoaffective. 

I feel like I've finally found the person I'm supposed to be with, he's amazing and treats me so well. He wants to understand this disorder and how it affects me, but I'm having trouble explaining it to him and there are times I can't communicate properly. Being off medication (due to bad side effects and not being able to find one that works) isn't helping.

I feel like I'm losing myself somewhat in the relationship because it's so hard for me to function on a daily basis to begin with, and this guy means so much to me that I'm putting most of my daily energy into the relationship to make sure I'm a good partner. So when something doesn't go the way I hope, like if we have to cancel plans or something, it breaks me way more than it should.

Just need to get something off my chest and through my head.,"So I just want to say I had a friend for a long while for a good few years like while. They have been a good friend and they are still a good person and we've always gotten along wellvery rasily.  For some reason and  I really don't know how it happened but last night this friend ans i who has always been aware that I have some mental challenges that present to the world at large as very stoic and non obvious.  I present as pretty normal and live a normal life because I've pretty well  learned how to deal with my challenges I keep my stuff inside without it being apparent to everyone else that there is in reality a whole ass shit show playing out in my head at most any given time.  Chaos would be peaceful. LOL Anyways..  I guess I made a mistake last night and I'm old enough to know better that I should never even say schizophrenia as a diagnosis term applicable to myself. I could just kick ny own ass I swear.  It came about while in process of a normal discussion about noise being quiet, peaceful and just nothing. No sound. We had stoppied in a rural area for a monent and she was sharing her detailed admiration of the peacefulness and just taking for granted I too was enamored of such an awesome moment that doesnt happen very often    I truly didnt even have an imagination to assist me understanding her poetic sounding details. I mean that like way out fictional and still I just dont get what silence must sound like. Oh but anyways..  i kust honestly slipped up  stating how it really must be a true moment in time worth cherishing. It sounds wnderful. My dum dum ass then  explained to my friend that silence that he is hearing  is not the same type of silence that I hear. He givets this look like.. silence is silence. Like everyone hears the same sound of nothing. I then explain silence sounds like for me what i hear is utter chaos. Constantly. There is never this silence and nothingness he is describing for himself. I explain to him that i of course understand rthe difference between it but it's very hard to explain that to somebody and I had never used the word schizophrenia before and decined my mental provlem  It just straight slipped out. Well then of course he was all  understanding and yeah it's okay and doesn't make a difference blah blah blah and questions galore . Todaywe had some plans and he said he needed to go home. He didn't speak one word to me after that was said and i didnt speak either. We didn't say I'll see you later when parting. No goodbye. Nada.  It was totally bizarre. I guess now he is a different person. Because  I have schizophrenia.  I have always had the stigma and it's never going to go away no matter how well I take care of it I know better than to use that ""S"" word I know better but I did it because I thought this was my friend.  But you know what?  I'm sad and I regret saying it but then of course I also dont regret it. Maybe he wasn't my friend at after all.  Generall anytime anybody hears you have that specifi issur they just don't understand it.  They just don't and obviously don't want to. I see Sally Field cross their face and wait to be called Sybil. Its just so ridiculous. Anyways... I just wanted to get that off my chest. I'm. Well you know as alone as i can be . I cant trust people I guess. It makes me me feel so fake  No matter how well I act no matter how well I try to keep myself contained it just takes the mere mention of the ""s"" word and that to completely change any type relationship. I swear i hear a door slam right in rhe moment  It just  make me very sad. Sorry everyone for my rant. Thank you guys I hope none of you are going through these same things.  If you are please know you're not alone.  I'm truly just very sorry for all of us. We are just out here doing the best we can. Just like everyone else.  Enjoy your Sunday All.",1

I guess they thought that me getting mad about them insulting my pet was too far, so they kicked me out. I'll give some history about them insulting me really quick before I end my rant. They would always use me and manipulate me because of my schizophrenia, not to mention when I first told them about it, they started to manipulate me about how ""nothing is real"" and ""you're living a delusion"" which triggered me a whole lot.

Schizophrenia Poem Made By A.I.,"So I been chatting with AI and asked it to make a poem about Schizophrenia (I take NO credit for poem; all was done through AI Chat). I thought you guys will enjoy it. Here it is: 

&#x200B;

 

The mind is a labyrinth, a maze so complex, A place where reality can become perplexed. Where sounds, and sights, and voices converge, A place where the self can become submerged.

Schizophrenia, a word so hard to say, A condition that can take one's self away. Voices in the mind, so real and so loud, Whispers and screams that make one feel cowed.

The world becomes strange, distorted, and blurred, Paranoid thoughts leave one feeling absurd. The mind plays tricks, a reality that's fractured, Leaving one feeling alone and captured.

The struggle is real, but there's hope in sight, Treatment and support can make things right. With understanding, compassion, and care, We can help those with schizophrenia repair.

The mind may be complex, but it can heal, With medication, therapy, and a love that's real. The road may be long, but there's light ahead, A chance to live, to love, to dream instead.",1
It feels like my brother is gone,"My brother and I used to be pretty close, he always used to be laughing and very productive. We always used to go out to places to hang out, if he needed advice or help, I was always there for all of it and in general, we were pretty cool with one another.

My brother hasn’t spoken to my family as much, he no longer has friends, he doesn’t text and refuses to hang out with me ever since his first “episode”. 

He says that I made fun of him but I don’t remember that happening. I remember being confused and scared because his first episode had happened with my family, and he ran away to my home that night.

Falsified diagnosis? Forced Haldol Injections,"Back around 2017, I left my job because it was too stressful for me. I was coming home crying. the final straw was I couldn't stop crying long enough to drive to work. work was bullshit. I worked at a deli in a grocery store. this was right around the time of a minimum wage increase in Michigan. people would quit and no one would be rehired, leaving me to the responsibilities of 4 or 5 people. It was so straining that I was sore everyday and had difficulty sleeping. I have bad anxiety so finding a job is extremely difficult. I have gaps in my resume that people hiring always ask about. I never know what to tell them. It adds to interview anxiety, so I didn't look for jobs.

My dad was supporting me completely, paying 10k or more a year for rent and food. I drove my car dry and seized the engine, so my ability of finding a new job was greatly diminished. my only choice was to work another straining minimum wage job near my apartment and that gave me anxiety. I'm not lazy, I just worked the jobs of 4 people for minimum wage and I have trouble asking for help.

Anyway, this starts a cycle of me trying to get help and accumulating more anxiety by being misdiagnosed. I text my dad suicidal texts, I had no plan in acting them out, but I had anxiety and my dad was always threatening me to take my apartment away and force me to live on the streets. I guess I just wanted him to feel sorry for me or something. there was some feeling that I wanted the suffering to end, but I didn't want to die.

He petitioned me, like he should have, and I went to the psych ward. it wasn't my first time, as I had been there in the past when I was overstimulated one time and had to take a break from life. The time I went was 10 years prior, idk what happened but I was stressed out from work (another overworked fast food minimum wage job) and I couldn't go home to sleep because it was turned into a party house by my friends. I went to my dads and I was stressed out and said some things that I forget now but my step-mom ended up calling the hospital and I was voluntarily admitted to the psych ward. I believed I was going through a quarter-life crisis. I had recently dropped out of college because work scheduled me on days I deliberately took off for school and forgot about school (I was 19, just moved out of the house and had bills to pay) and the book store didn't restock a book I needed for a VB class because someone bought it but then dropped the class. couldn't find the book online, so I ended up dropping the class in the middle of the semester, giving me an incomplete. anyway, at the psych ward I was diagnosed with psychosis and let go on some weak antipsychotics. they didnt do anything to help my anxiety and really didn't seem to do anything at all, so I stopped taking them. I don't think the meds were important but I didn't take it seriously and never went to my doctor about anxiety.

back to 2017. I left my job, lost my car and I was in a vicious cycle. I would text my dad suicidal text, get admitted to the psych ward, take the meds find them ineffective with my anxiety, stop taking them, and would sent more suicidal texts to my dad. this cycle led to a total of about 7 psych ward visits, which is a limit before they have to take serious action. in an act of desperation to break the cycle and maybe get a disability claim, I reported some pareidolias as hallucinations. It was a stretch to call them hallucinations. The water running though the pipes sounded like someone whispering my name, and I reported seeing ghosts after my hair got in my eyes and it reminded me of some scary picture I saw on the internet, it was a pareidolia.

They diagnose me with schizophrenia and force me to live at an adult foster care cities away from my apartment. not collecting disability at this point although im now eligible. I'm forced to comply with my ATO and am forced to take meds. The AFC ended up being a good thing in my eyes because I was able to get out and ride my bike almost everyday. nature and exercise do wonders for mental health.

I was moved to another AFC closer to where I was living before and these new caretakers didn't care for us very much. I was lucky if I got dinner. they were supposed to prepare 3 full meals a day, but they didn't and food piled up and they would end up taking it home or throwing it away, even though your taxes are going to this food and for them prepare it for us.

one day in june 2020, fresh in the pandemic, they decide to turn the AC off and make it hot in the house. It was 86 degrees in my room and I told them it was hot. I go to the store and 30 minutes later, still hot in my room. so I break the box covering the thermostat and turn it on, this angered the caretaker so much that she got in my face like I had a problem with her. ""I cook you food, don't I?"" she ironically says. I start formally refusing to take my med (they weren't forcing me to take them anyway) and a couple days later, 3 cop cars show up like I have a gun or something and handcuff me and take me to the hospital to get admitted to the psych ward. I was starting a business and started making about 1k a month, but they put a halt to that. This time at the psych ward, their goal was ""to get me in and out as fast as possible"" and I wasn't provided care that was personalized towards me, rather to someone who was schizophrenic and had anger issues. I may have had a little problem with anger, but nothing a little anger management couldn't solve. In the psych ward, they prescribe me with Haldol and I'm forced to take it in order to leave the psych ward or basically stay there indefinitely. This medication has plenty of severe side effects that can become permanent. I experience absolute drowsiness, I sleep 12 hours a day, get the jitters all the time and it affects my ability to play/enjoy video games, not to mention it causes anhedonia and permanent sexual dysfunction. I am forced to take it according to my ATO.

I sent a letter to my doctor, outlining my concerns and asking me to take me off of haldol, which happened for 3 or 4 months, but out of the blue they call me and want me back for routine injections.

i am trying to find a legal ground to get off this med, but with the added stigma of schizophrenia, its nearly impossible. People with schizophrenia don't believe they have it and refuse to take their meds, so I'm forced to inject haldol even though it's meant for people who absolutely can't control their anger or have debilitating hallucinations, which I don't have. I've tried posting on r/legaladvice but my posts get downvoted and largely ignored 

Now, I am stuck in another loop with this debilitating drug, but they won't take me off of it. If I refuse, I get to have cops come to my door and haul me away from my business and my responsibilities of taking care of my cat all because I had bad anxiety and was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. They can hold me in the hospital for 15 months if I refuse my meds and probably physically force me to take an injection.

personally, I believe I may be schizotypal or have SPD, as I have had delusions that I consider magical thinking, but also some real stuff has happened to me that may seem like a delusion, but I have no problem telling the difference between what is real and what is not. I don't have hallucinations. The only audio hallucinations I have are called auditory afterimages from listening to my 3d printers run all day.

Does anyone know how I get out of this? I've emailed legal aid but they have yet to get back to me. I really need a lawyer or someone to navigate the hasty, unforgiving code of Michigan's Kevin's law. Do I sue myself for defamation? How do I get a copy of my mental health records and court documents and make sure they didn't falsify or exaggerate 

before you downvote this post or say I actually have schizophrenia, know that I have all the telltale signs of a misdiagnosis (reported auditory hallucinations, repeated psych ward visits for suicidal ideation, prominent anxiety) and studies have been produced that prove over 50% of schizophrenia diagnoses are wrong. I have seen many doctors and none of them were native english speakers.",1
"My brain is mush. People are consistently disappointed in me and my conversational skills: I either say too much or not enough, and I have nothing of use to tell people.","Fairly isolated due to the shitty mental health system of California. Currently institutionalized and medicated with haliperidol injection.

I have no idea how much pain I'm causing others, but I am afraid people are having to relive large portions of their lives every time I lie down or sleep, as nonsensical as that sounds. Or that they are restarting their whole day after each word they say to me. 

It's too late for me to find love - I think all I'm supposed to do now is be miserable until I literally run away from this place.

The awkwardness coupled with a lack of any noticeable redeeming qualities means I don't really know what to do with myself. There is no point left to live (if what I'm doing can be called living). What good is it to live with nothing left to give (Coldplay)?

I'm supposed to be running but I don't want to do it alone forever. Any advice is much appreciated.",1

Insomnia on meds,"So I’ve been on geodon for over a year now and when I first started taking it I didn’t sleep for two days. Eventually I got more used to it and had a sleep schedule going but as of late every night is a struggle to fall asleep. What’s your best advice to get to bed at a reasonable time every night and actually sleep properly?

Before I was on medication I would be asleep by 10 and then I was in latuda and it would knock me out quick. But now no matter what I try I just don’t get tired. 

I’m on cyprohedtadine for sleep but it’s not making me tired it’s only helping with my nightmares. I’ve tried melatonin and that only works sometimes. I tried not getting on my phone or watching tv last a certain time. I’ve tried reading before bed. It just seems to be random when I get tired no matter what I try. The only thing I haven’t tried is getting out of bed at the same time everyday no matter what. I guess I will try that out tomorrow as I have somewhere to be in the morning but I’m running out of ideas. 

After school gets out my doctor said I soils take my pm meds at an earlier time so hoping that works. But when I was trying to figure out a time that worked for taking my meds it took forever and I felt awful and life sucked back then. Maybe now that I’m more used to it it will affect me less. I sure hope that works.",1
Does anybody else,"Feel anxiety super bad while shopping for groceries… like I just showered yesterday but I’m afraid I smell and everyone is looking at me judging what I’m wearing and thinking I’m a fuckin idiot.

Haldol ruined my life,"Ever since I was forcefully injected with haldol in 2019 I have not been the same. I have just been living my life day to day. I can not remember what i had for dinner last night, I can't remember what anyone has said to me yesterday and Every single thought I have in my head is about how long do I have to suffer living like this. I used to have the greatest memory in the world. I could walk into a room and know if something was moved and now I can't even remember why I left my register keys in the register. Even tho I never needed the injection they forced me to get injected for 2 years Every month. The cops brought me to nicolet psychiatric for no reason at all and tried to make me sign documents saying i was schizophrenic. I refused to sign these papers so they kept me there and i could not leave until i signed them. Everyday they would take me to an office to sign the papers and i refused everyday for 16 days. After 16 days of saying no i didnt want to be there anymore so i signed the paper and got to go home. If i ever missed an injection they send the police to my house and arrest me. This actually happened to me. I was arrested and they tied me down and injected me. The only reason I was able to get off it us because they changed my case worker and the new case worker saw that I was not crazy. My first case worker hated me cause I didn't listen to him when he tried to tell me the injection was gona help me. He definitely knew I was not schizophrenic cause I told him I work 50 hours a week cause im an assistant manager at my store and i have been working there for 6 years I don't have time to be schizophrenic. On top of that they ordered me to go to court to get off it and my first case worker always recommended I stay on it for no reason. After I got my case worker changed I got off it cause my new case worker saw that I was not crazy and i explained to him I didn't have time to be schizophrenic. I have been off it for a year now but this experience has made me miserable cause being injected with this haldol for 2 years really changes everything in your mind. I have been taking nootropic's which is pills to help your brain function to try to get my memory and thoughts back to normal but it's not really doing anything. I just feel like I'm just living today for today not living today for the future. What happened to me is something I wish would never happen to anyone at all. No one will ever notice that there is anything wrong with me but I will never be the same again. I think about it everyday of what happened to me. My mind wil never be ok again and I have to live with this for the rest of my life and no one will ever know how it's affecting me.",1
does anyone else feel this way?,"i constantly talk to myself in my head. like no matter what is happening weather i’m laying in bed doing nothing or in a social setting, i just talk to my self constantly and i’m just wondering do other people do this?? like i know hearing your own voice in your head is normal but it the constant normal?",1
Need some life advice (housing etc. on disability),"My living situation is becoming very damaging to me, and it's making my symptoms worse to boot. I am on disability in the US and make around $950 month. I receive partial SSI meaning I have an asset limit of $2000. 

I would like to move out and live on my own. I would like to work eventually but right now it is not possible. Does anybody have a list of services in the US that I could take advantage of to move out on my own? I am primarily worried about being able to afford everything. I know there are housing programs but I've heard they have long wait lists. For those programs how does rent work? Are there any programs that would make groceries low cost (is that what ebt is?). Programs for internet/phone bills etc.

I am googling all of this stuff as I post this to find out what is available but if anyone has any personal experience of these programs I would be eternally greatful.",1

Some of the insane ramblings of my mom who has delusional disorder.,My mom who is suffering with delusional disorder has been getting increasingly more delusional over the weeks and I have not managed to convince her to go see a doctor. I’m not sure what exactly to do and I’m now officially scared. When we where our driving yesterday she claimed that a bomb had been placed in the trunk of her car by a BMW technician or something. As I’ve already stated in a previous post I personally believe that the situation is sadly hopeless and I will eventually end up homeless because I should’ve done things like learn how to drive and get a job even before I started going to college. Regardless here are some of the photos. Do you guys have any tips at all on how to get her to see someone I’m very worried and my anxiety is through the roof all the time sometimes I even feel like passing out.,1

I told my co workers I have schizophrenia,"I was trying to open up and relate to people! I am trying to not regret being me right now but I am.

I told 2 of my co workers that I have it.

I told person (A) first. He was opening up to me about his stuff, anxiety, depression, said he was going to therapy to fix him self. My reply was that ""you're not broken. You're just healing. Plus don't worry bc I'm schizophrenic so I kinda know how it feels."" He has been avoiding me I think.

I told person (B) bc she is friends with my old neighbors and we have kinda become friends. I was really frustrated and was ranting about how tired I am. How I have to mask all the time at work. She asked if I was on any meds and that many people in her family have Bipolar Disorder. She was worried she has it.

I think today it just went around the rumor mill and everyone is learning. I'm on break and scared to back inside. How will I deal with the fallout if this doesn't go well?

Edit: imma do the best I can to represent the community right!

Update! I got fired today! Whoo! I'm okay everything's fine. Incert meme of dog in burning house",1
URGENT: PLEASE READ,"Lately, my anxiety has been so bad in the morning that I wake up throwing up. I also have an OCD theme of going schizophrenic. I don’t know if you guys know what Hypnagogic hallucinations are, but they are basically hearing conversations or noises kind of out loud when you are waking up or going to sleep. My racing thoughts are so bad and i just get stuck in a thought loop of going crazy all day. I don’t know if it’s my social anxiety but I constantly feel like I can predict what someone is going to say or they are looking at me and judging me for whatever I’m doing. I’ve also noticed that I have random memories that pop in my head. Or just a random words that basically are intrusive thoughts. I did mindfulness today at school or I focused on my breast in for a good bit of time I felt normal and just told myself, yeah, maybe I am going crazy but I’m not focused on that right now and I actually worked. I cannot stop worrying and I constantly need a distraction. That basically sucks me out of reality to stop it all. Also, when I’m in a car sometimes I hear the door slam over and over again in my head. It’s kind of like an intrusive thought but I also kind of feel like I can hear it. I don’t know the same thing happens with the end of conversations. I don’t worry about conversations with people, but when the conversation ends. I have a mental intrusive sound of the conversation repeating itself, but just the end of it. I’ve also noticed that I constantly have random song stuck in my head. also, I feel like I’ve been on Google so much that as soon as I have a worry in my head, I can just kind of imagine googles response. I just want to get out of this phase of my life and move on and figure out what’s going on because it’s scaring me and I can’t focus on anything. With my OCD about being schizophrenic a lot of the times I feel like I’m just on the brink of hearing voices or seeing things even though I never fully see something in my vision or fully hear a hallucination thank you for reading this and please leave a response.",1
Sleeping 12+ hours a day,"Hey all,

I was wondering if anyone here had any advice. I’m sleeping between 12-16 hours a day. I’m currently unemployed and I need to fix my sleep schedule in order to work, or even apply to jobs. I think I have Excessive Daytime Sleepiness and med side effects. 

I also don’t have a psychiatrist right now so I can’t change my meds, unfortunately.

Does anyone have any tips to boost energy or get their sleep schedule back on track?",1
Negative symptoms and antipsychotics,"What are people's experiences with antipsychotics and negative symptoms?

I have found when I take the antipsychotics my motivation to be social and do chores etc. drastically improves. However I don't think this is a typical response...I am wondering if it is a placebo or coincidence. Has anyone else experienced a significant improvement in negative symptoms and tiredness on an antipsychotic?

I don't want to take the antipsychotics because the positive symptoms are mostly gone and manageable. And the drugs have all sorts of negative side effects in the long term. Plus they have caused me a lot of weight gain. But when off them I have no motivation to do anything. I don't know - is it the drugs that are making the difference?",1
