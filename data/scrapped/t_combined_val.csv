"Trigger warning ‚ö†Ô∏è 

I've been having this issue usually when I'm home alone but not always. It's at its worse if my back is to an open room or hall etc. Even worse than that if I need to shower. For example tonight my wife works until 3a.m. I needed a shower and 3a.m. is too late anyway so I showered and I was so paranoid I kept the curtain open. I couldn't stand to close my eyes so I did my best to rinse my hair and face without closing my eyes and ended up having to for what I'm sure was just a few seconds but seemed much longer. Hurried to get them open despite getting some soap in my eye. This whole time I got my back to the back wall of the shower curtain and door open. Getting the floor wet. By the time I was done...which wasn't long cuz instead of doing one thing at a time and rinsing separately I did it all at once then rinsed...I was shaky and my heart was and still is racing and its been prob 20 minutes since I got out. This doesn't happen every time I'm alone. 

Sometimes it happens when my wife is home. Like if I'm doing the dishes with my back to the rest of the room I'm so paranoid and anxious if my wife comes in and speaks or touches me I jump out of my skin and my heart is racing for a while afterwards and I'll be shaky for a bit. 

For context I've gone through abuse as a kid I can only remember bits of it. I'm working with a therapist and on a wait list for a psychiatrist. My diagnosis so far are anxiety disorder, depression, social phobia, and ptsd. I haven't told my therapist about this paranoia or whatever it is yet because honestly I feel so dumb about it. I'm not scared to be home alone nor am I scared of my wife. Why does this happen? I'm so tired of all of this shit and I hate myself.

Edit: just also thought this. It's started happening at work too. Thanks to the social phobia I can't work around people so I work alone cleaning a 2 story office building. Lately I'm pretty jumpy at work. If a automatic light clicks off I jerk my head towards it immediately and feel jumpy for a second until I realize it was just the light. I see things out of the corner of my eye and when I look nothing is there.",5,paranoia

"So my anxiety consumes and covers me like a veil just randomly comes and go as it pleases. But the problem is, when it‚Äôs present I am often unaware. My thinking patterns do not change and my world just slowly feels heavier. Before I know it, it creeps over me and holds me captive until it leaves in a rapid ‚Äúwhoosh.‚Äù 

This leads to health problems. I grow pale, I look terrible, I feel terrible, I get fatigued and physically ill. 

And once I‚Äôm to the breaking point and I feel like I‚Äôm just ill or that I‚Äôm trapped forever, it disappears. I need to know what this is. I don‚Äôt really have any negative Or anxiety inducing thoughts or thought patterns. This is just a condition that comes and goes as it pleases.

"I hate this so much, I feel embarrassed for being unemployed. Everybody else my age has amazing jobs and everybody else is working really hard progressing in their career and making money and building families. Meanwhile I'm jobless af. I have had various jobs in the past.... In high school, I worked as a cashier and stayed there for 4 years. I had a few other part time jobs during college as well.

I graduated college with my bachelor's degree at the height of covid in 2020, and had the hardest time finding any employment. I remember spending entire days applying for jobs and just never hearing anything. I some interviews here and there, would study my ass off about the company and interview skills and make absolute sure I did my best, would send thank you letters and the whole nine yards, but would get ghosted every time. I would even be applying for jobs thousands of miles away just hoping anyone would take me. Eventually I landed one job.....a minimum wage barista position at Starbucks. It was the worst job I ever had, I was mistreated by manager and shift leads every day, vastly overqualified with a degree, got paid so little and the work was so strenuous. I ended up putting in my notice, and then getting fired one day before my last day because I just couldn't keep up and my manager just had it out for me. I got another job later on, but it was also very low pay and the work environment was so horrible and the commute was so bad, that I didn't even last beyond my first week.

I continued to apply for hundreds of jobs and never got any callbacks. On top of my dad constantly hounding at me for being unemployed and struggling with horrible depression and anxiety, eventually I got so burnt out and couldn't stand the thought of applying for jobs anymore. I had just been through 20 years of school and spending the last 10 of those working shitty minimum wage jobs at the same time, stressed out applying for hundreds of these jobs, writing endless cover letters, dressing up for interviews....and going nowhere. I just got so burnt out because of it. I'm currently living mostly off of an inheritance that my grandparents left me and my siblings.

I feel guilty that I don't have a job. But I just feel so anxious around the thought of applying for jobs and also getting trapped in a bad environment where I'll be mistreated again. I feel so anxious of giving up all of my days to work for a company that doesn't respect me, underpays me and could easily replace me. I feel anxious about learning the ropes at new jobs as most companies I worked for had horrible training and the first 3 months were always hell. And in general I feel so aimless because my degree isn't even what I want to do with my life. I feel that I also wasted my youth, I wanted to do so much more while I was still young. I wanted to travel and make friends and have fun experiences but I basically have to give all of those dreams up to work some underpaying job with back breaking hours for the rest of my life. It sounds like my definition of hell. I just keep waiting for the day where I'll have some revolutionary idea that will save me from this, but it never comes.",4,anxiety

"Bit of backround. Sophmore year of highschool I broke, hit with sever anxiety and depression disorders  that I still struggle with to this day. Dropped out, went in and out of various therapists and programs. Some helped, some didn't. Im sure many here know the story.   


I try my best. I live on my own, pay the bills well. With my disability coverage im reasonably comfortable, the ever crumbling economy not withstanding. But despite it all I never feel like im enough.   


I just..can't handle everything. Not all at once. Something always slips. Maybe I forget to clean the bathtub during my chore list. Or I keep putting off my dentist appointment because the bills scare me so much it stops me from doing anything else. Or just...getting the trash out.   


I always, without fail, can't handle EVERYTHING I need too. Most, but not all. And everyone reminds me of the fact.. What set off my current episode was I called my aunt, the woman who took me in temporarily after my mother died, to wish her a happy mothers day. Barely took her a minute of conversing to remind me im ""Really good at not keeping appointments."" And it just...it hurt so much.   


Apart from my therapist, no one seems to understand that even if I seem to be doing well, every day is a struggle to get done what I can. I always feel like im swimming with my head just barely above the water. Some days I choke and have to stop to cough out. Other days im mostly okay. But it never stops being a fact of im barely swimming as it is, any everyone expects me to handle it, or get stronger to handle it. But no matter what I do or how much progress I make, there's always... more. More appointments, more chores, more things I need to do that I inevitibably fail at in one way or another.   


So now, here I am again. Four trash bags sitting in the corner. Bed half made and falling apart. Clothes strewn about. Carpet needs vacuming, and I haven't eaten a proper meal in about 16 hours.. and im too cold to do anything. Too...empty.   


Why even bother? Nothing I do is enough for anyone, and those few who get it can't help for one reason or another. Im not even feeling like...sad sort of depressed. Or maybe I am? Tears tickle my eyes but I don't...feel anything but cold. Cold and Empty. I don't know anymore.

"Hi everyone, sorry in advance if I write a bit weird, Honestly I find it somewhat hard to open up, I'm not very good at it. Throwaway account because this is rather personal. I figured this would be the best place to ask this as I believe its related to my ADHD and you fine people might relate.

I have been attracted to a friend for some time, so I finally decided to take the plunge and ask her out. I got rejected, with a very cookie cutter rejection, which kind of hurt, but we are still good friends. Initially I had a wave of euphoria because I actually managed to ask her in the first place, but this went away after some time. Next came the inevitable sadness.

I still see her in a romantic way, it feels like it wont go away. I got a no, I should be fine to move on, but I'm NOT. I don't know how to handle this, and tbh I feel like I'm wasting time, imagining a relationship that will never be. So why am I still so attached? This feels like such a setback when I've been working on myself mentally for a good while now...

if you don't want to listen to my vent pls don't bother reading this i'm just in need for desperate help

is this even paranoia? or something else...?

\---

i might've posted something like this on my profile. it's the same topic, albeit things have changed over time. i'm unsure if anyone else has this problem, too, but have you ever felt like someone is watching you, reading your mind and getting into your personal thoughts?

capable of hearing/seeing what you think of, even if you were thinking of it for one second?

it's much worse when you have intrusive, unwanted thoughts. randomly coming into your mind.

i feel like someone's threatening me and watching me while i'm at home, reading my mind. whatever i like, they'll think of the same thing albeit in negative emotions. when i like something they'll think ""oh i don't. you're stupid and cringe and edgy, you know that, right?""

i'm unsure if this is even paranoia. just a whole other level of feeling threatened, scared, worried, anxious, and paranoid but in another way.

does anyone have a problem relating to this? because i really need someone i can talk to about this. at least someone who'll comprehend and care.

mother won't care; nor will sister or brother. my mother would say ""oh, it's because you're setting your mindset to that kind of thing"" when it's not me. my father will say ""you're weird"" because he probably assumes i'm a normal, cis child who is innocent and non-suicidal. non-mentally unstable.

sometimes, when i try perceiving on what's happening to the person watching me, i feel as if they're some person/demon who looks identical to me. but more annoying and creepy.

i feel like i can read what they're saying in my mind; albeit what would they really be saying? ""oh you're a wonderful person"" no they wouldn't say that. they'd say something more opposite; like ""oh you're an idiot, you just fake your depression you ugly emo brat. i'm now threatening you because i don't care"" and i feel like nobody can help me. nobody, in the whole entire fricking g\*d-damn world.

like people would just say ""no you're just setting your mindset to that"" ""nobody can watch you, you're 'safe'"" ""the only person who can read your thoughts... well, is you"" (according to my therapist). i can't get proper help because nobody will understand me well.

the person watching me might as well be an old imaginary friend; who now despises me. or might be some person i hate irl watching me through technology. even if theres no such thing as cameras around my house, i feel as if they're watching me some other way.

i'm unsure about whats happening. i need desperate help.

summary/brief explanation: basically i'm saying that i feel like some person is watching me and threatening me in some weird strange way (not by using cameras) and i can't get any help or remove this stuff from my stupid brain.

i just want to harm myself; how would that go with the person watching me? or should i say demon?

"The sad truth is I have to end my relationship with the man I've been with for nearly 3 years. We met online so that meant we had distance between us and despite it we spoke most days and messaged a lot. He seemed pretty normal from the conversations although he did seem reserved, but I put that down to getting to know you or he'd make small remarks that you could brush off as quirks. Fastfoward to now and he is more paranoid than ever, it is frightening and exhausting. Everywhere we have been people are out to get him, he accuses me of knowing them to put stuff in his food, in cities I have never even been to before. He makes all the food, he doesn't trust me to cook and then yells I am a baby for not cooking. His mind has descended into more irrational scenarios and it is taking a toll on his overall health. He has asthma and smokes which of course causes reactions like he coughs more, he feels like he can't breath right, his voice goes hoarse and all I get it is me doing it to him. No, it is an asthma attack and this could be dangerous for him. He thinks cigarettes are made ""worse"" these days or a pack must be chosen especially to make him feel worse. He coughs and coughs, complains of lumps in his throat and it is my doing. I get yelled at for being ""sneaky"" and I am laughing at him and plotting. He sees bad in almost everyone and that businesses are flushing money through them to hide criminal activities. He has had over 30 jobs in his life because people were ""attacking him"" or out to get him etc. He is religious and so people are putting spells on him or demons are targeting him which is frightening to hear a person be absolutely convinced. I have anxiety and lockdowns made it worse and I was in a bad place and he helped me so much and I have become too reliant on him. The paranoia seems to have become more intense and the accusations, from me being ""paid by someone"" to have targeted him or he has ranted about a jewel and people I have never heard of. I get verbal abuse and told I am useless and worthless. The end of the road has come. He is never going to get help and he hates doctors. He had his eye test months ago and was told he has cataracts and needs an operation. His parents had them, but he has refused to get it done and says his eyes are getting worse. He thinks he can fix them and ordered stuff, but the only cure is an operation. I can't be with him as his paranoia colours everything in his life and his health is going downhill. His parents are gone and he had a tough upbringing, his dad was cold and distant, his mother was loving to him, but he isn't close to his siblings. All he sees is bad in almost everyone and everything and most is aimed at me and I am made out to be the most devious, horrible, sneaky person ever. I am not and you can't reason with him. Paranoia has now coloured every aspect of this life together and I don't want to be part of it. My anxiety is going up being with him and he mocks it and calls me mental. He has severe mental health issues, his physical health is getting worse and he once was actually talking to his doctor, but now he mistrusts them more. I have to end this relationship for my own sanity too. I love him, he has been kind and supportive, but getting through to him is almost impossible now and false accusations are thrown back in my face.",5,paranoia

Part of me wishes the trip got cancelled‚Ä¶ but then I would be really sad!

I wake up feeling sick and anxious and I can‚Äôt stop worrying. Last time I flew, I puked on the plane twice and I‚Äôm scared thats gonna happen again. I also have long layovers in airports I‚Äôve never been to before. And I have a few days in Europe to myself and I‚Äôm anxious about that too. Plus all the smaller things like meeting new people, sleeping in different beds, time change, what to pack, getting a travel plan for my phone, etc etc. 

Any advice?

This is a very long read, uhm.
I got sent to the mental hospital because I sent a friend my goodbye message, and I was planing on committing suicide by overdosing on all of the pills I find in my house when school ends. Getting sent to the mental hospital made me feel like I was being punished for wanting to die. I am so fed up with life. Getting sent there made me feel worse. I had these certain friends that I could trust and be myself around, and they were encouraging me to live but over time, they started being distant. They pretend that I don‚Äôt exist now. I asked my friends if I could hang out with them on the weekend and they said yes. They ALWAYS hang out without me and always post about it. But suddenly they ghosted me again today and I feel like shit. I was so excited and happy, but they ignored my multiple texts. I wasn‚Äôt being rude... I‚Äôve always struggled making friends as a kid, and this reoccurring moments give me terrible flashbacks. I struggle with communicating because I am neurodivergent. Luckily I have therapists.

"so my entire life i‚Äôve always had anxiety about feeling like i‚Äôm always being watched/stalked, and sometimes those feelings will also be telling me that whoever is ‚Äúwatching me‚Äù is going to try to hurt/kill me, but i‚Äôve never really thought it was a big enough deal to really tell anyone. lately though things have really escalated, those feelings telling me that i‚Äôm being stalked have become much more intense, to the point where i‚Äôm only getting around 3-4 hours of sleep every night because the feelings are too intense to let me sleep. it‚Äôs not only the feeling of thinking i‚Äôm being stalked though, because around a week ago when those feelings started ramping up i started having new feelings too, ones that were telling me that people around me were going to poison my food, and that my family/friends were planning on hurting/murdering me. most of the time when this is happening the feelings will tell me that i have to leave the room or even building i‚Äôm in because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot safe‚Äù or something. these feelings have been making it incredibly hard to function and just do basic every day things, so i just needed to ask, what qualifies as paranoia? does anyone think i have it? i just need some opinions.

"So I use to live in a Caribbean island where crime isn‚Äôt too good. Like you hear wild things. A innocent jewelry man was followed from his job and the robbers blocked the road, told him to leave his car at gun point, robbed him, and murdered him. A girl was driving with a friend when someone tailgated and bumped her car. She came out the car to investigate and she got kidnapped, raped, and dropped off. Imagine women being targets in their CARS. 

These crazy news got me paranoid thinking I‚Äôll get a home invasion. Both of my parents are  in poor health so they can‚Äôt defend themselves. 

What makes me fear that I‚Äôm a high risk of home invasion is that we live in the rainforest alone with no neighbors and we have no security system. We have a vicious dog that hates strangers so I hope that can deter them. However I cant escape and hide in the bushes because the dog may attack me (The dog doesn‚Äôt recognize me since I live in the states). Whenever I hear all my dogs barking outside I get extremely anxious thinking someone is coming to harm us all. I even called the cops once and my mom got mad saying it‚Äôs the deer that the dogs are barking at. 

I really wanna visit my family more often but the fear of home invasion makes me not stay as often and only stay for a week.

Is there any advice or support you can give me to not fear of home invasion. I just fear a whole bunch of guys come and held us on gunpoint and I then get raped, and they leave with valuables and possibly our lives",4,anxiety

"About two months ago I finally sought out professional help to alleviate my anxiety. I went on ZocDoc and after some time, narrowed my choices down and picked at what I thought at the time was a good psychiatrist.

My first visit was very brief and she put me on medication which I thought was odd at the time. That visit was over the phone but she told me to physically go to her office for the next visit. Our second visit started out a little shaky. I went to the office as she told me to, but she wasn't there so I had to do the visit over the phone again while I was in her office. Aside from that it was great!  I felt like I got a lot off my chest and I felt like I finally had someone looking out for me. Our third visit was brief again and she didn't seem to remember or bring up most of what was discussed in our last meeting. I began to realize that she was very forgetful. Our fourth and probably last visit was awful. She couldn't remember basic details about me, couldn't remember what meds she prescribed me and sounded generally uninterested the entire time. At the end she told me they were having ""technical difficulties"" with scheduling appointments and would call me later to book an appointment.

That was over a two weeks ago and they still haven't called me back. I don't even want to waste my time calling them to see what the deal is. It all felt so directionless. She'd prescribe me medications then tell me essentially to figure it out and I've been trying to figure it out by myself my entire life. No guidance, insight, or any form of advice to help me improve my life as if the medications would suddenly fix all my issues. I'll take my losses and find a new psych.

I know this journey won't be perfect, but it was very disheartening to finally tell someone all the struggles I have dealt with my entire life only for them to give me subpar care and treat me as if I'm some annoyance. I did net some good from the visits. I was finally put on some medications that have greatly helped in reducing my anxiety. I also have a renewed initiative to work on improving my mental health.",4,anxiety
"I will try and keep this short. I have been fighting depression for my life and seeing psychiatrists and doctors for around 12 years. I am 35. With my current therapist, over the last 9 months or so he has basically stopped trying to help and simply listens and says he will help me look for a better resource. But every resource referred to me just doesn't take new patients, doesn't take my insurance, doesn't provide the care requested, etc. So I left a voicemail on a potential new therapist machine where I expressed that I was struggling and I was crying quite a bit. Instead of helping, they called a neighboring parish Sherriff dept. who called me and tried to figure out my location so they could pick me up. I made it home and was able to convince her that I am under the care of a psychiatrist and therapist and was simply upset, and never expressed I wanted to harm myself or others. She agreed, finally, that I was safe and we ended the call, and told me that she would not send anyone. But, the cops showed up anyway.

Since then I just haven't been able to trust anyone at all. My therapist has been saying for months I need to do some kind of inpatient program but I cannot defeat the paranoia that I will be drugged into submission and have something horrible happen to me. I am terrified I will lose my job and I have no savings or family or friends as a safety net. I would be homeless. Louisiana, where I live, is very poor and our healthcare is from another era.

I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I can trust any advice or help from the medical field and the more I express this, the worse they treat me, and it keeps becoming a self fulfilling prophecy. I can't call and ask for another therapist. My current therapist does not help. I am terrified that if I ever voluntarily went to inpatient I would never be released or I would be tortured into submission. There's nothing anyone can say to me that will change my mind, and I know that is wrong, but I also know it is true.

How do you ask for help when you don't trust the help? What can I do to convince myself that inpatient facilities are not simply mental jails to ease state suicide statistics? I read so many horror stories online, and I hear so few good ones. And the good ones don't seem to explain very much about what happened there, it's the bad ones that go into detail. I would rather die than go on antipsychotic medication again, because to me the feeling they bring is the worst thing I've ever experienced. It's like truly being undead. I know that isn't the case for everyone, but for me, I just feel like a small eye in my skull peeping into the world, but the rest of my body is something else, controlled by something else, I'm just watching, I no longer exist. And if that's the case, I might as well be dead. Here are all the diagnoses I have been given, but I am not really sure which ones are real:

Major depressive disorder

Double depression

General anxiety disorder

Adjustment disorder

Borderline personality disorder

Avoidant personality disorder

ADHD

ASD

" I don't know what happened to me. As a teenager, I was wild.. I started doing meth when I was 13 and was on and off til I was 17. I'm sure that has taken a huge role on my mental health now. But I was soooo care free. I used to hitch hike all around North America. Meet new people, sleep with strangers. (Not just sexually, but actually sleep with them in many different situations.) Then when I was 21, I started doing heroin, which then lead to fentanyl. That's truly what ruined my life. I had always been a functional alcoholic/drug addict until I did opiates. I went through a lot of pretty traumatic shit thanks to my fentanyl addiction. My husband and I lived with a severely psychopathic and abusive dealer for a long time. We watched people dying in front of us. We were also homeless for a long time and dealing with the gangs and being robbed and stabbings and stuff was obviously difficult. But it never truly phased me. Maybe because all I was thinking about was dope, idk. My husband went into the hospital for a week and I was on the streets by myself. That was the worst part, shit got really bad when I was alone. There's a lot of things I don't talk about, and definitely will never tell my husband because I don't need him to feel guilty because he couldn't protect me or whatever while he was literally on his death bed. Anyway, we got clean like over 3 years ago. I don't know what the fuck happened to me because ever since we got clean, I've been going through phases of extreme paranoia. No, it's not like day 6 of a meth binge where I think the shadow people are stalking me. I'm scared of real life shit and it's becoming crippling. I feel like every person alive is out to get me. Unless I know them well. I'm convinced that most people are violent and sociopathic and sadistic. The paranoia I feel in public is overwhelming but here's the stupid part - 

I did something I never should have done. See, I've always had this irrational fear of war, bombs, jihadists, religious extremists of any sort, neo nazis, acts of terrorism. Sometimes I'd play into that fear by watching war movies or documentaries that give me pretty severe anxiety and typically lead to nightmares. I don't know why I do it. I just wanted to feel afraid, but it was never as bad as it is now. Anyway, a few months ago, my 15 year old brother in law asked me if I'd ever heard of ""run the gauntlet. "" I said no, and he showed me one of the videos from it. It was a video of a man being beheaded, I think by some cartel members. About halfway through, I vomited and I was really upset. I don't know why the fuck I did this, but after that, I started seeking out gore websites. I'd specifically look up videos of murder or violence in general. Not because I enjoyed it, but because it was making me sick with anxiety and for some reason, I've always done this shit to myself. It's why I used to watch war movies. I would literally watch these videos of people being murdered and I've sobbed, hyperventilated, thrown up, and then continued watching. I realize how fucked up this all sounds. Well, I've stepped away from the gore videos because it was all just too much. But now my paranoia is at an all time high. I'm scared. All day, every day. I was shoveling snow at work yesterday, and every single car that drove past, I'd run and hide behind my car because I'm scared they'll drive by and shoot me. Or see me and get out and try to hurt me. Every time I go to get in my car, I get sick with fear that someone is in the backseat waiting for me. I try to take my dogs for walks and when I walk past other people, I specifically move far away when we pass each other in case they try to stab me. I don't go to any ATM's anymore, I have to have my husband do it, because I'm scared someone will be waiting for me to pull my cash out so they can rob me. When I'm in stores or restaurants, I start to freak out because I assume someone in there is going to pull a gun and shoot the place up. I wasn't going to admit this, but I literally am considering getting a helmet to start wearing in case someone shoots at me, I want my head to be as protected as possible. Needless to say, my time in public is extremely limited. I hardly go anywhere unless it's work. Which has become torture because I'm alone for most of my shift. I pretty much stay home now because leaving my house is a fucking massive challenge. I feel defeated. I'm so fucking over-stimulated because of all the anxiety and paranoia. I wish I never discovered those videos. I feel like they literally traumatized me, which sounds ridiculous, like.. How could a video traumatize someone? But it's just what I'm feeling. When I pass by people, I start having images in my head of the videos but it's my face on the people being murdered. It's like it happened to me. I already struggle with flashbacks from my fentanyl days, and these videos are just like that. I imagine people doing things to me that have never happened to me, just like a flashback. I get stuck in my head. I panic. I don't know what to do. I fucked up big time watching those videos. I now know how truly easy it is for people to murder and hurt others. Not just easy, but it's so much more normal and common than I realized. I just don't know what to do, I need help because I'm telling you, I cannot go on living this way for much longer.",5,paranoia

High school junior here.  A false sexual accusation rumour about me spread to my only group of friends.  They all gave me the cold shoulder. Later I find that this girl had essentially assimilated into the friend group I was once in. WTF? The popular guy that she cosied up to as well is showing no restraint and blabbering the rumour to all his friends. 

About the accusation - something did happen but it was all consensual and very minor. However I have gotten into trouble for something similar but more severe, and I am worried that the school will side with the girl no matter what as a result, and that I could get expelled and my life simply ruined.

But I know that it's simply not sexual assault (not willing to share details unless via PM, if you really doubt that I am not an abuser). I've asked my scenario to friends and anonymous online users, making myself sound as horrible as I can with wording, from both perspectives, and yet without fail, every single time, they agree that I am not in the wrong, or at least, that the girl was overreacting. I did manage to win a few friendships from that group back, but things will never be the same :/

The group cut me off at the end of February. The incident happened in early October. She acted like nothing was wrong until the start of 2023. Why did she act like that, so strangely? I feel so betrayed...

Nothing has happened since then, but my loneliness and paranoia can't help but get the best of me - what if I get expelled? What if I never even get to graduate? What the hell is going to happen to me... I'm constantly anxious and jumpy on the inside. I swear, if I even had a semblance of a support group, I'd have gotten over this ages ago. But instead I'm still spreading negativity and have become my own ticking time bomb counting down to my next collapse of despair.

It feels so weird... why does she get to interact with so many of her friends as if nothing happened while I roam this school as a loner, without camaraderie? It's almost like the roles are reversed. As much as I hate it when people call themselves the ""victim""/partake in victim-blaming, I genuinely feel like I'm the victim here more than anyone else in this situation is. Surely I don't deserve whatever situation that has befallen me?

...and no this isn't simply me ""facing the consequences of my own actions."" Read above again. Please be kind and civil, I have already had enough negativity in my life.

Now to get onto the title. The issue is that I've been so stressed by above ^^ that I'm almost incapable of making decisions for the long-term. I used to have many university plans and different programmes, internships, and research projects that I wanted to go for.

But now I can't even think of making it past junior year (we end in November). I can only plan for two weeks ahead at a time to keep myself from internally combusting, collapsing onto myself.

I get a sense of dread whenever people talk about school or exams or education things in general, despite my relatively high GPA in a prestigious high school. I feel like all that could be stripped away from me in a blinding flash, and I'd be reduced to less than mere nothing. I have so much to lose

This has been affecting me by rendering me unable to work on larger projects myself unless given strict deadlines. (Studying for exams, finishing homework assignments/projects, etc.) If it's for my compulsory graduation project that needs to be done before the end of 2023, then good luck to myself meeting the graduation requirements! I have simply lost motivation to work on anything unless motivated by external stressors...

Because, what's the point? These things don't have any meaning if I get expelled anyway. On the other hand, if I have strict upcoming deadlines, I know that it's relatively likely that I won't get expelled within that timeframe and will actually work hard on them, almost (80-90%) normal, back to my old efficiency, speed, and amount of work done.

I also can't make plans for the future at all. I hear my girlfriend talk about her plans for college, the coding projects and paid internships she's been taking up, and I can't help but feel inadequate to her. Everything good in my life is just me riding the old wave of my successes from a previous era in my life, a time when I was less depressed and pathetic. They're not even that much. It's just going for math competitions that I know I won't win, and chemistry competitions I know I  have much to learn.

I haven't done anything noteworthy this year, neither have I worked on anything due further than a few weeks away, nor having done anything optional but helpful for my future, like additional research projects and internships. I have no research projects, internships, or notable extracurriculars. And I can't even bring myself to gun for them. I'm probably going to graduate with the bare minimum if my outlook on my future is so bleak and hopeless. I don't want that to happen. But I still can't stop worrying about myself getting expelled, and all my effort now to be naught. It's irrational. I'm irrational.

I'm falling far, far, behind. Augh...

I haven't even made any additional plans for my second semester. All I planned for was to just do the bare minimum and get through school without any problems or breaking down. All the people around me are so ambitious, I used to be like them, but now I don't think I can. It's not like I couldn't even handle it. Thanks to this great fear of expulsion, I find it a terrible struggle to function anymore.

it's weird. like i have ambition but i don't have drive. yet i have a lot of pent up energy. it's so weird.

It's like my ADHD symptoms have been amplified by an order of magnitude or two. Ugh... How do I stop these treacherous, onerous thoughts?

"please be kind to me. I don't know if this is the right place to say this.

I'm neurodivergent but allistic. my mother is autistic. people talk a lot about allistic parents with autistic children. I rarely see anyone talk about what it's like to be allistic with an autistic parent. I'm not here to spread hate. I just want to share my experience.

growing up with my mother was very lonely. it often felt like she was in her own world. she never hugged me as a child. she often neglected me in favor of her special interests. when I cried, she would remain completely silent. once, I told her through tears that it felt like she didn't love me. she walked away without a word. 

when allistic parents have autistic children, they read books on autism. they talk to child psychologists. I couldn't do any of that. I was just a child. I didn't know what autism was. all I knew was that my mother acted differently from other moms. I'm not a kid anymore. I read about autism sometimes. I understand now that my mother didn't like me crying because it was a form of sensory overload to her. I understand now that she didn't like it when I interrupted her special interests because it wasn't just a hobby to her. I understand all of that now as a grown-up, but that matters little because child me didn't know any of that. I go to therapy once a week now.

I second-guess myself sometimes. maybe she did love me. maybe she still loves me, in her own way. whatever it is, I don't understand it. I don't know if I ever will. she doesn't like talking to me. she tells me to stop talking when it doesn't interest her. she turns away from me and engages in her special interest. I don't know if she knows it hurts me. it's hard communicating with her. she doesn't seem to have any interest in me. I see posts sometimes, by autistic people talking about how much they detest allistic people. I wonder if that's how my mother really feels about me. 

I don't know where I'm going with this. I'm not saying autistic people have to conform to allistic standards. I'm not saying autistic people shouldn't have children. I'm just sharing my personal experience. and if you have a child, please just tell them you love them.",1,autism

"So, I can be a pretty paranoid person, pretty easily.

But, of course, I am working myself up, still, worrying about what if there is Co2 in the house, all because I'm nauseated. Which, happens to me often, so i should just be used to it, right? But, of course, I sit here and look up symptoms of co2 and poisoning pretty much to the brink of a panic attack. Making my nausea worse. I feel like I am just paranoid. I guess i just need reassuring. I should feel okay since our fire department literally told us everything was all clear, shouldn't I? But, I can't help but worry. There are two other people in the house, and they're fine, of course. That, and we have dogs who are all fine and acting normally. I guess I'm just so used to working myself up.

"Once every while it happens. I see a post from one of you where you stand up for yourself only to immediately retreat and apologize when the other person plays the victim. I know many of us are weak to manipulation because these kinds of things are simply our Achilles heel. I'm not sure who needs to hear this among us, but don't let them do this to you. 

The reason why we stand up for ourselves is because people from time to time cross our boundaries and we have to enforce said boundaries to preserve our mental health. Your boundaries are completely up to you and you will likely surround yourself with different people depending on what they are. Enforcing boundaries against people who do not give them the respect they deserve is never wrong. Do not be afraid to do it. Everybody is entitled to respect. You too. 

A lot of you will paddle back and apologize because we are easily manipulated. But even then we can do our best to arm ourselves against it. There are actually many common strategies that manipulators use like gaslighting or guilt tripping. It's vital to be informed of these behaviours because it will allow you to pinpoint such strategies and know how to respond to them or prepare for what comes next. Please understand this. If you apologize, they win. And if they see that they can easily trample over your boundaries, it only invites them to do it more cause they now know you're an easy target. It might feel like the polite or civil thing to do, but it's the wrong course of action. Stand your ground. I'm sure you have your reasons for calling people out. Respect your reasons. 

The world is a good place, but at times it can also be really nasty and bad people can often take advantage of people who can't resist them in really vile ways. This is my attempt to look out for people who need to hear this. Look after yourself, folks. And if you can, look after people who need you to do it for them.",1,autism

Their antlers pierced the moon. They know I'm aware. They stalk. They tap against the glass, they test the wood of the home. I don't know if the deer are after me.

I cannot fathom dreaming of them again.

The third
""The web is a trap. A site is a desecration. Being lost is a mutilation""


The fourth page.  Before this. I open my gallery, select a random image and it's a picture of my saturn light. In all of it's aesthetic glory. Then I realize. 
""Aug 14th, that was the closest saturn was to earth this year""
The next page
I picked a random photo again. This time of a tree in fog I took nearly a year ago. I sketch it out. It looks like a branched antler. I panic.
Next page
""July 29, 21.""
This time, I recall pulling up a video I had took on that same date, tonight I realize it's all coming together. Are the deer protecting me?

The next page 
""The windows are to stay locked. Shut. Locked. All lights on. Keep a gun close. Shut all doors. Lock them. Pray often.""
The next page. A drawing that came from one line. A sunset over hills through a window, next to a door. The perspective is as if I'm standing down a hall. The door is to my right,  it would possibly open outwards. The window is facing the hills. The door is facing against the wall adjacent the window. 
I scrawled ""fall into the sky"" next to it. Followed by a crude scribble armature. I can't pick out any details other than it looking humanoid.  
Next page. An eye I drew. Trying to avoid the thoughts
The page after that. A disturbing scrawl. It's ss if someone had no face, with a beak or some pyramid replacing all details. The neck is inhuman. Stretched. 
The next two pages are just recreations of the last two, in reverse.

Glowing white deer. One spoke to me. I can't remember what it said. I think it said ""come child, it will all be okay"" I heard a shuffle to my right. Eyes, shot open. I can't look away from my phone as I type. Fear in my heart. I can't help it. I just need to be heard. To not be forgotten. My story seems made up, but this truly did happen. I don't know if I'm losing my mind but I'm scared. The fear is engrossing. Wrapping around my heart like a venomous serpent.

I'm sorry to those who have read this -- I don't mean to increase your own fears. Worries and desperations. The world will think we're crazy. Maybe we are. Or maybe we're right. That's what it's all about. Paranoia is a gut feeling, a primal need to be scared, at a more advanced level. A conception made by man to make it seem wrong to not be worried about the unknown. What you don't know, you can't fight back. 

Please god. Let me be free from this heinous brain torture.  It's an unfathomable sensory overload. My eyes dart. My heart races.

I apologize. Everyone.",5,paranoia
"I‚Äôve been off & on ADHD meds for about 14 years now. First Concerta, then Adderall. I started Adderall again about a year ago when I realized my depression was caused by the constant stress caused by my inability to stay focused & follow things through to completion.

I started at 10mg xr for four months, that was working really well. Decided with my psych to move up to 15mg xr, took that for 8 months. 

Then the lovely shortage started. Around this time my psych & I noticed I could benefit from an increase in dosage. We were aiming for 20mg. With the availability that turned into 20mg one month, 25mg the next, 15mg after that, 15mg XR with a 5mg IR the next. Dextro here, amphetamine here. 

It may not seem like much but the 5-10mg difference from month to month is driving me crazy. I miss the stability of the same dosage each day, each month. I know it‚Äôs lucky to get any of an Rx these days but wow it‚Äôs hard when my brain feels so many different levels all the time.",3,adhd
"Edit: skip to the end if u don‚Äôt mind just answering a couple general questions.

Hi guys, I‚Äôm 19 and had my first psychotic episode last may during finals week from a combination of my adderall prescription, weed and stress. It was a terrifying 4 months. For the first half, I was manic believing I was telepathic with my d1 hockey dorm neighbor. For the second half, I was paranoid shitless that he hired a hit man to kill me because he was tired of hearing me. 

For 4 months, I kept hearing voices despite months of different medications. I was declared treatment resistant but Electroconvulsive therapy eliminated the voices completely. I was diagnosed with schizo affective disorder somewhere in that period

I stayed clear of all drugs but when I returned back to UW Madison this January, I started using weed and alcohol daily until I heard an external voice while riding my bike on campus. It sounded like a person talking about me within hearing distance but I turned my head and no one was there. This was my only psychotic symptom but scared me enough to stop weed completely(still sober from weed and plan to for decades). I heard external voices like this every 5 minutes but only while I was outside. It lasted for a couple days after last smoking weed then it went away. Then for midterms, I decided to buy a few adderall as I figured I‚Äôd be fine since I stopped weed. I combined this with little sleep and i heard external voices while outside for a few days then it stopped(exact same features as post weed). This was my only psychotic symptom as far as I know. Does this mean I‚Äôm close to a full blown psychotic episode? 


I haven‚Äôt heard an external voice in a couple months. But after my midterms, I noticed that EVERYTIME I thought about what someone is thinking of me, I heard the sentence I think they‚Äôre saying as loud as my internal monologue. Currently, those internal voices have decreased to a level im comfortable with. That level is around imagining someone else‚Äôs thoughts as half sentences and half non sentences(or a feeling). Please try this quickly by thinking of something you did recently that impacted someone and let me know if what you think they‚Äôre thinking is in sentences or non sentences? 



I have an addictive personality but have managed to decrease my alcohol consumption from 20 to 10 drinks per week since the emergence of these voices I experienced. Is this level of drinking likely to cause another episode eventually? and how long would you estimate it would take the average person? I currently don‚Äôt have any psychotic symptoms so I also plan to take 20mg xr adderall 4 times per semester(early, though, so my sleep isn‚Äôt effected). If this is dangerous in your eyes, I can definitely be persuaded to not take it to study for finals this week as Im not stressed about failing. I plan on limited by drug use to adderall and alcohol. If alcohol+adderall or just alcohol are the only drugs you use, what amount do you use if you have you been successful in not having another break? Last question: do second psychotic episodes generally have the same features as the first? 

I would appreciate any insight on your experiences with even one of my questions or any general advice you have for me. If you have any questions for me, I‚Äôd be happy to answer in detail. We‚Äôre all in this together.

PS: The only medical professional I have access to is a nurse practicioner who only knows enough about schizophrenia to prescribe meds and google doesn‚Äôt answer any of my questions

Edit: I realize now the drug related questions differ vastly from person to person. But would someone mind PLEASE answering the question about internal voices? I‚Äôm going to be very active on this subreddit on this throwaway, helping and contributing whenever I can",6,schizophrenia

"I grew up in the hood, I grew up being taught about death, gangs, loveless marriage. I never knew what happiness was. I spent everyday of my life wishing death on myself barricaded in my room because I was hated. I kept myself alive with daydreams believing I could have something more one day I fought hard I clawed my way up I put myself through hell held my head up high through discrimination, sexual abuse, let boss‚Äôs believe they had a chance just so I could have a possible future; I did this until it stopped working. My high end life came with a cost which was my soul. I was living in San Francisco being verbally abused by a meth addict, I was abducted and raped by a Lyft driver that got covered up by the company, I was used by socialites for image appearances until there was nothing left inside me. I slept in bed everyday barricading myself once again then I got fired while I was trying to work through it. My mental health issues ruined the job I had to let a boss touch my thigh for. I went back to the valley with family and it‚Äôs great I remembered I had a soul but I can see the damage in my sisters life how her upbringing affected her. We were ruined. Our father a liar and a cheater. Our mother who stayed for a better lifestyle. They abused us and now we are all the same. Disasters.

"One of my dad‚Äôs most noticeable autistic traits is that he can‚Äôt stop talking, and he doesn‚Äôt realize when people aren‚Äôt paying attention or aren‚Äôt engaged in his conversation‚Ä¶ So he‚Äôll just keep talking.

"I'm going to give context, so it's going to be a little longer. Sorry.

I'm 28 years old, I love photos and movies since I was 10 years old. I learned to edit videos at 12, I started creating videos at the same age. My first YouTube video was in 2006, and the idea of YouTube and exposing it to the world was amazing to me.

I went to film school where I learned to be a filmmaker, while taking all the Journalism classes (photojournalism).

Leaving college, I started working in the field of marketing, since my country doesn't give a damn about national artistic production and the only types of films are the same comedy scripts. I focused mainly on working with brands and companies, to be able to deal with less EGO (dealing with money is easier than with people's egos). I've been working in marketing ever since, and it's had its ups and downs.

But my dream has always been to work with cinema. I love to tell stories, I love to create, and I need to let my imagination go, otherwise I get very depressed.

So in 2018 I decided to move to Germany even though I had never left my country or even spoken another language IRL. I started working hard, doing 16 hours of work every day of the week. I saved enough money to move and I came to Germany in August/2019. I started working here and gently paved my way until covid happened.

Between 2020 and today, a lot has happened: an abusive/manipulative relationship that destroyed my self-image; 2 months in psychiatric hospital; I broke my elbow; ended my relationship; I lost my home;

Since last year things have been more stable. I have a new house, with my pets, I started dating my best friend. I started to find myself again. What I like to do, what I like to wear, what I like to create (things my last relationship took away from me).

And this year I felt it was time to get back to pursuing my dreams and passions in filmmaking.

&#x200B;

**And here we come to the point of this post:**

&#x200B;

I just can't do what I've dreamed of my whole life.

Not for lack of skill or knowledge, but for lack of social ability. I can mask enough to work full time, but I suck at networking.

Like, HORRIBLE HORRIBLE at networking with new people

&#x200B;

And that's 80% of what's needed.

&#x200B;

I reached the point of thinking it would be easier to become famous through the internet. And now I'm 72 days into posting regularly on Instagram and YouTube. Going out, filming, create, plan, posting. For a little recognition and a lot of frustration (algorithms, people hating for no reason, no reach, much shitter content blowing, etc).

You might say it's only 72 days. But for me it's much more than that. It's years. It's a change of continent.

I feel like I'm banging my head against the wall (metaphoric) every day because I can't do a simple networking task. And even doing photo-shoots is very difficult, because the need to interact with new people all the time, giving instructions and being friendly. When I try to do it, I feel so frozen, it's like forgetting everything I know. And this is so frustrating.  


I don't know what do to anymore, because I'm tired and frustrated. I can't go further. But at the same time I don't like to give up. Photo and film are part of myself, my personality, my hobby, my job, my passion. I'm overwhelmed by my feelings, by the situation, without being able to get out of this, to find my way out, and how to overcome. I overthink everything and spend hours and hours trying to find solutions. Meanwhile the only thing that I get is a lower life quality because the constant anxiety crises.

"Please be patient while reading. 

I have been an introvert since childhood. But I was a happy introvert. I had a good friend circle, I was confident, I was getting straight As and I even had a healthy relationship. 

I had a brutal breakup, family issues, academic failure and covid isolation all in the same year (2020-2021). 

I slipped into depression. It was very bad. I isolated myself and cut people off from my life (everyone). I lost all my self confidence. I didn't utter more than a few words in 2021-2022. 

I came to college in 2022 August. I faced a lot of discomfort interacting with new people, making new friends and I again isolated myself. I rarely talked to anybody. Although after a lot of constructive introspection and self-care I managed to get better and I brought myself out of that depression. I regained the motivation. 

But even now I can't ""talk"" to people. I am confused whether it's in my nature that I don't like ""talking"" or that I have just become worse in expressing my thoughts. My friends go out in groups a lot while I just sit in my room studying or watching something. I can talk for hours if it's business or academic related, I can express my idea clearly and just when the discussion about the project is over, I will stop interacting at all. 

I am worried it's going to cost me potential friendships. Or relationships. I want to talk. But I don't know how. And I have tried talking, I sometimes talk with my best friend (whom I reconnected with just a few months ago) for an hour or two. So is it about me being uncomfortable around new people or something else?

I have no idea what exactly I am asking here; maybe it's that am I in trouble, is it going to be very problematic in future, what can I do to improve my situation here, is this normal, any other advice will help.",2,depression

Not knowing when this feeling ends or if it ends at all scares me",2,depression
"I finally opened up to someone about what I been going through, I've been really concerned about opening up to someone about things cause I worry they'll use it to take advantage of me or become afraid of me suddenly.  But it went well and felt really good being able to finally talk to someone.

I feel like it would have been helpful to have a concise term for people not experiencing schizophrenia when I was sharing stuff with them though.  I've heard people use something like Neurotypical or something for people who don't have A.S.D.  I tried googling stuff but couldn't find the right search terms to get something useful.  Anyone familiar with a word that would scratch that itch? Or if you want to take a swing at minting a new word lemme hear it!

And just to reiterate:  Absolutely not looking for anything mean-spirited

"My Kitty (named Kitty, by my grandfather) is the only pet I‚Äôve ever had. She is very very old for a cat (20yrs +) and will die eventually, and probably soon. 

She is the last thing I have left of my two grandparents who have passed. She has lived in so many houses, met so many loving people, and been taken care of to the absolute complete extent of my ability. I love her so much, she has been my true and only best friend my entire life, and I recently came to realize that in times of abuse and fear where I was helpless (and even times of happiness but where I had no one to share it with), she was there. She could have even been in the room when some things happened to me. This has helped me cope with those traumas, and helped me feel strong. 

She will die someday and soon. I don‚Äôt know how. But I analyze her every behavior, I check if she is breathing every single time I see her across the room. It keeps me awake at night looking for her again and again to check, it makes my heart race when I‚Äôm not home with her. I have a stomachache 12 hours a day wondering about it. This has gone on for years. 

It‚Äôs all consuming, stressful, to a terrible point where I fear I‚Äôll be relieved when she does pass, and that is somehow worse. How can I accept the possibility and truth that she will pass, and how can I know I will be able to handle it right when she does? I haven‚Äôt lost a pet in 19 years. 

TL;DR: How do I accept the truth that my elderly cat will die, and stop letting the crippling anticipation of it take away from my life?",4,anxiety

So I have really bad trust issues I've come to distance myself with most people but I had meet someone who was always honest with me never let me hear what I wanted to hear always 100 with you and I'm currently in a relationship with her and my trust for people is slowly coming back but we were at a outside mall looking at the movies wondering if we should watch one and I had sent her to go get tickets I don't like standing in lines to open so I put my back to a tree just in case some was trying to sneak up and for some reason I was convinced I had to look out that someone was out there or someone was planning something maybe not to me but I had to be prepared need a quick way out something close I can use to fight somewhere for cover and I hadn't realized she was coming back from the getting tickets and she saw me I had never really showed my true emotion on my face only thing that you could tell is if I was happy, bored or disgusted but apparently she had seen the paranoia on my face I had never shown emotion like that and called me out for it asking if I was okay that I look paranoid and it made me realize the amount of paranoia I had she brought to my attention that the whole time we were there I had kept looking over my shoulder glancing never getting to close to people and just tensed up that the only time I had been relaxed is when we were alone away from people and it made me realize anytime I go somewhere I'm always worrying that some one is going to pull something to the point were I dislike going out in public and I'm always planing just in case so I felt like I should probably talk about it doing it mostly for her",5,paranoia

"Hello,

I am curious about what I am experiencing. I have been diagnosed with PTSD but I question this diagnosis, as I do not experience flashbacks, intrusive memories, etc. What I do experience, periodically, is high sensitivity under certain states.

This could mean that yes, fireworks, loud vehicles and so on alarm me. However I also have been convinced at times someone will break into my apartment at night, that someone will follow me or attack me while walking from my car, or even that someone is following me while I am driving if they take the same roads.

Lately I've been worried my doctors have given me sugar pills and that they do not believe me about my health related symptoms. I am on lamotrigine (for MDD and PTSD) and I am on levothyroxine (for thyroid, mostly controlled). I almost stopped taking these meds. I am almost at the point of ghosting my medication professionals (I have this habit).

I am worried my former best friend may be stalking me online, so I keep creating new reddit accounts to try and remain anonymous. I still have the feeling I am being tracked. I continuously worry about my phone/search history being monitored.

My doctors first told me I am bipolar, now I am apparently not. Fine. I don't want to be bipolar. Honestly I feel like selling almost everything I own, taking off, cutting contact with everyone and finding a way to live in the woods. I hate society and I know I could build someone for myself.

"I'm no good at anything. There's nothing special, unique or original about me. I don't offer anything to anyone, I have no talents, no skills, no hobbies, no interests or prospects and am super boring to be around. I am the most boring and uninteresting person imaginable.

Nobody knows me. I have only two friends. One thinks I'm Iron Man and that I'm an unstoppable force domineering life. He's never met the raging, on/off drug addict, borderline abusive me. He doesn't know me. My other friend is better than me in every way. He's smarter, stronger, more talented, funnier, more charismatic and more respected than me and never lets me forget it. He treats me like shit. Mocking everything I say and do, never letting me finish a sentence, rubbing in my failures, making sure I know how much better he is than me. I never thought I'd say it about a friend this close but I fucking hate him.

I give and give and get nothing in return from any of my friends I've made over the years. They all just abandon me at their earliest convenience. The friends I actually do like don't like me and the ones I hate stick around forever.

Most of all, I want love. I didn't like the only girlfriend I've had, she was too quiet and even more reserved and awkward than I was. We were very cold and distant from each other. While the girls I did like were indifferent to me and sometimes seemed to hate me. One in particular that I worked with a year ago sticks out to me. She was my idea of perfect, she was so beautiful, sweet (even to me), intelligent and made me happy. I wanted to tell her how I felt, I wanted hold her and love her or at the very least ask her out and get to know her even better. But fear of rejection got the better of me and before I knew it, she moved three states away.

The only pleasure I get now is escaping into fantasy and imagining what life could have been like if I actually gave a shit. I know I'm young (20) but I'm so ill-equipped for this world that it would inevitably chew me up and spit me out. I already flunked out of college and got fired from my last job.

"I have a diary entry from the age of eleven talking about how much I wanted to die. I'm nineteen now, and not a day goes by that I don't regret not ending it sooner. 

I go to a good school, but I'm not overly passionate about my major, but then again I'm not really passionate about anything. I have a generally great family, and am upper middle class. I had a mostly good upbringing too; I only doubt my mother's love sometimes. So there's really nothing I can complain about.

I just am so lonely a lot of the time. I don't have a best friend. There's always someone better to hang out with. I'm a good person, I think, but there's always someone better. One of my friends comes to visit sometimes, but ditches me after an hour to hang out with her other friends in the area, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't cry all the way back to my dorm. I find myself doing dishes at other people's places, baking them things, giving them gifts, desperate to feel wanted and kept around. But there's no one with whom I've really ""clicked"" with, and certainly no one who actually reaches out to me. One of them even forgot my birthday. All of my friendships feel so superficial. I don't add anything to my family or my relationships. I feel like if I just disappear, it won't even be a blip in the radar.

Like I said, I've been sad for almost longer than I've been alive. I don't even know what's holding me back at this point. Why haven't I ended it? I'm not diagnosed; in fact, I don't even know who my doctor is. I just keep everything inside. And I have some friends who have gotten help for it and are better off for it, and I can't help but compare myself to them. One of them cried in bed for days, dropped out of school. For some reason, I just power through. I cry myself to sleep and hide behind long sleeves but I'm still functional. I shower, I get passing grades, I pull my head out of my ass and attend class and study and exercise, but I still feel so empty at the end of the day. Like all of it was in vain. I want to be like my friends who got help, but I don't know who to talk to (again, I don't know my doctor). I can't talk to my friends, because frankly, none of them actually *care* about how I feel when I would move mountains for them. I cried for hours when I realized that no one will ever care about me as much as I care for them. 

I feel like I'm a lost cause, honestly. Like the only way I'll get help is an un-alive attempt. I've gotten this far without help, like, do I even need it? Maybe I'm faking this all for the odd chance that someone asks how I'm really doing.",2,depression

I'm 45, Male. Going through what I'm sure countless others are going through. But it sucks more when it's YOU. This ""story"" will probably jump around a bit. Sorry about that, I'll try to keep it short.   
  
Been married 20 years, no kids. I'd say I have a happy life for the most part, great wife, great dogs, a few good friends. Full time job, as well as a small  
DJ/Entertainment business. Sure, things could always be better, but I'm doing ok. The problem? I've never been more miserable. Why? ... I don't know. It's been getting progressively worse for the last 10 years at least, maybe 15? But why? Is this the beginning of a ""mid-life"" crisis? There are plenty of reasons to be happy. But I am not, & honestly can't remember the last time I was.  
  
I had goals. I have achieved some, and still have some more that might never be realized. I've slowly given up on most of them. We won't get into what they actually are, it doesn't matter. It seems the last twenty years or so, have been spent treading water for the most part. Just getting by. BUT, I'm getting by. That's a good thing. I consider myself kinda smart, I've had many ideas for side hustles etc. Nothing ever sticks. It's probably my OWN fault. Could be undiagnosed ADHD? When I was young, that was never a thing. Point is, I want more. Maybe that's part of the problem, I'm never happy enough. People say be grateful for what you have, and believe me, I am. But...  
  
My wife and I have both dealt with pretty severe health issues for years. Me, diabetic for over 20 years, on insulin. This has led to multiple foot problems. But, thankfully, they all seem fixed. I had 2 foot surgeries last year. Everything seems good now. Other than the diabetes, I'm pretty healthy. Chubby, but healthy. She's doing good too, despite her struggles. These are good things. I should be happy.   
  
I SAY I'm healthy, but AM I? The Docs say ""For the most part, your doing pretty good. Ya need to quit smoking though"". My problem is ME. I don't love how my life has gone. I see friends and acquaintances doing (what looks like) so much better. Thriving small businesses, nice houses, shops, etc. I've been working toward the same thing for years,..and nothing. Also, no real vision of how to get it done. (the shop part at least, credit sucks due to medical bills) My Dad passed away when I was a year old, so none of that cool fatherly advice, or help. This is NOT a pitty party for me, I don't want that. Just pointing out facts. I also had big dreams involving music. None of which came anywhere close to true. I'm a drummer, not in a band currently. I've thought seriously about selling everything. The full DJ trailer, the drums, everything. I'm from a small town, so not much out there anymore. I don't know what I'd do without an outlet for music. But I don't know what to do WITH it either.   
  
But it's not ALL doom and gloom. I have a modest house, and small garage that we own. Also, no credit cards. These are good things.   
  
But, I'm still generally miserable.   
  
I used to be over 350 lbs. and my body has taken a hit because of it. My ankles, knees, feet, back etc. always hurt. I drink a little, nothing too bad. Six or so when I mow the yard etc. pretty normal stuff for any guy really. I've tried the jazz lettuce. I like it. May have to get a medical card, since I can do that here in Ohio. I have a somewhat stressful job. So does the wife, we're both in Management. I work all week, then the weekends are either DJ gigs, or doing work around the house/yard. Currently, the wife is off work due to hip surgery (she's almost better), my truck is broken, lawnmower is broken, house needs some small repairs. Not enough money or time to fix everything. I know it sounds like I'm just bitching, and I am. BUT, back to my original question. What do you do? I know I'm not the only one. 

I used to have dreams. Now I just foresee more of the same until I die. I see NO reason to care, try, or plan for the future. I have no one to talk to about this stuff and no way to make sense of anything. It's not like I'm suicidal, but I've seen enough. I don't care what happens. I wouldn't kill myself, it would be terrible for my wife, mother, even dogs. But then that means I'm just living for them, not me. I'm just so over it, and I don't see any way out.

"I feel numb all the time

I always worry about what people think about me and how anxiety makes me look 

I have a constant stream of negative thought

I start hating how i currently think and feel
and look

Feel horrible about myself

Hypotheticals and anxious intrusive thoughts that make me feel grief 

Paranoia and fear/disgust of myself

Hating all aspects of myself

Acting extremely anxious

Hyper awareness of present anxiety

Feeling like I died already 

Feel extremes amounts of mental pain and chronic sadness for my own existence 

I have OCD

It‚Äôs about everything I‚Äôm into and feel like I enjoy: making yt playlists and refreshing till a video gets privated so I can remove it or replace. and checking social media followers on ig and Twitter to see when someone unfollows or deactivates their account. 

Starts hating my current thoughts 

Starts feeling like I hate myself and the way I move/act/look

Feel existential grief all the time 

Felt like my life was already over at one point 

Don‚Äôt know how to feel or what to do

Don‚Äôt even know if I sound right right now

Cling to an irrational dream everyday 

Feel like my therapists and close relatives don‚Äôt understand me

Feel like I don‚Äôt know or understand myself 

Feel like I‚Äôm acting weird or odd or strange

Feel like my mind is fucked up and that I am permanently broken

Starts acting in an insane hypothetical anxiety that I will embarrass myself and ruin my life forever 

Don‚Äôt know what these feelings mean

Don‚Äôt know how to fix myself

Have had intrusive thoughts of me ending myself and the timelines it would cause 

Chronic embarrassment and shame all the time for my past present and future

Feel like this is all sad and mock worthy

Think about death all the time 

Hate myself for all these things too 

I‚Äôm lost

Feel paranoid about everything 

Feel on edge

Feel like I don‚Äôt relate to anyone

Feel like a weird loser 

Don‚Äôt understand my thoughts, feelings, and emotions.

Horrible anxiety about myself and identity

Believe I am a goner

Feel like a slave to my thoughts 

Feel bad about myself 

Feel like people notice and start judging at how weird I act

Constantly try to plan what I say and feel horrible for how I currently think

Feel horrible about how I currently act 

Constantly fixate on my past and current behaviors 

Always ruminate 24/7

Always react extensively to intrusive thoughts 

Anxiously react to everything

Chronically ashamed of everything I do and comparing myself to others

No confidence and telling myself things will go bad

Confused about what all these mean

Feel like to my core I‚Äôm a loser 

Anticipating bad and embarrassing things 

Feel like a slave to my anxiety and that I have no control of anything 

Constantly fall into pits of SI

Don‚Äôt know whether the intrusive thoughts are me or not

Feels morbid and dark in my mind all the time",4,anxiety
"Ok, so I know all of these are coincidences but I still feel a slight anxiety over it. It seems like if I interact with a celebrity‚Äôs work or say certain things about a celebrity they... die? The most recent example was I complained that people would be disrespectful to Prince Phillip when he died and a few hours later we had the newsflash. Other times would be when I have watched films or listened to songs, etc. Someone involved would pass away. I obviously know I‚Äôm not causing these but how do I cope with the anxiety that comes with when this happens? I feel so irrational but I can‚Äôt help it.

Also I‚Äôm not really sure if this is the right sub for this so if it‚Äôs not just feel free to remove it x",5,paranoia
"That‚Äôs all I feel. Every day of my life. Every minimal action that ever occurs around me just reminds me what a waste of a human being I am. I can‚Äôt seem to do anything good.

It‚Äôs a poison that‚Äôs killing me every day. The fact that I will never be as good at anything as my peers. The fact that I won‚Äôt ever achieve anything great.

"Why is this? I don't want to be at work but the thought of going home is worse. I will just go for a walk so I don't have to go home. What's at home? Eat some food, scroll on my phone, read a book, sleep? Wtf, it feels so empty and boring. I don't enjoy music anymore. I barely enjoy my hobbies anymore. I don't enjoy going to my favourite places anymore. I like being alone so I know it's not about wanting company. If I had an all expense paid luxury vacation I'd feel the same. If I had a mansion with house cleaners and all the groceries I want it would be the same. If I didn't have to work it would be the same. I feel uncomfortable at existing. If I let my distracting thoughts stop for one second I start crying. I don't really want to die and I'm scared to die but it feels like I'm incompatible with life. Like I'm having an allergic reaction to it all the time. I feel less real than everyone else. I want to disappear without it hurting or doing it myself. I want someone to shoot and kill me while I sleep.",2,depression
"Hey guys.

I have been struggling with depressive thoughts for about 3 years. It all started because of a girl, but since then it's evolved.

Ever since I turned 18 I have more and more frequently been turning to drinking to cope with my problems. I'm drunk as I'm writing this, and would love to stop. The problem is that I frankly enjoy being drunk. 

As a 20 y/o man, struggling with alcoholism isn't that much of a problem in my close one's eyes. I don't tell them why I drink. We party and have fun, and they don't recognize that I have a problem. 

As a coping mechanism, however, it doesn't work long term. I'm fine in the moment, but when I wake up I'm just as miserable as I was the day before. My therapist says I should find ways to stop, but hasn't really given me clear cut advice.

If you are like me, by all means stop drinking. I wish I'd never started, but life got in the way. The whole point of this post is sharing my experience, not necessarily seeking advice.",2,depression

Idk, I know there definitely are people like that but I don't think it's normal or healthy that I do this with virtually everyone including my parents and family. I can hardly think of anyone that I've ever known who I didn't have these fears around. It's just instinct for me to assume the person in front of me is malicious and callous.

"I am 21 years old Italian, nearly 22, and i've got these type of thoughts since I was like 10, but always ignored them, but sometimes they always return. And now, I just can't think of avoiding them. I didn't, and still don't know what to do with my life. I have ADHD and probably developed through depression some personality disorder, but having ADHD and growing tired and bored with things kinda fast, I just can't work, between being in a office, working 6 days out of 7 like my mother does, I prefer die. The only thing that can bring me joy, are gaming, but I guess with the many people doing it, the little pubblic being Italian gives, and being shy/depressed myself, that can't turn in to a job; the other thing is art. I went to an art high-school, and I had a wonderful time, finding friends and teachers that I liked, even if sometimes it was rough, and there was Covid in the middle of everything, I knew it was worth it. Then, nearly a year ago, it ended. I didn't found anything beyond it, I didn't know how to be an artist, all my friends were too far away, not even in the near cities, I didn't know what do to with my life. I thought I could get that figured out in time, while I attended an art university, but has since passed a year, I still don't know what to do, and everything that teached me university is pointless, nothing I can't find on the most basic of the YT channels. 

For all my life, people said I was wrong. My jokes, my look, my face, the round of my face, my beard, my body, ironic that somehow I even got called fat for a bit of time at school, without ever being, I'm now 1.70 tall with 60 kg, at least depression never put me in a condition to always eat. Now, I'm thinking, they were right, not for the reasons they gave me, of course, but I am wrong, I can't find my place in the world. Even if I quit university, what's in then for me? Finding a job that I'm going to hate and quit? Waiting to become a famous artist while playing tons of videogames? Very recently I'm starting to wish that when I go to sleep, I don't want to wake up. Being by IA taking control over night, being by WW3 starting over night, being by a thief, even by some magical portal with monsters, even by a zombie outrage over night. Because, in the end, I'm so wrong I can't even put up with the solution  to my problem I've found. Maybe, not the best of solutions, but a solution nonetheless.",2,depression

"When the black dog comes, 
you don't hear it arrive.
One minute your happy,
Not a care in the world.
The next moment he is there. 
His tail all waggy,
He wants to play.

You play fetch with your mood,
He runs around with it, from high to low,
Bringing it back you feel quite good
But the dog wants his ball
So you throw it away
Just for him to play with
Feeling negative all day.

You play tug with a rope
Pulling your thoughts all over
Shame he is a strong dog. Not like the rest 
What was fact is now fiction
You question everything.
Pulling on the rope you do your best,  
Such a strong g black dog.

Then there's the stick, he loves it so much,
Knawing at your insecurities
Stripping away who you are bit by bit
Till you question who you are.
A strong tree, reduced to saw wood
By the big, black dog.

When the day is done, all you want is to sleep.
So worn out by the big black dog. You are.
But tomorrow you awake, knowing you have to play with him again. 
It's exhausting. I wish the dog would go home.
But I am his home. And he'll be here again, day after day.
Maybe if I coukd just have some more sleep, I'll one day be okay.",2,depression

"Its always dark roads, or something that screams horror movie vibes that make me feel unreal. Was binging the Halloween movies to basically stalk the stalker Michael Myers. Unfortunately it did get to me a little bit today, went to the park and deciding for my future health to leave the park I was at when it started raining was better then getting drenched and sick. Taking the route I always take I got a little spooked by a cat, laughing it off I continued cause the rain seemed to be getting heavier and I was still about 20 minutes from home. The cat had my heart racing just a little bit and the rain mixed with occasional bursts of thunder drowned out the sound of cars and talking people I passed.

I waited incase he was waiting on me, and I watched him cross the street a few more blocks down and dissapear into the dark street.

"I just want to start by saying I don't really feel that my life has been terrible as far as it goes, but I can't help but feel like nothing ever quite went the way I hoped it would. I turned 30 recently and the realization about where I'm really at hit me like a truck. I don't have many happy memories from childhood up until I was about 23-24 years old because everything I did had the shadow of my parents looming overhead. They fought a lot as long as I can remember and wanted to control my every move. My dad is addicted to pills because of a problem that caused him a lot of pain. My mom had a heart attack when I was 13 that couched her indefinitely because she was too afraid to move. When my brother passed away everything in the house got worse. Every conversation became about death and loss. All of their expectations crashed down on me and I was intimately aware of how short I fell of them. I got bullied a lot in school up until I got expelled. I just sat in my room, never really left except to get weed and then I just smoked and wasted time until I could go back to sleep, the one time I wasn't looking over my shoulder.  I missed everything from the ""golden years"" of high school, and I miss everything now because being in uncontrollable social situations fills me with dread. Now I'm dealing with my own daily physical pain from a vague condition my doctors can't pinpoint. The sole saving grace in my life is my wonderful partner. I love her, but I feel more and more every day that I'm robbing her of a fulfilling life because of the demons in my heart that I can never seem to grapple with. It's always one step forward, two steps back. I can't ever finish what I set out to do because there's a titanic fear of failure on my back. What the fuck do you do when you feel like you can't change anything, but you hate damn near everything about the life you wasted all by yourself?

"Hi, I'm(21yo) currently very desperate. The desperation just exploded with my bachelor thesis. Even though I almost have it (only a few details are missing and a few sentences from my conclusion) my consultant is away(work trip) till the due date and 99% can't check it and approve it. Right now I am trying to finish it in tears...

Anyway, I have gf (19yo) for almost 2 years, she is a very good student finishing grammar school, and we decided a long time ago to send applications to really good universities in Denmark and possibly build our future there. But since I might not defend my bc thesis and finish my current university I can not go there. I will extremely piss off my parents and also my gf.

My current university became very stressful for me after the coronavirus lockdown (I had 3 semesters online from my bedroom) I couldn't find many friends. Recently I started crying regularly on my drives back home from the uni. The economics and business mngmt programme I study is kinda interesting to me but for my entire life, I haven't found an area or someone/something I want to become. In Denmark, I chose UI/UX and content creation since I have been goofing in cracked Adobe Photoshop and Premiere throughout my life. And for the past 1.5 years, I have been actively coding html css and did a little online product catalogs for a little company from: styling the products -> photographing -> editing -> putting them online. So I guess this should be my point of interest. 

And here comes my recent indecisiveness. I have trouble getting up in the mornings, I lack motivation. I can't plan my routine. I am acting very lost and frightened in public. I feel extreme pressure to finish my current uni, go to Denmark, accommodate in Denmark, and live there. It's not only this, my gf is not pushing me into anything, she is actually very nice and supportive. But the most pressure I feel is that I disappoint all the people who know me because I become in their eyes the guy who achieved nothing, prolonged his studies, or didn't even finish them...
Sometimes I wonder why she is still with me when I can't come up with nice dates and we only spend time at my place watching movies alone.

I can't get anything done. I start but never finish any work or assignments. My head is constantly spinning between I'm a failure and suddenly it wonders to how many things I could do, that I should go run every morning, study 4 hours a day, write every single line from my lectures, start a business... And I'm the failure cause stopped attending the lectures, procrastinated at the end of the semester, and wrote the thesis very late. But I couldn't persuade myself to do it. Now I don't even know what I want from my life, I'm not sure of anything... This is the indecisiveness I mentioned before.

And now I am a wreck sitting in my room as I do most of the time nowadays. I look out to all the successful former classmates from grammar school or friends building their careers and compare to them. The worst thing is that it shows that I do nothing. My parents see me in my room lying in bed, playing guitar, etc  -> simply procrastinsting and not studying. But I really can't focus on the studies. And I see that the time has been wasted which now eats me inside out on top the my current mood.

I also started thinking about what it would be like to kill yourself. Cause I want the burning pressure to stop when it gets serious sometimes. I remembered, a few years ago having a mental health lecture at grammar school and they asked if we have suicidal thoughts and that it is a bad thing and a lot of people might have them. I thought to myself, that I must be very lucky to have never actually thought about it. But here I am with the thought somewhere deep back inside my mind.

Sorry for my poor phrasing and grammar.
It really helped writting this.",2,depression
"I was on Lexapro several months ago and one night for no reason I woke up and had a horrible panic attack. I had never had a panic attack before so this feeling was completely new to me. I didn‚Äôt know what it was at first. I thought something was seriously wrong. After that I felt like I never really felt the same. That following week I had another really bad panic attack and I had to be put on hydroxyzine which really helped because I felt in a constant state of panic everyday. 

I switched off of Lexapro shortly after thinking that is why I had the panic attacks. I then went onto Zoloft. I had previously been taking hydroxyzine before bed every night in fear that I would wake up having a panic attack again. I finally tried not taking it during the night and found I would wake up with increased anxiety for no reason. So i would take some hydroxyzine and I would usually be able to calm myself down eventually. 

A few months later I felt like Zoloft just wasn‚Äôt doing anything for me so now I am on Effexor. I‚Äôve been on it for a few months now on 75mg. To be honest I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs working or not. I don‚Äôt want to go off of it and realize that it was helping. But Im worried that if I go on a high dose it will mess me up like the Lexapro did. 

I still sometimes feel that increased anxiety waking up if I don‚Äôt take hydroxyzine. I‚Äôm wondering if that is the meds causing this, or if it‚Äôs because of that one panic attack I had that triggered something in me to just feel completely different after that point on.",4,anxiety

"I (M,22) have been diagnosed with panic disease a couple months ago, since then something really went wrong inside me.

I had my first panic attack, when I was 18 by smoking weed with my friends. I was in an insanely bad shape, cuz my gf just  broke up with me, so when we were smoking, I had a panic attack. 
Since then I‚Äôm not finding back to myself.
I have extreme depersonalization, derealisations, which makes my joyful life really tough. I have been to many many psychologists without any success. I recently started seeing a psychiatrist, so I had antidepressants prescribed. Since I started taking Scippa, an SSRI for about 3-4 weeks now, my life really went for a downfall. I feel incredibly stressed, nervous all the time. I am unable to desensitize myself or to even leave our home ( I live with my mom, she is a huge supporter of mine) since a week now. I don‚Äôt want anybody to sort out my problems, just want to hear some helpful thoughts,suggestions, ideas what should I try.

"My family doesn't try to get me to visit or go out anymore. I haven't had a friend in about 5 years now, with the exception of maybe my boyfriends friends, who probably would have nothing to do with me if I wasn't dating my partner. Even my partner is giving up on trying to get me to go out. I just need a push, I know its inconvenient for other people to have to push me, but its the only way I go out. I am so overwhelmed every minute of my days that thinking about doing something is just too much and freaks me out. It has to be at least somewhat planned, like a couple hours ahead minimum. Whenever my boyfriend goes out with friends, they just text him wyd and then 20 mins later they're out doing stuff. I cannot do that.

I feel so empty. I feel like I literally only exist to make money for the business I work for.

 No one would care if I died. It amazes me how there are some people whose passing would affect an entire community like a tsunami, yet I feel my passing would not even make a tiny splash, a drop, even. Some people would be sad, but they would not grieve. There would be no one to grieve, as no one really knows who I am. My gravestone would never be adorned in flowers. The grass would grow tall, as no foot traffic would pass over, and yet again, I would be invisible. 

My partner would have no one to talk about me with when I am gone. He is the only one. People would try and sympathize, maybe mention softly how shy I was, or how I had a hound dog, but they would never be able to talk about ME.

When my parents pass, I will have no one to go to and grieve. I will be alone in my sorrow and emptiness as the last people I felt truly connected to leave, and I will live with the guilt on my shoulders from not talking enough, not visiting enough.

I am convinced that if my body and mind were not so used up by the corporate job and the capitalist world, maybe then I could make connections. Be someone. But for now, ill let myself continue to erode until everyone leaves. I have no energy left after the day anyways.

I feel obliged to add the positives before I end my post. I at least have an extremely dedicated, loving, supportive partner. I think the love we have is truly one in a million and he does know me inside and out. I think people could go through hundreds of lifetimes before experiencing the kind of love we have. He is why I am alive, though I don't tell him that. I pretend to be strong and I pretend well. When I cry, its just because of a bad day at work, or stress is what I tell him. It doesn't make a difference, as long as I have him. I am financially okay. I wish I was doing better, because I know without help I wouldn't even be able to afford my own food, but I'm stable right now.

"Hi there,

I have been living with paranoia for all of my life.

Even before entering nursery school I can remember not being able to sleep because when I closed my eyes I felt like I was being watched.

A key memory of mine was in primary school where I sometimes ran to school as fast as I could because I was able to see shadow creatures far behind me when I moved my head quick enough. Even though it was exhausting it was better than the fear of being followed.

Over time it got worse enough that in secondary school I didn't go to school for a week because I the creatures were getting closer. Almost breaking of the intense fear the creatures just stopped appearing and I went on as if nothing happened.

Through secondary school I started to have moments where the creatures appeared again and over time the frequency started to increase. I was in school acting like usual and suddenly freezing, internally screaming and barely able to breath while a creature stands besides me, barely visible and terrorizing me with its gaze.

I thought often about telling someone about my issues with imaginary monsters but I didn't trust a single person and was scared to appear like a clown so I just lied when someone noticed it. I also considered suicide multiple times and I'm glad I never went through with it.

At some point when I was 20, covid had started, this state was permanent again and made me quit work, I hid in my room below my blanked. I only survived thanks to my roommate paying rent and giving me bread and water. (True MVP here)

I am only able to rely on my roomates telling as most of memories of that time are very blurry and dominated by extreme fear but I remember that I somehow started to actively suppress it. As suppressing it was very demanding I used weed to calm my mind while searching for other solutions and then I had a weird idea while being high.

By recognizing their existence (looking at them) which makes them look real (they usually were shadow/fog like) I got used to it and realized a few days ago that no matter how close they are, they just exist and can't be a danger to me.

&#x200B;

Currently I'm sitting in my room while a bunch of humanoid creatures are watching me which gives me a weird feeling of assurance and well-being, occasionally I look at them in awe for what my mind is able to create. I may struggle a bit with trusting others but that's something I just have to work on.

Is that a good way to accept my paranoia or do I sound insane? I honestly don't know but I'm generally more happy than ever.

Thank you very much for reading and it's very relieving to have written down what has been on my mind for a very long time.",5,paranoia

The feeling was unexpected, I didn't mind it though. Having real emotion for the first time in a long time kick me in the face. I can not explain what was happening because it was too much to handle at all. I hardly slept after I got home and just stared at the ceiling and let my emotions control every horrible thought that crossed my brain.

"Even since I watched a show with a telepath 8 or so years ago I‚Äôve been unable to shake the idea that people can read my mind. I can‚Äôt stop censoring myself and justifying things in my own mind because I feel like other people can hear my thoughts, even when I‚Äôm completely alone.

"I work a retail job as a parking lot attendant. I had gotten my work done, so I stood by one of the entrances. A customer was in the road calling over to me. I didn‚Äôt understand him so I asked what he said, he held up his cigarette and I thought he said ‚Äúis this alright‚Äù as in ‚Äúis it okay if I smoke out here‚Äù to which I said yes. He started walking towards me and I realized he actually said ‚Äúyou got a light‚Äù asking if I had a lighter. I asked him if that was what he said, and he said yes. I apologized and told him I misunderstood him and I didn‚Äôt have a lighter. He said ‚Äúyou trying to play me out?‚Äù I asked what he meant and he said ‚Äúyou said you had a lighter and you don‚Äôt‚Äù. I told him it was a misunderstanding, but since I‚Äôve never had a confrontation like this at work, ‚Äúi thought you said is this alright‚Äù came out as ‚ÄúI thought you asked if I was alright‚Äù which makes no sense. 

He walked away and I stood there for a few more minutes. I didn‚Äôt feel safe anymore so I went into the building and walked around a little bit. I went back to working thinking he was just passing by, but he was still outside the store. I passed him again and apologized to him again and walked away. 

I walked back into the store and passed by the entrance I was standing by and saw that he was standing there on the phone.

"I remember being upset at the playground whenever someone left the swing swinging after they got off it. I needed it to sit still otherwise I was anxious.

If my mom ran over the cord when vacuuming, I would scream and cry. This was terrifying to me. I still feel like vacuuming is uncomfortable for me today and I hate when the cord is in danger of becoming caught or rolled over.

My older brother had a computer game that taught you about the human body - what a skeleton was, what hands were, what an eye was. When it showed an eye opening, it made this creaky opening sound effect that caused so much terror in me that I had to run to the other side of the house and close my ears. My brother would sometimes repeat it to mess with me. 

I guess I'm saying this because I don't really understand where these fears come from. Or what they might indicate about me. I often don't remember these small terrors I used to have and I'm sweaty typing about them. 

Today I live with an ever present feeling of wrongness in the pit of my stomach and hypervigilance of my surroundings. My eyes scan things quickly and I find myself becoming quickly fatigued when they dart around back and forth too quickly. I find that I'm very good at competitive games where awareness and reactivity are a strong suit. I'm excellent at my career and fast on a computer, but it is a double edged sword as my brain overheats (sometimes physically, it feels like) as it takes too much information in.

I was playing the new Zelda game, and while those games are generally enjoyable to me, walking through vast environments with numerous paths and options available to me at once is incredibly exhausting. I need to walk through every nook and cranny and find every collectible before I can move further, and my eyes are constantly scanning and looking for hidden things. It's incredibly fatiguing. On top of this, there's a voice telling me I need to be doing something else, but I can never figure out what that is. I can't just sit down and enjoy something. 

So yeah, I think I just needed to say some of this stuff. I don't really know why any of this is the way it is for me, but sometimes I forget the reasons *why* I'm anxious and it's all just a confusing abstract jumble. So I turned my thoughts into words this time.",4,anxiety

28 yo female. I have a lot going for me. I have a healthy relationship, a chill dog, I just finished my second semester of college (better late than never, right?) but I‚Äôm really really struggling. 

I‚Äôm fortunate in that I don‚Äôt go through every day feeling sad. I‚Äôll have episodes of sadness but they‚Äôre short-lived. I don‚Äôt feel overwhelming happy but content, I guess. My main issue is just a lack of motivation particularly when it comes to work. I need to find a new job because every time I get a job, I don‚Äôt want to go into work. I think of those 8 hours and what else I could be doing like sitting on my ass watching tv or smoking weed so I‚Äôll choose to do that stuff instead of working so I‚Äôm not making any money and I just don‚Äôt care. Someone on Reddit mentioned this could be a depression symptom. Anybody else experience this?

I love my partner but he does not understand mental health so while he feels bad for me, he does not offer productive advice and I just end up keeping everything to myself.

All I ever wanted to do was be a musician (I play drums for a couple of metal bands) but instead I got caught up trying to live life according to what my parents wanted and ended up here for my PG degree that I've severely fucked up because of my no interest in academics. I'm now left with the crippling doubt of whether I'm going to be eligible to get my degree or not and if I don't, I'm going to be neck deep in debt (30L INR). I've been dating this girl from back at home for the last 7 years and while she's nice, I don't want to spend the rest of my life with her but again, too much familial pressure which means I've to marry and her and I'm fucked because I've cheated on her multiple times while I've been away here in the UK. I've basically fucked up my entire life up to this point and I've thought about offing myself a bunch of times now and all I do is just do drugs and get drunk and I'm lonely as fuck, someone please tell me there's a way out of this without completely burning all the bridges in my life.",2,depression

"Hi, im new here and im having a hard time rn with an obsessive fear (don't wanna talk about it). I don't know if im paranoid or something but it was always a thing i asked myself in the back of my head. I remember when i was little, my mum would go out of the house to take care of our garden (to hot the day to do it), and i was absolutely terrified that she would disappear in anyway, the more common fear about that that i had was about aliens abductions (i feel stupid writing thst down) or just the fact that it was not her but someone or something else that took her appearance (same with the rest of my family when they go back from outside, i just automatically think it might not be them. I even do it my my pets, i tell them stuff like ""i know its not you"" and all, i even try to test their normal behaviour.

Another time i remember when i got out of school waiting for my mum to pick me up, i had the sudden fear that everyone, EVERYONE, was not real, they were robots, i could've stand that my loved ones might be too, then the fear went away for most of the time.

I also have this fear of behing spyed on with everything, phone, spy cam, people. I was so scared of that, that i didn't go outside for a long time.

Now back to present, im scared right now, i wonder if i could just take a lorazepam to try and calm that down but i dont have any prescription for it and im scared what it would do if i take one, but i also just want it to stop hurting for the night",5,paranoia

"What the title says. I love learning. I like science and geography and I'm obsessed with history. I love textbooks and documentaries, taking notes and writing essays and always having facts to tell people. I don't mind sounding like a nerd - I really, really like learning. But that's why it makes me so sad and frustrated and angry that I failed school. I officially dropped out about a year ago but I haven't attended since S3 (9th grade). I hate that my school ruined my education. I'm so smart and I'm capable and I really WANTED to learn, but they refused to accommodate me or listen to me or treat me like a human being and now I'm fucked with no qualifications and no idea what to do with my life. I don't know if it's wrong to blame them, but I tried my best - like really, really tried - and they shot me down every time. Yeah, other disabled students do learn from home, but you don't need that. And yeah, other disabled students do get support, but you don't need that either. Your meltdowns and panic attacks are just overreactions. Though we're constantly saying you're capable and full of potential, we won't let you take the exam because you won't pass. It doesn't matter that you studied at home - if you wanted to study at home, you should have asked to do home learning. Oh, you did ask us and we refused? That's because you're not disabled enough for home learning. But you're too disabled to take the exam. None of it makes any sense. I know I couldn't have passed my math or my English, but I studied every damn word in 3 different History textbooks and I know for a FACT that I would have passed that exam. I just wanted one qualification in the thing I love and they denied me that. And if they'd let me do online learning like a few others did, I know I could have passed other classes too. For the few months we did online learning for COVID, I did really well.

School sucks for everyone, I get it, but neurotypical people get to complain that algebra is useless and the cafeteria has terrible food and they don't want to take English for 4 years. I just wanted them to consider my needs for 5 minutes instead of brushing me off for years until they presented the choice: ""Attend every class full time or drop out at 15"". Why are those my only choices? That's not fucking fair. Who are they to decide who's autistic enough for support? I'm fucking autistic. I shouldn't have to look like this image of autism they have in their head just to be treated with the empathy everyone else gets. 

I don't want to sound... ungrateful? I know I'm more privileged than a lot of other people are. I'm just so frustrated that I have all this wasted potential that I know I could have fulfilled if they'd let me.",1,autism

"Last night I helped one of my best friends get into a relationship with someone who I actually had feelings for. I was going to make progress but unfortunately, she saw my friend as her soulmate. I‚Äôm glad that they are together considering my friend has never been a relationship. I‚Äôve been heartbroken for years, she managed to put it all together for me, then I handed to her and went to my friend.  I‚Äôm now heartless.

I helped many of my friends that got into a relationship, some of them are even married. I haven‚Äôt been in a relationship in 7 years and that was my only time in one, and it ended off so terribly that it‚Äôs stuck with me to this very day. Thanks to that, i have depression and a shit ton of anxiety. 

To others, they see me as a great friend with the best advice. But what I think is that they think I‚Äôm very weird and very socially awkward. Truth is, I am, and I don‚Äôt think I will ever be like a normal person ever again after that relationship. I put on a face for others that, I hope, will make them smile and laugh. I always ask them how‚Äôs your day? or how are you? And are you doing well? I feel like whenever those questions are turned to me, it‚Äôs all false sympathy to me. 

All this time, I have never took care of myself mentally in the last 5 years. It‚Äôs draining and taxing my entire lifestyle. I‚Äôve lost all interest in hobbies and even looking for a relationship since that‚Äôll turn into me begging for love, and I know that‚Äôs not how a relationship works.

I was criticized slightly and everyone was tense as it was busy. I felt so scatter brained and hopeless, I just had to get outta there. I‚Äôm going back and thought it over.

For reference, i went through my university's accessibility center and talked to a specialist there and also a doctor at the student health center, and did all the interviews, questionnaires and such for the dx process. It's not like i just went to google and did a five minute ""do i have adhd quiz"".


Everytime my parents bring up adhd, they never mention it by name, as if acknowledging makes it something demonic or something. It's always ""are you still taking ""the medicine"".""


You would think that my parents would be happy that I've been doing better in school since starting meds and therapy, and that several of the issues I have had in the past 10 years or so have been able to be managed as a result of managing previously undiagnosed adhd.


Instead I'm being told that it's not real and that it's all in my head abd that I'm doing this for attention.


I'm not very open about my adhd, but a few of my friends here at uni have said that they noticed a positive change between me now and me last year, and i feel so much better than then.
I'm at the happiest I've been in a long time, and a big part of that has been learning how to manage adhd. I don't want to go through the emotions of the past several years again. 


It just hurts so much that the two people whonare supposed to care about me the most are being so dismissive of something that had unknowingly been causing so many problems for so long, and now that I'm learning to take care of myself, it's like they don't care.


I know I'm an adult, and that others opinion's shouldn't matter, but it really hurts when it comes from your own parents. I try so hard to do well in school and at work, but it feels like nothing is good enough for them.


It feels stupid to be crying over this but it just hurts so much when I can't go to my own parents about these issues because I'll just get told to get over myself.",3,adhd

What is genuinely good about life? Why do people not allow assisted suicide for those who can't do this anymore?
Like, I will never be any use to this world  because all I can do is art. I am mentally AND physically ill person, I can't do any useful job. I can't earn decent amount of money to live on my own with just doing art. There are countless people that do art better than me, and that's okay. I will forever be alone because of my mental illness, and that's understandable too. My home country is destroyed by war and the country i ran away to is now involved in another war, so I don't even have a place to call home anymore.

"Hello.. It‚Äôs my first time using this app to ask for advice because I seriously do not know what to do. I‚Äôm a sister (20) who has a little sister (16). My little sister is diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder and was doing therapy session and taking antidepressants. She was doing so well for 2 months after she decided to stop her medication. She stopped it without consulting her therapist. I didn‚Äôt realise this until she started withdrawing heavily from it.
She is currently feeling really sad and having mood swings. The thing that triggers her withdrawal symptoms is her being at school.

These past few weeks, she had a difficulty waking up to go to school and my mother gets mad at this. She wouldn‚Äôt wake up when my mom is trying to wake her up. She would groan and doesn‚Äôt get up. My mom (58) gets pissed because she cares about my sister‚Äôs education and feels like she would fail as a mother if she doesn‚Äôt have her daughter continue school.
My mother is also diagnosed with depression but takes her medication
however, I don‚Äôt think she understands what my sister is going through and can say things that I‚Äôm sure she doesn‚Äôt mean to.

I‚Äôm honestly really scared on what my sister is going to do.

She used to self-harm too but now she is doing it again..
she is also having suicidal thoughts and I‚Äôm worried she might take action.

What can I do to make her feel better but still proceed to going to school 
I know that it‚Äôs best for someone who has depression and having withdrawals to stay at home and heal better
but it is also an issue if she falls behind in her classes 
The school doesn‚Äôt seem to care either about it. I live in the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and mental health is not cared about in high school.
So I genuinely do not know what to do.

The plan so far is that she is booked again to see her therapist but it is next week and idk what i should at the moment.

"So much of what i see, especially on the internet, but even outside of the intenret, is my own internal experience, memories, and associations, reflected back at me through other experiences, things, names, and people.  its awful.

Some days i honestly feel like how Mal felt in inception, or how Truman felt in the Truman show when he realized everyone was keeping him in the dark and that his life was just a play.

I'm afraid of these feelings affecting others, but this is really how i feel about my own life and its scary to me.

My brain seems to spin narratives out of nothing, where i feel overconnected to the sounds my neighbor makes, and even find myself subconsciously going to the bathroom at the same time as them, only to find out after hearing them flush while im in the bathroom, and its like what they're doing is a reaction to what i am thinking. same with the (loud and annoying) cars outside my window, and of course i just HAVE to live on the bottom floor by a busy street, its like my parents did this to me on purpose, for revenge on me living with them insufferably for years after dropping out of college. even tho i know thats not how they think they feel, i think that's how they feel sometimes, and they wont admit it, but who am i to say how they feel, despite them gaslighting me and me gaslighting them.  so fucked up

it happens with the TV too, feeling like my brain is having a conversation with the TV itself. i know that's ""hallmark paranoid thinking"" but as long as im aware of it, im ""still in the prodrome"" or whatever. i know i need psychiatric help and that's what im getting, but i want to be able to pull myself out of this way my brain works without meds, because i have had really bad experiences with meds and they scare me more than this does.

and yet sometimes when normal life feels less real than this, i really dont know what to make of it, and i dont know what to do.

it doesn't help that i'm really socially isolated, and yet people trying to encourage me to be more social, while not offering up themselves as a social person to be social with, just makes it feel like their help is really misplaced.   doesnt help that because i was socially isolated before getting a job, i tried to force friendships on people i ultimately didnt even want to be friends with and was probly honestly not a good ""match"" for them because i projected what i thought they were onto them, based on appearances and past friendships.

on a different note, i can't believe this is how my life has gone, i had friendships in high school and college, but those were before i came out as trans, and in retrospect, those friendships weren't that deep because i was always acting and being someone i truly wasn't. but since those memories are real, and since the fucked up person i am today is really detached and dissociated, that person i used to be feels like the realest me i have, even tho back then it felt like i was repressed. so now i feel like im trying to find my old self just to get to my new self and its all traumatic.",5,paranoia

I'm really close to going back to the mental hospital just to get my ativan refilled because I'm having panic attacks like crazy and it's making it impossible to do anything and I feel suicidal and hopeless. I have to get a job and take observed drug tests for probation and both give me really bad fear, the latter from childhood sexual trauma.

Because I have addiction on my record am I never going to have a chance of feeling better?

I've tried every single anti anxiety medication except for benzos and lyrica; basically they don't want to try any controlled substances.

"A bit of information: I am a 23 y/o trans man, currently living with a friend *(we share a room)* and their family, a grandmother and a sister. I *have* been diagnosed with general anxiety, but no paranoid disorders.  


So, I've always thought I was... Decently paranoid. Like, everyone gets those thoughts sometimes, y'know? I figured it was normal enough, just a brain doing its thing. Maybe the thoughts were a bit irrational, but that was nothing to worry about.  


Recently, I was talking with my friend *(not sure how the conversation got here)* about how sometimes, I have to check that they're breathing, because I'm afraid they've died and I hadn't noticed. And because I tend to ramble, of course I went on talking about how I worry the others in the house have died in their rooms, and how the kitchen windows freak me out at night because I'm sure there will be someone there, etc etc. My friend then simply told me that those thoughts aren't normal, especially not that frequently.   


I'd never really considered myself to be any more paranoid than the average person. But now, I notice those thoughts really do plague me often, even if they're completely irrational, like believing someone might be hiding in the crawl space above the laundry room. Today, I had a full blown anxiety attack because my friend was gone, their grandmother had no idea where they had even left, adamant they were still home a minute ago, and they hadn't answered my text. I had to scour the whole house to make sure they hadn't collapsed somewhere. When I didn't find anything, the rational thought is just that they've gone out and they're fine. But then I began to panic that they'd still collapsed somewhere, it just wasn't in the house. I wasn't able to calm down until I called them and found out they'd just gone out for lunch.

&#x200B;

I don't know for sure if any of this is genuine paranoia, or just my anxiety acting up in a weird way. I've been talking with my friend about some of the thoughts when they come up *(I told them about my panic today),* but I don't actually know if that's helpful or hurtful to me. Paranoid schizophrenia runs in my family, so I don't know if maybe this is something I should be properly worried about. Any thoughts or advice or even similar experiences would be nice to hear.

"Sorry for the long story!

I broke up with my long-term girlfriend around a year ago. Tried to split amicably; we lived together so I had to stay there for almost a month before I could move to a new place (it took a while because I had moved halfway across the country to be with her, and was now moving back of course). She got a bit mean that month at times, but otherwise we were both coping well with the split and managed to live next to each other until I moved out (at least, that's what I thought).

Her parents, however, are a totally different story. Ironically, the had always supported my side in the argument that led to our breakup, but strongly freaked out at me when I decided it was finally too much and broke up with their daughter. Unlike her daughter, they coped very badly and were seemingly much more depressed and angry than either me or my ex.

Then weird things happened in the month I was there. First they suddenly were seemingly friendly to me again (maybe they hoped for reconciliation?) and even invited me for dinner at their house for one last time. After said (unremarkable) dinner they turned semi-hostile again. I later found out that when I was out the whole day to sign the contract for my new apartment (as I said, quite far away), they tried to break in (they had a spare key because they owned the apartment and we were renting it) knowing I was not there. When I later confronted them, they said they only wanted to do so to make a video recording of the whole place and avoid discussions about possible damage due to me moving out later on. They didn't actually manage to do it because I was coming home earlier than expected, and instead had their daughter film everything and send it to them. I actually would have agreed to them just coming over to do so (I understand that they want to protect their property and would take accountability if necessary), but doing all of this behind my back left me feeling deceited. I kept my calm to avoid further conflict, but started growing suspicious obviously.

I should add that these are extremely over-protective people. They‚Äôd literally make the university homework of their daughter while she was out having fun. They'd write mails for her in her name. They‚Äôd text her all the time and would panic if she didn‚Äôt reply within an hour (she‚Äôs almost 30 btw). Stuff like that (I know, should have run away immediately at those red flags).

Then, I got mislead again. In that month we still did grocery shopping together, and my ex told me she wanted to go to the shop close to where her parents live to buy some fish (because it's cheaper there). Said shop was closed when we arrived (no way her parents didn‚Äôt know). But since we were there, she briefly wanted to go to her parents for some other reason I don‚Äôt even remember. When we got there, her parents handed me a contract that they asked me to sign. It stated arrangements for me leaving the apartment (ok, I get that), but also stipulated that it was my decision to break up, that I should be responsible for cancelling mutual accounts, that I‚Äôll be accountable for any damage bla bla. Anyway, I adjusted/scratched some of those ridiculous agreements in there and signed to avoid apartment-related disagreements later on. I mean, I get that something had to be put on paper about the apartment, but her parents making this ‚Äúbreakup form‚Äù for her and all of the other stuff in there was just ridiculous. Oh, I later also found that even after me signing that contract (and leaving a pretty obvious agreement about cancelling/dividing all mutual possessions in there), they called the bank where my ex and I had a mutual account to make sure I wasn't hiding (stealing?) anything...

At that point, my suspicion turned into fear, and I did something I should normally not do to avoid any further surprises being plotted behind my back. My ex has an Apple Watch, we she often leaves at home when she is out working. Knowing that she frequently texts her mother, I started reading those texts on her watch when she was out (only those, didn't want to know what else she was writing to friends etc.). In those texts I learned how they had indeed been scheming together to sneak in when we would both be out and so on. I also learned that despite them acting friendly / concerned about me again, they were secretly cheering in those texts whenever I had some bad fortune coming my way (e.g., when I was having trouble getting the utility companies registered at my new address, when my 76-year old grandmother caught COVID, ...). They'd literally put a heart emoji on those messages, but then the next day her mother would call me to offer her help packing my boxes because ""it's not good for my back"" (I do indeed have back issues from time to time); felt super creepy because I obviously knew by then that all of that expressed concern and friendliness was fake. Of course I had to pretend everything was fine (couldn't let her know I was reading those texts with her mother), but inside I felt sick; especially considering that just a few months ago I went to her mother's place every day for an entire month and worked from there  (I was working from home during COVID) to take care of her because she had broken her shoulder and needed assistance. There are a few other things they lied about (and did) that month, mostly minor/childish things that I just tried to ignore.

Anyway, her mother being a total snake, and my ex at the very least playing along with it, did make it much easier for me to realise breaking up was absolutely the right decision. I was so looking forward to the day I was moving out to finally have these kind of people out of my life for good. Her father, however, is a different story. He got very angry and shouted at me the day we broke up, then pretty much remained completely quiet throughout the entire month. To be honest, I was so focused on the scheming mother that I didn't pay much attention to him. To sketch a picture of the man: he's a rich and highly intelligent doctor, but at the same time also a very isolated, introvert (and honestly, frustrated) person. He has no friends that I know of (as in, during the 4 year relationship with my ex he never met with any friends that I know of) and is very unhappy in his marriage (without going into further detail, there is at the very least frequent verbal abuse between him and his wife; they never divorced ""because of the kids"", my ex even told me herself). His wife also blurted out one time that he was dealing with some sexual frustrations (really didn't need to know that). He suffers from intense paranoia too; he would for instance sometimes leave his cellphone at home when going for a walk (especially during COVID restrictions), because otherwise government authorities could triangulate his cellphone signal and track his position. Perhaps this paranoia was also the reason for the contract, recording my apartment, calling my bank, changing the locks of the apartment the same day I moved out (yes, they did that, despite them being the ones previously plotting to abuse their key to my apartment...). I don't know. I know that, a few months before our breakup, he for instance got a pretty serious letter from the police following a complaint from one of his patients. Really don't know what to think of that now. Other than that, I actually liked him because he was always nice to me (before the breakup), had many interests (art/travelling/cooking/...) and could have a deep conversation with you instead of just chit-chat (once you did get him talking). Again, a very smart person I actually looked up to in some ways. On the other hand, I found it hard to gauge his character for all of the above reasons.

Getting to the point: a few weeks after I had moved out, I started having some weird medical issues. It started with some mild aching pain around my testicles, and without going into too much detail (sorry if TMI already), I suddenly also developed sexual dysfunctions I didn't have before. Now, there is also pain in my foot, making even simple walks uncomfortable. Doctors have no clue what's going on (after multiple MRI/CT screenings of my back and pelvis, blood work and so on). Seems to be some weird inexplicable nerve issues, despite me testing negative for all common causes (diabetes etc.) for such issues. Things are also gradually getting worse, and over the last few months the fact that it's not going away is starting to affect me mentally as well (which of course makes doctors think now that ""it's all in my head""). I started panicking, and researching myself what could be wrong. Similar to the doctors I had consulted with, I couldn't find an answer.

Then, an idea started bothering me: I had just gotten out of the strangest, most suspicious month of my life (with people scheming behind my back, and me probably knowing only half of it through the texts I had read), followed just a few weeks later by the most suspicious medical issues I've ever encountered. What if that's not a coincidence? These people clearly had bad intentions set out for me; what if they went as far as to poison me? They have the means to do so (him being a doctor and having full access to any prescription medication/chemical), the motivation (knowing what they had already done ...), potentially the history (the suspicious police letter a few months earlier), their totally weird/suspicious behaviour, and honestly they also have the social isolation and mental instability necessary to be capable of doing such things. Continuing my research, there are indeed drugs/chemicals causing symptoms such as mine that are extremely long acting (sometimes persistent for years) and can be administered both orally (and I had dinner there after our breakup) or topically (they had access to my apartment, and could have put it into any of my bathroom products). I have since thrown out everything (shampoos, douche gels, toothpaste, hair products, perfumes, olive oil, ...) I had taken with me when I moved out there.

Initially. this idea seemed way too unlikely to me; but honestly, as months have gone by without any other explanation, and as I really can't judge these people properly (and I can't just ask them; I know they are excellent liars and I have been fooled by them before!), I am starting to consider it more and more as a possibility, and lately even reality. It's making me so scared that I even contacted a toxicologist for an extensive blood screening (which costed me quite a bit), but they couldn't really help me out (as it may no longer be detectable in my blood). For the last two months I have been having constant nightmares about these people (not my ex even, just her parents!) and what they might have done to me. I wake up in panic, sweating, heart racing and not knowing what to do. It seems impossible to ever know what really happened, and I just fail to rationalise that this could not have happened.  I'm started to have panic attacks throughout the day. I'm truly \*constantly\* thinking about this, making me basically unable to enjoy anything anymore. I fear that I'll never get a full answer, while at the same time living like this in a constant state of anxiety is unbearable and driving me to some dark thoughts ... and it's not getting any better as time goes by, that's clear. Never had any mental issues before. I'm hesitant to seek psychological help, because that would only help calm me down about my fears, until they get me to believe this didn't happen, hence fooling me twice in the case it really did happen (a possibility that can't be excluded)!

Again, sorry for the long wall of text. Even if nobody reads this, I hope writing all of it down for once will help me cope a bit better.",5,paranoia

"I honestly have no idea how to begin or if this will even read coherently but, 

I have social anxiety, it‚Äôs the type that causes irrational overthinking of social situations, panic and usually the immense urge to run away and hide. 

My issue relates to real life interactions and video game interactions (I‚Äôm a big gamer) I play games that are designed to be played with other people but yet I struggle to do so because the idea of using a microphone and talking to other people causes me to panic

In real life however I‚Äôve basically become an isolationist. I‚Äôve not seen any friends for years, I hardly ever leave the house. I lost my job during the early days of covid and haven‚Äôt had the confidence to go back out there and get another, which in turn has only made the anxiety worse. I overanalyse everything, every person I walk past could be a threat to me. I even cut my own hair because going to a hair dressers and having to make idle conversation would make me want to run. 

All of this originates back to when I was in school (I‚Äôm 24 now) I was bullied terribly, never had many if any friends.

This is compounded by part of my family instilling in me the ‚Äúget on with it‚Äù attitude, they have little to no sympathy for mental health issues and call it weakness. Being raised around this has caused me to keep my issues to myself, again adding to the problem. 

I live in the UK and have tried several times to get a doctors appointment but I‚Äôve not been successful due to waiting lists and such. Also the thought of having to say all of this to someone‚Äôs face makes me feel very fearful

I‚Äôve allowed my person appearance to slip, i don‚Äôt look after myself as well as I should and sometimes getting out of bed feels like the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done. 

I guess what I‚Äôm asking for is advice or just to know I‚Äôm not the only one feeling like this, because it seems like everyone around me has an abundance of confidence.

I pretend to be oblivious. I don't want to remember what happened to me again. I just want to be free. Free from pain, free from suffering. I don't go out, I don't do anything. I'm just a shell. I was born nothing and I'll die nothing. I don't want my parents or siblings to have to take care of me in their old age and I want to free them from the burden. All I do is stim all day and smoke.

"This is fairly new to me but I‚Äôve been dealing with ongoing anxiety and panic disorder and am looking for some information from others who deal with the same that might help. 

In therapy today, after telling my therapist about a panic attack I had yesterday, she said it sounds like my nervous system is very unregulated and very much in ‚Äúfight‚Äù mode (in fight or flight). This is the first time I‚Äôve heard of this and have a few questions.

Is that something that happens in the moment or is it in a constant state of being unregulated?
Is there a way to regulate it again for good?
Do I need to rest and reset or keep pushing through and putting myself in uncomfortable situations? Feels like I shouldn‚Äôt avoid stuff but also feels like my body needs a break.
Is a panic attack an unregulated nervous system or is generalized anxiety? Or both?
Any success stories of those who used to be in constant ‚Äúfight‚Äù mode?

Any information helps, I just want to understand what‚Äôs going on and what I can do to feel better.",4,anxiety

"This is Buddy, he was my therapy bird, and emotional support animal. My grandma gave him to me when she went into the hospital for surgery to remove some cancer, worried that if something happened to her I would be alone. 
I got him when he was just under a year old, and he thought me so much about body language and indeed he made me feel like I had someone, especially after she passed away, I coddled Buddy like my baby. 
whenever I was upset he'd always crawl or fly up to me and fluff up just comforting me.
I ended up entering a relationship with someone who was unstable, I would clean his self inflicted wounds, watch as he physicality fought with freinds, but when he reacted violently towards his cat I had to end it. During the break up he threatened to set me on fire, and stole just about everything I had. 
I had severe problems after that, I had to move back in with my parents and couldn't really communicate what was going on, and when they started trying to change how I interacted with Buddy I started to shut down. 
They removed him from my room, got upset because he wouldn't shut up.. Really he was screeching because I wasn't around. 
And eventually they said I wasn't taking care of him to their standards and said I had to get rid of him. So he got rehomed to my sister and died less than 6 months later. 
It broke me...as John wick said ""[he] was an opportunity to greive unalone, and you stole that from me, killed that from me"" 
I miss him everyday.. And the place were staying doesn't allow animals.. And a therapy or emotional support animal isn't protected by the disability act.. 
He thought me about gasses, specifically Teflon, which made him sick and I had to rush him to a 24hour vet. 
He died when he was 6 years old.. 
The oldest cockatiel died when they were 30.
He could tell when I was anxious.. When I was stressed, angry..

"A little back story.
I have CPTSD that stems from intense childhood trauma. One thing that continues to get worse as I get older is the feeling that I am unsafe. Im a 24 yo female and the world around me feels so unsafe. Sometimes I feel unsafe even in my own home. I have nightmares often that I‚Äôm being hunted/chased and cant seem to rest even while I‚Äôm sleeping. 

I have a particular fear of men and dating/engaging with them. This has started to impact my daily life as I have become isolated and antisocial from this fear. When I do start to get close to someone I start having delusional and racing thoughts about how they will probably end up harming or killing me at some point. 

Keeping this in mind, Ive been really traumatized the past few months. In June I was at work reading through local news articles when a picture of a man popped up that I knew. I used to teach group fitness and this particular man took my classes and he would always come to class early to chat and hangout with the instructors. We added each other on snap and casually started chatting. He was working on a book and would have me proof read it and stuff of that nature.
I never got particularly close to him but we still were very friendly with each other and I would say that we were decent friends. Not really sure what ended up happening but we ended up out of touch. Fast forward to a few weeks before said new article was found, he ended up trying to re-add me on snap by name but I ended up denying it due to said paranoia about men. 
This guy ended up murdering his ex girlfriend and her friend in a parking lot before taking his own life. 
This obviously has been kinda disturbing to me because it plays into my main fears and paranoia. I am very analytical and self aware so normally with irrational fears I am able to reassure myself its just that, an irrational fear. But recently I don‚Äôt have that reassurance to give myself which has been distressing. 
I don‚Äôt really know how to work through this and it has started to impact my social functioning.
Any insight and advice is much appreciated.",5,paranoia

"I'm 19 years old and home for the summer from college. my dad and I never got along that well. we disagree on most things and we get into fights all the time. maybe hate is too strong of a word because we do get along sometimes but I feel like we are always at a constant battle. recently, I have not been doing well mentally and have been really unhappy. spending my hours laying in bed and not having the energy of doing anything. Last night my dad came into my room and started screaming at me for my room being messy, ruining Mother's Day because I did not leave my room, etc., and took my phone. He made me feel so shitty and I truly felt bad. when I get into these arguments I ""shut down"" and don't say anything because I think if I do say what's really on my mind he will contradict it and say that's not a reason. Today, I quit my job and began applying for new ones online on my computer.

I don't say anything throughout this whole thing which is making him even more mad. I can't remember all the things he said because I think I blocked it out. As he was yelling he puts his hand into a fist calling me a bitch and I yell ""Yeah Hit me"". He laughs and said ""You would like that wouldn't you"" and I ran into my bathroom and locked the door. I start having a panic attack and he says ""Let me see your tears"" like he wanted to see me cry. a few hours later he's talking to me like nothing happened but I'm still pissed. I'm I wrong to be upset? he does not understand what I am going through and called me mentally retarded for thinking I have depression or ADHD. I don't know what to do.

So I‚Äôm in a long term relationship (almost 3 years). About a year ago someone forced themselves on me. I obviously told my partner what happened. He was kind and took care of me and things have been great. I can‚Äôt get rid of my paranoia though. I find myself torn apart worrying about if this person will contact my partner and try to convince them I was disloyal or try to ruin my relationship. These thoughts control every day. I start hyperventilating and sobbing uncontrollably. I‚Äôve tried talking to my partner and he obviously tells me he would never believe the words of someone else. But still. What things can I do or tell myself to get past this? (I‚Äôm in therapy and have been for a long time. Just wanted some outside perspective maybe? Thank you.),5,paranoia

All these misfortunes and others that I haven‚Äôt named replay in my mind on top of not knowing my direction in life. I used to be extremely extraverted now I‚Äôm the opposite, it‚Äôs hard for me to answer people back, I don‚Äôt like going out anymore, even though I want companionship and I do want to be how I was but I‚Äôm just lost. I‚Äôve had a crazy life so far and I know I have alot more in store but I‚Äôm scared and I get sinister thoughts that start to take over me and a big part of it is not knowing my purpose or forgetting what my purpose is. I have two things in my life that I‚Äôve always loved and that I‚Äôm passionate about, but they‚Äôre not lucrative unfortunately.. those two things are watching movies/writing movie scripts and bodybuilding and dieting.

"I have diagnosed ADHD with multiple comormidities: major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, mood disorder with bipolar features (meaning I just barely don't meet the diagnostic criteria for bipolar 1 or 2), and stimulant abuse disorder (in remission). I haven't abused stimulants in 10+ years.

To spice things up, I also have a rare metabolic disorder - glutaric aciduria type 2 late onset. Google it if you want, but basically my body doesn't produce the necessary enzymes for me to properly metabolize fat. There is no cure, and the symptoms include exercise intolerance and extreme fatigue. The treatment is a high carbohydrate, low fat and low protein diet. I cannot go into a calorie deficit at all or I will start to metabolically decompensate, which means a hospital stay for fluids and monitoring. I've been hospitalized seven times since my initial diagnosis two years ago. I've also gained 20lbs.

I recently switched psychiatrists because the one I had been seeing for 12+ years has no expertise in metabolic disorders, and he's located two hours away. I was also having issues with the old psychiatrist re: stimulant meds. Non stimulant medication has never been effective for me. I've literally tried them all. I need supratherapeutic doses of medications like Concerta or Vyvanse to have any effect at all, and my old psychiatrist viewed that as drug-seeking behavior.

My new psychiatrist has been practicing at Massachusetts General Hospital for 25+ years, went to Harvard medical, and lectures at Yale. He's been doing academic research in the psychiatric presentation of digestive illnesses for the past 10+ years. After our first appointment two weeks ago, he took me off all my old meds (prozac, Seroquel) and put me on abilify, lamictal, and trazodone. No ADHD treatment at all due to history of drug seeking behavior (obviously he and the old psychiatrist talked, which I authorized). Since I've gone on these new meds, I am sleeping excessively - like I go to bed at midnight and don't wake up until 4pm the next day. I'm crying spontaneously with very little provocation. I can't take care of my toddler (thank God for our nanny), I've been unemployed for 8 months, and I can't perform the most basic tasks like showering, cleaning (thank God for the maids), and cooking dinner for our family. My poor husband is pulling all the weight, and I feel like such a failure. I just want my life back. I want to be the wife and mother my family deserves.

I have a second appointment with my new psychiatrist tomorrow morning and plan to share all of this with him. My husband (who is a primary care MD) went through the ASRS ADHD assessment with me and had me write down concrete examples for each question, as well as how it's affecting my life. Despite severe symptoms having tangible negative impacts on every aspect of my life, he strongly cautioned me against asking for stimulant meds due to my history. 

I completely broke down. My husband sees how bad I am and feels the consequences more than anyone, but even in his professional opinion, I shouldn't have access to the treatment I need because I abused it in my 20s.

I don't know what to do anymore and feel so helpless. If I can't get the treatment I need, what's the point? I don't want to live this life being a disappointment and a burden to everyone I care about.

"I have been feeling increasingly depressed for the past year and a half or so. I would say it got much worse after I was involved in an accident that was my fault around that time. No one was seriously hurt but I can‚Äôt seem to get myself to let it go. I think it like fundamentally changed how I view myself, and I think deep down I have some unpacking to do re: understanding that I can make mistakes and still be worthy of love and compassion.

I am trying my best to do the things that make me feel better. I make myself exercise for at least 40 minutes almost every day. I make myself go to bed early enough to get 7-8 hours of sleep. I take care of myself and try to eat healthy. I keep my space tidy and clean.

But like, doing that is all I can do. And it takes so much effort. I can barely get into my hobbies these days. I used to draw and paint weekly and now it‚Äôs like, maybe once every few months. I just end up feeling paralyzed and blank on what to draw. 

My job is very demanding and high-stress, for not much pay. I want to find a more fulfilling job, but I‚Äôm stuck in this like paralysis of feeling that every job will feel like this no matter what I do. And my skill set is so specialized, I feel like I don‚Äôt even know what else I could do. Every ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù job I see wants 3-5 years experience. 

I live at least a half hour from most of my friends, so I‚Äôve started feeling more and more socially isolated and lonely. They‚Äôre a more spontaneous crowd and tend to just meet up since they live so close, so I don‚Äôt get invited to things. I live with my boyfriend but he works odd hours and is tired and not always as romantic/affectionate as he used to be. He is also going through a tough time and doesn‚Äôt have the energy to do the extra stuff anymore. What sucks is just not feeling wanted. 

Every day I feel like I‚Äôm slowly drowning. My job feels like a dead end, my relationship is losing its spark, I don‚Äôt see many friends anymore, I don‚Äôt enjoy my hobbies anymore. My self-esteem is on life support. Every day I just wonder if this is it and I feel so empty and sad.

I haven‚Äôt told anyone how bad I‚Äôm feeling in a long time. My last therapist dropped me suddenly when she switched practices last year, and I always have such a hard time bringing myself to try again when I‚Äôve had shitty experiences in the past. I have suicidal thoughts most days, but I don‚Äôt really want to die. I think I just want to feel ok again, but my coping strategies are just not enough anymore.",2,depression
"Hye everyone. Hope you guys are well.  

I wanted some advice from some mature people. So here is my story:

In 2022 July I completed my graduation and got a job too. So a 20 years long struggle of my mother came to an end. During this time I also went through bad patches(depression and shame). But during the 4 year degree I didn't have time to get depressed since I got so busy in the excessive workload. After 2022 July, I started feeling lonely. Like it was very hard. But few months back I got a new roommate. He is a great company. 

Now out of no where when my brain realized that there is nothing bad in the present, lets bring back the bad memories of the past to ruin the present. Past memories are jumping in again and again which triggers my shame. So the incident(9 years old) which triggers my shame is linked with my mother and sister. The both don't even remember that incident or even if remember it, they are not bothered, neither they ever reminded me. They both love me a lot.But they both don't know that I am still carrying it. Also another thing is the thought that I am gonna die at the end. So why work so hard? 

So currently these two things are killing my motivation to study and do other productive stuff. I have wasted 2 weekends. 2 days ago I went to a therapist and he has prescribed escitalopram(10 mg) to me. However, I don't have any generic anxiety symptoms or suicidal thoughts. 

I am 26 and I think I should be fearless and on attack mode currently and try to live these years with full excitement and enthusiasm. But I don't know why my brain is teasing me.",2,depression

"I've been having a terrible time with paranoia, with this one really strong, terrifying certainty that everything in my life is connected and someone is doing it on purpose. For example, I'll be online and see the people I follow post a bunch of posts I don't really get, oh well no big deal. Then I listen to music on soundcloud, and find an amazing fansong for media I don't know, but I love it so I listen to it over and over. Then I'll talk to my penfriend and she tells me about this cool podcast she's been listening to, so I google it, and it turns out all the posts were about it, and the song was about it, and a bunch of things over a series of months are now all linked and it terrifies me. To be clear, I don't think that someone is making these things happen, it's more like they're deliberately moving them into my line of sight, deliberately drawing lines between them, like their making a web by connecting everything in my life. It's terrifying, it's like I'm the only thing in my life that *isn't* being puppeted, and I'm just trapped in the middle and I can't do anything to stop it. I don't feel like it all the time, but when it hits I can't get away from it. I don't know why they would be doing it, who they would be, how long they would have been doing it, I just know that they are, and it's so scary that nothing I see hear think or do is really my own choice, because they're deliberately putting things into my path. It's like a bunch of random stitches at random points in my life, and then I'll pull on a bit of unrelated thread and it will pull all the stitches in and I'll realise they've been waiting for ages for me to just move that thread.

Crippling indecision. Depressed people can be consumed by an overwhelming inability to make decisions. Everything is questioned right down to the granular level. This constant self-questioning and evaluating leaves the person paralysed and unable to function. For instance the depressed person might make a decision to take a shower. What follows next is a tsunami of questions ‚Äúshould I wait to later‚Äù ‚Äúwhat if I don‚Äôt have the energy‚Äù ‚Äúwhy do I need a shower anyhow I am not going anywhere?‚Äù This can literally play out for hours and hours until the sufferer finally says something along the lines of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù Needless to say this self-doubting will be followed by recrimination and more than likely self-hatred for being so weak, which in turn feeds the depression, an almost perfect vicious circle.  
Critical self-judgment. Depressed people don‚Äôt really see themselves as ill. They rarely give themselves that good a break. Instead they can very easily view their depression as a personal weakness they could overcome if they just tried hard enough. This train of thought is perpetuated by other people telling them to just snap out of it, or a thousand other platitudes they have heard a million times before. Instead of seeing this nonsense for what it really is they turn it internally and berate themselves for having a character flaw that doesn‚Äôt allow them to function like normal people. They don‚Äôt need other people to be judgmental as they are expert at doing it to themselves a thousand times worse.  
Interaction is painful. It‚Äôs something most people take for granted. Interaction, conversing and relating are things we mostly don‚Äôt have to think about. For someone suffering depression this natural ability can become excruciatingly difficult. In most instances we pull on a socially acceptable mask and pretend everything is fine. We are present but not really there if you know what I mean? We can be surrounded by people and feel painfully alone lost in the quicksand of depression. We are experts at hearing but not really listening. We are ninja warriors at the art of avoiding talking about how we are feeling. Everything is great and fine when in reality we are dying inside. While you are talking about how your day went we can be reliving the worst moments of ours and at the same time making sure you don‚Äôt see our pain.  
Fear of the future. Ask a depressed person what they think their future looks like and they will more than likely tell you ‚Äúmore of the same or worse‚Äù Depending on the severity of the depression a sufferer doesn‚Äôt see a future. A future is something other people have not them. Their future is the struggle they are going to have tomorrow morning when they wake up and think to themselves ‚Äúplease, not this again, I don‚Äôt think I can go on like this‚Äù We think about the future by comparing it to our past. It‚Äôs very difficult to imagine a nice future when all the evidence from the past is telling you it isn‚Äôt going to happen. For the vast majority of people a future is something they can feel optimistic about. For a depressed person it can feel like something to dread. Something filled with hopelessness and helplessness. Not living in the present is extremely common; it can feel like we are adrift in an ocean of misery and torment stuck in a no man‚Äôs land of despair and apathy. Once hope is lost, everything is lost.  
Even the good times can be bad. Imagine not even being happy at the birth of your child or in fact any landmark occasion that marks a supposedly joyous event in our lives. A chronically depressed person doesn‚Äôt have to imagine it. For millions of people this is a reality and is something that is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. Guilt and shame which feed the depression are experienced in equal measure. They know on a rational logical level they should be happy, unfortunately they have lost the ability. Their happiness has been replaced by numbness and indifference which they have seemingly no control over. I well remember when I was going through my own depression someone asking me what I would do if I won a million pounds. Without even having to think I said I would probably give it away as no amount of money could ever make me happy again. These are the depths a depressed mind can sink to.  
Observing not participating. There is a song from the movie midnight cowboy sung by Harry Nilsson that I think sums up depression beautifully. Here it is. ‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs talking at me, I don‚Äôt hear a word they‚Äôre saying only the echoes of my mind‚Äù. Severe depression is probably like having an out of body experience. You can see and hear everything happening around you but you are not part of it. It can feel very lonely and isolating to realise that you are a spectator to your own life. Your heart aches to be part of something that will make you feel like a human being again but your depressed mind is constantly telling you that this is for other people to experience, not you. Just like the song you literally do hear what everybody is saying but you are lost in mire of the echoes of your own mind. It can feel like you are living a life where the pause button is permanently pressed. A state of non-existing if you like.  
Dysfunctional relating and relationships. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the rate of breakups and divorces amongst people suffering depression is quite high. Relating to another human being requires motivation that is sadly lacking as they struggle with their illness. Maintaining relationships requires effort and energy both of which have been sucked out of them. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs because they have lost the ability to care and they feel powerless to do anything about it. When you don‚Äôt care if you live or die yourself it can be very difficult to care for someone else. They are trapped inside the prison of their own mind desperately hoping for someone or something to set them free. For a depressed person isolating themselves can be preferable to relating even though they absolutely know this is doing them real harm. A depressed mind doesn‚Äôt think rationally it will push away the very thing that could help them. It can see relationships as having very little consequence, even though the opposite is true, such is the contradictory nature of depression.  
Lack of autonomy. The most important thing to every human being on the planet is having a sense of autonomy or control over their lives. When depression comes into a person‚Äôs life that sense of control is taken away. Choices start to become very limited and the person‚Äôs world can become microscopic. In an effort to fill that emotional void many people turn to food, alcohol, drugs, shopping anything in fact that alleviates, however temporarily, the crushing feeling of being out of control of their own destiny. These strategies can of course bring about bigger problems to add to the depression. A sense of meaning or purpose to their lives is missing and in its place is a gaping hole. This can set some people off on a journey to find that missing piece in the vain hope that it will complete them. They never find that thing that will make them whole again because it doesn‚Äôt exist. It is a depression generated wild goose chase that can easily turn into an obsession. Depression holds out the promise that if you could just find that thing outside yourself everything would return to normal and the depression would vanish. Unfortunately as many people have found to their cost, including myself, it‚Äôs simply not true. The answer lies internally not externally.  
There are a countless different ways that people can experience depression. There are however quite a few commonalities between the different types. If any of the above resonated with you it‚Äôs time to seek professional help. These types of symptoms won‚Äôt be exercised away, prayed away, snapped out of or ignored. If left unaddressed they have the ability to devastate your life for a very long period of time.

"As a father, I lose a job, stay home for almost 3 months. I regret losing my job, start to struggle mentally.  But I am a father.

I keep looking,  have a few interviews that fell through with nothing. I still keep looking. Then I start doing rides for people to keep some money for myself.  My EI was called for already for the family but I wanted my own. Is that selfish?

Anyways I do get a job. 2 weeks in, it's like my family ignores me, I'm not the father figure no more, they learned to adapt. 

I feel alone, unloved, not wanted, and most of all my son, my best friend... never tells me how his day is going anymore. We used to have conversations like this but now it is all silence.  I pick him up from work, he doesn't say anything.  We get home, he hides in the basement.  WHAT AM I DOING WRONG!

I love him, sooo much... if I cause so much pain when I'm here or when I am gone. Why am I here when I should be gone. Selfishness is based on not allowing others to help, well, there is no one else.  So when I die, I'm not selfish.",2,depression
"For the sake of some background info, I'm a 21 year old female who just graduated with an associates degree in Graphic Design and Computer Information Systems. I'm currently working full time as a waitress/manager at a little diner in a truck stop. I'm currently on 50mg of vyvanse, which I take once in the morning. 

Now, the reason I wish I never started meds is because I genuinely struggle so hard on the days I decided not to take them. It's like before I ever went to the doctor, yeah, my adhd made things difficult, but I could function most days and eventually got shit done. But now it's impossible to do anything unless I take the vyvanse. I don't want to take it every day because it can be really difficult to fall asleep while on them. It's also hard because, It's not just that I'm productive on my meds, I'm also happier, my appetite is low(so I don't binge eat) and I just feel like I'm physically in less pain, like it's easier to get up and move. I just get so depressed and tired, hungry, and emotional on those sober days... nothing like how I was before the prescription.

"hey guys, i‚Äôm new to posting here but i need some reassurance that i‚Äôm not thinking clearly and there really is hope for me still. I was majorly depressed from 14-18, (almost 20 now) then things slowly started getting better, i got into a new amazing relationship with someone i loved with my entire heart and soul and and cherished and i was stable for the most part, probably the most stable i‚Äôve ever been. but due to my codependency and attachment issues i had some insecurities but i genuinely loved him more than myself and put those aside as much i possibly could, BUT we recently broke up and my life has gone absolutely downhill from there. there has been so many stresses, i had an attempted si after that, failed that one unfortunately, mental hospital stay, being treated differently by my family, iop, therapy, so many meds and med changes trying to figure out what works best for me, med withdrawals and just so much more. I‚Äôm stressed, and i‚Äôm tired. I drink and i try to just relax for a moment but instead all the emotions i hold onto come flooding out 10x more intense and while me and my ex partner were trying to work things out and things were both very difficult he just couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore; i know he‚Äôs doing what he feels is best for him but i can‚Äôt help but feel so abandoned, i feel like all my insecurities and fear of abandonment were just validated and it makes me feel hopeless. if the one person who i felt i could understand and who understood and loved me me the most couldn‚Äôt deal with my mental health and breakdowns during a rough time, who can? i have nobody else.

"Hey everyone. 

I've been diagnosed with adhd for 2 years, type one diabetes for 24 and coeliac (severe gluten auto immune response) for 20. I also suspect I struggle a lot with autism socially. 

I'm struggling to tolerate side effects of both stimulants and atomoxetine so can only tolerate a small dose of dexamphetamine every other day.  

Basically, I have ways to sort of get by and cope about half of the time but the pmdd side of things throws me out of whack and I stop being able to function (unable to work, so irritated by every little noise/find it so difficult to be kind to myself because of the amount of pressure I have to do things because of my health, intensified rejection sensitivity, feeling and thinking irrationally).

Due to the unpredictable and demanding nature of type 1 and of how difficult is it to avoid cross contamination for gluten I'm nearly always unwell (especially with adhd making it hard to remember to do things/to eat/hard to process things at the necessary speed to keep up with my health). 

I live in the UK and I'm very lucky that we have the NHS I doubt I'd survive without it. However, I don't know I can help myself, not sure if I'd like comfort or solutions maybe both? But I'm experiencing a lot of suicidal ideation (no planning just the feeling) the last few days, particularly from the effects of when I accidentally ingest gluten (malnourishment, brain fog on top of the adhd kind, migraines, double fatigue). 

Is there anything anyone has found helps them cope or lessens their number of meltdowns? I know this was a long winded one so thank you if you're reading. I have a pip assessment coming up which is a battle in itself, I know that support would go a long way if it goes well (ongoing for 5 years).",3,adhd

"Usually posting somewhere makes this issue worse. But I want someone to know what I'm going through because its weird and I don't know if this is severe paranoia or delusion at times. There is a woman in my brain, whether it be a separate entity or not. Whether she actually exists I dont know. I have severe OCD with constant compulsions. I cant enjoy anything without compulsions and Ive set up a while system. Were both in charge of my brain and when I do my compulsions I touch something three times. First time I say yes in my brain, second time is no, third is I don't know. Its always no because its usually something like ""do this or you will be punished, do this or someone you know will die, do this or whatever idk its a bunch of horrible shit."" I have argued with her and basically just had breakdowns saying ""STFU THIS ISNT REAL"" I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT. But every time I do this or ignore my compulsions something bad happens. IDK. EVERY TIME. I feel like this is genuinely real. I don't actually hear her bc I don't hallucinate. Either something bad happens (I don't want to say bc it triggers me to actually type it out) Or I feel like I'm outside my body (depersonalization, de realization) or I just feel high or like nothing is real. I feel like she is going to banish me into another dimension or Ill never see anyone I love again if I continue this. I don't know if I fully believe this , but sometimes I don't have the capability to think irrationally and sometimes I do think it is. It is ruining my fucking life and I want to end things. I mean the feeling high or outside my body could be anxiety but sometimes it happens when Im not even anxious. I keep seeing signs that this is real like after I argue with her or ignore a compulsion I see the word die or burn or i see fire or something in a youtube thumbnail or whatever. Ill hear sounds like banging immediately after I ignore it. Immediately. Almost every single time. Sometimes I have been like ""if I see the color red three times in a row its real"" And i have done it over and over again and its red. There are so many other examples. I dont know what to do. I feel like something bad is going to happen to me. I cant do online therapy bc its not fucking free or go in to in person therapy bc I have no money.

I literally have made up a whole system for this. I have to write S for sorry when I argue with her on a flat surface or say intrusive thought out loud whenever I have one so she doesnt punish me. She is a irrational person and I have to be the rational one so sometimes she could punish me without me even doing anything bad. Ive literally made this all up and never saw or or hear her but Im convinced its real sometimes? I dont know if its bordering onto delusion or not but this is ruining my life. Even making this post I feel like something bad is going to happen. ",5,paranoia

"I didn't go to pre-K, I did go to a morning class but I never went to pre-k. In 1st grade I went half days, and my mom would take me out in the afternoons. I did go to a homeschooling teacher for a little while, I can't remember how I did. Then 2nd through 4th grade I went normally. Then, she took me out to homeschool me, it didn't work out so she stuck me back in later in the year. 

I surely fell behind because I couldn't stay focused on my schoolwork at home, that's why my mom put me back in public schooling. Which I'm thankful for. I missed a lot of school through my education years, due to an illness I had which had me vomiting quite frequently. They took me out of class for math because I fell behind, and I had comprehension issues due to my ADHD. I have attention deficits. But, now it's gotten better. In 5th grade towards the end of the year they brought up to my mom they would like to place me on an IEP due to falling behind in a few subjects; Reading and Mathematics.

Fast forward to current time, given I was in an IEP I feel like I'm intellectually or developmentally delayed. I feel like I'm slow, I currently live at home and work in the hospital as a certified nursing assistant. I work full time, but I feel dumb. I pay rent at home even though I'm so bad with money it's insane. I'm impulsive with money especially, I prioritize things badly. I know I'm doing it too, it's just like impulsive. It's weird. I have bad anxiety, social anxiety as well.. anxiety for every situation it seems like. I've gone to therapy for it, because I feel like I'm existing... not living. My therapist says that given that I was able to pass my CNA state certification I'd have to be average or above average in intelligence to even pass it. 

I feel like everyone around me knows something is ""off"". Even though I haven't heard it, I'm sure they talk? I don't really care about anything else anyone has to say BUT the thought of them thinking that I'd be slow or intellectually delayed bothers me. As a kid I walked and talked on time, and passed my childhood milestones. It wasn't ever indicated I was intellectually delayed. 

I got employee of the month 2 months being in the hospital, but I've made big mistakes no one got hurt. I've been a CNA 4 years prior. These nurses are my age and younger and they seem so mature. I feel like sometimes I feel dumb and inadequate. I'm quiet, but I want to be smart and an intellectual. They always say how a hard job I do. These nurses hangout and are friends with each other. I feel out of sorts here. There's been times where they come sit by me cause I sit away from them. Do you think they think something is off? They seem to like me and keep me included. THEY are articulate, I think I'm articulate online but offline it's bad.

My first relationship ended in me being cheated on. My second relationship was with a slob who tried to get pregnant by me without my consent.

I fell hard for a girl 10 months ago, and she fell for me. She was like a princess, I‚Äôd never been so smitten. But she lived too far away and we didn‚Äôt want to put each other through long-distance. So we cut all contact.

Society is cold and hostile. Nobody trusts each other. For good reason: so many people do everything they can to exploit the crap out of everything they can. So, when a trustworthy person comes along, they get treated like shit all the same. The chance to prove yourself rarely comes along.. and a lot of people just don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre trustworthy, they‚Äôre too busy trying to exploit you.

Now I‚Äôm here, ranting on reddit, because deep down I crave social interaction, despite being introverted af.
But all my social circles have died off, all my friends don‚Äôt respond to my messages anymore, not because they hate me, they just forgot.

It‚Äôs really just not easy to enjoy life sometimes, it just isn‚Äôt. But life is precious all the same. I just wish I didn‚Äôt have to tell myself that so frequently :/",2,depression
"Lately I've been feeling uneasy, anxious, scared, and full of dread and angst. I'm worried I'm on the verge of a psychotic episode. It feels like I'm on a roller coaster on the slow incline. Being pulled up by the chains. I can see the top and the steep downfall in front of me. The butterflies are going crazy in my stomach. I've been on this roller coaster before so I know how it ends. Its ends with me in the hospital. So should I just jump the gun and self admit myself. I've been in the mental hospital twice. Each time I've experienced really trippy things but it has been like a reset button on my life. 

Up to this point I have been stable for two years. Taking my meds and seeing a psychiatrist and psychotherapist. But I'm coming up on the anniversary of my first episode which was very intense out of body experience. I always have this cycle of stress and anxiety around my anniversary but this year it is pretty strong. I don't really want to go back to the hospital because it felt like a prison and everyone is in a different mental state. Its like a mind circus. But it would be possibly better to be there than have a breakdown at home. What should I do?",6,schizophrenia

"So I've been having some trouble sleeping having hypnagogic hallucinations, hallucinations while sleeping both tactile and hearing voices, talking in my sleep and responding to these hallucinations, and very weird dreams in general. I can't wake up even through extreme panic during sleep, until eventually it stops and before getting up; I dissociate in bed for a bit cause of the fear and chronic pain like I legit feel like I'm gonna passout from how tired I am from the dreaming and sleep. Sometimes I get lucid dreams and sleep paralysis.

I have a psychiatrist who prescribes me with Seroquel, Atomoxetine, Pregabalin, Valproate, ah that's all I can remember for now. I'm from Vancouver Canada where weed is legal medicinally and recreationally, and I'm currently residing in Mexico and have been for a little over two years. I know that an Indica would help me calm down and be able to sleep through the night with no issues or panic but it's illegal here so idk if that's an option :/

What can I do? I've already tried several atypical antipsychotics and even benzodiazapines since 15 years old. The only thing I've found that keeps dreams away is weed.",6,schizophrenia
"I've been spending more time thinking about how I'm autistic and didn't know most of my life, and doing more research to better understand my autism. 

I really miss how things were during the height of the pandemic. I live in a major city and I enjoyed working from home more often, less people outside and on public transit, etc... Everything felt less overwhelming for me, and now that things are pretty much back to normal, I feel overstimulated in public places more often. I am trying to learn ways to better manage this. I already wear noise canceling headphones pretty much everywhere, I wear loose fitting clothes to feel less fabric against my skin (and I'm picky about what I wear), and I recently bought a pair of sunglasses and a sun hat because sometimes the sun and other lights are too bright for me. I was on the verge of tears wearing the sunglasses yesterday because I felt immediately more calm, and I had no idea the bright lights made me so stressed out and I've been living like that for 27 years. My baseline stress level is likely much higher than NT people and I had no idea because this is all I've ever known. I'm trying to figure out other ways to feel less overwhelmed outside of the house now. 

As I've been thinking about this more though, I've talked to people in my life about me being autistic, and even people who know me and really care about me, they're supportive of me, but they don't understand. They are willing to do things to help me, like being okay with me turning off the lights because they're too bright, or fidgeting to calm myself down. But for everyone else, I explain it to them, and it's like in one ear and out the other. They say they're supportive, but when I ask for what I need to feel okay, I'm told that I need to, ""be flexible,"" and that, ""we all have to deal with things we don't like,"" without acknowledging that I already have to be very flexible to exist in a world where I feel like an alien. 

I want to do more to educate myself so I can better support myself and advocate for the autistic community more. I'm trying my best to be optimistic and focus on solutions, and I've been relying on God to help me through this emotionally difficult time (I'm a Christian). It's just difficult to accept that most people don't understand autism and don't want to learn anything beyond their limited understanding of it. And that it will be a battle to fight for more awareness and better accommodations for autistic people in the community. I already did a lot of education and advocacy work for the trans community because I'm a trans man and I know a lot of folks who are trans who I care about. I'm tired and I'm sick of life being an uphill battle just to have the same rights as everyone else, and to have an even laying field. I feel like I'm mourning the fact that being autistic had affected my whole life and I didn't know until like 3 years ago, and that if I want more awareness and better treatment I have to basically go into battle again. It feels so unfair. 

I'm not really asking for anything, I just wanted to get my feelings out here because I feel like this is the only community I know that will understand. I don't have any autistic friends irl and I don't know where I could meet some.",1,autism

"Hi everyone, Im a 27 year old woman and have been in the talking stages with 30 year old man for a couple of months now. Recently we have gotten a lot closer, and are starting to take things to the next level. He recently told me that he has schizophrenia. Although some people have told me I should stay away, this does not bother me or scare me, as it is part of who he is and I love him for all parts of him. I have my own mental health issues (bpd) and do my best to not judge anyone based off of their own struggles. With that being said, I am looking for and tips and advise anyone has to give on being in a relationship with someone with schizophrenia, anything from how to better understand him, what to do/not do, and just anything anyone wants to share. I am doing my best to educate myself on his condition but there‚Äôs only so much you can learn from reading about something, so I am hoping that you all can share experiences of living with schizophrenia, or dating someone with schizophrenia.

"Was listening to binaural beats constantly, getting in at least one good session a day. One night I heard a ‚ÄúBang‚Äù so loud it had me frozen.

"Hello everyone, 

Yesterday first time in my life i got anxiety attack after smoking weed.
Ive been active smoker for 6+ years
Never had anything like this,
Ive had this very uneasy feeling in me 
And it pretty much stayed today aswell.
Ive felt like my life is worthless and i wont be able to accomplish anything.
I got so scared in my head cause i never had mental problems. This idea of having them scared very much. Im 22years old working low paying 9-5.
I dont have many friends and im quite alone. I really dont want to be anxious or worse - depressed. I thought maybe its because of poor diet or no vitamins? Maybe i can drink some supplements to feel better? Im currently taking magnesium. I will stop with weed for a while but is there a way i can feel better?",2,depression
"So I'm Kat I'm f21. I go to college but I'm here over the summer with my family.I have a mom and dad and 2 sisters. I've been feeling very stressed here. I'm not sure how to handle it anymore. I have a car but my parents don't allow me to take it to college(pls don't ask idk), but my sister in HS takes it everywhere. And everytime something is diffirent about my car (ex the emergency break is on) she gets mad and tells me to not put it on. 

My parents are stressed all the fucking time and j mean all the time. My family is in a bad mood everything single day 24/7. And rhey get furious over small things (like for example all the spoons being dirty) will throw them over the edge. This is extremely hard to live with. My family fights everyday too about dumb stuff like the dishes or like the creamer being low. Every single day I'm struggling with my mental health bc of them. The other week I asked my dad to move the elliptical out of my room that they put in my room without asking or even telling me for that matter. My dad was screaming at me saying ""this isn't ur house"" ans no one uses the elliptical so I'm confused as to why it has to be in my bedroom. My parents wouldn't budge with it. 

And basically my whole life I've been struggling with mental health and I've told my parents countless times about it. But they tell me I'm faking it. I've had so many panic attacks in front of them and they just don't care. My sister is a junior in HS and SHE IS GETTING THERAPY. Like wtf??",2,depression

"Hi

I don't know how to start this properly but I want to talk about me feeling like im nobody.

I am 23 years old and living in a big family of 18, i am number 15 in line. From childhood i got little to no parenting from my parents, not that they weren't amazing parents, they just did not know how to raise a child to have good routines. When i was a child i did not go to kindergarten, we had an aupair while my parents were working at their company. They were never strict on me brushing teeths or showering, they would tell me to do it. But as a child, if you don't want to do something then you don't do it unless you get forced to. 

So as i am in school, i would start to skip days because i felt like it had no consequences. Which then without me knowing made me the weird kid. I had my friends, that are still my friends to this day and are great. Anyways the reason i am bringing this up is because this didn't come to my attention before one of my friends told me that i used to be the weird kid. And then everything clicked, now i understand why no one ever had contact with me outside of school, it's because they wouldn't want to be seen with the weird kid. I never felt bullied, but more unnoticed. And that is how i still feel, because it's kind of true.

2 years ago i went on a work and travel program where you can live for free in another country by working for a company in that country. We were 10 guys and i felt like we had so much fun and i felt like i made so many new friends. After the 1 year of working had past, we had become somewhat close at least that's what i thought. You see, everyone was close except for me but i didn't know this. I found out about this by seing all the Happy Birthdays posts they made for each other on instagram. But no one ever made one for me, and i see that they are still hanging out. While even though i have contacted them, no one has ever reached out to me... Like i don't exist and so that is what started my feeling of being a nobody. 

I feel like no one remembers me after having a deep conversation or shared laughs. 

And i feel like i haven't accomplished anything in my life. And i know im not dumb, i passed with top grades in school and have an iq of 120 according to mensa. It's just the feeling of nobody will ever remember me that weighs me down. 

We have a family chat group and everytime someone has a birthday, everyone congratulates people, and compliments them with 'Thanks for always showing up when we need something'. Meanwhile i haven't got a single meaningful comment like everything i do for my siblings or how much i care about them which i try to show them by coming visiting them. Its like they don't remember.

Right now we are doing carpentry work at the family cabin, and i hear ""Great work sibling!"" And i have a lot of carpentry experience so i was making the kitchen but all i got was complaining (from one of my brothers) all though everything i did was by the book and looks nice. 

And then he said a comment to me that made me absolutley resent him. He said you are just pretending to know how to do carpentry, while i put my heart and soul in to that project. And hadn't boasted anything about stuff i knew. It was so painful to hear that i felt physical discomfort. No one has ever expressed that they appreciate me. And i feel like i can't talk to them about feeling unappreciated.

Feeling like a nobody is draining and very deeply sad. 

I think the reason i feel like i haven't accomplished me is because i have never been recognised. And not being recognised also leads to lack of motivation.

Anyways thanks for reading my messy post, i will gladly take any advice or other thoughts on the subject.",2,depression

"My little brother and his friend went into the creek in our backyard and kidnapped a salamander. Now my parents want to let my loud, obnoxious, irresponsible, little brother keep this thing as a pet.

I *tried* telling them to release it, but they won't listen. They've bought a tank and a bunch of other stuff for it already. So I decided that if I can't get them to release it, then I'll do research to make sure it's at least somewhat happy. Well, i try to tell them *anything,* and they won't listen. They refuse to listen to me at all. This has gone on for almost a week now and im so sick and tired of it. Over and over, they say something about it not eating, or not moving much, and I tell them the reason why that's probably happening, and they get angry at me and don't listen to me.

And when I try to help them with anything, they give all the credit to my little brother. I'm pretty much the only one doing research at all, and they just act like I'm stupid. I cry about this poor salamander every single night, because the poor thing is suffering and there is pretty much nothing I can do to help it. I can't freaking stand seeing animals suffering, and my parents know this, and they just get angry when I'm concerned about it. We just kidnapped this poor thing from its home, I want to make sure it's OK, that's all I want to do. 

Not to mention all the other stuff going on in my life that makes me feel worthless, pathetic, and want to kill myself, this doesn't freaking help. I can't even keep a couple of plants alive, plants that are supposed to be *easy* to keep alive.

I hate this so so much, I want to freaking kill myself so freaking badly. I want to free the poor salamander. They won't even feed live food, they're feeding it dried and dead food. They even said it themselves, that this species of salamander is ""endangered"", and they still insist on keeping it. 

They favor my little brother so so much over the rest of me and my siblings, they would never let anyone else take in a salamander or even a bug from the wild and keep it as a pet. 

And the only one who will listen to me about this at all is one of my older brothers. 

I just want to end everything, the only thing keeping me alive is the fact that all my loved ones will be sad.

See if I‚Äôm alone and if anyone can help? I feel like it‚Äôs pretty common and I know I can‚Äôt be the only one who feels like this. 

I‚Äôm a cisgender, female who has been in a committed relationship since summer 2019 and I still feel like he‚Äôs cheating on me. I have literally no basis for this and each time I ask he is open and transparent, offers his phone, leaves it around all the time, answers any time I call, I‚Äôm active in his family life, like at this point if he‚Äôs stepping out it‚Äôs on him not me. Yet, I still feel sometimes (and less often every day, this post is a step for me towards not feeling trapped like this) that he‚Äôs seeing someone. And the type of trist I‚Äôm thinking of is totally out of character, he‚Äôs never been a one night stand or a cheater. He did confess to being an emotional cheater long ago and in another life and again, we‚Äôve talked AT LENGTH about how we are both different people as I used to be a cheater too. Either way, I know I‚Äôm with my partner and my person. And I know they feel the same by their actions and words. So why do I still get panic attacks when I see a girl we both know at the same event or do I go on a days long trip out when he mentions he texts this girl that used to be a good friend of his.

"So my diagnosis process has been anything but smooth. At first my doctor brushed off my issues as depression and anxiety. Put me on meds for both and they got worse. Way worse. I was almost sent to a psychiatric hospital bad. Then he suspected bipolar. Kept me on the other two meds but added meds for bipolar. I started to hallucinate and get even worse! He got rid of the anxiety meds and the depression got really bad. The anxiety had almost completely gone away. I was unable to stay wake for more than an hour at a time. I failed high school and have to go through the expensive process of getting my GED. After enough complaints from my teachers, parents, family, and myself my doctor took me off my meds and agreed to do a screening for ASD and ADHD. (ADHD runs in my family.) when doing the screening the only things that flagged for ADHD were the lap over ones for ASD. Well now since he prolonged my diagnosis process till after I hit 18. The only place that will do a diagnosis for autism is TWO HOURS out of my city. That isn‚Äôt even accounting for the distances in the cities I‚Äôd have to go just to get to the exact location. There is a doctor in my city but the oldest people he diagnosed are 17. I‚Äôve been telling my doctor teachers have raised concerns of me being autistic for long before I was 17. My doctor has made things difficult for me from the start with almost everything. Stomach issues, my transition, therapy, and even just simple blood work so I know if I have some of the genetic conditions that run in my family. I‚Äôve got the paperwork for the place outside of my city because I finally want a set in stone answer so I can access the proper accommodations I‚Äôve needed since day one. I‚Äôm gonna take them in when I have my next appointment. I‚Äôve already had my local hospital help with my transition (which I find out if I start hormones on Monday or a later date!) I‚Äôve done my research on this and honestly once this is all said and done I want to be a voice for people like me in my city because this situation is so draining and isolating. Please tell me my doctor isn‚Äôt the only one? I‚Äôm not even self diagnosing the screening said I‚Äôm autistic and should do the full diagnosis. Teachers have said I probably autistic. If it weren‚Äôt for them I would have never even started the process because I thought I was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù compared to my family‚Ä¶ sorry if that made no sense at all. I‚Äôve had a busy week last week and I still haven‚Äôt fully recovered. 

TLDR: doctor has made my diagnosis process 10x harder by pushing off the actual diagnosis until after I was 18. Now I have to leave my entire city just for one appointment that could have been done here if he had acted 3 years faster.",1,autism
"Hi all,

I used to be a strong believer of God. Then I entertained the doubts which grew day by day until very little of my belief has remained.

With that, my mental well-being went downhill as my anxiety was through the roof.

I've lost some of the ideas that used to make life so much easier such as 
-Everything happens for a reason.
-God has chosen what's best for me.
-I have a connection with a higher power and he'll take care of me.
-I have a high purpose in life.

Ever since my faith has weakened, I've become much more dependent on people for emotional support. I've become more needy whereas all I used to need was a quick prayer to make my worries go away and be content and hopeful.",2,depression

"I hate how media portrayals of autistic characters depict ""rudeness"" that is based on the assumption that we are deliberately and knowingly being rude because autism makes us uncaring. 

An example of a non-autistic character who is intentionally a dick is House. He is knowingly an asshole and has an excellent grasp of social skills that allow him to fine-tune his insults. However, this is portrayed as part of his personality and free choice, with some trauma and chronic pain mixed in. 

Tons of autistic or autistic ""drag"" characters (looking at you Sheldon fking Cooper) are portrayed as rude, but not because of the actual reasons that might cause an autistic person to unintentionally be rude. They're basically written as jerks who just dislike social conventions, rather than not understanding them. It's all part of this horrible mythos that we could be ""normal"" and we're choosing to act like this because we're assholess without empathy or desire for approval and human relationships.",1,autism

Hey, Reddit community!  
  
I'm reaching out today because I'm facing a significant hurdle in my life‚ÄîADHD. It has become a constant roadblock, preventing me from fully capitalizing on the opportunities that come my way. I'm tired of being unfocused, constantly changing my plans and goals, and feeling the frustration it causes in my business and personal relationships.  
  
I'm an ambitious individual with big financial goals, but my ADHD often feels like a bottleneck, hindering my progress. I find myself overwhelmed by countless distractions and flooded with new ideas, leaving me unsure of which path to pursue.  
  
So, I'm turning to this incredible community in search of guidance, support, and mentoring opportunities. If you've been down a similar path and have successfully navigated your ADHD challenges, I would be incredibly grateful for any advice or recommendations you can offer.  
  
Are there any proven programs or therapies that have helped you manage your ADHD symptoms effectively? Perhaps you've come across certain strategies or techniques that have made a significant difference in your life. I'm open to exploring all possibilities and suggestions.  
  
Moreover, if anyone is willing to offer mentorship or share their personal experiences, it would be a tremendous help. Sometimes having someone who understands what you're going through can provide the motivation and direction needed to overcome obstacles.  
  
I genuinely believe that by learning from others who have triumphed over their ADHD challenges, I can acquire the tools and strategies necessary to unlock my true potential.  
  
Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Your support and advice mean a lot to me. Together, let's transform these roadblocks into stepping stones towards a more focused and fulfilling life.  
  
Looking forward to hearing your stories and insights!",3,adhd
"Back around 2017, I left my job because it was too stressful for me. I was coming home crying. the final straw was I couldn't stop crying long enough to drive to work. work was bullshit. I worked at a deli in a grocery store. this was right around the time of a minimum wage increase in Michigan. people would quit and no one would be rehired, leaving me to the responsibilities of 4 or 5 people. It was so straining that I was sore everyday and had difficulty sleeping. I have bad anxiety so finding a job is extremely difficult. I have gaps in my resume that people hiring always ask about. I never know what to tell them. It adds to interview anxiety, so I didn't look for jobs.

My dad was supporting me completely, paying 10k or more a year for rent and food. I drove my car dry and seized the engine, so my ability of finding a new job was greatly diminished. my only choice was to work another straining minimum wage job near my apartment and that gave me anxiety. I'm not lazy, I just worked the jobs of 4 people for minimum wage and I have trouble asking for help.

Anyway, this starts a cycle of me trying to get help and accumulating more anxiety by being misdiagnosed. I text my dad suicidal texts, I had no plan in acting them out, but I had anxiety and my dad was always threatening me to take my apartment away and force me to live on the streets. I guess I just wanted him to feel sorry for me or something. there was some feeling that I wanted the suffering to end, but I didn't want to die.

He petitioned me, like he should have, and I went to the psych ward. it wasn't my first time, as I had been there in the past when I was overstimulated one time and had to take a break from life. The time I went was 10 years prior, idk what happened but I was stressed out from work (another overworked fast food minimum wage job) and I couldn't go home to sleep because it was turned into a party house by my friends. I went to my dads and I was stressed out and said some things that I forget now but my step-mom ended up calling the hospital and I was voluntarily admitted to the psych ward. I believed I was going through a quarter-life crisis. I had recently dropped out of college because work scheduled me on days I deliberately took off for school and forgot about school (I was 19, just moved out of the house and had bills to pay) and the book store didn't restock a book I needed for a VB class because someone bought it but then dropped the class. couldn't find the book online, so I ended up dropping the class in the middle of the semester, giving me an incomplete. anyway, at the psych ward I was diagnosed with psychosis and let go on some weak antipsychotics. they didnt do anything to help my anxiety and really didn't seem to do anything at all, so I stopped taking them. I don't think the meds were important but I didn't take it seriously and never went to my doctor about anxiety.

back to 2017. I left my job, lost my car and I was in a vicious cycle. I would text my dad suicidal text, get admitted to the psych ward, take the meds find them ineffective with my anxiety, stop taking them, and would sent more suicidal texts to my dad. this cycle led to a total of about 7 psych ward visits, which is a limit before they have to take serious action. in an act of desperation to break the cycle and maybe get a disability claim, I reported some pareidolias as hallucinations. It was a stretch to call them hallucinations. The water running though the pipes sounded like someone whispering my name, and I reported seeing ghosts after my hair got in my eyes and it reminded me of some scary picture I saw on the internet, it was a pareidolia.

They diagnose me with schizophrenia and force me to live at an adult foster care cities away from my apartment. not collecting disability at this point although im now eligible. I'm forced to comply with my ATO and am forced to take meds. The AFC ended up being a good thing in my eyes because I was able to get out and ride my bike almost everyday. nature and exercise do wonders for mental health.

I was moved to another AFC closer to where I was living before and these new caretakers didn't care for us very much. I was lucky if I got dinner. they were supposed to prepare 3 full meals a day, but they didn't and food piled up and they would end up taking it home or throwing it away, even though your taxes are going to this food and for them prepare it for us.

one day in june 2020, fresh in the pandemic, they decide to turn the AC off and make it hot in the house. It was 86 degrees in my room and I told them it was hot. I go to the store and 30 minutes later, still hot in my room. so I break the box covering the thermostat and turn it on, this angered the caretaker so much that she got in my face like I had a problem with her. ""I cook you food, don't I?"" she ironically says. I start formally refusing to take my med (they weren't forcing me to take them anyway) and a couple days later, 3 cop cars show up like I have a gun or something and handcuff me and take me to the hospital to get admitted to the psych ward. I was starting a business and started making about 1k a month, but they put a halt to that. This time at the psych ward, their goal was ""to get me in and out as fast as possible"" and I wasn't provided care that was personalized towards me, rather to someone who was schizophrenic and had anger issues. I may have had a little problem with anger, but nothing a little anger management couldn't solve. In the psych ward, they prescribe me with Haldol and I'm forced to take it in order to leave the psych ward or basically stay there indefinitely. This medication has plenty of severe side effects that can become permanent. I experience absolute drowsiness, I sleep 12 hours a day, get the jitters all the time and it affects my ability to play/enjoy video games, not to mention it causes anhedonia and permanent sexual dysfunction. I am forced to take it according to my ATO.

I sent a letter to my doctor, outlining my concerns and asking me to take me off of haldol, which happened for 3 or 4 months, but out of the blue they call me and want me back for routine injections.

i am trying to find a legal ground to get off this med, but with the added stigma of schizophrenia, its nearly impossible. People with schizophrenia don't believe they have it and refuse to take their meds, so I'm forced to inject haldol even though it's meant for people who absolutely can't control their anger or have debilitating hallucinations, which I don't have. I've tried posting on r/legaladvice but my posts get downvoted and largely ignored 

Now, I am stuck in another loop with this debilitating drug, but they won't take me off of it. If I refuse, I get to have cops come to my door and haul me away from my business and my responsibilities of taking care of my cat all because I had bad anxiety and was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. They can hold me in the hospital for 15 months if I refuse my meds and probably physically force me to take an injection.

personally, I believe I may be schizotypal or have SPD, as I have had delusions that I consider magical thinking, but also some real stuff has happened to me that may seem like a delusion, but I have no problem telling the difference between what is real and what is not. I don't have hallucinations. The only audio hallucinations I have are called auditory afterimages from listening to my 3d printers run all day.

Does anyone know how I get out of this? I've emailed legal aid but they have yet to get back to me. I really need a lawyer or someone to navigate the hasty, unforgiving code of Michigan's Kevin's law. Do I sue myself for defamation? How do I get a copy of my mental health records and court documents and make sure they didn't falsify or exaggerate 

before you downvote this post or say I actually have schizophrenia, know that I have all the telltale signs of a misdiagnosis (reported auditory hallucinations, repeated psych ward visits for suicidal ideation, prominent anxiety) and studies have been produced that prove over 50% of schizophrenia diagnoses are wrong. I have seen many doctors and none of them were native english speakers.",6,schizophrenia

I wonder if writing down all that worries me just creates more focus towards the negative and reinforces it.

"I suffer from really bad paranoia : and it‚Äôs just been getting worse more recently. Every comment, the slightest slip of wording sends me into a full on breakdown because I just automatically assume everyone in this world wants me dead and are going to stop at nothing to get me there. 

No one understands this either. I‚Äôve had several people complained to me about how the way I act effects them, but even after I try to explain that I‚Äôm paranoid and think they‚Äôre trying to hurt me, or ruin my life (I explain as nicely as I can and try and assure them it isn‚Äôt their fault I‚Äôm just mentally ill), all they think about is how it effects them. I try to apologise but then they say things that make me even more paranoid and before you know it it‚Äôs another suicide attempt because I‚Äôm so scared they‚Äôre gonna come to my house and try and kill me themselves.

"Has anyone else done ""tests"" to see if they can trust someone? For example, sometimes i blurt out stuff to people that i've told someone else i trust to see if they tell other people, or i tell someone my opinion on someone to see if they judge me or tell the person. i'm a strong believer in pinky promises so i try to show that i'm serious about it.

"I don't know if I really feel hope anymore or if I keep going on just so I don't burden anyone with absolutely giving up. Some days I really try to find something that means a lot to me and something I can look forward to in my life. I try to do things that I know I enjoy and I even have a girlfriend who means the world to me. But, none of it makes it feel like it is worth going through the river of shit (as the poker players would call it).

I am constantly confused what it means to be happy. Sometimes I think I found it, only for it to just turn around and lead to more disappointment. I feel like the ultimate disappointment. I know there is a lot of trauma that makes me feel that way and my mind has been permanently altered to think as such from years of BS manipulation I have dealt with. I know that it is the result of a decay in my ability to process things in anything other than pain, a deconstruction of my ability to communicate in any fashion that is clear or unformed by the Bell Jar Sylvia Plath wrote about. Trauma physically changes our brain chemistry. It is not just the gross overstimulating anxiety we feel when we flash back to an old horrible event. It is also the fundamental way our mind perceives the physical world. The simple functions that are no more complicated than 2 + 2 are basically fed bad data over and over again until 2+2=5. Then it builds on that until we reach such a level of obfuscation that a million little pieces doing something wrong, makes a very ugly whole shape. That is what trauma does.

I know this. I have looked at it and observed it over and over again. I have looked at the things I do and I know what part of my past it comes from. But, sometimes it doesn't matter because even if I managed to conquer those aspects of my trauma, I feel like there is just more trauma waiting for me. More fights and struggles. More death and mourning. More systems that actively feed off my energy just to commodify my labor into such low worth. More decay of my body and mind.

It comes to the point where I don't even know what I want to do anymore. What do I even hope to get out of life? Love? Sometimes it really feels like I can't truly feel it. I care for people and my girlfriend, but it is so obscured by a fawning trauma response that I just can't feel beyond that need to be nice and supportive out of the need to not feel like absolute dog shit. I literally can't trust myself to know what love is. Success? I would love the security of success but I feel like most of the time success is sacrificing you self-worth and principles to gain that security. It is an insecurity at the heart of it. Fun? Maybe. Maybe I just want memories worth having. Maybe I would like times where I can truly put myself together long enough to really internalize what a great time is instead of pushing myself through activities just so I don't ruin other people's time.

What I really want? I just want to write a novel; I want to create a youtube channel where I can go over art history and over analyze everything and create parallels between a Russian writer like Fyodor Dostoyevsky and an anime like Gintama and have it work. I would like the security to celebrate what is beautiful and ugly in this life for the pure joy of it. I want to be good enough for someone without the crushing fear that I am constantly on the verge of fucking it up. I want to be able to trust how I feel and be able to put it into words without the basically half an hour pause it takes me to get even a slightly viable explanation together. But, even then I will never be sure that something horrible isn't just around the corner and it makes it so much more difficult to keep walking on. I know I can't live my life worrying about the future, but I can't stop it. I can't stop living in the past either. I don't know what it means to live in the present because it just feels like an endurance to get to a new moment.

Even now I hate this post because it feels like a pity party for myself. That I am just wanting to feel sorry for myself and have people feel sorry for me. Honestly, I just want it out of my head for a bit. I just want to be able to put into words other people can understand and maybe that will make it more manageable. Maybe that will put it into such a way that I can start taking it to pieces. But every time I try to put it into words, I keep thinking ""no, that's not it."", ""no, that is not how it feels"", ""no, they will misunderstand what I mean""...I just don't have any internal confidence. It feels like all that is left if pushing on just so it doesn't feel like a burden or it is just numb. Idk. I'm going to post this anyways, despite my mind telling me not to. Hope you are all doing better than I am right now.",2,depression

"Trigger warnings: True crime mention

For background, I've had anxiety since I was a child that manifested itself into a very bad anxiety disorder due to childhood trauma and chronic pain/health issues. 
Before, when I wasn't working on my anxiety and my issues, I was able to do a lot of stuff without worries. Watch scary movies, go on the big rollercoasters, drink more than one glass, listen to true crime, etc. But after finally going through and processing my trauma and opening up and working on my mental issues I have become way more sensitive. I have always been sensitive and emotional, I wear my heart on my sleeve, but now I am extra sensitive to everything bad/sad/scary. 
For example, if I watch a documentary on a serial killer I worry and fear that one day I am going to ""snap"" and become a killer and I obsess over the possibility of this happening to me. 
Because of this I don't make certain decisions that I feel like are affecting my life too much. Another example: I watched a video of a mom that went into postpartum psychosis and killed her baby, and now I am never gonna have kids out of fear. 

I do see a therapist and I have been taking medication for 12+ years, I just wanted to see if anyone feels the same way I feel and what tips and tricks they do to help.

"I don't know where to start, but I'm in an adult relationship. We've been together for 3 weeks and lately it feels like she's been more slow to reply. When we hang out in person, there are absolutely no issues, and the verbal and physical communication is great

I suffered abuse growing up and also have a history of partners leaving after the month or two month mark (because they got back into the dating scene too quickly or other rubbish like that; after showing me houses they wanted to buy with me or kitchens they liked. Yes I know, that was a red flag. Them moving so quickly like that. I should have known they'd do a 360)

I've also moved lots and never had any long lasting friendships till recently, the last set of friends I had to cut out due to them disrespecting me. I have a group of friends at the moment, no worry there. But that was just to set the backstory; temporary friendships, temporary relationships, low self esteem, and it all subsequently spiralled into depression, intrusive thoughts and paranoia

I'm paranoid that my current partner will leave me, even though she's been finding it tough lately as have I. I've got no reason to suspect her. It's just my bl00dy brain being stupid. How do you cope with thoughts like this one? It's making me so sad. I just texted my partner about it but don't think she'll reply. any time soon (I expect she'll be back in 2+ hours?). Telling her about it was so difficult because I worry it'll push her further away; again another one of my intrusive and paranoid thoughts. Argh...

"For the past 5 years my employment has been extremely inconsistent due to a panic disorder. I was first put on medication ( Zoloft w/ xanax for breakthrough anxiety) at 14 (25 now). Got off all meds at 19. Since then, it's been a total rollercoaster of panic attacks one month, depression the next, and so on.  
  
Should I get back on the meds if that was the only thing that helped? Therapy (CBT, EMDR, Hypnosis, Exposure-Response) didn't help. I can't even exercise anymore without having a panic attack from my heart rate increasing. Even getting excited about positive things can throw me into a panic. My digestive system is in shambles from the constant anxiety, and I am at risk of losing my job. I'm a substitute teacher and a uni student and this condition is sucking the life out of me. The way I see it, I can stay off meds and lose it all, or take them as needed and keep my job.

Forgot to mention that SSRIs didn‚Äôt do much for my panic attacks. I was constantly having breakthrough anxiety and the only thing that quelled the panic was Xanax. I can manage baseline anxiety just fine, it‚Äôs the panic attacks that mess me up. I‚Äôve been fighting getting back on benzodiazepines as I know how addictive they are.

"(Sorry this is a long post ahead, not exactly ADHD friendly)

I'm in my early 20s and recently got diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression and I honestly relate a lot to the Asperger's community. I've known that I was dealing with these things for a long time but avoided addressing it until now because I am in an intense burnout cycle that has left me feeling decapitated. My family's response is that none of this is real and I just need to stop being lazy and to get it together. They don't want me to take medication because apparently living life depending on a pill is worse than a dysfunctional life without joy (I'm aware medication isn't necessary for everyone and some people thrive on other sorts of treatment, but I want to at least try it). They even wanted me to not tell my professors about what's going on to save face and my mom thinks they're talking about how terrible my work ethic is behind my back. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't now also paranoid about this. For context, I'm currently struggling through an undergrad degree that is really difficult. I once had a strong passion for the topic but it is slowly burning out along with my will to live. It's especially awful because my parents are paying so much money for this and I struggle intensely with guilt for my lack of willpower in daily life. I feel guilty for using accommodations in school and still barely pulling through and my parents make me feel 10x worse.

I honestly don't have memories of being happy for an extended period of time. I've always been intensely emotional and had anger issues as a child, but I quickly learned how to conceal this because I grew up the only child of super religious parents who care about appearances more than my feelings. I'm afraid of them and try to do as much as I can to avoid upsetting them. My mother in particular has been a helicopter over me my entire life and has very explosive anger such that I'm constantly telling white lies out of fear I might say something that'll make her blow up. Needless to say, I got yelled at when she tried to help me with math homework. I could talk about a lot of negative experiences from my childhood, but that would take all day. My privacy was constantly violated and I was punished for ""lying"" whenever I bottled up my feelings, even though I did this because those feelings have been dismissed every single time, or worse the feelings were considered offensive.

I've also struggled socially my entire life and its only gotten worse as I've gotten older. I have a couple of good friends, but for the most part I live my life completely disconnected from society. Every day, I wake up and walk through life as if it were a simulator. It's like I'm in some sort of bubble where time is distorted. I rarely have anything to look forward to and when I do I can hardly enjoy it either because I'm 1) feeling guilty about something that I haven't done or 2) get bored and/or tired incredibly easily. It feels like I have no escape from this hell. There are some people who listen, but I've never felt like I've been heard by anyone besides a therapist I see every two-three weeks for free through my school and I'll be going home for break soon. Nothing is appealing to me in life except for my bed and my ability to get lost in my imagination. My executive function is so poor right now and it's added so much to the shame. I feel like things are never going to get better. I hate being at school and I hate being at home. I hate thinking about the future and the past is painful. What do I even do? I've never cried so much in my life.",3,adhd

"Hi I‚Äôve been struggling with depression & anxiety etc for a few years now but I found that  my intrusive thoughts have been getting stronger and stronger and sometimes I feel like I can‚Äôt tell myself apart from them

I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be alive with the thoughts that intruding my head I believe they aren‚Äôt me but I get really depressed and get worked up over the thoughts because I feel like I‚Äôve had them for so long I can‚Äôt tell myself apart 

I could be even just doing regular tasks like playing games , doing the washing  , while my eating dinner etc and I‚Äôll hear thoughts in my head but like it‚Äôs my voice in my head saying it like does that make sense? 

I just don‚Äôt know how to continue on anymore I want to start going to therapy but I don‚Äôt want to discuss about my intrusive thoughts because they are really bad and I feel like people should leave me over them and I‚Äôm worried that like they will think it‚Äôs myself actually thinking these things 

for more detail of what the thoughts involve things I am really against of and they say sexual inappropriate things",2,depression

Hey, well this is something that I haven't told to my therapist and I don't know if, as I said in the title, it counts as abuse so I just want opinions, is okay if it isn't, in just genuinely curious if it has something to do with my depression or anything 

So, when I was really little I used to eat very slowly so I had to stay in the table for a long time, until I finished my food, and while I was staring at my food or eating or just seating there my dad (his desk was in front of the dining table) watched like erotic videos; it could be girls dancing sensually or, I think, even straight up porn. I think he touched himself sometime but I can't be sure bc my memory is really bad, and even if he did it wasn't like recurrent or anything. 

I remember one time I was fake sleeping at my grandma's house, I was face down with one of legs up ( I'm sorry I don't know how to explain ) so my ass was like flexxed ig idrk and he entered the room and said like 'damn'. I also remember one time I had a sexual dream with him and I felt really guilty after but not disgusted.

Also I've watched porn and known about sex since I was really small, fantasizing about having relationships and everything. When I was growing up (rn I'm 16) I've watched and listened my parents having sex without them knowing.

Well I don't know what else to say but please comment what you think :))",2,depression

I see posts on TikTok about these and  usually they‚Äôre pretty funny and relatable but at the same time, i feel like it tends to put a pretty bow on something not pretty in the slightest. This shit is destroying me every second of my life. It‚Äôs so isolating, i feel like an alien disguised as a human trying to play a role i know nothing about. 
Everything is difficult all the time, does not matter how hard i try. Im so tired constantly, everything leads me to burn out. I don‚Äôt know how to properly communicate with others, nothing i say ever seems to make sense to others. Everyone always thinks im lazy, insensitive and overall don‚Äôt care. I seem like such an obnoxious shit person, im so goddamn annoying. I have no idea what actual true success feels like, just ‚Äúthats good enough i guess‚Äù. Im never good at anything, only terrible or alright but nothing worth raving about. 
I cant hold a job long enough before being fired or quitting for being miserable. I barely graduated high school then ghosted community college because i cant even handle a cheap liberal arts degree.

"This post may be triggering so proceed with caution. I‚Äôm going to talk about¬†anxiety¬†and¬†specific fears/ phobias.

I‚Äôm not sure whether these are attributed solely to my anxiety or if they could be considered part of PPD and/ or delusions:

- Not wanting to take medicine from my parents as a kid, when I was sick, because I thought they were trying to poison me.

- Being resistant to taking medication in general because I think there‚Äôs something wrong with it and I‚Äôm going to be drugged.

- Fear of overdosing on medication because I don‚Äôt trust myself to remember if I‚Äôve already taken it; this one might be justified with my DID which causes amnesia.

- I‚Äôm uncomfortable and try to avoid talking about certain things in the same room as a smartphone because I think it can hear me.

- Similarly uncomfortable with talking about anything personal over text/ messenger, for the same reason. Someone might read it.

- Wary of trying new foods in case I have an allergic reaction and die, even if I‚Äôve read the ingredients. I can‚Äôt eat anything that anyone else has prepared for me. Sometimes this transfers to foods I already know are safe.

- Fear of choking (maybe ARFID related). It‚Äôs usually manageable but sometimes crops up and makes it extremely difficult for me to eat anything solid for days/ weeks at a time.

- This one is less common, but thinking that there‚Äôs something¬†wrong¬†with my body. Like maybe it‚Äôs slowly rotting on the inside.¬†It doesn‚Äôt help that I have nightmares about things like my teeth falling out.

- Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and have to check every room in my house to make sure nobody‚Äôs broken in.

- I refuse to answer the door for anyone who isn‚Äôt in uniform and delivering a package, because they might be a criminal.

- I have a lifelong/ reoccurring fear of being falsely convicted of a crime and going to jail.

- I‚Äôm convinced that most of my friends secretly dislike me and I imagine them talking behind my back.

- Sometimes I think my partner has turned against me and I‚Äôm convinced he‚Äôs talking about me behind my back.

- Similarly, I will think my partner is cheating on me (for no reason/ without any evidence). I become fixated on the thought that he‚Äôs developed feelings for someone else.

- I tend to expect the worst from people and think they‚Äôre against me.

- If someone is late and/ or doesn‚Äôt answer their phone, I obsessively worry that they died in a car crash or something.

- I‚Äôm wary of every stranger I pass on the street because they might intend to hurt me.

- I rarely walk anywhere alone because I‚Äôm afraid of being assaulted or kidnapped.

- When I‚Äôm driving I easily become convinced that someone is following me.

- Sometimes I‚Äôm afraid that a loved one is going to end up murdering me for no reason.

- If anyone near me is holding a knife, I don‚Äôt trust them. No matter who it is.

- If a strange coincidence happens, I easily become convinced that it¬†means something¬†and I start searching for patterns around me

"I am not looking for sympathy. I am not looking for a reminder of all the good things that happened or that I have. I am just looking to get this off my chest in a place where others understand depression, and some may even be able to relate. I am not looking to end my life due to this; I just am feeling depressed and a bit hopeless; so I decided to share a bit of my story in hopes it will help me feel better.   
  
January 6th, 2023, I went to the ER for what turned out to be sepsis of the right leg. In 2013, I was in a car accident which left a wound on my right calf which, for the next ten years continued to open and close and eventually became septic. From that day in January till min March, I was unconscious; partially due to the sedation and partially due to what was to come. During the months of January and February, I coded 5 different times. The first code required 45 minutes of CPR to revive me. Within those months I also became an amputee. The doctors at one point told my wife that it was either my leg or my life, there wasn‚Äôt room for both. My wife did the only sensible thing and had them amputate my right leg above the knee.   
  
During these initial months, I had a tracheotomy, was placed on a ventilator, lost the ability to stand or walk on my own due to the trauma of losing my right leg and everything else that happened during my stay in the ICU.  
  
Today during PT, we attempted to stand, and it really broke me when I couldn‚Äôt. I have a bed sore on my tailbone from my stay in the ICU. They couldn‚Äôt move me at all during a period when I was on EKMO and Impala which were keeping my heart and lungs functioning. It was during this period that the sore became a thing. Unfortunately, because of the placement of the wound, the pain is immense most of the time and spikes when I move, it is touched, or I lay on a hard surface. When the pain became so much, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore while trying to stand, I became depressed and now feel very much a failure. Logically, I know that I have been through hell and back, so not being able to stand the first time I tried isn‚Äôt truly a failure, however my mind doesn‚Äôt always follow logic. I have cried off and on all day, feeling like I will never live a somewhat normal life again. I fear I will be wheelchair bound the rest of my life and that, though I am still in rehab, I have reached my peak performance from here on out.   
  
After all has been said and done, I feel a little better getting some of this off my chest to complete strangers. I still feel down, still feel like I am a bit of a failure, but I know eventually, I will be my old self.

"As a 24-year-old guy, I'm looking for advice on how to overcome the challenges I faced during my childhood with strict and controlling parents. Growing up, my parents were extremely strict and had a lot of rules that didn't allow me to have any freedom or independence. As a result, I didn't have many friends and felt isolated from my peers. My parents also painted a fake picture of our life to others, always praising me and saying I was a good child who didn't do anything wrong. In reality, I didn't have the social skills or experiences that other kids my age had because my parents saw things like dating and having sex as taboo.

"i've had an issue with this show since it came out. it's not a good portrayal of autism/the struggles of autism at all, and what infuriates me the most is how shaun's actor (freddie highmore) is NOT AUTISTIC!! he says he prepared for his role by ""talking to people in his life with autism and watching autism documentaries."" it wouldve been so much better if the writers or actors were actually ND. plus, the whole plot of every episode is:
shaun had a bad childhood. and hes autistic with savant syndrome. his coworkers think little of him because hes autistic and constantly doubt everything he says. fast forward near the end of the episode and turns out he was right all along! and then repeat that for six seasons across anywhere from 18-22 episodes per season. another issue i have with it is the whole attitude of ""autism is a superpower!!"" that goes on through the show. for instance, because shaun has autism he can.. visualize things?? like, he'll stare off into space and information/diagrams of the human body appear around him? üò≠üò≠
plus the whole viral clip of him sobbing and having a meltdown about not being called a surgeon is PAINFULLY IRONIC considering in another episode he continually refers to a transgender patient by their assigned gender, despite having it explained to him several times..
i could complain and rant about this show for HOURS!! it makes me so mad and annoyed to see autism portrayed in such a harmful way. autism is NOT a superpower, the entire show just gets autism all wrong, and when it's shown to tens of millions of people, they're all going to think that's how autism works. it doesn't just give you innate abilities to do stuff, it's a lifelong struggle to be seen as normal and it's exhausting.

"I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but... I'm at my wits end.

&#x200B;

Two days ago, I suffered what is possibly a seizure in the morning, and although I am already dealing with that with my neurologist, and my psychiatrist knows about these too, I don't know what to do now.

For the two days since, I've been beyond myself anxious, like... I have this feeling in my gut telling me like something terrible is going to happen. I feel like my body wanted to quiver. I feel like I almost want to cry, and I have no idea what to do.

I'm already pretty well versed with anxiety, been on meds since 18 YO (26M rn), and am taking 225 mgs of venlafaxine (For anxiety) and 600-900 mgs of valproate (for the epilepsy) + have clonazepam 0.5mg tablets on hand.

Had one pill of the clonazepam I keep for acute anxiety attacks, but... I guess, I'm asking -- How do you people deal with these anxiety episodes like this? I'm literally worried of everything, and nothing seems to be able to distract me. I'm worried I won't be able to fall asleep, that I'll be tired, and that might lead to further seizures. 

It always takes me about a week to get back to normal after a seizure, but after the last one, I think it's the worst it has ever been and I'm just lost of how I could calm myself down T-T",4,anxiety
"I can't do anything, literally anything, without the fear of suddenly having some sort of serious medical episode and dying. It interferes with everything I do.  
  
I can barely sleep. Whenever I try to sleep I suddenly start to feel dizzy and get jolted awake. Or I'll feel a random pain and start to actually believe that I'm dying. It doesn't matter if I'm tired or not my mind will just not let me sleep. Trying to take my mind off of it by doing things I enjoy like playing video games, watching YouTube, or going on walks doesn't work. The thoughts are still there. I'm constantly checking my pulse. Constantly googling symptoms. Constantly fighting the urge to go to the ER. I can't stop it and nothing I do helps.

I feel like I'm not myself. I was perfectly fine until 3 months ago. I can't afford therapy and all of my doctors appointments are so far from now. My mental health is the worst it's ever been.",4,anxiety

"I'm 33. I feel like I don't have enough time to figure all this out. My main issue is OCD but this sub is more active and helpful than others.  
I have to do months of therapy and medication experiments to deal with the OCD. Then I need to get an ADHD therapist for months to help me improve my executive function.  
Then I have years of trauma to somehow deal with.  
Then I have a devastating breakup that just happened to deal with.  
Then I have a career change to make because I'm unhappy and can't afford my very high cost of living area.  
How on earth can I do all this. I have limited time, energy, and money. I can't possibly spend as much of any of them that I need to do deal with all these issues and it feels like I'll have to try and get by with a bunch of accumulated damage. Like if my mental illness had been caught earlier so much damage could have been avoided. But it wasn't and now I'm left with the burden of trying to make myself a whole healthy functional human being and most of what brings me joy has to get neglected because we live in a capitalist hellscape that demands constant productivity and high earning in order to be secure.   
I'm working on it and making slow progress. The mountain ahead of me feels impossible though.",3,adhd

"I feel like this happens to me too much. I get cast off by friends and my spot gets filled by someone else. I feel like I'm always the least favourite and most forgettable/least valuable. I've gotten really close to someone online over the past five years but have always felt this fear in the back of my head that I'll never be special and will be forgotten about eventually. It kind of happened a few times in minor ways but I would always isolate myself first before I could be isolated, then I would reunite with her when I felt the threat of being replaced was gone. We've visited each other several times in person and spent a week or so at a time at each other's homes. I would consider her my best friend and that my fear of being replaced just gets in the way of me embracing that fully.

I get really scared whenever she mentions meeting other friends. I know this isn't healthy and is just a product of my irrational fear. I'm planning on travelling to meet her in less than two weeks. She's just told me that she doesn't know if we're going to be able to see each other again for the rest of the year, at least not the summer, because she wants to get a job and is planning on having a different long distance friend over, who happens to have the exact same name and hairstyle and glasses and eye colour as me, and she doesn't want to have both of us over at the same time since we don't know each other.. I don't know how to cope with this. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for almost half my life and I've been getting better recently but this has pushed me back several steps. I can't even talk to her about this because I know this is a completely irrational fear but it's too much of a coincidence, it's driving me crazy. I truly can't cope with the idea of being swapped out for some other girl who looks the exact same as I do and has the same name. It's too much.",5,paranoia

"Has anyone else felt like it‚Äôs been communicated by many autistics that you can‚Äôt be happy with your autism?

I was diagnosed almost a year ago. Autism is my special interest. As soon I received an official diagnosis, my life was filled with happiness. I already wanted to wear autism shirts, pins, etc. as it‚Äôs my special interest, but finally being able to call myself autistic made my life so much happier. I wanted to ‚Äúfill my life‚Äù with autism.

I was proud of my autism for a while. Until I started seeing posts about how too many people think positively about their autism. 

Now, within recent months, my life has been filled with negativity. I started focusing on how shit it is to live with this disorder. I‚Äôm crying all the time, hating myself more, and praying to God my symptoms get better somehow. 

I‚Äôm filled with hate.

While life has buried me in embarrassment and self hatred, part of me thought ‚Äòthis is exactly how you‚Äôre supposed to feel about your autism‚Äô. But is it?

I‚Äôm tired of that. I want to love my autism again. Desperately. *Everyday* is a struggle comparing myself to neurotypicals and putting myself down for every basic thing I can‚Äôt f-cking do.

"Backstory: I do a lot of internet deep dives, usually looking for obscure media. I never look for anything illegal. I always stay on the surface web, I don't actually know how to use the deep web. Sometimes these sites are not in English.

I'm afraid of us getting hacked or looking our internet connection because of something I looked up. I'm afraid of my family thinking that I am some sort of weirdo.

We moved last year and had to switch to a different ISP. It's satellite, so we have limited data, so we can check on how much we have. For some reason I'm worried my family will look at my internet logs and question me about it. I feel like I have to sometimes ask them about what they are looking at it listen in on them. Although, they usually just stuff like pay bills or look up landscaping stuff. Our anti virus software also logs our history, and we tend to check on that more frequently.

I have a collection of cosplay photos, nothing that's too NSFW. Many of these pictures come from a behind the scenes blog from a Japanese adult film studio, that uses a lot of well made and detailed costumes. I have no interest in the adult films they produce, I want only pictures of the costumes. I was looking though their archives recently, I had that open in one tab, in another tab I was looking up information about an obscure foreign kids movie. I got this paranoid thought that, because I had NSFW content in one tab and information about a children's movie in the other, the feds would mistake me for looking at CP. I thought that they might come to my house and search our stuff and my family would be mad at me.

Next up is that I torrent shows. I have an external drive full of old TV shows and anime. Sometimes the batch files can be large, so I try to download little bits at a time, as to not use too much data. I'm worried I'll end up using all of our data. Our ISP, doesn't turn off our access, but would slow it down a lot. 

Although I use a VPN, I'm worried that our ISP will send me a copywriter strike letter. I'm not sure what I was do if I was in some sort of legal trouble. I don't know how I would even pay for the fees. I don't have much money, that's why I still live at home.

I once posted about someone using my father's SSN to open up a bank account, me thinking it was something I did, even though I would never give it to anyone, nor do I even know it. I don't even use the same computer as him, so I don't know why I thought that. (We later learned that two of my mother's patients had the exact same thing happen from the exact same bank.)

Finally, just yesterday when we were having landscaping done, an SUV pulled up near our house. I buy got out, wrote something down, then left. My dad thinks he was here to do estimates about our yard, but left because we already had someone out here. (My parents called around to get estimates, two of the companies sent out guys to look at our yard without telling us they were coming. My dad thinks it's a case of that.) My first thought is someone was spying on us.

I keep telling myself that I need to stop doing this stuff. I'm not looking at anything illegal. I've been doing this for years, and it was never a problem. I don't know why I'm so worried now. I think that it might be because that things are different now. It's stupid to worry this much, about what would amount to nothing. I know that it's extremely unlikely that someone would come for me. It would take too much time and money to go after just one out of millions of people who the same, if not worse stuff than as me.

I'm mostly worried about what my family would think of me, if they knew about this. I'm afraid of having an awkward conversation about it and their opinion of me changing. I'm horrible at talking about uncomfortable things, and feel like I'd end up getting physically sick, something that had happened before when I became overly nervous.

Can anyone give me some advice? I feel like I need it.",5,paranoia

Jumped on reddit and saw a post on r/AITA where some dude was complaining about how his girlfriend was introverted & didn‚Äôt like to socialise with anyone including his friends (she would not stop him from doing his own thing with his friends and socialising with whoever, she just didn‚Äôt want to partake)  so he staged an ambush on her where he invited her around to his house and then invited his friends as well without her knowing. She tried to be amicable with his friends but was obviously anxious, became ‚Äúmute‚Äù as he put it and snuck out the back door 30 mins later. He then goes on to say how childish she is for not being able to deal with 1hr of talking. The general consensus was that he was the asshole for staging an ambush on her BUT she was the asshole for not wanting to socialise with anyone and that she should be socialising with him & his friends for the sake of the relationship. 

I really couldn‚Äôt believe that people were saying she was an asshole for not wanting to socialise with people. Honestly reading those comments made my anxiety skyrocket. They all had thousands of upvotes too meaning people agreed‚Ä¶ now I can‚Äôt help but think that I am even more of a piece of shit for having anxiety and not being able to socialise. Whatever i guess. Just ranting. That whole thread reinforced my negative beliefs.",4,anxiety

"first of all, I hope this is the right sub reddit to post this

I have thought about me might having depression for quite a while now. Lately it has been such a string feeling, that I've considered seeing a doctor, reading about experiences from others and taking those quizzes on Google.

I know they don't replace a doctor I can talk to and sometimes I had to pick answers which aren't particularly true because they were kinda in the middle, if that makes sense. I've taken about 10 quizzes and they all said either I could have low or moderate depression.

The reason why I'm thinking about it is because I've felt this void inside of me I never could fill, I have no energy to do basic daily things, like cooking, vacuuming or buying groceries. I'm living with my mom and only clean up when she cones home from her boyfriend who live about an hour away, if I don't have anything to cook or whatever I can always visit my dad so that's a good thing ig. 
Anyway, I also have always felt like I don't belong, or that I feel home nowhere. No matter where I moved I never felt like home. 

One of the questions in the quizzes was if I enjoy things less then I used too and I like doing many thing, like playing bass guitar, doing vocals or drawing and playing games. But literally the only thing I'm motivated to do is either sleeping, playing games or sometimes drawing.

I feel like I have depression not severe depression, I've never even thought about harming myself or commuting suicide or anything but just all of the things above make me wonder if I have depression.

I really wanna see a doctor about this but I also really wanna try getting better without meds. 

I'm just wondering if anybody has the same experience or what are your experience? Is there a chance to treat depressions without meds?",2,depression

"So, I've had a pretty big paranoid episode in my life. Involved me thinking the Devil was trying to kill me and the government was tracking me down and stuff like that. I call it an episode because I'm able to define it within a certain part of my life, and since then haven't had those thoughts. 

But, ever since, I feel like I'm paranoid about the prospect of ever being that paranoid again. Basically it'll manifest in certain ways--there's this one person I keep seeing pass me on the sidewalk every time, and rather than think ""this person is following me"" I think to myself instinctively, ""well if I was paranoid I would think this person is following me, but I'm not."" It's like my paranoid habits are the same of being so watchful and attentive but now my brain frames it as ""well that would be concerning to a paranoid person, but obviously you aren't paranoid. Right?""

Does anyone relate to this or at least have some advice? Is this a sign that paranoia is just gonna be my thing forever? Because it's very tiring.",5,paranoia

"I finally mustered up the courage to ask my psych for an ADHD eval. I got the results yesterday.

I do, in fact, have ADHD (primarily inattentive type) but she said I scored way higher on the autism part of the test. I'm really not sure how I feel about a memory/focus test being used to diagnose autism? I'm not a medical professional but that just doesn't make sense to me. 

I also didn't realize I was being tested *for* autism. I thought I was just taking an ADHD assessment. I feel kind of violated about it? Not that I'm mad about being autistic (I have suspected for a while now) but I wasn't really interested in pursuing a diagnosis because

1. There's no ""treatment"" for it
2. I've heard you can be denied medical care for being of unsound mind or whatever

So yeah I'm kinda miffed that that's on my medical record now. I don't really need another reason for doctors to belittle me and talk to me like I'm stupid.

The other reason I'm upset is that my psychiatrist seems reluctant to prescribe stimulants to me because my ADHD ""isn't severe enough"" (compared to the autism I guess? idk) even though I've already expressed that I'm struggling with task initiation and follow through, as well as time blindness- which is all severely affecting my work.

She increased my Wellbutrin rx and said we'll meet again in 6 weeks to see how that's working. If there's no impovement, she'll add strattera. Hopefully things will improve, but I'm also worried that if they don't, she won't want to try a stimulant.

She very briefly mentioned some behavior therapy to ""help"" with the autism (and I mean very brief). I'm hoping it was more of a ""this is a thing that exists"" comment and not a ""this is a thing you should do"" comment, but I'm still wary. I don't really struggle with the ""classic"" neurotypical ideas of what an autistic person struggles with. And I also couldn't give less of a shit if people think I'm weird or hard to talk to (although I think the general consensus is that I'm funny and easy to get along with).

I like her as a psychiatrist, she has generally been very good at listening to me and letting me decide what kind of medication I need. I guess I'm just worried she's going to start treating me differently now because she knows I have autism.",1,autism

"last year at 22 I got diagnosed with adhd and have been on vyvanse ever since. it has helped a lot school wise but i didn‚Äôt realize until now all the other issues that adhd has caused. 

my boyfriend that i was dating for over a year just broke up with me and i‚Äôve finally realized that it was adhd causing so many issues for me in our relationships as well as my difficulty to make/ keep friends my whole life. 

I didn‚Äôt even realize what the true issue was until i started to research adhd more and it has finally made my whole life struggles make more sense. 

but now i am also struggling with the guilt of ruining my relationship with someone who meant a lot to me. i struggled with emotional dysregulation a lot which made me cause a lot of fights as well as not being able to communicate how i felt effectively. i struggled to be social with his friends sometimes out of fear of rejection even though they were always nice to me. 

i know that not understanding my adhd made it impossible to stop these issues. now that i do know i‚Äôm working on managing it so that i can avoid these problems in the future. i just wish i would‚Äôve known sooner.

I‚Äôve started seeing a counsellor to help me work on it. I just hope that one day he‚Äôll give me another chance. I know i made a lot of mistakes and it sucks that i didn‚Äôt even know that i was doing it till it was too late. i know that i need to work on it to have a healthy relationship. I just know that i wouldn‚Äôt have lost him if i didn‚Äôt have adhd. i am already improving and hope to continue improving each day. i know i needed to learn this about myself and grow as a person but i just really hope there‚Äôs another chance for us in the future.",3,adhd
"It's a Ruger Redhawk in .44 Mag. I was lined up on the brainstem through the soft palate. I was fantasizing about how nice it would be to just turn off instantly. Like flipping a switch and making all of the hurt just go away.

I see posts here of people talking about how rarely they shower. Or how hard it is to force themselves to eat or go outside. I get up every day. I shower, I shave, I groom myself. I eat. I go to work and maintain performance. I interact and socialize. I paint a smile on and continue moving forward. It feels necessary, but meaningless at the same time. I'm not allowed to leave. It's not fair. I have people who rely on me. To teach them  how to perform safely and get through high stress, dangerous conditions. Two beautiful children who need guidance and support. But I feel so empty.

The medication does nothing to alleviate the suffering. I have therapy every week and it's all I look forward to. But once that hour is over, it's back to this unbearably painful existence. The one person who ever made me feel joy in this life is gone. I've lost all interest in everything that once I was passionate about. For 30 years I've toughed it out. And I thought that I had been sent a savior. But, like everything else that provided any relief, it's been torn away. Leaving me lower than I ever was before. And I've almost done it before.

I work in conditions that most would consider unacceptable. And I've always loved it. I'm not scared. But I have such a fragile heart. I have so much love to give, and I feel like everyone just takes it, and leaves with it. It builds in me until it hurts. I need someone to give it to or it's going to kill me.

I really wish the best for everyone. And I hold out hope that, somewhere in this world, joy does still exist. Even if it will never be mine.",2,depression

Along the way, I‚Äôm constantly searching for ways to help myself get through the struggle I have with my perception of what people are thinking of me. Especially the work life.

Navigating through the minefield of paranoia has always been a struggle but I have always found a way back to a place where I forget that paranoia has a strangle hold of my happiness. Then, not before long, the cycle starts all over and I‚Äôm once again at it‚Äôs mercy. My self perception and paranoia are happy to see each other to pick up where they have left off.

This time around, it‚Äôs different with the pandemic and how the entire world has made a massive mental  shift. Having everything and everyone under a microscope seems to have become the new black and who knows what the short -long term effects will be on our psyche.

Hi everyone, I'm sorry if this goes a bit long but I really need some advice...I've had awful anxiety my whole life, and I'm also diagnosed with ASD and ADHD. About a month and a half ago I started on some new medication and I feel like it's really made some good changes for me, but is also opens but some issues. I've been working with the idea that I wanted to do something in childcare because I have a qualification and it's something I know I can do. Since the medication has kicked in though I feel like I finally have the ability and motivation to study and do something with my life that I'd be more exited about..unfortunately i have absolutely no idea what that is. I need a job to pay my bills because I'm 23 and out of home, and I'm worried that I wouldn't have time to study anyway..but I really just can't see myself enjoying childcare much more and I don't know what to do and it's sending me into a spiral. I've taken so many career quizes and there are so mmay results that seem interesting to me, hut I know I can't do them all but I can't seem to get it down to just one...

Am I doomed to just be in this job I hate forever because I missed my opportunity to study what I wanted to because of my mental health? I could really use some advice...I appreciate it",4,anxiety
"Does anyone else feel like they are the world's biggest hypocrite? It's so frustrating because on one hand I understand my rationalization for the way I do things, and it feels justified. On the other hand, I can't help but feel like a bad person for setting different standards for others than I do for myself.

I know I struggle with time management, and I work so hard to be punctual and prepared. However, it doesn't always work out - sometimes I am late and sometimes I forget things. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect that I am understanding and gracious if others keep me waiting or are unprepared, right? Wrong. It feels like they have committed a personal offence against me. Like they are intentionally disrespectful. Obviously I would never say or do anything to convey this - I am am always polite and understanding because logically I know sh*t happens sometimes. But I still feel so guilty for being so upset by something I know I do often enough myself.

And there is more. I often interrupt people when they're busy, but I hate being interrupted. I live and work in my own cluttered spaces, but hate when people leave their clutter lying around. I often zone out when people are telling me things, and have to ask them to repeat themselves. But I feel in my whole body the frustration and irritation when someone isn't paying attention to what I'm saying. It's such a double standard and I know it doesn't make sense, but it's like an emotional reflex I have no control over. 

I feel like I can never voice these feelings because it's not fair to others, and it's not their fault that I react so strongly to other people exhibiting my worst traits. I feel like I spend so much of my time policing my own behaviour and making sure I don't act in a way that reflects my initial gut feeling. I don't want to come across as manipulative, or that I think my needs are more important than the needs of others. I just feel like a bad person and a bad friend sometimes because no matter how courteous I am outwardly, on the inside there's this mess of negative emotions I constantly have to push down. It's a never ending cycle of feeling like everyone is against me, and then feeling horrible for not being empathetic towards others, and then feeling hopeless because I can't help it.

Not to mention I've already ghosted him twice during a depressive episode and he's been patient and gentle with me through it which just makes me feel worse and through no fault of his own makes me feel more like the dumb little mentally ill pet that he says nice things to in order to placate me so I don't do anything stupid.

So naturally my awful gremlin brain latches onto the idea that either 1. he's just complimenting my abilities so much to humor me because I'm his sad loser friend who doesn't have the attention span to do anything *but* write and he pities me (bolstered by the fact that he tends to not actually have any criticisms of my work despite them constantly being contrived, formulaic and absolutely *riddled* with typos) or 2. if it's so good then one day he'll steal my ideas and put them forth as his own because he actually has a body of work posted that people like and expect more of and he wants to keep up with demand (I've been too much of a coward to share my work with anyone but him thus far). I have no reason to believe either of these, especially not the second one. The first one maybe, I can definitely see him being the type to be too nice to accurately call me out on my BS especially now that he knows I'm depressed but there is *literally* no evidence of him stealing other people's work and even if he did, his stuff's already good, he wouldn't need to market my trash ideas as his own, and he's just a good-hearted, talented and (I pray) honest person who doesn't deserve to be suspected of something so underhanded.

I feel awful because he's great and absolutely deserves a friend who isn't an obsessive paranoid little freak and he's always telling me how much he likes talking to me and it just puts me more on edge cuz I'm always anticipating the day that he no longer likes talking to me and this is why it's easier to just not have friends, as sad as I am when I'm alone >\_\_\_>

Even when we're just speaking about random stuff, I always get the feeling that I'm asking too many questions or misunderstanding too many things or just plain being an idiot and he always reassures me that I'm not and I'm fine but *of course* he'd say that if he didn't want to hurt my feelings by being upfront about what an awkward weirdo I am >\_\_\_\_\_\_>

"Sorry in advance this is a little long. 

A little background information, my ex boyfriend has what i'd say are paranoid visual/auditory hallucinations and I don't know if it's possible that it stems from his trust issues or his previous drug usage (acid/shrooms/weed) He would usually project onto me and accuse me of cheating, which I never did. I tried my hardest to reassure him.

There have been prior instances where he's accused me of cheating, however this is the first time he's gotten 'proof'. I had been living in a new apartment with my mom for just about a month. We were sleeping on skype as we did every night, but this one night he recorded the call. 

The video is dark, there are no lights in my room, the only light is what's coming from my laptop screen. In the video you can hear me exhale and groan/moan 'mm-mmm' (the closed mouth version of no, if that makes sense) and that's when you can hear me and clearly see me turn over in my sleep as my arm is now visible. I make the same 'mm-mmm' noise and then there's what sounds like someone else's voice whispering ""come on"" and in response to it, I give out a short groan/moan, 'mmmgh' ( I don't really know how else to describe the sound, but it's like a response someone would give if someone was bothering you in your sleep). Shortly after he wakes up and shines his phone flashlight into the screen, lighting up my room and making both, my face and body visible. My eyes are closed and my arm is in the position it was when I turned around. (he unmuted himself afterwards which made the audio quieter, getting rid of the loud waterfall noise that was happening throughout the video) 

When he shared the video with me, his first and only belief is I cheated, which is frustrating considering he believes in more spiritual/paranormal things, whereas I don't, but I heard the 'voice' as well. I tried to reassure him the best I could considering I was asleep. I started thinking a bit irrationally, like maybe someone was speaking through the vent above me, or because it is a new apartment maybe maintenance or someone is coming in everynight to talk to me? maybe it's my own voice, but it doesn't sound like me. I even started thinking maybe I have DID   
maybe I just heard this noise too many times that it's just ingrained into my mind forever as ""come on"" 

 I really have no idea and its truly always bothered me that he never believed me. I'm genuinely just left wondering what it was or if anything at all.",5,paranoia
"Recently I've found myself to be increasingly paranoid about the possibility of being cyberstalked, having my personal info leaked, and having my reputation ruined by things that happened online. Like a lot of people, I did some pretty dumb shit on the internet as a teenager, and lied a lot about myself. I used a different moniker online for the most part, but was dumb enough to tell about a dozen people my real last name. It's not one-of-a-kind, but it's fairly uncommon in the US (about 2,500 people) Yes, I looked it up, because that's how much I worry about this. About 3 people out of them know my legal name, with my real first name. 

Now I'm filled with the fear that these people will try to look me up years in the future, harass me, post malicious content online that could be looked up by my employers, try to contact my family members, etc. I considered them friends, and I don't think they harbor any ill will toward me. One of them definitely didn't like me, but they were extremely non-confrontational and avoided any difficult conversations, so I don't think they would try to do anything.

I know this is irrational, but this fear has consumed my life for the past month to the point where I subsequently fear having any sort of reputation that would make me searchable online in the future. Just on the off chance that these people would hold a grudge.",5,paranoia

"I have recently noticed that my behavior and thought patterns deviate from others' considerably, in that mine are much more paranoid and guarded. I don't believe *everyone* is out to get me and I am capable of some degree of trust (only fully trust one person), but I am constantly evaluating everything I say and do in fear someone will use it against me. And this does not just apply to saying something that can be taken badly, no, but also to, for example, revealing seemingly innocent information about myself that others seem to have no issue divulging. Ironically, my paranoia prevents me from going into detail here, but a good example is how I am paranoid to let people know my birthday, and when asked, I will only begrudgingly and hesitantly answer.

I see other people have no such issues with talking about such minor things about themselves, but I am constantly guarded for the not nonexistent possibility of malicious people somehow somewhere finding information that can be used to harm me. I am also incredibly paranoid when leaving my residence, often distrusting strangers on the streets and even going as far as to imagine in detail how a specific stranger who happened to glance at me plans to harm me and how I should react in that situation, constructing a very specific scenario in my head over such inconsequential occurrences. Is this a cause for concern? Is this a sign of a form of clinical paranoia? Is this something I should consult a doctor or a professional regarding, or is it mild/normal? I find the constant stress of reevaluating every tiny thing out of fear very exhausting, but I'm not sure if this is a mental issue I may be facing. To clarify, I do suffer from several mental illnesses, so having something paranoia related or my paranoia being a result of one of them would not be a far fetched assumption.

"I tried looking this up but could only find people reporting the exact opposite problem...

I can never cry when I'm alone; honestly, I never feel emotions very strongly at all when I'm alone. I'm a 25 y/o man and I consider myself to have a healthy view on crying/emotional release.

I generally consider myself to be a very emotional person. When my girlfriend tells me a sad story from her childhood, I'll tear up. When she says something sweet to me, I'll also tear up. I frequently cry at touching moments in movies, both happy and sad (I guess this is an exception to the ""alone"" thing, but I still feel like I have some emotional company and something to cry about).

I'll occasionally tear up a bit when answering a question from my therapist. Otherwise, I have an extremely hard time crying alone or about my own life, even when I feel exceedingly sad. 

For some context about me: I've dealt with anxiety and depression for most of my life now. I've also struggled with some fairly serious physical health conditions as an adult as well as severe chronic pain.",2,depression

"Last night, I lost it. I cut myself in other one place I can feel it. More than a year ago now, I injured my leg badly in a vehicle accident and today, there's some nerve damage that prevents me from feeling that area. 
So last night while I was taking a shower, I heard someone aggressively banging on the door and pulling at the knob and it scared the absolute shit out of me. Believing it was my mom, I unlocked the door and told her the door was unlocked if she needed in, while I hid back in the shower. We do this sort of thing all the time. Being too anxious to finish my shower, I opened my door to ask if everything was okay because I was getting no response from anybody. So I put my clothes on as fast as I could and as I was doing so, I heard my Step Dad say he threw up. Mom was super pissed but kept insisting everything was fine.
I knew better though. This made me so upset last night that after having a long cry session, I tool pit my scalpel and completely hacked up my leg.

"Hi, I don‚Äôt know how to continue with my life. 
A bit of contest here. 
I‚Äôm 21f and I was diagnosed with depression in the last months by my therapist. I always had depressing thoughts during my life and also some suicidal ones but I‚Äôve never ever done anything in the concrete, I think I was too scared (just one time I tried to take a lot of meds together but I stopped and asked for help). 
I never considered myself ill, nor everyone around me. I have the perfect family and I live in a privileged contest, middle class kind (not rich but I always had what I wanted). Others think I‚Äôm a pretty girl, skinny and very gifted in social contests, outgoing, always first in my classes with fantastic grades, not very good at sports but it‚Äôs not important. I‚Äôm very empathetic and always had some kind of ‚Äúperception of the deepness‚Äù around me, and my therapist says it‚Äôs a gift. I write, sing, and have too many hobbies including gaming, reading, painting and so on. I‚Äôm the gifted kid of the extended family and the good girl type, that did something rebel only one or two times. Now I study history and work as an emergency rescuer. I have tons of friends in real life and also online. I wanna be a writer.
I have the perfect life, I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôm so lucky and I just don‚Äôt understand why I am ‚Ä¶ I am depressed. I know I had problems in my growing. I was the loser, always bullied by everyone and against me there was intellectual and actual violence. I had to be always perfect because of my parents and my family, I am the first of the grandchildrens and so I‚Äôm the role model. At 19 I had a toxic relationship that leaved me with the fear of love and also a little stomach sindrome caused by anxiety, but never less, I didn‚Äôt have a real trauma. A REAL one like a bad family or rape or something like that. I always been dark and sad all my life and i know that when I was a child I was so happy and a little overwhelming so others will call me ‚Äústrange‚Äù or ‚Äúfreak‚Äù but I was so innocent and wanted the friendship of all of them. (I want to return to be that happy, like a child.)but this was never something like real real trauma.
Now I‚Äôm here, trapped in my bed every time I return from work. When I am at work I am someone that is happy and I help others and fight in very difficult situation but when i return home I just turn off. The worse thing it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm numb every time, also when I am happy at work. I worsened in the last weeks and I‚Äôm trying to don‚Äôt see my friends and it‚Äôs working. I have a deadline for my university studies soon and I didn‚Äôt study. I feel useless and I hate so much myself. I hate the way I look, the way I act, the way I think and the way I am. I hate every inch of my being in this world. I want to see my self being wrong and fall into the deep end. I love my friends and I will do anything for them, they deserve the world and I want to cancel myself for them. Right now I have only two girl friends that I try to be in contact with but three days ago I messed up over a very stupid thing because I panicked and with my anxiety I didn‚Äôt responded to them. Part of me don‚Äôt want to lose them but the other part knows I want to be alone cause I think I deserve to suffer, I deserve cause I‚Äôm an horrible person. I feel like an impostor that it‚Äôs acting all her life and everyone just sees the good things while I‚Äôm so horrible and selfish. My therapist it‚Äôs trying to convince me that it‚Äôs all in my head but I don‚Äôt believe her. I sincerely think I am a freak, a bad person, a sociopath of some kind. I don‚Äôt deserve the life I have and had , I don‚Äôt now why I had such a good childhood and I will happily switch it with someone more worth of my family and the ppl I have around me. I don‚Äôt deserve anything. Im wrong. And now my two bff are so angry with me, I tried to explain them I panicked and I wanted to write to them, not ignore them, but I didn‚Äôt have the courage because im so scared of the anger of others. If they go away how will I do? It will be the end? I‚Äôm not lucid, idk what is happening in me or around me I just wanna sleep all the time. I try to seek help from my Parents but they are convinced it‚Äôs the period cause it‚Äôs spring and everyone it‚Äôs a little sad and tired and I said to them that I have depression but everyone it‚Äôs a little depressed don‚Äôt you think? I don‚Äôt know what am I doing and I don‚Äôt know how I will live a peaceful life if it will be always like this. I feel so alone and if I try to explain I just seems to victimise myself so the others Will be around me. Am I doing it? I don‚Äôt know anymore. 
I don‚Äôt want to un live myself but I don‚Äôt want to live also right now. How can I go on? 
I hate myself so much cause I just created problems when my life it‚Äôs perfect. I‚Äôm such a loser, a drama queen, idk, just a fucking pathetic self-centred girl with a god complex i think

Note: This may count as an update to a previous post.

For context, me and this guy decided to rekindle our relationship, and are attempting to take things slow. A lot happened between us, and he seems to be doing better now.

But, my anxiety is and has always been really bad, and I'm afraid it will push him away. From thinking he's ignoring me when he doesn't text, to wondering if he'll find someone else, someone better, you name it. But rest assured, none of this is his fault. He is a very sweet guy, never cheated, very honest, always reassures me when I need it, and above all he's never harsh or rough to me during a disagreement. All in all, a good guy. He's not perfect, obviously, but who is?

However, my anxiety gets to me fairly often, which causes me to overthink. I do my best to push it aside or distract myself, but of course, it gets to me. Unfortunately, I have a hard time communicating to him that something is wrong. He might ask if I'm okay if I seem off, and I'll say ""I'm fine."" ""Don't worry."" Don't get me wrong, I am well aware why I tend to do this, and I will add that context, and more if needed. So I'll move on with the big question.

How do I deal with anxiety? Does anyone have tips? Anything is appreciated, thank you in advance.

I can't go 1 hour without thinking about her, or worrying if she's safe and alright. Other times I wonder what's going to happen to us when she feels ready to talk to me again.

Will she still love me, will she even want me in her life? Is it even possible for a LDR to work out after 2 past breakups, or am I just telling myself that it is so I don't hurt myself again.

"Like many, I'm suffering from this shortage. As a result, I haven't been able to get my Concerta (and/or generic) in over a month.

People keep telling me to try asking about another medication, trying something else, and it's driving me nuts thinking about it. It's not like you can call a pharmacy, they tell you ""Sorry we're out of X"" and you can just say ""Well, what *do* you have?"" 

Making appointments is rough enough, but imagine they change you over to something else, the Pharmacy doesn't have that either, so you're right back where you started and then have to make ANOTHER appointment to get ANOTHER prescription for ANOTHER medication

All of this on top of the fact that while I get it (controlled substance and all) I hate that prescriptions expire. ""You didn't fill it in time, so you need to make another appointment and get another""

I didn't fill it in time because you didn't have it though, so how does any of that make sense? (other than, again, controlled substance and all that)

&#x200B;

On top of all that, I can't help but think ""Well if others are in the same boat as me, but they're tripping and fading off instead of repeatedly trying to get their meds, maybe I can get mine if enough of them..."" and I feel so crappy about that. I feet crappy about all of this.

"I‚Äôll start off by saying I‚Äôm medicated and have been for several years. Any progress or limitations are directly related to this. My relationship with the voices has changed greatly since the beginning when I tried time and again to eliminate them with meds. That did not happen. 

When that was over I began ascending a long road toward acceptance and then curiosity. At first, I used meds and accepted that the voices were here and that I‚Äôm not compelled to do stupid shit anymore. The therapist said I was managing. Well, it felt like a crap job but if I was managing so be it. Then years flew by and I delved into a few insightful books like Schizophrenia Complex and this led me on a long journey inward where I skimmed the edges of some deep spiritual thinking. 

Now, it‚Äôs not as though the voices are to be banished. Instead, they are there to remind me I have an inner life to attend to. When I‚Äôm at therapy, and being still and silent for some amount of time each day, I become more functional and enjoy my hours more, especially with family/friends. In short, I have to respect what I am to become stable. In this life that is enough.

Last thing, I believe it‚Äôs important for me not to be perfect all the time. When I attempt that it all goes to shit and life just laughs at me saying, ‚Äústop! That‚Äôs not really you!‚Äù As a result, I‚Äôve got some quirks to me, but it‚Äôs better than being involuntarily held once a year. Instead that‚Äôs happened 2x in 20 years.

"When I was about 13 or 14, in high school, i used to feel like someday, for whatever reason, someone (not someone in particular, just about anyone) would attack me. I started bringing box cutters in my jackets and eventually a knife in my backpack for self-defense. It pretty much went away when the pandemic started and we no longer had class in person, around spring of 2020.

By autumn of 2020, I had driven away a few online friends from me, because I kept thinking they hated me and were telling everyone I was a bad person and I would end up isolated, and I eventually lashed out at them.

And as of now, I fear most of my friends dislike me and at any time will make me an outcast. I dont know why I think that way, they have invited me to meet them in a few months and have even bought me a thing for when I go.

"Had to share this. Went through rejection.
As it is, have been a reserved, introverted socially awkard chap my whole life. I used to be in a military school for 6 years. Now I am 23.
Getting out of the military school and adapting to outside world was a tough thing but somehow got connected with some old friends from elementary school. Pretty nice people. These people pushed me to do a bit of socializing. I always stayed away from girls on my own. But during one of these sudden hangouts, I met this girl who is a jolly and friendly person, quite gregarious as well. Slowly fell for her though I got to meet her only twice. Let me call her 'P' for now. Then on, I texted her once in a while but nothing other than some casual conversations. I realized that I do have something for her but never knew how to go ahead or approach her. 'P' used to have a boyfriend who cheated on her and messed things up for her. 
Someday, I was asked by one of my friends to approach her but I didn't pay any heed to his words. Later on, I realized that I should give it a try by asking her out though I accepeted that most likely I will get rejected.
I decided to do this by writing a note and send it to her through a mutual friend of 'P'. I talked to this mutual friend (another girl) of her and explained this to her. She said it was quite a nice idea and be hopeful that it will be a 'yes' though I told her that I am not expecting such for reasons.
Then the note was handed over to 'P' and she said no. I was okay with it. But she added that she felt very uncomfortable because of this which basically makes me look like a creep.
Just these facts of unwillingly bothering someone I do like and getting passed on as a creep have messed me up from all possible ways. I feel like throwing up. Moreover, I don't know anyone to share this with. This happened two days ago. My exams are going on. Today while I went to attend my exams, a few minutes into it I realized I don't have any drive to finish the exam, all these intrusive thoughts engulfed my mind. I submitted the script with nothing on it. I am just horrified with the fact that this whole thing has started to affect other spheres of my life. Some friends have told me apologize to her (though I don't know how did I bother her), but the idea of reaching out to her again freaks me out. I don't know what's ahead. Some support and advice will be appreciated.
I pray and hope this happens to no one else again.",2,depression

"Days are blurring together, I'm not sad, but I'm not happy. I feel fake, like everything I do is premeditated and I have zero-control. I can't even remember what I ate for breakfast, school work has piled up and I'm scared to start trying to catch up. I'm such a burden, nothing I do is ever right. I wish I helped my mom more, I love her, but don't want to be around her. It's gonna hurt so damn bad when she dies, everything is going to go haywire, and she is going downhill. I'm almost 15, all my friends have part-time jobs and know what they are going to be when they grow up, while I'm over here trying my damn best to function. Functioning is probably the hardest part about all of this, I'm able to seem 'okay', but at what cost? Barely taking care of/caring about what I look like, what my room looks like? And my mom hates that I don't care what I look like half the time, but really, would she rather me lay in bed all day and let the dogs and chickens go hungry? UGH I DONT FREAKING KNOW ANYMORE, all that I know is that I HATE feeling like this, this weird, empty and angry feeling with an anxious buzz in the background. My chest feels heavy, but my stomach empty, with this ache that I can't rightly explain. I just want people to see that I am trying, that I'm a person too. Hell, I'm so disconnected from reality that my vision is blurry, I know what I'm seeing and I can describe it to people, but it's also like I'm watching a youtube video. The only reason that I even picked up photography was because I could actually *experience* the pictures. And hell, my mom wanted me when no-one else did, and now she's leaving too. She adopted me when my bio abandoned me, I don't know a thing about the lady, I was barely a year old. I had a brother I never knew and had to ATTEND his funeral. I don't want my mom to leave me like everybody else, sure I've got a sister and family I love and care about, but it's different with her. God I'm just so sick of it all, sometimes I want to comit suicide because then they'll wish they saw the signs but I know thats shitty of me, and other times I wish I could commit but I always shame myself down from it. I just don't want to exist anymore, not if it's always going to be like this. And for anyone even thinking that I should go to therapy, trust me, we have tried to get me in counseling, the places in my area don't take my insurance, and that crap is expensive, and frankly we are not in the best of financial situations right now. Nobody around me would understand if I told them, I've been this disconected since I was around 7, and I genuinely believe I don't deserve help, I deserve to suffer for all the bad shit I've done, and I know nobody agrees with that, but they would if they just knew the half of the crap I've done.

"So I'm 17y I've witnessed some things when I was young that I wasn't supposed to witness (such as a my parents abu$ing eachother)..I also didn't have a family like a cousin or a grandma because we don't talk to them.

When I was 14y I've seen my parents fighting in front of my face and I couldn't handle it so I went into a panic attack so I still have this panic attack from a time to time and sometimes without any reason!!.

So when I turned 17y exactly I start getting attached to any guy I talk to also girls! For example when I'm talking to a guy i just met and he's kind to me i tell myself omg I'm gonna be with him or I'm gonna marry him and I get attached to him so fast but when I meet someone else who's more kind to me i forget about the other person and I get attached to the second person and it's going like that...

After I talk to that person and they start ignoring I start crying and sometimes I feel depressed for three days or smth...sometimes I want to kms so baaad cos I always beg for attention or dying to find someone who can take care of me idk why I wanna be loved so bad!!!!! Even tho I do love myself is just I feel like with a strange feeling when someone really take care of me and idk whyy! But I love that feeling it's like heaven so I keep looking for attention...I'm starving for LOVE sometimes I think I'm crazy but I just need a caring person so I get attached to people so fast thinking that they're going to give the love that I'm dreaming about but I'm always wrong.

Tbh I think this is all because of my childhood trauma!! Or like my parents didn't loved enough.

So I need some tips or idk like how can I get rid of attachment and this kinda of stuff because they're affecting my mental health.",2,depression
"I hate myself for what i did. I slept 11 boys and who knows the number of bjs. Some of them was one night some of them was fuckbudy. I lied to a boy about my past just to make him love me although i had a boyfriend at that time. And after i broke up and started to date with new boy i talked to another boy and sent my photos which new boy took from our date and i said to him i want to go drink. New boy loved me but fake me but learned truth and devastated. He learned all of this. He started smoking again because of me. All this time he cared for me like i am his child. I didnt even see this kind of caring and loving non of my parents nor relationships. And i hate being myself and not treating him as he deserves. After he found out i lied again about the number of people but he found out again. I also said i did check stds and i have nothing but i didnt said that after this check i slept with 2 people. How stupid i was i couldnt think i would spread something to him. (we checked i had hpv not cancerogen thank god) I promised not to lie again and comitted him. I was using paxil and he was so good to me i could quit in 7 months after using 7 years. He is always so good to me he helps me so much he always cares about my health, spends money for me. I cant stop myself from feeling devastated and very sad and crying every day. Every day my past comes to my mind. I know i dont deserve him but its like idont deserve to be happy at all. I cant work because i am always sad, i cant even brush my teeth sometime. I cant stand the reality of my past. I dont have anyone in my life who cares except him.

"Hey guys, I think i'm mostly looking for reassurance that i'm not a horrible person, but for the past few months, my tolerance to noise has gone way down the drain. My doctor and I decided to taper off vyvanse (which I have been on for 2-ish years), and I still think this decision is for the best, but for the life of me it pisses me off how much noise the general public makes. 

The neighborhood kids surrounding my apartment love to scream for hours on end outside, and it seems like when *that* is not happening, some other neighbor leaves their poor dog outside to yelp and scream and make noises no dog should make. It makes me sad that the sound of kids playing gets to  me this much, and i can literally feel it igniting my nervous system and I'll try so hard to just work through it but the anger always comes in so quick and fiery if yk that feeling. 

I know it's not the kids' or dog's fault, but I just feel so frustrated bc it seems like these adults give absolutely no consideration to the echo chamber of concrete walls that surround the area. If i'm being super super real, I think the anger probably deep down is at myself for not being able to tune it out like the rest of the world...

No one can see that I didn‚Äôt get their joke they just told, that the sounds are making it very hard to listen to you, that I‚Äôm sweating and that your eyes are hurting me, it seems like I‚Äôm doing just fine. If I do show a bit of my symptoms, I come off as weird or rude. 

 It makes me wonder if I could even be autistic if I can mask to this extend because sometimes it doesn‚Äôt take that much effort, or maybe I‚Äôm just used to push through these things no matter what. Sometimes I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm just an overreacting attention seeking neurotypic (even though I‚Äôve only told a handful of people about my diagnosis) even though I can finally relate so much to autistic struggles and other autistic people in these subreddits.  



I also be on the verge of a meltdown because of everything happening around me, but due to traumatic experiences from the past I‚Äôm extremely good at pretending everything‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôll just be my ‚Äònormal self‚Äô, then as soon as I get home I‚Äôll hit myself, throw things around me and cry hysterically.
Ever since I was a little kid I would only do this when I‚Äôm alone because I knew my parents would just act like I‚Äôm doing it on purpose for attention, even though I know my emotions are so intense for me I just explode. In social settings I‚Äôve always daydreamed/ sort of dissociated when I‚Äôm overwhelmed to cope, but if I am alone, overstimulated and one little thing goes wrong all my frustration gets out.

I just hate that people think I‚Äôm not having that much struggles with my autism, or that ‚Äúit must be really mild then‚Äù, or ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôm just a HSP!‚Äù, just because I appear to be ‚Äònormal‚Äô most of the time. You don‚Äôt see me struggling with emotions, doing simple tasks at home or understanding things. You don‚Äôt feel all the things I feel in my body when I‚Äôm with you. IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT TO APPEAR THIS WAY.

"TW: grief, cat death

One of my lovely kittens from my garden killed by a idiot car driver recently. I found his body this morning.

-I wanna share but you dont have to read this paragraph-
(I saw blood in road and think what if its him but i always think the worst so try to calm myself. Then check the garbage boxes and found him. Im really upset because we lost his mother 3 months ago and he is very shy so i was trying so hard to have a relationship with him. Its going well in last days, even he sat in my laps.)

I felt very bad when i saw him. But then my brain start to tortured me. Am i really upset or faking it? What should i think now? Go imagine his little face. Oh you arent really sad just try to make yourself upset for feel like a nice person. 

I know that i love animals truely. But this thoughts never stop. Do you feel this way and what do you do for managing?

Ps: sorry for bad english but im feeling bad and cant talk properly.",4,anxiety
"Seriously, at this point I expect nothing. If I‚Äôm real, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the guy to pull a trigger. But, it‚Äôs just, at this point, it‚Äôs all too much. I‚Äôve been suffering from daily migraines for months now, and my daily life is really tough.

So for the past weeks, I‚Äôve just wanted a break, a quick relive, so I don‚Äôt blame myself for thinking about making it all over.

I‚Äôm really trying to give myself a chance, I‚Äôm a healthy guy (27m), I‚Äôm successful at what I do, but damn, it‚Äôs all just too much.

Really, I just want to know that I‚Äôm not alone here, life feels so pointless at this moment.",2,depression

"ever since a couple months ago, I've felt that my anxiety has worsened. Back then, like a year ago or so, it had been bad on some days but overall I could force myself through them. However, recently I've felt that it's become unbearable. 

I constantly feel this tight grip on my heart and I feel like puking and I get trembly and blurry visions occasionally. I dreaded living as a whole. While there were those minute moments where I've forgotten about my fears and paranoia, I feel that every hour of every day I feel this terrible feeling in my chest. I can't exactly describe it but it's this uneasy feeling and it's just bad. so so bad. It makes me lose my appetite and I don't like how things have gotten for me.

I used to really enjoy doing my hobbies like learning the guitar and drawing but nowadays even doing those things is difficult because my mind's always in a state of worry and I can't stop it.

I try to calm myself by depriving myself of my senses which used to work wonders but I just can't stop it. Its the fact that it's everyday for the past few months I've felt like this makes it terrible.

I hate going to school. I hate seeing people. I hate leaving my room.

At first I thought I could ride this one through, that it'd end soon but no it hasnt.

It's to the point where I actually really can't talk with people and I'm alone in school. I feel that I've avoided my friends to hide away in toilet stalls because the sight of so many people has become so sickening that I tend to panic so much that I have to isolate myself. As bad as it seems, I feel like isolating myself somewhat helped me through some bad times.

I'm constantly in fear of people and all I want is to hide away and live life invisible. I don't know why I'm this way and I don't know how to stop it.

and now that I've got group projects where I need to partner up with people, it's a pain for me since I don't have anymore friends and everyone else does.

I've got no one to talk to and my parents don't believe in mental health being such a big issue and once I told my mum and she said it'll pass. 3 years later and it's gotten worse so!

Does anyone have any advice?",4,anxiety

"So I went to this treatment center over the summer, and it basically made my paranoia extremely bad. I felt like taking my own life just to get out of the situation. I thought the phycologist there was going to harm me, the staff members were out to harm me, etc. They didn't even do anything about it. They just told me I was being irrational. That was it. No meds, no nothing. I can't even interact with people because of it, or one of the main reasons, I should say. I feel like I have to act like I'm okay so my parents won't worry about me. I just want to be a normal kid, like the kids at school. Not having to worry if people in your life are lying to you and backstabbing behind your back must be a gift. feeling like no one is trying to kill you at night must feel great. I know, I know, kids there are mentally ill as well, but at least their mental illnesses aren't so bad to the point where they can't make friends or feel like the principal is trying to harm them or their family.",5,paranoia

"I have enough money to get a nice Air BnB anywhere in the state. I've always dreamed of vacationing to Portland in a beautiful area surrounded by greenery/nature. Probably in a cute little cottage home or cabin... maybe a cool tree house or a home by a flowing river or lake. I can bring my cat with me and smoke my weed while I listen to my favorite music. I don't know how I'd do it yet but it's not a choice that feels very distant. I'm thinking before the year ends. I'm just really .. really tired. Tired of trying. Tired of failing. Tired of repeating this cycle of constant highs and lows. Tired of being mentally disabled and living in a world that doesn't care about people like me. Who knows, my next life could be even worse. but i'm hoping the universe will be more kind to me next time around. Id like to exit in peace surround by the beauty of nature. I don't have much but all my money and valuables will go to my little brother. My nerdy collectible stuff will go to my best friend.

"Hi /r/paranoia,

Lately my stress and paranoia have been spiraling out of control. A few months ago, a paranoid thought popped into my head, and I cannot get over it. No matter how much I try to reason away the thought, it doesn't change the fact that it affects my mood and self-image. This thought is also about a touchy subject which makes me feel ashamed to admit to it.

I woke up one morning, and I had the thought that someone had molested me in my sleep. 

I couldn't remember whether the doors had been locked the previous night, and I couldn't check in the morning, because my roommate (who wakes up before me) would have locked the door after leaving for work. I don't suspect my roommate did anything to me. I'm instead worried that somebody broke into my house at night, and had their way with me while I was sleeping.

I know that if I was actually molested, then I most likely would have woken up during the act. I didn't feel like I was drugged. I also know that the odds that my roommate and I both forgot to lock the doors is very low. I'm also sure that my dog would have barked at any strangers coming in, and that would have woken me up.

Despite the rational side of my brain telling me that nothing probably happened, this thought continues to eat away at me. It's because I can never be 100% certain what happened. There's no way to definitively prove this thought to be false. 

I haven't told anybody about this, not even my therapist. I'm embarrassed by this thought, especially since there are so many people who have gone through real sexual trauma in their lives. It feels like my delusions are spitting in the face of those who have been legitimately molested and assaulted. I'm worried that I'll never be able to have a healthy sexual relationship again. I just feel so violated.

Does anybody have any advice for overcoming thoughts that can't be proven false?

&#x200B;

TLDR: I had a paranoid thought about something that happened, and I can't prove that it didn't happen. Any advice on overcoming this thought?",5,paranoia

I should just stop getting my hopes up- I have nothing to live for.",2,depression

"Does anyone have any advice or tips on helping with anxiety over making phone calls?

It is partly due to social anxiety, but whenever I have to phone somewhere, doctors for example, I can't do it. I get so nervous and anxious that it doesn't happen.

Some places like my dentist allow me to email if I feel anxious about appointments, which really helps, but my doctors insist on phone calls which doesn't feel very supportive, hence I don't call.

I am going to email and ask if they can help me overcome this, but I am not feeling hopeful.

"The ceiling in my apartment collapsed the other day and the property management in being a real bitch about it. My gf‚Äôs mother has ‚Äúoffered‚Äù to let us move in with her, but it‚Äôs a trap. I know it‚Äôs a trap. This woman is fucking insane. She thinks everything is a personal attack against her. She gave my gf and I a fucking hour long lecture tonight and everything is apparently my fucking fault, I‚Äôm killing my gf with stress, even though I‚Äôm the only one fucking working right now. I‚Äôve been supporting two people on a fucking retail income. I‚Äôm barely holding it together.

She asked me what exactly upset me so much after her goddamn lecture and I just walked out. I went to the car and slammed my head against tue steering wheel and screamed and jammed a metal straw into my thigh until my gf finally came out like 10 minutes later. I want to fucking die. I don‚Äôt want to live with that fucking woman. I don‚Äôt know what options I have, besides just saying fuck it and living in my car. Or just giving up all together. I don‚Äôt have any family, not really. The only person I have in my gf. I don‚Äôt even really have friends anymore because my depression is so bad that I just basically lost contact with most of them after college. I have no where to turn.
