I drove 4 hours to see my friend and we literally do nothing. I'm so frustrated.,"Like the title says, I drove 4 hours away from my city to hangout at my friend's house for a few days.

I'm so fed up I feel like I'm starting to spiral into ADHD paralysis. All she does is sleep in until 2pm, watch TV, smoke bud and then goes to sleep. I've literally sat on a couch for 2 days while I wait for her to wake up and get ready and then we just watch whatever she wants on Netflix for a few hours until she passes out again.

She instantly shoots down any idea I have whether it be an activity to do or even just something I want to watch on TV. I'm so understimulated and bored I've been doing her laundry and cleaning her kitchen to do anything besides just sitting.

She's ""having a quick nap"" again and then wants to go see her friends at a bar if she even wakes up. I honestly don't even want to go anymore. She's just going to talk over me the entire time and I'll probably end up getting upset, start drinking to much and end up embarrassing myself.

Idk, don't have anyone else to vent to. Thanks for listening to me.

Edit:
Thanks for the responses everyone. We were very close friends in highschool and she's the only person I've really kept in touch with through the years. I appreciate everyone showing your concern for her mental health, but this is kind of how it's always been. We used to smoke a lot in highschool and I just don't think she's outgrown that phase yet. All we really do is talk about our mental health and problems and she is legitimately doing so much better than she has in the past. I hope I didn't come off like I wasn't concerned about her.

Edit 2: 
Wow, I didn't expect this post to get much attention. There's some more relevant information posted in the comments but I figured I'd add it up here as well so nobody misses it. She lives on a farm house out in the country. There isn't a whole lot to do alone, but I did end up driving to my old highschool to see what it looks like now.  

We were and she still is to an extent ""that kind of stoner"". She has a display cabinet for pipes, bongs and other paraphernalia. Has psychedelic art and 4/20 art all around her house. Has worked at multiple dispensaries. You know, she's just really into it. I obviously can't tell if there's something deeper going on she hasn't told me about. So it's hard for me to say I don't think she's depressed without sounding like an asshole... I just want to say I was with her when she caught her ex cheating. I've seen what she looks like when she's going through pain and I talked to her everyday the following months when she was very depressed. I've seen what it can look like for her and she doesn't seem miserable. 

Honestly, the more I think about it the more she seems like me before I was diagnosed, medicated and went to therapy for ADHD. A lot of what I see as her shooting down ideas could just be poor focus and her hyperfocusing on a TV show. We both made a pretty loose plan beforehand that should have been more solid.",1
RSD is one of the worst things to experience in life.,"I'd like to apologize in advance if my post title was bad. I am not good at titles and I noticed some of my posts in other communities get downvoted so much all because the title isn't up to standards of really picky people.


I made a simple post on my local subreddit today with the title that our local movie theater fucked up big time. I wanted to treat myself and just watch a movie solo (which I'm usually to afraid to do) so I bought my ticket a week in advance and got all mentally prepared and went there only to find out it was closed. I saw a couple families with kids also looking really sad or angry because come on, some families don't get many opportunities to get together and do leisure activities like this. Everyone clearly had already purchased tickets beforehand and we weren't given any specifics on how we'd be refunded. This, of course made me a bit emotional, not because my plans were botched, but because I witnessed others looking pretty upset.


I also made that post as a way to inform other locals not to go to that theater in case they also bought tickets prior.


Post got downvoted and comments were basically telling me to stop whining or making it such a big deal just because I couldn't watch a movie (because my title said the theater fucked up big time). In hindsight yes, I should have titled it ""FYI So and so theater is closed today. You will be refunded if you bought tickets in advance"" but I am naturally an emotional person and seeing those families walk away sadly like that made me upset for them too.


The whole point of my post HERE is because this is the only safe space I feel like I can vent about this to. I know it's trivial, but there are just so many redditors in other communities who have huge sticks up their asses and feel the need to put others down when no one has outright attacked or harmed anyone in the first place. I'm so sick of it and probably will quit reddit altogether for a bit. Of course I also immediately deleted my post in that other subreddit and unsubbed too. Fed up with the locals here being such assholes to others over nothing.


Edit: Please replace ""RSD"" from my title to just ""Rejection sensitivity"" or ""Emotional dysregulation"". I am really fighting to not delete my post in fear of downvotes again. I had no idea RSD was something that was overused or that there was so much miscommunication with it until now.


Edit 2: Thank you all for your support, validation, and sharing your own personal experiences here. I've been reading every comment and it helped me not feel so alone. I hope that those of you who struggle with rejection sensitivity find healthy ways to cope and get the help they need. 
Thank you mods for your acknowledgements as well.",1
Turns out the class started last week...,"... And not tomorrow.


This Adderall shortage is really effecting me. I was on a stable Adderall dosage for the last 9 years. I switched to to vyvanse(I know I'm lucky my insurance covers this) 3 months ago due to the shortage and it's just not working. I started failing tests since the switch and just missed the entire first week of an online class. I. The so incredibly frustrated with this DEA/shortage issue.",1
I don’t feel like an adult,"There’s so many things I just don’t do or want to do but can’t establish a routine for. Like I’m so proud of myself for finally starting to brush my teeth twice a day instead of once. That’s how bad I am.

Just normal basic stuff like establishing a routine for washing sheets and bedding is impossible. It’s not out of laziness I just don’t remember until it’s not a good time. And I think to myself “I’ll do it when I’m done with this” and forget.

I suppose I’ll just write down everything that needs done and try to do it tomorrow. I feel like a failure of an adult.",1
The worst thing about ADHD is just not being able to do shit no matter how hard you try,"Finals are coming up for me, and I'm fairly certain I'm going to fail this year because right now I just cannot get anything done because I cannot focus. I can't focus on the work, or studying, or anything. No matter how hard I try, my mind just drifts away to something else. I know I need to get this work done, and usually the deadline provides enough stress and anxiety to give me the ability to power through it but at this point it's just not anymore. My highest grade is a 61% D-, but the average is closer to 50% with my worst class being 40%. I know I need to get this work done otherwise I will have to retake the year, but I just can't. I can't get myself to sit down and work for more then 10 minutes. I take medication and everything, but that isn't working anymore. Why can't I do this? It's so important and I don't want to retake the year. I know it's important and I know I'm in for a lot of shit if I don't do it, and I'm beyond stressed and almost every day I'm freaking out about how I need to get this work done. Basically borderline panic attack all day every day about this. But I can't. No matter how hard I try, I just can't. This is so fucked and I don't know what to do.",1
Paid the tax again,"Yes, the famous ADHD **'tax'.**  


I woke up, had a breakfast, did not go to work, dressed up and I was commuting to my doctor appointment only realizing that it is actually tomorrow, same time. I did not go to work because of this appointment and I will have to not go to work tomorrow..  


I slacked a little bit, I did not take notes, I did not stress myself for what is coming and this is the fate I face. I fucking hate it, every bit of it, I build a little bit of self respect, a bit. And all has to go down the drain because my stupid brain decided it is 30th of May, not 31st of May. I despise that I have to live with this. I am tired of looking at the bright side, because even if I lie about how I mixed the dates, I can not lie to myself.",1
"i feel like im going in circles, i want to improve","For 10 years all my twenties i have been in the self improvement rut. Im writing lists, writing long term goals, making mind maps about priorities about my life. Once every third month im making a vow to myself to live my life trough my todo app, writing down and executing stuff from there. It never holds. I decide to get in shape. I decide and want alot of things, but i doesnt happen. Just like i read from most of you i have changed uni and gone back and fourth multiple times (thank you, free education in europe). The tempo and work load from studying 100% is just too high for me and i have constantly been behind and will not be finishing on time. Its constantly a fight of trying to be more productive and im burning myself out. My life is totally unbalanced. I have tried only one typ of medicine, Ritalin, but it gives me anxiety. Im skeptic to meds generally. Also taking meds just fizzle out, just like everything else fizzle out, healthcare just provides you some medication here without checkups. Sometimes i find notes from 5 years ago deciding to make a change literally writing the same things im writing today. Im just an insane man living in a self repeating pattern of behavior and thoughts. I know something needs to change, this change is not going to come from inside me. Im so stubborn believing everytime i can fix myself, but i literally cannot.",1
Everyone says people with ADHD are better entrepreneurs but I feel like I'm the exception sometimes,"I'm terrible at managing myself

I can barely keep on top of a basic schedule 

I'm terrible at pritorizing 

I'm terrible at time management 

I'm terrible at being motivated to get this business/idea off the ground because I feel (I ""know"") I'm going to fail and it's probably gonna be a waste of money

I feel like I need someone to hold my fucking hand the whole time and be cheering me on for me to keep going and I don't have that

I really hate me. I want to be more successful and have a good career and I'm such a fucking failure. A childish adult.",1
How do I overcome the sad,"The crash period after you've had a very high-dopamine day or half day then suddenly you just feel down and extremely sad, assuming everyone hates you, is annoyed with you, etc.
Feeling so bad emotionally it spills over into physical pain, your stomach hurts, your chest is aching, your back is aching...
Nothing seems to bring me out of the sad, I want to be sober I'm tired of drinking or smoking it away, doesn't even work anyhow..
How do you guys deal with these periods?",1
"Painfully bored, send help.","I’ve had this all my life but lately it seems like it’s worse than ever. Nothing entertains me anymore, nothing keeps me occupied or holds my attention or brings enough joy for me to continue with it. It just feels like my life is moving forward and I’m being dragged along. I’m so fucking bored, all the time. I’m medicated (for ADHD as well as depression and anxiety) but it feels like it doesn’t help anymore. 

And this boredom is just so painful and dreadful and I’ll try something for two minutes and I can’t get into it and I end up just scrolling on my phone. And that isn’t productive and leads to the cycle of feeling shame and guilt about myself. I don’t want to sit on my phone all day doing nothing. I can’t keep doing this shit, it’s so frustrating. How do I cope with this horrible boredom and lack of joy? 

I don’t even know what I want to hear after posting this, I guess I just want to vent and to know if others get this feeling as well, and what you do to deal with it. I have the next two days completely free and I’m honestly dreading it because I won’t be able to occupy myself with work or derby practice or meetings or anything else. I just have to figure it out myself and I have no fucking clue what to do with myself because nothing sounds good enough.",1
I need lots of quiet time,"People talking too much overstimulates me and drives me to the point of a meltdown. I always read that it’s a typical ADHD trait to want to talk a lot but I’m the complete opposite. Is anyone else like this? It super annoys me when people won’t shut up, I really need a lot of silence or just music playing for my brain to feel good. My boyfriend and his family are INCESSANT talkers and it’s driving me kind of insane and I don’t know how to deal with it or explain it to them without seeming rude. People who talk a lot assume you hate them if you don’t reciprocate and that’s not the case I just don’t talk much.",1
I don't matter,"I'm fucking tired of all the bullshit that people say that ""oh, you shouldn't compare yourself to others, boo hoo"". 
Like, yeah cool. If only that's how the life worked. You aren't gonna get a job for having pretty eyes. You'll only get a job if you're better than other applicants.
Never in my life I have achieved something, mastered something. And even worse, half the time I haven't even achieved average, half the time I haven't moved past beginner.
The only thing I've managed to stick to for a very long time was my hobby as pixel artist. But what's the point? This winter it hit me like a truck, when I've realised that I've first opened MS Paint SEVEN FUCKING YEARS AGO. And seven fucking years later I'm at best an average. In seven years people can achieve so much. I've seen people progress past my level of skill in measly a year.
Why should I even bother. If I try to start learning something, there are already people better than me. And even if I waste time achieving some level of skill, those people will in the same time achieve something too, so in any way they'll still be better than me. 
No one will look up to me. No one will pick me. Because there'll always be people better than me.",1
"I (23f) don’t know how I’m going to live like this, and it’s making me feel like I’m going to have a complete breakdown","I don’t know how I’m going to live like this. Some days I get up, take my medication and have my little to do list but I’m so unmotivated and unhappy that I just have to crawl back into bed. I have a job that is what I always wanted that gives me flexible hours and lets me do what I love but I still resent that. It makes me feel like a spoiled brat. 

Absolutely Everything feels like a chore except binge eating, drinking with friends to the point of black out, doing drugs, spending money on vanity, and sleeping. 

I feel like I’m filling with poison and can’t even talk to family or friends sober without it feeling a chore. Everything has to be intense and to the max or I don’t want it at all. My self esteem is at an all time low because I don’t know why I can’t just enjoy things and go for a walk and smell the flowers- boredom doesn’t feel mundane it feels like it’s actually excruciating. 

I feel like I’ve tried so many different doctors and meds and psychs and none of them have worked for me for very long. I try so hard to have periods of exercising in the morning and less screen time and trying every new hobby I can think of and every single time I come back to the same place- lying in bed at midday feeling like my life is completely pointless and vapid.
I even recently tried just booking tickets to different states in my country and working in different places (I can work remotely) and I still just found myself not even wanting to explore wherever I was unless I had a bottle of vodka in my purse to do it with. I preferred staying in my Airbnb alone and rotting in bed. 

I don’t even feel I can tell the people in my life this because it feels offensive given how
Privileged I am (I have a job, friends, relationship, enough money, my own place, access to health resources etc) 
I want to love life so badly and I know there are times when I do but I just wish I could be re born as a completely different woman with a different brain. 
I wish I could love watching a sunrise or sunset without being under the influence. 
I wish I at least knew that one day this cycle would change and I could find more peace being alive.",1
Now that I'm not working... I am a HOT MESS...,"I hyperactively think about all the things I'm going to do now that I have the time.  My to-do/wish list only keeps getting longer which stresses me out, but I'm not actively really doing anything.

At the end of the day, I'm exhausted and just want to watch some TV and relax, but it's impossible to concentrate let alone find something to watch.  It's going to be a looong night...",1
Delusionally hyperfocusing on people??,"For the past month or so I have been hyperfocusing on a certain musician. Usually the topics of my hyperfocus have been shows or series and/or anything fictional, or my hobbies, so this is not usual for me. I really do not know how to handle the situation and I feel like I am getting lost in my hyperfocus, the delusions and the need to have the artist's entire discography playing on a loop all the time. I can feel people getting bored of me and myself getting bored of other people because I feel like nobody else but the target of my fixation matters.

I keep having these scenarios pop up to my mind about possibly meeting him and getting to know him. In a way, it is possible, as we both live in the same, relatively small country. I feel like the lack of geographical distance makes my fixation worse - because theoretically it is possible to meet him in person one day, these delusions stay alive and well. 

I also keep thinking that I understand him better than most of his fans. I feel like we have similar personalities and that I can see his real emotions, unlike the other fans that are fixed on his outer shell. However, I acknowledge that I am definitely projecting my own feelings and imagonation on him. He does feel really athentic, but it just isn't possible that I could understand him so well without ever meeting him or knowing him personally.

I also keep having romantic scenarios about him, which makes me feel stupid, as he is 1) someone I do not know 2) assumedly into women, and I am 1) a gay(?) man 2) usually very aromantic. I feel like I have to meet him and to get to know him, and once we become friends, I would have the chance of him falling in love with me. This makes me feel like a freak. I know it is not possible or realistic, but I desperately hold on to the scenario. It feels wrong, but for now I haven't found a way to let go. I also feel very possessive about him: seeing others enjoy his music and content makes me incredibly jealous and I even feel RSD. 

I usually don't feel attracted to anyone, which makes my attraction towards him even weirder. I crave attention and validation - at the moment I would like nothing more but to have his undivited attention. The feeling is so strong that I desperately feel like I have to get to meet him ASAP (however, I know meeting him in person isn't very likely). I have tried to figure out whether this sudden attraction is telling me to go out and try dating people, but I feel repulsed by anyone else (romantically). I feel like onlythe target of my fixation is 'good enough' or 'worthy'. I don't necessarily put him on a pedestal or anything - I just think he seems like a good, funny and caring guy. 

As a cherry on top, I am insanely jealous at the artist for his charisma, skills, looks, confidence and what not. I want to be like him. I can feel my personality being affected, or even merging, as I subconsciously study and pick up his habits and mannerisms. I feel embarrassed about it because I keep thinking that to other people it probably seems like I am trying to imitate him. 

In the end, I live in the constant crossfire of wanting to be like him and wanting to be with him. As I said, it is possible that we end up meeting some day (small country, small circles etc.). However, I wish to get rid of the delusional scenarios that I have about him or about undertanding him on a deeper level. There are lots of similarities between the two of us and I feel he has also insired me to find out my true motivation in life and chase after it. I know based on my past experiences that the hyperfixation shall pass. Still, all the emotion feels crushing at this very moment. My hyperfixation brings me happiness and inspiration, but it also affects my performance at work and school and makes less interested in social interactions. Basically, I just want to be alone with my hyperfixation and it is the only topic I would like to discuss with anyone at all.

I would like to be able to enjoy his music without getting carried away with all of these feelings, of which some definitely sound delusional (lol). At the moment, all of the conflicting thought make me exhausted and depressed. I feel like I will never be good enough - I will never be able to meet or get to know him and I will never be able to achieve anything like he has. If I think about the situation somewhat realistically, it would be cool to become his friend or work with him at some point. I also wish to use all these feelings as a fuel to find my true passion in life and to work towards reaching my goals. Through these feelings, I've come to realise I have lots of repressed creative energy and that I wish to be seen and heard more. 

How do I overcome the delusional scenarios I have regarding him? Overall, the fixation affects my quality of life a lot, but I trust that the phase will pass. Right now all the feeling are crushing me and I am neglecting my responsibilities. How do I cope - any tips???",1
Living at the mercy of my whims,"I am so tired of feeling like I’m not able to decide what I do.

I can’t have nice things,"I have a weird paranoia about losing Stuff. I’ve been sad because I lost the hoop earrings my mum bought me as a school graduation gift. They were like £20 but I LOVED them and they’re gorgeous, unique hoops I can’t repurchase anywhere as I got them 6 years ago. I’m very sentimental about jewellery I get as gifts, she gave me a ring for my 19th birthday and I’ve not taken it off since. 

I literally never take my jewellery off or switch it around because I’m so scared of losing it. I wore those hoops for over a year straight, took them out a few months ago and now they’ve vanished. 

I went through old photos trying to figure out when I switched out the earrings, it was around January, and I’ve only noticed I’ve lost them now. They’re not expensive enough anyone would bother stealing them so I know it’s on me. 

I have a few bits of jewellery I’ve inherited and I literally never wear it, it goes in a locked box in my drawer because I’m so worried I’ll misplace it and I’d feel awful if I did. 

I’m in that annoying phase where I’ve moved out but my room is tiny and I have 0 storage so I still have quite a few things at my parents house.

Executive dysfunction is destroying me.,"Every single day I do almost nothing. Just sitting around scrolling on my phone even though I can’t stand it sometimes. I can’t even put myself through a 20 minute video on Youtube some days. If I’m lucky, I will get an hour or two of ability to function a day, but that isn’t guaranteed. All I do is go to class, go to my job, and then sit. Even on days I don’t work or have class I usually can’t bring myself to do anything. Meds aren’t helping enough. I genuinely hate living like this, even typing this post feels extremely tasking. 

The other day I finally started cleaning, did for like six hours. I’m still a mess and can’t bring myself to try again. 

I have hobbies and interests I want to interact with but can’t for more than a few minutes at  time. Every time I mindlessly grab my phone I’m suddenly unable to function again, my screen time usually averages on 7+ hours a day despite my mandatory classes and work at least a couple days a week.


I’m constantly fatigued too, which takes away from everything I try to do. I sleep enough, I don’t get why I’m so exhausted. 

Life feels like a waste if I can’t do anything. Wish that my brain gave me the right chemicals for once

Interesting links been ADHD and seemingly unrelated issues.,"Since my diagnosis I often find myself reflecting on my current behavior and circumstances a lot and trying to take it back to see if it's related. I've done loads of things that are really surprising and I'm wondering what the community has as well. 

One of the more surprising things is the link between my glasses and my ADHD. When I was a teenager I had really bad acne (and generally poor hygiene) and went to the dermatologist. I was too ashamed to admit that most mornings I just couldn't wash my face properly with acne creams and so I lied, said they didn't work and was put on a high dose of roaccutane. I was told to use it for a maximum of 6 months and I'm conjunction with the creams. 2 years later I'm still on it and shamefully lying about using the creams and I'm way over the recommended treatment schedule to the point my skin and eyes are now permanently dried out. So dried out I can't use contacts and laser eye surgery is too risky. 

Tl;dr lied about my hygiene and dried out my eyes and now can't wear contacts.

Torn up my whole house, looked at every paper and it's gone. No idea who diagnosed me and who I saw for treatment. (I can't find my passport either but that's for another day) 

I fell off the treatment wagon like, 6 years ago and my ADHD symptoms are getting a lot worse in recent days. Haven't had a job in several months, haven't figured out what I want to do for a career change yet. I've tried to figure out if I go back to school or self teach but you all know how that goes especially without treatment. So for now I'm attempting to be a homemaker for me and my partner but I feel pressure to go back to work very soon for better financials. I just can't go back to my previous occupation because I've developed PTSD from it and I'm still getting flashbacks and nightmares from it. 

I'm so frustrated by how hard it is to get a provider for rediagnosis and treatment. Most of these providers are psychs that don't do ADHD evals or they do ADHD evals but not treatment. And then when you find any provider that is accepting new patients, they're hard to reach. One NP I tried to contact had two numbers, one for new patients and one for current with automated messages that prompted you to call the other number. I've emailed others with no response. I even tried an online psych service and they didn't have a single ADHD provider in my state. I'm also really anxious about what treatment would look like once I even find a provider with how hellish it seems to get meds with this whole shortage shenanigans the DEA is creating. 

I'm afraid I'll only get treatment if I end up in a psych ward. I'm afraid my ADHD won't be taken seriously. Idk what I even need right now, I think I just needed to vent.",1
I feel so lonely,"Even though I have people around me I feel so alone with this. I know I have people I can turn to to seek advice and some pick-up but when it comes to adhd issues it's like talking to a wall. It's been so hard for me to learn to reach out but now I see that doesn't even matter. Nobody around me gets it, nobody understands how awful I feel and how much it affects me that I can't do a project for example. Hell, they don't even comprehend how I could have the time, the resources and place and still not be able to do anything. Oftentimes I fell literally caged in my body and I can't even explain that to people. I have close friends who turn this shit into a joke or just gloss over it as if I just was feeling a little lazy or didn't really care about my grades and it really really hurts. I'm scared of being alone all my life.",1
"I feel more ""sane"" on medication?","When people talk about taking adderall, they mostly focus on the productivity boost it could give them. They also talk about how their brain finally shuts up and all of that is true for me. But the biggest effect that adderall has on me is with managing emotional dyregulation. Without it, my mind is always thinking about how the people in my life really hate me and will abandon me. I've cut off so many friendships bc of this fear. On adderall, I can sort realize that these intrusive thought may not be true so I don't fixate on them as much. I even catastrophize less about my studies/career. Ifeel like that's what ends up making me more productive. Just seeking to know what other people experiences are like..",1
Problems with parents (ADD diagnosed),"So i have inattentive ADD(m19)  and my parents have made a somewhat good job at educating me but im not in a good spot presently, i dropped out of school (cégep(only in Canada)) because i really don’t have a fucking clue on what i wanna do in life. Im gonna start back at the end of summer. My parents want me to work to be useful to society and to be secure with money at least if im to not be at school.  I hate my parents for thinking they understand me and for every lesson they give me i feel like we’re always against each other especially my father. He wants me to push myself mentally and physically every day to be better but when he talks to me about it, i can’t help myself but to think he doesn’t love me because he has the choice of not attacking me verbally but he does it anyway and he says he doesn’t have a choice because ain’t no way my son is gonna do nothing for 4 months of his life. I just don’t see how him doing that is gonna help me heal.  (past other schools trauma when younger) i know im somewhat smart, ive always been curious about any little details. Does anyone else dislike their parents for just arguing on a daily basis knowing it won’t do anything?",1
Pest control is going to spray my apartment tomorrow and I still haven't cleaned anything.,"It takes so, so much for me to do anything as mundane as getting those tea bottles off the kitchen table or take out that trash that's been there for days, so obviously my house is a mess. Pest control is coming at some point tomorrow and, not only does the ""sometime between 9am and 4pm"" stress the everloving fuck out of me, my house is *still a mess.* I need to clean, I need to at least mop so the chems aren't just spread over a layer of dirt, but I cannot get myself to move and that just makes the crippling sense of being overwhelmed more overwhelming!",1
How am I supposed to just work?! - wildfire,"I find it so hard to just go to work when there are huge life changing events going on. It really just seems silly to worry about working when there’s a wildfire raging no more than a 45 minute walk from my home. 

I know the world would crumble if everyone felt this way but it just seems so much less important than being home for my family…",1
Got ADHD-taxed (forgot to cancel fitness app trial) and I'm now hella motivated to use the heck out of it,"So I thought I had my trial cancelation strategy down  pat, I immediately cancel trials (for phone apps) as soon as I get them, knowing that the trial still allows me to continue using it  until the end of the trial (and of course, if I decide I really like the app I can always resubscribe for the paid subscription). 

That plus I try to not get ""just for fun"" trials unless I am seriously considering the paid app.

This all fell through when I got a trial last week for a fitness app where it wasn't very clear whether I can still do the trial if I cancel it. So I put a reminder in my calendar to cancel it the day before it ended, and continued with the trial without canceling.

Fast forward, I went through some difficult days physically and mentally last week, forgot about the app (and didn't really use it other than looking through it a couple of times) and completely missed the reminder in my calendar. Yesterday I got hit with the email that I just got charged $39.99 for the monthly app subscription.

I tried to contact Google apps immediately after I saw the charge to explain that I had only logged in a couple of times during the trial and had intended to cancel, but of course they refused to refund the charge. (I was optimistically hoping they would maybe make an exception since my app activity showed I didn't really use it and I had never requested a trial refund before.)

I'm really mad at myself, but at the same time I have decided I'm going to use this as motivation to use the hell out of this fitness app for the next 30 days. My fitness routine has been lagging a bit and I wanted to get into a more structured daily routine, so since I paid for this expensive app I might as well use it.

Also this is my final (well, one can hope...) lesson to never ever leave an app trial running without first canceling it.

That's all folks!",1
I hate that I let people tell me I didn't have it,I was diagnosed in the mid/late 90s a time when it felt like every hyper kid was getting diagnosed and TV shows like south Park made fun of it. Plus on top of that I wasn't told any of the symptoms and just had to guess because web MD wasn't even a thing then. 20+ years of trying to figure out why I couldn't do what everyone else could do easily. I'm hopefully going to start medication again. Maybe not Ritalin or Adderall because I hated feeling numb to everything but honestly would try it again vsince I haven't been on meds for like 20 years.,1
Don't know what to do with my life,"I was wondering if anyone had any advice or guidance on how to handle and deal with career indecision? I was recently laid off from my first job out of college, working in the professional world, in which I had worked for about 2 and half years. I felt that the role I had was not a good fit for many reasons and mainly tolerated it because of good pay and benefits. I did not like my experience overall and felt really burnt out in the end. I have been trying to figure out for the past couple of months on what to do next and have been feeling very overwhelmed by how tough the job market is and the overall job searching process. I also feel all over the place and can't seem to make a decision on which career path/job I should be targeting. I had the same struggle back in college when trying to decide on a major, my indecision made it hard for me to pick something and I ended up graduating a year later.

  
At this point, I'm open to any kind of job whether contract or part time for entry level positions that don't require a lot of experience. I've been told that I lack clarity and direction and don't seem to know what I want which makes me feel even worse as many people don't understand that this is a part of my ADHD symptoms. I have no idea what to do and would really appreciate any suggestions or if anyone has experienced indecision about their careers or any other major life decision, how to handle it and move forward? I don't have very many supportive family and friends who I can open up to about my situation so I thought about posting in this group to see if it could help.

I’m pretty sure I’m about to get fired and I don’t know what to do,"I’m pretty sure I’m about to get fired! I’ve tried so hard but ever since I got laid off from my job I had for five years and since then  it’s been a struggle to get a good job and to keep it between the ADD and the stress, It’s been a lot! The only job I kept over a year after the one I got laid off was food delivery which I did for over a year and it was going well but then after corona, I was noticing my profits going down, so I worked in a retail store for almost 2 years it was awful and they made fun of me once they found out that I had ADD! I worked there until I applied and I got this job and it was really good and  I did tell this boss upfront and things seem to be going well but I made a lot of dumb mistakes but I thought I got along with everybody and we all liked each other but sometimes when I make my stupid mistakes due to my adhd forgetfulness I make jokes to compensate and I thought you know everyone seemed to like it and that  silly me but I think I realize that people are pretty over it. They’re over my mistakes. I’m really trying and something my boss said Friday makes me think I’ll get fired possibly Thursday I’m gonna try to go talk to her and be like I know I’ve made some mistakes but I’m actively working on them but I’m afraid. I don’t know what to do if I lose this job!  my boyfriend has really been there for me but after this, I don’t know I just feel like he’s gonna be like she can’t do anything.

Now my struggle is following through on the rest of the task - making sure that bottle gets opened, a pill comes out, a pill goes into the mouth, a pill gets swallowed.  Sometimes it's hard to believe that each of these steps comes with the risk of blowing the whole process! No wonder we are more exhausted than most by the end of the day",1
Dealing with my office manager,"Saw my therapist today. I was diagnosed with a pretty severe case of ADHD predominantly inattentive type around age 21. I'm 29 now. 

Therapist also has ADHD so she also thinks my office manager should get off my neck about ""stop looking at your phone"" 🤷🏼‍♀️  when I glance at my phone, it's to hit the next song on the playlist for the earbud I have in my ear since I'm looking at a computer screen for 90-95% of my shift.  My office manager DOES NOT have ADHD. 

Short background for context: I've been at this job for about 2-4 months (recently moved down here around January 2023). It's a sleep clinic and I was hired to help manage the sleep machine inventory. I've worked a variety of healthcare jobs for the past 5-7 years. 

since the head doctor also runs an ADHD clinic (i learned about that by chance) if I happen to see him at lunch over the next 2 weeks during lunch time in the lunch room I'll ask him if he can talk to her about it (in the nice hr voice of ""hey lay off since she's got those lower dopamine levels, she needs that constant background stimulation, if she's still getting her daily tasks done and there isn't a noticable drop in quality"")",1
frustrated with my relationship w food,"Im exhausted of my brain screaming ""AAAAHHHH YOU CAN ONLY STOMACH ________ AND YOU GOTTA DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO GET IT ASAP!""

wish me luck,"i didn't have a great experience with ritalin, as in, it had absolutely no effect on my cognitive function and i was up to 40 mgs per dose.

my psychiatrist switched to wellbutrin to improve my mood and inspire some kind of motivation, which worked for a while, and it has made me feel better in some areas, but i still, for the life of me, cannot focus or do basic stuff i need to do. ive been putting off writing a 1500 word essay on a subject i am actually interested in for like a month now.

today he prescribed strattera. im trying to be hopeful and optimistic, but i just feel defeated. i don't feel like this is the one and maybe i'm just doomed to stay in this state of limbo forever. 

i am working with a very skilled therapist. but even she admits that although therapy does wonders, it can't magically make me focus on the tasks i need to do, even if it can help me to stop putting them off. 

wish me luck i guess. i don't know what else to do if this new medication doesn't end up working either. i might check myself into a mental hospital and let them test newly invented adhd medication on me as a human test subject because i probably won't be able to do much else with my life.",1
"""Eat your veggies first"" thinking gets me stuck","
There is an AI edited version and the orginal everwhere version read 1 (or both I guess)
AI EDIT
Do you ever feel like you're stuck in a situation where you have to do things you don't enjoy? I often find myself likening it to being a little kid at the dinner table who has to finish their veggies before having dessert. You know that if you don't eat them quickly enough, you'll be left with no dessert at all. But here's the thing: staring at the veggies, playing with them, putting them in your mouth, or even waiting them out won't make them disappear magically.

Now, as an adult, I find that this analogy still holds true in my life. I always try to tackle the tasks I dislike first, thinking it's the responsible thing to do. However, more often than not, I end up getting stuck or suffering along the way. One minor example, It's like going to the store and buying a variety of drinks but having to drink the ones I dislike first, only to end up with a limited selection of the ones I actually enjoy because everyone else ends up drinking them. Super annoying.

More importantly, whether it's working on a project or just daily chores, I find myself laying out the steps in my head, and it always comes down to feeling like I have to do the thing I dislike the most first. It feels like being a child again, being told to stay at the table until I finish my vegetables. Childern being told to stay at the table is akin to being held at gun point, however,  since I'm not actually held at gunpoint as an adult, I often find myself procrastinating when faced with that one dreaded task. 

Can anyone relate to this struggle? How do you approach tackling tasks you don't enjoy? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences!


My OG Version
So I ofen think or explain I feel like when it comes to doing things I don't like that I need to do I feel like a lil kid at the table that has to eat their veggies first before having desert and if you don't eat it quicly enough you have to eat it with no desert. Staring at the veggies don't make them disappear, playing with the veggies don't make them disappear, putting veggies in your mouth don't make them disappear, waiting the veggies out don't make them disappear. 

As a child being told to stay at the table is equivalent to being held at gunpoint as an adult. Since I'm not held by gun point I get stuck procrastinating when there is that one thing I really dread doing. As an adult, I feel like I always try to do the things I don't like first and often get stuck or suffer. Buy a variety pack from the store... drink what I don't like first then forced to split all the good ones...annoying but not a big deal. Even worse...When I want to work on a project or have something fun to do ... I lay the steps out in my head and it comes down to I need to do the thing that I don't like the most first. Then I do nothing.  

I be feeling lost, its pervasive, I rarely get things done, and I waste so much time (especially when the dreaded thing takes no time or ends up being easy).

What do you all think? Advice?",1
Feeling like ADHD (Inattentive) is a completely separate disorder to ADHD (Hyperactive),"I know everyone with ADHD is going to experience varying symptoms to varying degrees. As per my diagnosis (DSM-5), I suffer from every single Inattentive type symptom, and none of the hyperactive type symptoms.

Sometimes the stereotypical symptoms (especially hyperactivity and impulsiveness) feel so alien to me. I also don’t recall ever hyper focusing on anything either. 

It often causes me a fair bit of anxiety, believing I’ve been misdiagnosed and something else is going on up there. The biggest things I really suffer from are VERY bad memory, keeping focus and spacing out / blanking. A really big one that affects every part of my life is blanking in conversations. I don’t feel nervous or anxious, and I don’t have an aversion to socialising but I do find it very difficult to hold conversation. My brain just goes blank in any conversation (makes it very difficult during therapy sessions, because I end up unable to explain or recall things).

Anyway, I guess this is just a rant. Wondering if anyone experiences similar?",1
My 9 year old son has ADHD,"Hello I am a mama here and just looking for ways to support, love on, and help my kiddo through this journey (9 years old- boy). Any advice is great thank you.

Currently, we are also dealing with bullying at school. He gets bullied constantly, school ends in three days for summer break but just want to be prepared and work on some things this summer to help him and support him as much as possible so he feels good and in his own skin and can be himself.",1
I think my brain stopped working,"For the past few weeks, I feel like my brain has stopped working. I can’t remember anything and I find simple tasks incredibly hard. I have a big exam coming up and I’ve been trying to study for it for the past few days but to no avail. My brain is not taking in any information and I also can not access my stored knowledge about literally anything. It’s like my brain is locked up and the key is nowhere to be found. I don’t know what to do and I’m getting really frustrated.

I’m not medicated by choice because ADHD meds are hard to get here. My psychiatrist only prescribed me antidepressants before and I’m not really sure I want to take them again because the side effects were just not great. I felt like a robot. I did get things done but I just hated who I was. But if nothing works, I might just suck it up and take it. I don’t know anymore.

Anyone experienced something similar? Please  share how you coped with it.",1
Venting/house guests/mental exhaustion,"We've had house guests (5 different people) for almost the last 5 weeks.  We are almost done.  I am mentally exhausted.  I want to be alone for a bit, but my and my spouse both WFH so even after the guests are gone, there are always people around.

Just wanted to vent. I don't have anyone I'm not related to around here that I can just go hang out with and have coffee, or play games, or do nothing.  Feel like I'm being a bad spouse and/or parent right now.  I know this is all in my head, but it's been rough.

Stupid Australian Healthcare System,"So I have been diagnosed with ADHD for over 2 years now. And my physiatrist wants to see me and check up on how I am doing and refresh my medication script.

However for my visit with him to be covered by Medicare (basically insurance) I need a referral. Yep that’s right I need to go see my family doctor to get a referral to my physiatrist I have seen multiple times before and is asking to see me. I just find it incredibly stupid and annoying.

I got my first stimulant prescription but now I feel like a drug-seeking addict,"I got recently diagnosed with ADHD (I’m 28) with a private psychiatrist and today he prescribed me Concerta. But during the appointment I couldn’t shake off the feeling that this private psychiatrist is a glorified drug dealer I am just a drug-seeker.

I haven’t even gone to the pharmacy yet and I am already thinking about how people will judge me, and that I don’t actually need the medication.

I know everything I just said is completely irrational, but oh boy gotta love it when your brain gets stuck in overthinking mode.

Has anyone here struggled with this?",1
Elvanse/Vyvanse Not Working,"I am here because I genuinely don't know what to do.

I have been discharged from my psychiatrist as far as I'm aware and the wait list is 1-2 years long and I can't get a doctor's appointment (the UK is bad for this).  

I'm currently off my meds as they seemingly stopped working overnight, as well as causing severe dry mouth out of nowhere. I also had surgery and it was also best I came off for that reason.

I've tried 20mg up to 50mg of elvanse and it wasn't helping so I just came off. That's when I saw the lawsuit/conspiracy trending about Vyvanse/Elvanse not working for so many of us around the time it just stopped working for me (around Feb/March 2023) 

I'm getting frustrated, I don't want to keep going off and on the medication, the withdrawal symptoms were killer! 

Do breaks even help? I'm hesitant to go back on, especially if they still aren't working.

Anybody else having these problems? I made a post a while ago but I feel so alone with this.",1
When your best is everyone's average,"You know what I hate about ADHD sometimes, that my best, my very best, is never enough. When I do my best the only thing I manage to be is average at best. I'll start the semester, study daily, revise, and do everything I can, and I would still do badly. If my friends got a bad mark, it's always because they didn't study enough, because there was some event, some excuse. Me? None. When they try to console me with their bad marks, my reply is always, you always can do better, this is not the end of your potential. But for me? I can not do better, this is the best I have, the worst mark you get, is the best mark I can get. It hurts, you know? It really does, because you are constantly letting people down, people constantly tell you to do better, put more effort, but you already are? I really am sick and tired of this....",1
"Having ADHD is so lonely, man.","One thing I don't see being talked about nearly enough is how ADHD (and ASD too I imagine in a similar way) can isolate you from people.

Just one (personal) example is when you find a brand new thing to be obsessed over, but not a single other person in your life gives a shit about it. Like you can be super into this new video game, read up on all the lore and really have a lot of fun getting stuck in.

But you then look over to your friends and realise they don't care. They're only going to get bored if you rattle off all the fun things you've done or found out.

Your colleagues ask you what you did with your weekend and you reply that you've been enjoying your video game, and they laugh and roll their eyes like 'oh, again?'. 

It's not the type of thing you can find space for in an online community either, as very few people care about the cool kill you got the other day or how you think this thing is cool but it's already been talked to death on the subreddit. 

Then everyone starts to wonder why you're not as social with them all of a sudden, as if you have nothing to talk about anymore, but it's just that you'll end up talking about the Thing again. Shit sucks, man.

People without ADHD/ASD obviously get this sometimes in their lives too, but with me I find this is on a permanent every-few-months-or-so cycle. It's exhausting and so I just wanted to vent about it.

Do you guys experience this too?",1
Sometimes my boredom is so great it feels almost physically painful. I don’t know how to relieve it.,"26. I have a standard life: 9-5 job. Basic hobbies like drawing and videogames. Hiking on weekends. It’s stable and I should be grateful. And I am. Except…my want for adventure is often so great I don’t know what to do. It feels like I’m trying to hold back a charging lion with kite string. 

My adhd brain craves adventure. Adrenaline. Unfortunately my life circumstances don’t like that. My finances aren’t great and I have very little pto so it’s not like I can go gallivanting off on a big travel adventure on a whim. 

I feel the world is so big and I have but one life and I’m living it stuck inside a box. Literally. (#cubiclelifehahahakillme). I have no idea what to *do* with this internal energy. I go to the gym but it feels like a temporary stopgap. Videogames can distract my brain but the action experienced inside a video game isn’t real so my brain isn’t satisfied. 

Ultimately I want to help people. But I want variety and I want action. Maybe I’m nuts but I once got hit by a car (minor injuries) and thought “huh, hey at least it broke up the monotony of my life and is now a cool story I can tell”. My current coping mechanism is listening to heavy metal way too loud which doesn’t seem great. But hey at least I’m not doing drugs or something.",1

Worried I won’t be diagnosed,"Ever since I learned about ADHD, it’s like a veil has been lifted. I have almost every sign except the big one - getting up from my seat haha - and have had them since I was a kid. I’m 31 now. Everything is making sense, from the hyperfixations to lying in the dark, to my procrastination and the debilitating inability to get out of bed, cook, or clean consistently.

My therapist is very supportive. She and I are working on what would be helpful if I do have ADHD, but she is also trying to be mindful and purposeful in not diagnosing me. We are just working on strategies together. She is also great at just reminding me that I have already lived a life finding ways to navigate the world, and I only need to dive into treatment options if there are things I need support with. For the most part, I have strategies to process, explore, add disclaimers, etc whatever I need to to get through the social aspects (I am very much a talker and “oversharer”), but the executive functioning struggle is super painful.

But idk - I have a fear that I won’t be diagnosed for it (is this ~~RSD~~ um emotional dysregulation lol). I do have a significant trauma background, but I think it’s evident to me now at least that it’s a little bit of a chicken or egg scenario - I had some significant traumatic experiences when I was a young child, but the lower grade, long-term secondary trauma was I think compounded on by ADHD. I think the biggest thing is that even though none of us are diagnosed, I do see the signs in my family.",1
Working and studying is just too much,"I'm doing an MBA, not because I wanted to, it was just a lot of family pressure and where I'm from it's a thing for almost everyone to do it. I'm also working a full time job. 

I'm 27. I never wanted to this, let alone in something I have no interest in. I'm content just going to work and doing that for 5/6 days of the week. I just can't focus on anything to do with this MBA. Now I'm on the brink of failure due to not knowing anything and not attending classes because I just couldn't bring myself to take the transport for an hour and then spend 3 hours in a classroom after working 8 or 9 hours. I don't know how the others do it, but I just can't. Maybe I can, I don't know. But I don't think I want to. Now I have this pressure from people and everyone around to finish it, I absolutely hate it. I just want to drop it. I talked to the uni about dropping, or at least let me repeat the sem, and they're just adamant about wanting me to finish it now since it's my final semester. Not to mention things at home being a bit of a mess sometimes as well. I just can't be bothered with anything to do with this course now.",1
I'm getting windows tomorrow and I'm waiting for the last minute panic to set in so I can finally clean my house after 2 weeks of neglect.,"My kids qre clinging to me at a top tier level. I called my MIL to help me. I am so embarrassed. I pretty much explained that I kinda just need her to be here qnd sort of pretend to clean because I need a body double. Idk if she is understands but she's on her way. I spent 2 hours cleaning my 6x6 foot bathroom because it's either do nothing at all or everything like taking off faucets and cleaning the grout. I'm just having a serious pity party.  Why did the mental illness gods bless me with adhd.  Why can't I be a full functioning adult who just maintains instead of piles. Why do I get overwhelmed by sounds and smells and textures. Why can't I just load the dishwasher and not freak out because something in the dishwasher smells (the filter, I know).

Stress clean,"Do you stress clean too?

It always wait too long with even the smallest cleaning tasks. When it gets too much I explode and deep clean to whole apartment and I am completely exhausted afterwards.

Flaking out because of stress,"
I was supposed to go out with my girlfriend and her friends tonight to see her friend DJ at a club. I've done it before and it was a really great time, so I've been looking forward to it all week. However, the past three days have been super stressful because of a sudden surgery my cat needed. Anyway, I got ready, had my finger over the button to order the car, then put down my phone and started petting my cat. 

I've done this a lot. I've gotten ready to go somewhere lively, but when it's time to go, I just flat out can't do it. I think it's part sensory, part mental (and part cat in this case). I know if I go I'll have a lot of loud sounds and a ton of people to deal with, but I also know that I loosen up after a little and usually have a good time. I feel like not going is kinder to myself and more what I need in this situation, but that I'm letting my girlfriend down and robbing myself of a fun time. I do this ""should I go? should I stay?"" dance until it's too late to go and I shut down. So now I'm home, sitting on the couch in my cute club outfit, trying to justify my choice, feeling like I let my girlfriend and myself down.",1
Getting a ADHD diagnosis in Sweden is annoying,"Background: I just got done with a online meeting with a psychologist. We have been going through my intentions and the reasons I'm there. I explained that I talked to a uni school counselor (8 months ago), was told it seems like I have ADHD, then a doctor who suspected it too and now I talk to this psychologist. I shared in the first session that I failed all my university classes (or rather couldn't handle the stress of going to the exams, knowing I hadn't managed to study). That all I want is to have the tools to restart uni next term and do better. 

Now I'm in an ok place; I'm 20 years old, I have a place to live (with parents), I've been doing an internship and I have a few friends I meet from time to time. That means I don't have to get diagnosed _right_ _now_. But it feels really dumb to not get diagnosed when _before_ my life starts to fall apart (not that it will but it feels like it could). 

The next steps of getting diagnosed, as I understand it, is to get referred to a psychiatrist by the psychologist and then go through the process of proper diagnosis. Seems reasonable enough. Except I'm told that it is apparently _extremely_ hard to get diagnosed. You basically need to have your life currently be falling apart both career wise and socially for the psychiatrists to take you in and even then they are at high capacity.

I get that they need to prioritize but idk how we don't have more resources to help people before their lifes goes to shit.",1
Tell me I’m not alone,"Maybe this isn’t an ADHD thing, but I’ve been putting all the pieces together regarding my fidgets/stimming/behavior in general and there’s one thing I noticed I always do but I really don’t even know how to describe it… basically if I walk past someone I don’t know in public, I automatically do this quick little “Hhh” exhale through my nose. Usually accompanied with a smile/half smile. Like when someone says something funny or even amusing but you’re not supposed to be listening so you do that subtle little nose exhale laugh, does that make sense? I’m generally a pretty friendly person despite my social anxiety, and I’ve noticed I usually only do it when crossing paths with someone and actually making eye contact/acknowledging their presence in any way. It’s like I’m not saying hello or being friendly in words, but my little exhale is like hey, what’s up. And every single time right after, I feel so self conscious about it like they’re thinking “why did this girl just sniff at me?! Did they hear me?” 😅 Am I alone?!",1
Lost and afraid,"I am 40. Severe ADHD.

Have tried: Dex, Vyvanse, Concerta and Ritalin, ADHD coaching, read most books on ADHD. 

I cannot teach high school English anymore because I cannot complete the admin/planning/differentiation tasks.

Cannot pay the mortgage and likely will have to sell the flat. 

Have been deeply depressed for months. 

This adhd life is excruciating. 

The lack of focus, the errors, losing stuff, the chronic disorganisation, the flitting mind, the languid mind, the inability to juggle parts of anything, I feel disabled. 

I see no job I can do. 

Feel detached from the world and everyone in it. 

I don’t know how to rebuild and am struggling to see a future.

My son has inattentive ADHD and I feel so worried for him, too.

Most jobs I see require at least one of the skills I don’t have such as:

Attention to detail
Highly organised
Cash-counting/numeracy

I am really frightened that I am going to be a nervous wreck.

I do struggle with suicidal thoughts, even though my son’s father took his life. 

Feel that my ADHD is so severe that I cannot juggle the strategies required because I have so many deficits.

I feel exhausted, resigned, over this adhd life. 

I’m sick of hearing from people who don’t understand this disorder… it’s really, really hard!",1
My psychiatric clinic has the worst system of making an appointment,"Some time ago I’ve been forced to change my psychiatrist and she works in some kind of clinic and the appointment system is just terrible. In order to make an appointment you need to pay them in advance for the meeting and there is a deadline so you can’t pay too late because your visit will get terminated. What is more is that they send you a message with a link to the pay site, you can’t access it otherwise. Next time you know you get another message because it’s the last day for the payment and you get one last message that your appointment has been terminated. One good thing is that you can call them after you’ve missed the deadline and ask if you can still pay for it, but calling a stranger is not particularly easy when you’ve got anxiety. It’s the least ADHD friendly system I’ve seen.",1
ADHD and Disassociation,"I hope I'm not alone here but it's been a struggle getting an ADHD re-diagnosis with a psychiatrist (I'm a travel nurse and the new legislation that doesn't allow the telehealth apps to prescribe stimulants and requires telehealth providers to be in the same state has hindered me, esp because I was about to try Vyvanse or Adderall that I think would have helped bc Strattera and Ritalin weren't cutting it).  
So it has led to more mental health services burnout because of additional feelings of invalidation.
But most recently I had a psychiatrist tell me that ""it doesn't sound like ADHD"" because I told her that recently because of my burnout of frustration in not being able to find treatment my brain has realized it can forcibly quiet my inner dialogue, so I don't hear like...10 mental radio station at once, but in exchange my body is moving on impulse and autopilot. And as soon as I try to more actively live in the moment, it means I'm turning my inner dialogue back on, and it's like all of the mental noise picks up again.  
So I call it disassociation because I had problems with focus before but now it even especially feels like my brain and body are disconnected, and I'm even more distanced from emotions.
Am I just calling it the wrong thing?
I tried to explain to her that the disassociation isn't from a traumatic event, it's from having to deal with my constantly running ADHD brain for years, but nope, she decided that couldn't be what's happening.

TL; DR: does anyone else's brain get so overwhelmed at its constant noise that your body decides to just go on autopilot?",1
"22M, coming to terms. Screaming in my car at the top of my lungs","I write the symptoms for this fkn curse in my journal so I won’t forget what to tell my doctor. Next to each symptom I write how I relate to it. As I read each dot point, some of the biggest aspects of my life finally have an explanation, by the end my questions are being answered and all I can do I slam my steering wheel with tears in my face and think about how different my life would be if I knew earlier.

Why was I always overeating? Why do I get bursts of anger as if from nowhere?
Why can’t i learn an instrument despite having it and the desire to create that which I love? 
Why am I always distancing myself from people I care about while having so much love for them? 
Why can i never decide what to do with my life while having so many interests?
Why can’t I ever get into a relationship even though it’s what I’ve wanted for years and I have so much love to give?


This might just be another story in a sea of millions, but it’s one that’s waited so long to start, one that I imagine will have more confrontations down the road, but I’m hoping it’s one that like the many unfinished books in my shelf, I can finally get through and find myself better at the end of it.

I guess I have to get him admitted- it breaks my heart,"Hi, 
My 14 year old with severe adhd just got very aggressive. He threw everything off the kitchen counter at me, destroyed a Lot and hurt me. This was caused by a limit to his computer time. Isuffer from a severe, lifethreatening autoimmune disease, plus am disabled due to a a spine fusion which went wrong. So, this is really really dangerous for me, but I still don’t t want to. 
I don’t know what to do anymore, his aggression gets worse and worse - but five minutes later he bottlefeeds our orphaned kitten very carefully. 
He refuses his medication, and I cannot „make“ him take it… 
The pediatric psychiatrists that treat him already said that the only thing they could offer is the inpatient treatment, since we tried everything else. 
I plan to get him to the e.r. Tomorrow (I need his father for this, he is on Night Shift and I cannot even get him on the phone)  -but I feel horrible. I don’t actually think that this is good for him, but his smaller siblings are terrified of him, and I cannot cope anymore. I need a Break. 
Did any of your kids get admitted? They are quite strict, visiting times only twice a week, telephone only at one time a day, no gadgets.

"Job interview tomorrow, thinking of throwing it all up","Hi! A little bit of backstory(English is not my first language): I went undiagnosed for the first 23 years of my life.

Fast forward five years and I dropped university one time and in the process of doing it a second time. In the last year I’ve been diagnosed with adhd and cyclothymic disorder but I’m still in the process of gaining meds. 
Now for the part that made me write this post: tomorrow I have a job interview for a decent paying job which would also give me the opportunity to travel (a long dream of mine) but I’m also in the midst of a fucking depressive episode and thinking of throwing it away by not even showing up (also the anxiety is killing me).

Parents ruined my life,"I am yet to be diagnosed with ADHD, but I have an appointment coming up.

That being said, I recently stumbled upon an Instagram post about adult ADHD. It opened up a rabbit hole for me and I've been reading and researching about it and for the first time in my life I feel like I have answers for why my life is the way it is.

The thing that struck a nerve in me is a post about executive dysfunction. 
All my life I've been labeled lazy, Incompetent, idiot etc, even when I'm trying my absolute best to focus. 

My parents always called me lazy and gave up on me  while my symptoms were stronger than ever. One diagnosis and proper medication could've changed my life. I would have never been in this bottomless pit of anxiety and depression if they took to a psychologist instead of assuming all that was wrong with was my doing. I hate my parents for it. 

I'm happy and sad at the same time. I finally know I'm not a weirdo, I'm not lazy, I finally have an answer. 
I don't know whether I can turn my life around anymore but I could have if I was diagnosed earlier. 

Thank you for reading, have a great day!",1
Has this really been my issue all along? Why does medication work so well? I can't believe this..,"Hey r/ADHD  
  
I'll try to make this somewhat short if I can. I am M28. I have struggled with anxiety and depression my entire life, mostly anxiety. Especially as a kid, I was very anxious, the most anxious kid I knew out of all my friends. It never felt fair. I want to share some of my life story here and just see if this is legitimate...because my counsellor and doctor were willing to try me out on Vyvanse but i was never officially, thoroughly diagnosed by a psychiatrist. But for the first time in my life, my anxiety is like..gone. I feel happy too, more than ever in my adult life. And the over thinking! It's like i would just have multiple streams of thoughts in my head and I would have to think of the same things over and over and over to try to reassure myself, but it would never quite work. I've tried Wellbutrin before for anxiety/depression and it barely worked at all. Also had a lot of issues with depersonalization/derealization (really terrible anxiety causes this) so basically thought i was going entirely insane.  
  
My symptoms (whether they are ADHD or not, idk) have only gotten really bad in the last year, after I went through a marital separation/divorce. For example, I wake up at 5 AM, get to the gym, but found it near impossible to focus on sets and constantly scroll tik tok in between. Same when I got home. I wouldn't get out to work until past 10 AM sometimes. Basically it would take me 5 hours to do a morning routine that shouldn't take more than 2. And it's like..anhedonia or something, like pleasurable activities are no longer pleasurable to me, no matter how many millions of songs I switch to or how many different TV shows I try out. So, I thought the culprit was depression.  
  
But I just couldn't focus on one thing at a time. I have 6-7 books on the go right now (mostly on an ereader) and I constantly bounce between all of them, I have big time difficulty staying with one book. I also can never get through a full song. TV goes on the background while i bounce between reading a book, writing in a journal, and playing games on my phone. As an example.  
  
Once i tried the vyvanse, holy shit. Absolutely calming, focused, for example i am writing this post in silence without any background TV or music which I never do. So that to me means its working, and maybe I really have this right? But I don't know if i always did or not? Is that possible?  
  
I would really like to connect with some other people who have gone through some of this. I was never diagnosed as a kid, I actually did well in school so i don't know how that factors in. I was a ""loud"" kid, the class joker in a way, could not stop talking, always wanted to speak up and often got in a trouble for that though. Also as I grew up I was always a huge dopamine seeker. Porn hooked me from a crazy young age. Although now, I have low sex drive which doesn't make sense...I always read on here how people with ADHD are often much hornier than normal, but I'm the opposite :( I love sky diving, fast bikes/cars etc anything that can give me a rush, I am the biggest adrenaline seeker I know.  
  
Anyway, I think that's enough context for now, ( Don't want to make this too long) I am just looking for any other perspectives and hopefully to chat with some others that got this more figured out. I am having mixed feelings where I am so happy I may have found something so big, but also, how did I lose my entire teens and 20s to this! Did I not have to be anxious and depressed for the last 12 years if I was only officially diagnosed?? :(",1
Getting There,"Long time listener, first time caller.

Gah. 39yo and worked out this was probably me end of 2021. Since then been stuck in a waiting list (UK based) for referral.

If I was to explain what my head has felt like most of my life, it'd be an octopus weave of tentacles trying to access various parts of my brain whilst a swarm of bees just fly around inside just incase things felt too quiet. I just cannot switch off, invasive thoughts (sometimes not entirely pleasant) just constantly queue jumping in front of whatever it was I had decided five minutes previously was a priority. 

I can be sat on a Teams call that I'm chairing, suddenly look at my watch for the time. Then I'm counting watch links. Then I'm thinking what I'd need to get to smelt down the metals, could I repour them into a mould fo... ""So what do you think about that?"". 

Me: 'sorry my connection went then, can you repeat that?'

I work such lumpy hours, I know everything I need to do but sometimes I can be sat there just pointing a stick at my head awaiting something to happen. Then inevitably I get my work done at 10pm that evening, fueled by the mix of needing to get it done and the relative quiet of the evening. 

Sleep is just an arse. Can never fall asleep within 90 mins and ruminate through the churn of whatevers happening. It's like you go to flick the switch but it goes from on to on. I can rarely fall asleep quickly but only when absolutely exhausted, never at 'bedtime' but those times feel so good to just know I'm in that state.

The more I learn and read about ADHD the more it fits the things I've always struggled with but have lacked the awareness of what it was and wasn't strictly neurotypical behaviour. Could never concentrate at school or absorb information easily, was always told I could do big things by teachers (English usually) but just needed to apply myself. 

I lose so many items around the house and so many hours of my life meandering through. I'm getting there, my workplace are supporting me now (I decided to get it in the open with them last week) and am trying to get the process of a referral expedited. Just feel so exhausted, feel like I'm close to burning out at the moment and feel really emotional. Spoke to some good people recently who have ADHD and it's given me hope. Been on a journey with anxiety and depression for 20 years, if I can potentially get to a root cause and maybe tailor meds to help I'd be so happy. I mean I am happy sometimes but it's always underpinned, always compromised by never being able to fully feel that joy of just being without the constant noise of expectation, failure and inability to just be 'normal'.

I'm trying to get back into a few small things to get me baselined again (exercise mainly) but what has really helped you guys? To quote Ned Flanders Dad: ""I've tried nothing and I'm all out of ideas"". This sub has help me so much to just understand it's not just me and provided me with that solice. I'm getting there, but it's just such a grind sometimes. Thanks for reading.",1
Meltdowns and embarrassment,"I just had an embarrassing episode a few days ago. I don't wanna explain in detail what happened but I was at a public event where I had a meltdown and burst into tears. An insignificant thing triggered me and I got scared.

Normally I really don't cry that often and it has never been a problem for me to control my emotions in public places and social gatherings. I’m starting to think irrationally and I probably overreact in most situations. It worries me that I have become such a nervous wreck over the last 4-5 months.

Thinking about the episode the other day makes me uncomfortable, and at the same time so disappointed in myself. My dad was also at the event and he thinks it was embarrassing too, so that doesn't help at all. It's not the first time I've embarrassed my family because of my overreactions, but the episode the other day was the worst I've had.

I’m 22 years old and I got my ADHD diagnosis in 2018 and I have been medicated ever since. I don't know if it’s my ADHD symptoms that have changed or if I should look out for other causes, but I don't feel ready for help from doctors or psychologists yet :)

I would like to know if some of you also changed and became in a way that was difficult to accept at first? Did you learn to deal with it over time?",1
"Help, Afraid of going into office. Now finally seeking assessment.","Hey all,

I’ve come to the realization (through relating to every meme I see on Instagram (prob not the best way))that I almost certainly have adhd-I.

I have always been forgetful, at nearly 30 I lose my phone everyday, I forget to eat and am horrible at replying back to texts (but also can’t stand a phone call), the low energy, despite being in good shape, indecisiveness and the general boredom of life finally may have a reason.

I know all this and still procrastinated on calling my doctor until what happened to me recently.

I have been working from home for the last 2 years and recently have been forced to go into the office. I haven’t. I have been using vacation days on my office days. 

When I work from home I usually “watch” (actually just listening as background) YouTube videos. I’m frequently watching bits of a video at a time and switching to another as I get bored. My work gets done very well even while being distracted for periods of doom scrolling for something interesting.

One day I had the idea of simulating an office day by just having access to podcasts and music playlists. No YouTube no insta. 

This was a huge mistake! I managed to work for about three hours before hitting a wall of boredom. I had downloaded 2 podcasts and had some playlists. I think I made it through half one podcast and half of the other. At some point I put my phone down and lost it. I thought it was ok because I had music playing on shuffle but I was wrong. The boredom grew and I started feeling irritable. I kept getting up out of my seat and pacing around. Irate. I felt a huge wave of angry anxiety at the thought and feeling of dread from this boredom. 

I felt as if I was going insane! Like tearing up a tiny bit for some reason.

Im normally a very easy going , shy bc of inattention and pretty chill so this kind of scared me.

I couldn’t/ didn’t want to leave my apartment bc I was expecting a package. When I could finally go out, I took my dog out. I went for a 20 minute walk and still felt very irritable. At that point I had around 2 hours left of work and just stopped working. 

I don’t know how I would survive in an office setting where there is sooo much more that I cannot control. I hated every moment of that anxious irritability and would hate to have people see me.

Definitely need help. Called doctor the same day.

Part of me is always saying it’s not adhd it me being lazy (family’s go to when I would forget chores and appointments)",1
Feeling fucked up in my mind for having to adapt to a non-ADHD environment for years against my will,"Like the title, I struggle with severe mental health issues, involving anger, resentment and general numbness for living in a very ""protestant"" environment with ridigity and monotonous planning, which I simply couldn't escape until last year. I'm.doing better now in more flexible enviroment where I don't have to mask my adhd-traits as much and people seem to respect me more due to a spontaneous and flexible nature.  But still, I get haunted for these thoughts where I was shamed for not fitting into the conservative ""farmer""-mentality. It made me miserable, a d I internalised I was a piece of immature shit, which did not have to have happened.

I Just Can't Win,"Disclaimer: English is not my first language, i hope the post is clear enough.


I work as a ERP consultant/specialist, for just about 8 years now and i hate pretty much everything about it, the thing is i live in a country where that salary covers all my basic needs and if i were to leave i am not sure i could get a more engaging job with a good enough salary, considering i could not study in any university and dont have a degree, (i started at that company just answering phones and making coffee until eventually i learned everything i needed to become a consultant and my boss just started giving me clients). It is a very hard job for me as i need to be very organized and spend hours on repetitive, dull tasks for days/weeks.

I was diagnosed with adhd about a year and a half ago, and since then ive been trying different dosages for my meds, with these meds i have been doing great at work it is just so easy to do things, to sit down and draft a project requirements to send to programmers, or analyzing data, creating reports in SQL, etc, things that could take me weeks to finish just because i could not get started or just left them half finished.

The problem is with my personal life, especially with my girlfriend, we've been together for about 6 years now, but a couple of weeks ago she told me that she would like to take a break as she felt i am not into her as i once was, i am not intimate, fun or as obsessed with her as i was and she felt pushed aside. It is absolutely true, i could feel that I lost that part of myself with the medication, i became more objective focused, less fun, just more robotic in a bunch of ways, no more impulsive hugs, or ""fun time"" in the middle of the day, at night when meds wear off i am just tired and my mind is all muddled up and i cant get existed to do anyhing, i just want to watch something on tv and sleep.


Did anyone experience something like this? I dont know what to do. With the meds, i do great at work and dont hate it as much, but my personal life is falling apart, i just can't win.",1
I’m never going to be okay am I?,"So I was just scrolling the adhd meme subreddit and as I’m sure many of you here can I was seeing myself in the posts and comments and feeling personally attacked. And while I get it’s supposed to be funny memes it honestly just made me kinda sad cos I realised I’m never going to be okay.

I’m never going to be normal, I’m never going to achieve some of the most basic things like a stable healthy routine or being able to just live life like it’s not an uphill battle. I mean I’m getting heart palpitations from poor health and want to do all these things to improve it and I make all these plans to do it but when it comes to it I just can’t no matter how hard I try and I’m stuck in a viscous cycle of telling myself I’m going to do better and then hating myself at the end of the day.

I’m never going to be fully okay, I’m never going to just be normal, or just do the things I need to do. I’m never going to be able to stick to a routine or keep myself healthy. I’m never going to achieve my goals or complete my projects that give me the drive to keep going. And even if I was okay, and I did all those things, I still wouldn’t be happy because nothings enough for me. I always want more, if you told me 5 years ago everything I’ve done all the challenges I’ve overcome and how far along I am I would be ecstatic. But now that I’m here, it’s just not enough and I’m still not happy and I don’t think I ever will be.

"Nobody understands, I give up","Today I 26M (diagnosed 9 month with Inattentive ADD) just realize that i will never be understood by my family. Any thoughts of us being a better family is gone, of us having a better relationship is over. I am done, I give up. Today my sister 29F was talking on the phone to her boyfriend and said on you have adhd right, because my brother self diagnosed himself and thinks he has adhd and he act worse than you. My sister is a therapist who see adhd patients as well from what she tells me. I'm not sure how can she be a therapist or help people with adhd with their problems if she don't understand anything about me or can't see that I have it. She tells her boyfriend that I am self Dianoged which is stupid because I been Diagnosed by a psychiatrist and I take meds for it that I have to meet with a psychiatrist monthly to get that renewed. She knows that but I don't think she is an understanding person which don't make sense because she does have patients that like her and want her as a therapist. 

Also my parents are a lost cause. Every single day I don't do aethign right or fast enough and it's always the same, your a idiot, you cant do anything right, I waste my time making you, talking to you is like talking to a wall. Why are you like this, why can't you hold a job? Why can't you just try harder? Why can't you be better?  It's nothing but constant negatively at me for most of my life and I try to make them understand, I try to send them videos about adhd, try to explain it to them, and they can't or don't want to understand me and what I have, which sucks because if they take the time to do some research like 3 hours they will understand me better and maybe can help save them and me stress, but it isn't like that, it's just constant stress for me and for them, they are so frustrated with me and honeslty think they hate me and just want me to die. My sister calls me useless and other insults as well. My parents just think I'm stupid  but don't understand anything about my Condition, all they know is that it'd for hyperactive people. Well I give up, no way they will understand or ever understand. Sycks that I can't have a better relationship with my family.

 I guess I am just the black sheep. The no good very bad son of the family that is a disgrace and that how it is most of my life. Like I have such low self esteem and alot of stress because of the constant negativity of my family at me for not doing what they want when they want. It's all could be fixed if they could take the time and effort to learn amd understand me and adhd and seems like that won't or don't want to so it's over and I just give up. I'm stuck kn this house and just trying to think of how I'm gonna be on my own amd get my own place but I have no job and no money right now, I am broke and I just got out of school so I will try my hardest to get a remote job in another state or town or something. 

 These negatively to me is doing more harm than good. Adhd is having a harder time getting these negative insults, and the fact that I am messing up and constantly get blamed for not being good enough is just too toxic for me now, I can't be a better person with all this negativity at me, it so overwhelming and exhausting to just try to be the best I can be and just fail and get insulted, and this is a constant thing that happens daily in my life, I don't yell back or argue because that's not me, but I can't take this verbal abuse no more. I need to get out of here. Is anyone else in the same situation I am in? Are you the no good very bad son/daughter of your family that is a disgrace? I hope you all are doing well and I wish whatever struggles and problems you got that you overcome them. I hope your family is more understand than mine.",1
"Very overwhelmed with life, I don't know how to manage it all","I'm extremely depressed and I also have ""severe"" ADHD. I'm on meds but they aren't a magical cure as everyone here knows.

I'm a senior in college and I'm in two 3-week courses which are very intensive. I have to do an internship before I graduate and those are very stressful (I've done one already). I'd have to balance it with a full schedule, too. I feel drained even showering...but of course I can't let that be known to my professors or people I internship for. I have to pretend I am just the happiest and most motivated person on earth.

  
I sent about 4 emails today, expressing interest and asking my professor for guidance with my resume. Meanwhile I'm in tears from the pure exhaustion. I look lazy from the outside, my mother said to ""stop making excuses."" I am so tired. I can hardly take care of myself...how am I supposed to find the motivation and be able to do an internship?

  
My therapist is also trying to get me to make friends so I have Bumble BFF. I cannot for the life of me understand how to manage the anxiety that comes with that along with school, an internship, and just taking care of myself (movement, journaling, hygiene, etc.).

I feel so ashamed for being seen as ""lazy"" or like I'm letting anxiety control me. It's not even pure anxiety, it's just feeling so overwhelmed and I don't know how ""normal"" people manage life. I just don't understand. I feel so stupid for thinking it is CRAZY to do full-time school and a part-time internship. I did it before and god idk how I survived honestly. But when discussing this with my professor I have to pretend I'm totally fine and able to manage. On the inside I am in distress...",1
The cruelest joke my undiagnosed adhd plays on me is a fascination with productivity that I can never achieve.,"I’m working in a pretty fast paced tech environment so I’ve always been interested in optimising that. I’ve tried every app, every tool, every journal, spent days devising schemes for organising tasks . 


Without fail, it lasts a few weeks before the chaos consumes again. It’s infuriating. I know what to do, I know how to do it, but it slips through my fingers like sand.

Worst side of ADHD experience for me is memory issues,"I have spent a good time analysing myself before the diagnosis as to why I was the way I was.

There is one thing that I can't get over with; memory issues. 

A few things I can tell about it

My memory is filled with gaps, I can't retrieve information.

I explain stuff and suddenly the rest is missing, then either I makeup something or face the shame. This could be a random funny story or a presentation in front of your boss. Result is the same.

I will see a doctor about this stuff. Just not sure how much of that is something expected.",1
My mom maked me feel like an idiot,"I was packing for a trip tomorrow and she came into my room and started telling me what to do. What i should pack,why i didnt pack it before,show her what i took, just general things. Its like she hovered all over me.
I felt like an incompetent idiot that can't even pack. I felt so crowded by her so i started yelling,pulling on my hair and face,bitting  myself and i physicly couldnt look her in the eye. I asked her to leave and she did and now i feel bad.
I know im not reliable,im not sure if im able to live on my own,i dont remeber to drink,shower,eat,stuff like that.
But at that moment i just felt so stupid and so irratated that i just snaped.

I need to accept my uni offer but I can't get myself to do it,"Basically, I need to accept a uni offer I got. It's the only offer I can accept and it's a course I really want to do. I got another offer from another uni but I was not sure if I actually qualify and the support told me I don't so it's not an option anymore. I really just need to click the button and then apply for accommodation on campus. But I just can't do it. 

I think it may be because I find the other course more interesting but even before the support told me I don't qualify I was thinking about going to the uni I need to accept the offer from now anyway because it got much better support etc. I don't know if this is actually an adhd problem or not but you guys are a great support group and my parents are no help. They just keep telling me I need to click the button and accept the offer but I know that I just can't do it. 

It feels a bit like adhd paralysis because I am on my phone screaming internally to open my e mails and click on the accept offer button but the difference is that it's been going on for days. I can ignore it when I am at work because then I am busy but as soon as I get home I keep telling myself over and over again to accept the offer but I can't do it and it's ruining my days. Any tips or any support?",1
"Why can I be so compassionate sometimes, and other times be emotionally unavailable?","I struggle with this immensely. I’m not a bad or evil person, I don’t wish harm or pain on anybody. But sometimes I don’t feel a single thing when someone tells me something that involves painful emotions. For example, a coworker of mine mentioned their grandfather passed away a day prior. I said I’m sorry to hear that, as is respectful, but I didn’t feel any sympathy/empathy. Not because I think they deserved it or whatever, but because I couldn’t muster that emotion. I switched up and got back to what I was doing like I didn’t hear anything.

Conversely, I can be extremely thoughtful and compassionate with people. An example would be that a friend of mine was going through a downturn in their mental health (depression). I immediately called them and talked for two hours, offered to bring food over and hang out, and made some plans to go out to let loose. 

I’d like to add that the examples I gave extend both ways to the people I know. Compassionate with coworkers and emotionally unavailable for friends/family. 

Is this related to ADHD? Am I just someone who chooses when to be compassionate? It’s sort of exhausting, not in a mental way, but in a ‘I’m tired of having different personalities’ way.",1
"Well,I ruined yet another school year for myself.","Well,the school year is ending soon.Wich means I feel like absolute shit again. Every year I keep telling myself I'll try to pay more attention in class.That I will do my homework.I NEVER DO IT.

It's not even like I try my best every day,I just look at my iPad in class and let myself get distracted.When I try for like a second to pay attention it doesn't work and I just tell myself ""aw damn,well I guess I have no choice but look at my iPad again"".

 Is it even my ADHD at this point?Why am I doing this?Why don't I just do my homework instead of watching YouTube again?WHY? Everyone is mad at me and they aren't in the wrong for thinking that.Other pepole with ADHD can do it just fine,they are productive in school.But I just keep being lazy.I don't know what to do.I feel so bad.Like nothing is ever gonna be ok again.I keep doing this to myself.

Stimulants enhanced my memory and I accidentally became self aware.,"One month into stimulants and I just became accutely aware of my true nature. ADHD was completely blocking me from accepting innate parts of my personality. My memory could not hold enough information to gain perspective.

 I laid in bed, and a clear visualisation of my childhood ran in my mind. I grabbed my journal and started recording the sequence. I pushed as far back as I could , at my first signs of impulse management. My mother would never correct any impulses. Hmmmm I kept going through insane acts of unrestrained impulsivity and nope, no corrections. I then got a sense of my emotions at the time, something completely missing from memory before stimulants and focussing on my past. A sense of being ""special"", but this sense was felt with my newer higher order functions, more access to understand emotion.....

It hit me right there and then. Like nothing has ever hit me before. I wrote the words..... Is this narcissistic personality disorder?

My mind went blank...... Memories loaded fast and hard. I started tingling all over my body and just held back my emotions from exploding. It was impossible to miss now. Everything fell in place. My grandmother was queen narcissistic, my mother was a victim and unfortunately was unaware of her inability to love me normally. Raising me with ADHD, and dysfunctional parenting style left me with personality defects that would go on to a highly dysfunctional adult life. For all three, Grandmother, Mother and Son.

In one evening, every single moment in my life made more sense then ever before. Previous diagnosis of NPD a decade before I could never accept. Not until the ADHD was treated could I access enough emotional intelligence to remember my life. I believe I was hiding myself from this trauma. It's not easy to see. 

Its been a really big few weeks. My wife is really not surprised, and Im so lucky my strange broken way of loving a person has been compatible. Now with ADHD treated, I can make an effort to be adaptive. My maladaptions will never totally disappear but it's a relief to start a new journey, where I can minimise harm on others through awareness.

Rejecting what works well,"So this is a bit of an abstract thing that became evident to me when playing some games with friends, but applies in many areas of life including work and relations.. I noticed that when there is a solution to a problem, or a certain way to do things, many people will stick to that solution and do it repeatedly until that no longer works, while for myself, as soon as such solution is found I immediately tend to act like ""ok I know this method works, now is there a way to do it faster, or with less effort?"" And often times I find myself stuck in endless experimenting of suboptimal approaches looking for that one that might be 1% better. Some people look at me in that process and say ""you're making such silly mistake because you can just do X and it works"" and I'm aware of that, but also can't help the constant urge to look for different ways to do it (a process that of course involves many silly mistakes)

Does anyone else find it hard to stick to that one method that you know is working?",1
Feel like I can only be super sympathetic or not sympathetic,Idk if this is because of the adhd or just something else I deal with but it's like being overly sympathetic adds to my anxiety (I work in healthcare) and it puts me in people pleaser mode also. But to protect myself I just become irritable and stop caring about others and I don't want to be that person. I enjoy being positive and helping others and idk how to find middle ground on being sympathetic but also getting myself to set emotional boundaries so I don't exhaust myself.,1
giving up lol,"i’ve tried literally every coping mechanism.

i’ve tried exercise. caffeine. no caffeine. I’ve tried sleeping well. not sleeping at all. cutting out sugar. eating a ton of sugar. cigarettes. to do lists. calendars. pomodoro. working with friends. working alone. working at home. working at cafes. 

nothing helps. my brain is constantly under stimulated, overwhelmed, restless. i can’t get anything done. and it is getting worse. 

i think i just don’t care anymore. and honestly i wish people around me would give up on me too. 

but they refuse to acknowledge that i’m struggling and keep expecting me to try harder. as far as my parents and professors are concerned I’m too smart to be struggling. I just need to work harder and work on my lack of practicality and black and white thinking. 

my mom also refuses to get me meds because apparently when i was diagnosed as a kid it was very mild so it’s not bad enough for professional help. 

i’m giving up but it’s kind of liberating. i don’t have it in me to care anymore.",1
I said something stupid and I feel so bad.,"I recently started hanging out with a new group of people that are a bit older than me. We usually just game together and stuff, and during an online game, the other team was messing around/acting really stupid. I tend to kind of blurt stuff out when I'm excited or overstimulated (aka in this moment) and I said ""is this person om crack !?"" completely without thinking. As soon as I said it, I felt like an idiot, it was immature truthfully. One of the guys then said that someone here had struggled with addiction and that wasn't funny. I immediately said ""I'm so sorry"". I felt so terrible and still do, and the vibe kind of got killed completely after that. I ended up just muting and leaving after the game because I felt so dumb and I didn't even know what to say. I have done this so many times, where I am just offensive on accident and that was particularly immature and in bad taste, I feel so sick over it. I don't know these people that well and they're new friends and I really don't want to lose them over this, but I feel like I won't be welcome anymore and I don't feel like I deserve to be. I'm not looking for sympathy but I just needed to get this out I guess.",1
Screaming Into My Pillow,"Every time I get a medication refill I label the top of the lid so I can see what it is when looking down at the tray where I store all my medication bottles. 

I use permanent marker to easily see with clear tape on top so I don’t smudge it.  It’s just an abbreviation of the chemical and the dose in milligrams so I can quickly sort the information. 

Since this process is multiple steps, I have wrestled with executive dysfunction to do this each time I get a refill. Often losing. 

I’ve spent nearly a year with this process as a nagging thorn in my side. Weeks of stalling and sighing as I pick up the bottle to read the label knowing I should have done it sooner. 

About three minutes ago, I realized I could just put the old lid on the new bottle as long as the content stayed the same. The lids are hard plastic. I don’t move the bottles from the tray. I’m not in a humid area. There’s no reason not to. 

I could have swapped the lids this entire time. How. How did I not see this earlier??

Anyone go off Adderall and feel happier?,"My local pharmacies are declining to fulfill out-of-state telemedicine prescriptions, so while I wait to switch to a local clinic, I have run out of Adderall and have been off it for 4 days now. I was always on a super low-dose (IR), so other than tiredness (which could also be attributed to a mild infection I’m fighting), I haven’t felt anything other than…happy. More at peace than I’ve felt for a long time and more excited about life around me. 

I was initially scared of going off it because I am worried how I will have to muscle through projects at work that are sometimes boring to me. But I had forgotten how much more creative and lively I am off of it.

Now I’m questioning whether or not even going back on medication is worth it. I mean, yes, it makes getting on task and staying on task easier, but I am so emotionally blunted. Which is hard because my creativity and in-born sense of inspiration is apparently, emotion-based.

I don’t know if I have a specific question. I guess I am musing more than anything.",1
How did your close ones react when you got diagnosed as an adult? Not good for me,"Hello,  
  
I was first diagnosed with ADHD in March this year. Ever since, whenever I share this with someone I care, they'll start by asking why I think I have it, and not long after I start explaining, they'll say ""that happens to me as well"". It is really frustrating and sad.

Impostor syndrome then hits me and makes me think ""maybe you don't have it, the symptoms can be easily misinterpreted, there's a lot of people on the internet claiming they have it just because they can't pay attention to things they don't like"".

I'm lead to think similar stories have happened to not few of you, and would like to hear them.

Focusing on the wrong thing,"This is day 3 now of me being on my reinstated prescription of Adderall XR (15mg) after 5 months of being off of it. I was concerned that it wasn’t working, but it just dawned on me that I’ve been hyper focused on creating a song in GarageBand. I don’t even know the first thing about making music, nor have I ever shown interest in it before now. The beat I’ve been working on has consumed my life for the past few days, it’s constantly playing in my head and I’m always itching to work on it when I have to be away from my laptop. At first I thought it was kind of humorous but the reality has set in and I’m frustrated. At this point I don’t know what’s better- being unmedicated and unable to do anything at all, or being medicated and focusing on all the wrong things, which leads to me still feeling like garbage about not doing what I need to do. 

I know it almost seems like such a little thing, and maybe I should be proud for engaging creatively in a new hobby. But there’s so much real work that needs to be done in my life and I can’t seem to shift my attention to anything that matters. I feel myself sliding into a deeper and deeper depression by the day. I just want to be able to do things. For some people, just wanting to do something is motivation enough. But no matter how much I tell myself that I want to get up, and that it would feel so good to have a clean room, or kitchen, or to work on my education, I just can’t get up. It even extends to my other hobbies like playing video games and making art. I feel apathetic toward it all but I want so badly to just feel pure innocent joy that’s unhindered by my lack of motivation.",1
Help understanding my own ADHD better,"Hi, me (19M, ADHD (probably) mixed type) feel like I myself don't understand my ADHD at all.

Starting meds has made me realise what I should have been able to do,"Hi,

First time poster on here and on Reddit. Also on mobile :/.

I started meds a week ago on the starting dose and today is my first day on a higher dose and it feels great but also so bittersweet.

I feel so much more capable, my anxiety and depression symptoms are massively reduced and I feel like a different person but in a good way. That thick water of brain fog is mostly gone and it feels so calm.

On the other hand though, I feel sadness for my younger self. I'm not that old (25) but it feels like if I was diagnosed when I was much younger, it would have been easier, not just for the general ADHD symptoms we experience but also for my self esteem. I spent much of my teenage years thinking I was just lazy. Always doing homework and such at the last minute unless we were in class and could do it then.

I feel sad for my younger self. I was the person that everyone thought was super happy and not stressed about very much but underneath that I was deeply scared and stressed about everything. I wish my younger self could feel how I feel today.

I'm glad that I have got here though. It took a couple years to realise and another 1 year to get diagnosed and start treatment but in the end it was worth it. The only other sad part is I'm very confident at least one of my siblings has ADHD and my mum. They are very supportive with me but I don't know if I should talk to them about my concerns. It feels like if they do have ADHD and experience even a small amount of the relief this process has given me, it would help them so much.

Sorry for the long text and hopefully I got my first post right 😅",1
How do you deal with the idea that you are failing at something?,"Let me explain: I like doing creative work, in particular writing. I started writing books or just novels many times, but always failed to complete them with some minor exceptions.

I hype myself up when I start writing something, I feel like I'm gonna have a blast writing it and I have big expectations. Even though I'm not bad at all at writing I start soon to feel like I'm not good enough and I start to wonder if I should keep writing or not.

Obviously I stop, believing I am not capable of delivering what I expect. 

What do you do in these situations?",1
Would love some help,"I figured I'd type in this subreddit because I quite frankly was unsure where else to go.  
  


I was diagnosed with ADHD while finishing up my first semester of medical school. I had always not been great at paying attention to lectures (or other people talking), I was always incredibly forgetful, I was always late to things, and I always had severe FOMO and I have always had crippling fears of people being upset with me. Whenever I'd talk to people I've always had my brain running 6 thoughts at once, and it never seemed to slow down.  
  
I always figured I was just a 'normal, but slightly anxious person' but when the onslaught of medical school curriculum happened I was hit by a truck. I had in undergrad and high school always been able to ease through my classes and I got away with my tendencies to heavily procrastinate, but med school proved to be too tall of a task  
  
At first, the diagnoses and the Aderall prescription was such a relief. I finally felt like I had figured out the root of my torrid anxiety, my near-0 confidence levels, my med school challenges, and some of my social difficulties. But overtime, I have felt like this past year has still absolutely unravelled me. When I'm on the Aderall, I'm able to nail my schoolwork, I am able to focus, and I am slightly less anxious. But it poses a slew of novel problems that I've struggled with. I am never hungry anymore, and as someone who has been lifting and finally seeing results, this lack of hunger always has stunted my progress. This in turn has made me less confident about my body, which has given me another reason to be afraid to pursue a love life. The Aderall has also warped my experience to go out and drink with friends, which is the usual go to amongst my classmates (the alcohol gets masked until it hits me all at once, and then I'm unable to enjoy myself), and when I'm slightly inebriated and the aderall wears off, I get horribly cranky. In general, the withdrawal I get at the end of the day has made me irritable and snappy, and this started to bleed into my friendships. It has also affected my ability to sleep at times.  
  
I feel in a horrible catch 22. When I'm on aderall I get my academic success back, my head is less of an anxious, swirling nightmare, and I am able to not forget things. However, with the aderall I've found it way harder to achieve the body I want, and the withdrawal I at times feel has made me scared to be near my friends. I haven't taken my aderall in two weeks, but this has just led me to return to being anxious and clingy.  
  
I was writing on here for advise/insight I guess. Whether I'm on the aderall or not, I severely lack confidence, just in different ways (I either feel ugly or anxious or both). My confidence levels are so low that I stopped going out to bars, and I feel incredibly hopeless about finding someone who could manage to love me when my brain feels so unattractive. I also don't like relying on a drug that makes me cranky at the end of the day. I've become less jolly (only my closest friends would notice) and I feel so so lonely. My parents don't understand, and none of my friends have ADHD and are getting attention from members of the opposite sex, are doing well in their careers, and in general are far more sure of themselves (they have their own problems believe me, but I can't help but feel jealous.) I have never felt more unaligned with my own self. I want to be able to find love, I want to not be worried about whether or not my friends are upset with me all the time, I want to have an inner peace and 'enjoy the moment' rather than mostly fret about my past or future. Therapy has helped in ways, but not as much as I'd like at times, and I thought maybe talking to those battling ADHD could help me",1

Medication Induced Hair Loss Crisis,"I'm in despair. My entire life is a mess due to ADHD and excessive daytime sleepiness. I've tried Vyvanse, which has helped with both issues, particularly the hypersomnia. However, I've experienced hair loss, including eyelashes and eyebrows, while on the medication. This side effect has led me to research amphetamines, where I've found many people complaining about hair loss as well. I also tried Modafinil, but I found it to be less effective. However, I'm concerned about the possibility of hair loss with Modafinil, as I've come across several posts on Reddit mentioning it as a side effect.

As a woman, I cannot afford to lose my hair. At the same time, I feel I have no choice but to take the medication that will eventually make me bald as I've wasted so many years of my life due to my conditions. The decision between prioritising my physical appearance and having my hair, even if it means having a chaotic life, or taking medication to get my life in order, but accepting the possibility of becoming bald and feeling less attractive, is throwing me into overwhelming despair. I know I sound dramatic but this dilemma is causing me to question the purpose of continuing on. I feel like wasted potential. I'm tired of life and I'm hopeless.

I previously tried a non-stimulant medication like Strattera, but it resulted in excessive sweating as a side effect. I'm considering going back on Strattera and simultaneously taking a Hyperhidrosis medication to manage the unpleasant sweating. I don't know how effective this will be.",1
drained and unable to break the cycle.,"I keep telling myself that the only way to fix my life is to set a routine and plan every second of my day to give myself some kind of structure but I expect too much of myself and it shows in the way I plan things out and if they’re not high expectations then it’s not stimulating enough for me but in both cases I just…don’t do anything. 

I work a 9-6 desk job and my physical health is dwindling so I was like ok let’s make a nice schedule to be active at least 30-40 mins a day (I love working out, do I do it?

Not late, late late. Then I get up. What’s worse is that I tried it, working out then going to work. Got stuck in traffic, made me late, ended up on my ick list of things to do.

I've tried literally every med and nothing has helped. I give up.,"I've tried literally every med available and nothing helped. I give up.

I don't know what to do man, I got official diagnosed about 3 years ago and have been testing different meds since. First it was Adderall 15mg XR, then 30mg when I didn't feel anything with the 15mg. The only thing I got for my troubles was insomnia for the first few days, a constant pressure on my chest, and a annoying lack of appetite. Then I took Vyvanse, it was more of the same, I felt nothing and the only thing different was that the side effects were more tolerable. Concerta came after that, god did I hate concerta. My brain simply didn't stop buzzing, it was as if I was listening to never ending tv static and I couldn't fall asleep until I literally collapsed from exhaustion, still no change that felt even somewhat helpful. 

After concerta I thought that maybe stimulants weren't the answer, so I started taking strattera. It took about a month for me to actually begin to feel the effects of it, but for the first time I actually felt something better, not just annoying side effects, but real help, and it only got better as the dosage was increased all the way up to 80mg, which as far as I'm aware is the standard dose for an adult male. Wanna know what happened next? IT GAVE ME DEPRESSION!

It started a bit after the 6 month mark, my mood kept getting worse and worse. Every day I felt there was less and less reasons to live, every day I hated ever being born. At first I chalked it up to the stress of school simply getting to me, I was wrong. I only understood what was really happening about a month after I started thinking these thoughts, to which I immediately stopped taking the meds.

It's been two months since then, and completely disheartened I decided to try one last med, Wellbutrin, an antidepressant and off-label ADHD med that I've been taking until today. By far my least favorite of the bunch. Worst case of insomnia of all of them. And the tremors, god the tremors. My hands NEVER STOPPED SHAKING. Feels like I have parkinsons for gods sake. It's not even that high of a dose, 150 mg, and guess what? Even now I feel no beneficial change.

I understand that these meds aren't a cure, that they're only supposed to help, but I haven't felt jack. Just side effect after side effect. And I'm tired of it. Honestly I'm beginning to doubt whether or not I even actually have ADHD after the failing of all of these meds. That maybe It really is just a horrible lack of self discipline. So I'm done with meds now, honestly not really sure where to go from here, just more of the same I suppose.",1
"Everything is a chore, even the things I love","They say that to be able to achieve anything, to find motivation, you need to know your “why”. I call it knowing my endgame. I think that’s absolutely true and it has always worked well for me.

I left home a few days after highschool graduation - I moved to another country to study and it was as exciting as it was exhausting. With barely any time off, I was studying or working or thinking of either. Still, although it was hard I was able to pull it off - cause I knew what my endgame was. I wanted a degree.

After leaving uni, when I was finally free of shuckles and could do whatever I wanted, **I realised I had absolutely no idea what I was supposed to do**. I no longer knew what my end game was.

For a long time now, I have been wondering what to do about that. Is my endgame for the week to get to the weekend? Is my endgame for the next couple of years to get a better paying job? And then, after I’ve done it all, what will my endgame be? What’s the actual point of reading, taking walks, staying healthy, keeping relationships?

And then it hit me, as banal as it sounds, that the endgame might just be those things in itself. The point of reading a book shouldn’t be to finish a chapter, to finish it all, to finish another one by the end of the month. It is to *read.* The point of going for walks isn’t to walk a mile, to walk ten miles, to take 7 walks each week, it is to *walk*.  


Obviously, there will always be things we can’t find pleasure in, and having goals is useful. But for the most part, I think I should make peace with the fact that the process should be the endgame in itself.

But how to do that with ADHD? When your body is literally incapable of producing satisfaction from those tasks? Or worse, it’s a *chore* to read, to walk, to hang out with friends. How do I live then?",1
How do I overcome the resistance in my head to achieve a thing I actually want to do?,"I don't mean, 'I can't clean my teeth' even though that's a doozie, I can't bring myself to do my passion (X). Can anyone relate to that sentiment or is that a broken me thing? 

What happens is I do the classic 'I can't do X because I haven't bought Y yet' then I have a good excuse to not do anything towards X until Y arrives. By which time I've procrastinated onto buying Z. Repeat until dead. 

Even after I've bought the whole alphabet there's a part of me that just won't let the rest of me just sit down and get on with the thing I've been thinking about all day. 

Its confusing and frustrating me and causing a lot of internal conflict, even if you haven't a solution, but you have something similar going on with your X I would like to hear  that. 

I'm trying to acknowledge the resistance and try to understand why my brains doing this to me.",1
"Dear self, you need to hear this","Dear Self,

I've been wanting to tell you what I'm about to say for a very long time, but I could never quite understand it or find the right words. This won't be perfect or everything you need to know,  but this is where I'll begin.

First and foremost, I need to apologize. I'm sorry for the way I've been treating you since you were a little girl. Always being so hard on you. Comparing you to everyone else. Always telling you that you're not good enough. Always questioning every decision you make. Telling you that you're fat and that is the only thing people think when they see you. I'm sorry for telling you that you're lazy and unmotivated.  I'm sorry for leading you into physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive relationships for most of your adult life and telling you to stay in them as nobody else will ever love you. I'm sorry for being your worst enemy and for constantly making you feel like life is harder for you than for the people around you, and making you feel like it's your fault. I'm sorry.

At almost 33 years old, you've been diagnosed with ADHD. Things now seem so clear as to why you went to college 3 separate times and never graduated even though you only needed 3 more credits, why everyone else seems to have it easier than you and why the push and pull in your head never stops.

Guess what... this isn't your fault. You're not lazy. You're not a loser, and most importantly, you're not unloved.

I will tell you though, that this will never go away. It's something that you will need to live with and face every day for the rest of your life. 

There are few people around you who will understand how this has impacted you and how it has changed the way your life has been for so many years.  

You need to know that after years and years of heartache, pain, and tears, you have found yourself in a place of peace. You can now understand why things were the way they were.

I promise, I will now give you more grace and compassion. You are a wonderful mother.  You have a wonderful husband and home, and the people that surround you truly adore you.

Your weight does not define who you are as a person, and ADHD is not who you are. It is a part of you, and you, my dear, are wonderful.

Many people consider this a disability and though it has disabled you from so many things, it has also enabled you. It has enabled you to be where you are in life right now, and you are exactly where you need to be. 

Life is not an easy thing to navigate, but you are strong, smart, and you can do this. Please remember that this world needs you in it, just the way that you are.

- xoxo",1
"I never realized how many of ""us"" there are.","For the days I feel so alone, misunderstood and unsupported, I remember this sanctuary of understanding and empathy. Your words, your experiences your history and it parallels so much with my own. 

I was diagnosed at 60. Tried all the meds I could and nothing could help without hurting physically or mentally. 

I look at my regrets of the past and now understand myself so much better.  I was the grand poobah of fucking things up, being misunderstood and screwing up so many relationships, friendships, even my family life. 

But I return to this topic again and again. It's therapy. I learn more about myself the more you share about yourselves and I am so damn grateful for you. 

You are my therapy. I know I'm not losing my mind and above all there is hope. Thank you.",1
Can’t get real help because I was an addict 3+ years ago.,"I turned my life around have a child now and will never look back. I’ve tried strattera, guanfecine which made me like pass out from being maxed out, Wellbutrin, nothing works and even though I had my medical 🍃 card it doesn’t matter bc it’s federally illegal according to my psychiatrist so that counts as me still being a risk to addiction ( even tho I quit the mmj months ago too)
just to try Ritalin. Other psychiatrists were willing to try adderall with me but unfortunately the one stopped accepting my insurance and the other retired. Now this one is anti 🍃 and won’t prescribe any stimulants, tells me to do YouTube adhd meditation daily . It’s BS!!!! My life is a mess and I will never get help. I told her this is effecting my work , home, daily life and oh well…… idk what to do . Upset af and unhappy with life at this point. What can I do! So many psychiatrists are just like anti stimulants now ): I can’t even brush my teeth daily or shower and vacuum. I just can’t routinely do it but I really want to.",1
ADHD Thing of the Day,"I was reasoning with myself to throw away a travel size bottle of thing of hand sanitizer that I bought right before the pandemic. I got so close. I said: “oh this old thing, I can toss this….” Walked toward the garage can… and I quickly followed up with “…in the drawer”

Man! I was close any tips on how to break the cycle? (Yes I’m medicated)",1

I would really appreciate it if anyone struggled with something similar and found a solution, please help a brother out with a tip or two 🙏.",1
"I got friend-dumped the other day, and it hurts so much.","  As the title says, I (24F) have been friend dumped.  It was in the evening, over snapchat, where he (23M) sent me a text saying 

""Hey, I need to end our friendship.""

  At first I was thinking I read it wrong, but then he kept going with

""I need to do it out of respect for my ex girlfriend.""

  Now we had previously had a falling out where we hooked up and he didnt tell me he was in a relationship, and I was feeling really guilty so I told his girlfriend (22F) that I didnt feel comfortable keeping it to myself anymore, and I explained it to her.  After that both of them blocked me on everything.  Well back in January 2023, after a few months of not talking, he messages me and says 

""Hey.  I want to apologize.""

  And then it brought back so many memories and pain from the first time i was cut out, that I had my guard up HIGH.  He then started to say that he ""Valued our friendship"" and ""had been feeling awful about it since"".  Me being so easily trusting, I accepted him back in my life and gave him a second chance.

  Now, between January and May 2023, we started talking again like we were before.  Eventually there was some spicy content shared.  And at this point, I think things are looking up, and that he actually wants to work this out.

  The last week of May was when I was dumped.  I was furious, like beyond upset, because I trusted him with so much of myself that I don't often share with people.  I laid in bed and just cried, and asking why.  It felt like somebody had run a sword through me, and I felt so weak and helpless.  It was awful, and it felt like a part of me had just died, and there was a void now in my life, again.

  I still had to go to work the next few days, so I had to suck it up and not show that something is going on.  When I would get back home, I would sit there and cry, and sob, and write down all my thoughts and feelings about this.  How I told him to NEVER attempt to contact me again, and that he was a terrible person, somebody I considered a friend and had trusted, had just stabbed me in the back, like what was I supposed to do?  

  I sent him some messages that I do regret, like saying that I hope everybody he gets close to leaves him once they realize he's a terrible person.  How if I had a gun to shoot him, I would shoot myself instead so he'd have to live with it.  How I wish I could physically stab him in the back so that maybe, he'd understand what he put me through, and maybe think before doing it to someone else.  

  It's been 4 days, but it still hurts.  I go to check my messages, and he's not there.  I've cried so much these last few nights, and I know that he is going about with his life perfectly fine, and everything is just rainbows and unicorns over there.  And then I'm on the other side feeling every emotion on the upset spectrum.  My eyes would water up whenever I'd think about our chats or anything, and I can feel the lump inside my throat growing.

  It took me so long to get over him the first time.  I'm scared that if I trust somebody, they're gonna turn out like him.  I'm worried that my emotional instability will just remain unstable because of him.  I'm trying to tell myself that his words or whatever had ANYTHING to do with my self-worth.  I attach a lot of my self-esteem on other people's opinions of me, despite knowing full well that I'm the only one who can determine my worth.  

&#x200B;

  Does anybody have any advice on how to move on, or even grieve the loss of a friendship?",1
Bad at Math,"I've been bad at math my whole entire life, I feel like no matter how much learn and what I learn I would still make mistakes within a math test. Even right now when I'm taking extra classes for math, I still don't feel confident in my math skills. Every time I look at the problem, I get increasingly overwhelmed and overcomplicate what I need to do which well in turn makes me do the question wrong or let me sit there ages trying to figure it out. 

I'm not even sure I have ADHD but after researching it seems like I fit in a lot with inattentive ADHD or a mix of both. I'm just wondering if ADHD sometimes contributes to this overwhelming feeling whenever I look at a math problem.",1
My frustrating experience trying to treat ADHD with medication since 2015,"I'm diagnosed with ADHD-C and  Autism (ASD-1), I've tried every ADHD stimulant currently available starting way back in 2015 up to now and all of them have given me horrible physical/mental side effects that overpowered the benefits. All of their benefits were laser like focus, attention, and motivation, but to such an extreme degree I no longer felt human anymore, I just felt like a robot programmed to complete a task and nothing more. I didn't care about anything else other than the task I was focused on, be it a project, listening to someone talk, learning, daily chores, etc

It's like I'm trading creativity, humor, wit, love, and social interest for alleviating everything that ADHD makes difficult for me. I feel like it's just not worth it.

I have also tried alternatives like Strattera and Guanfacine but those just made me feel ill and tired all the time. I'm also diagnosed with autism, so maybe that's why I'm having such an atypical response to these meds. I'm about to just give up and go back to drinking coffee again. The only thing that sucked about coffee is the afternoon sleepiness and mild anxiety.

Anyone else out there go through a similar experience as me? How have you learned to cope being a poor responder to medication? Is there any hope for people like us?",1
Emotional disregulation,"Of all the shitty things about ADD, I don’t know where I’d place emotional disregulation, but it really fucking sucks. Losing my shit like a lunatic, slamming doors, throwing stuff. It’s just so not fun.

"Job help, bills need to get paid",Since my mom passed i have too take over the rent and bills. Anyone know any good jobs for a 20yr old male with unmedicated ADHD? Im working on entering the military soon to pay for college however i need to keep the lights on until then. Ive done the math and to cover bills and rent i need to make $20/hour minimum.,1
small things SO hard. i just want someone to tell me what to do. except that if they did i would hate it.,"I’ve been living on my own for almost a year now— first time, graduated uni last year. I’m in a city far away from family and most friends. I feel so embarrassed at how long it’s taken me to do normal things, like figuring out how to pay my council tax after many tearful phone calls met with automated voice mails. Some days, feeding myself three square meals and showering felt like an epic mission. Still does!!! There were certainly a few months of depression which obviously made everything harder (plus being newly sober), but even now that the weather’s nice and warm, I’ve got a job and a cat and more friends, the simple things are still so difficult. I’m not depressed currently— I’m in pretty good spirits considering how humbled I am at the moment by how debilitating my ADHD is. 

If I put something in the oven, it WILL be burned. If I start running a bath, it WILL nearly overflow. It took me three weeks to complete my last cycle of laundry because it kept getting damp and forgotten. ‘Now’ seems to consistently be a crossroads between several boring things I have to put in order of priority and do: ‘now’ is always needing the toilet, boiling the kettle for the third time, figuring out what to eat, walking in and out of rooms, doing my rubik’s cube just for something to do with my hands. My whole goal for today was to not let my blood sugar drop so low that I feel faint— I’ve succeeded, but that genuinely has been my entire focus. oh shit I’ve just remembered there’s laundry in the machine!!!!!!!

It feels like I’m regressing — but I know that’s not true. I used to put myself in situations that would keep me adrenalised 24/7, with five projects on the go and absolutely no time to second guess anything, since a deadline was never more than a day or two away. I think it took so long for me to be diagnosed because I didn’t relate to the struggle to focus, because I was constantly adrenalised and too busy and spinning plates from the age of 11 to 22!! I get it now. I can’t focus, I can;t remember the thought I just had, I cannot for the life of me decide on anything right now. I spend hours in daydreams, the way I did when I was a child.. I feel like a child! I’m afraid of the supermarket because of how spaced out it makes me feel, and choosing between brands for somethign, deciding it I ‘deserve’ something or can afford something else leaves me in tears. I’m medicated, too. I had hoped the meds would keep working as well as they did in the beginning. And don’t get me wrong, they still help— the way I describe it, they provide a safety net for when I fall off the tightrope— it’s still an inconvenience to fall, uses up time, and embarrasses me but I don’t break my legs. 


I’m sober and I’m trying to be strict about positive self-talk. I’m keeping me and the cat alive, and I havent been arrested yet for not filling out some important form I’ve never heard of. I don’t want to go back to the high-stress, burnout cycle. But right now it’s hard to see how I can manage to do interesting things that excite me without that heightened fast-moving environment. I don’t want to spend my twenties struggling to do laundry. My friends are all doing these amazing graduate jobs and I’m bribing myself to do the washing up. I’m not jealous, and I’m actually proud of myself — slowly but surely, I’m learning, and I’m building a strong relationship with myself. But its such a weird achievement to tell anyone about — it just sounds like im depressed to other people (which I’m not at the moment, and I know what that looks/feels like for me). And it’s not an ‘achievement’ — because it’s a process. Even if I wash the dishes tonight, there’ll be more tomorrow. And I might not be able to do them tomorrow— but i’m working on choosing it now. What a weird life! 

in summary i guess i’m coming to terms with the fact i really do have a disability. it was never going to be sustainable to use stress to force productivity. this is life!! i do love my cat and she’s just as distractable as me.",1
So I was all ready to post and forgot the message,"No i really did.

Having adhd and a part-time job in college is hell. I’m too overwhelmed,"I’m kinda losing my mind and have been scrolling Indeed for the past 2 hours. This turned into the longest, disorganized post I’ve ever written. I’m so sorry 

I’ve been working since I’ve I turned 15 and have experience as a fast food worker, server, dog sitter, Doordasher, tutor, wedding assistant, and house cleaner. I’m going to college to be a therapist, but I’m not even sure I’ll enjoy that.

But anyway, I just recently started working fine dining after not serving for a while and this particular restaurant is not scheduling me. I only have one shift next week :) I’m losing my mind since I just finished my semester and have nothing to do. But I also dread going to work because my anxiety is through the roof whenever I start a new job. They’re really strict with making mistakes, and I’ve already made a couple and been yelled at. Ive always had awful social anxiety, but I was able to get over it with my last job serving. I did enjoy it, but it had a lot of management issues. I quit and started 4 different jobs at once (dog sit, doordash, tutor, wedding assistant) and got overwhelmed of course. I hated doordashing, tutoring, and there’s just not enough hours for the wedding assistant job. I desperately need a lot of money to support myself in college, so that’s why I did that, but I need structure in my life. I literally failed 2 classes this semester, this is the worst I’ve ever done. 
That’s why I’m working at this new restaurant, but there’s no point in staying if they’re not scheduling me, right? So I’ve turned to scrolling Indeed and changing the filters every possible way to find something I could apply to. But will I apply to anything today? I haven’t even updated my resume since I started this new job. I hate interviews. I hate quitting jobs. I don’t know what kind of job I’m looking for, or why I’m doing this, and I can’t stop.

This was supposed to be an advice post but honestly this is just a messy rant. like what the hell am I doing? I just want to feel productive, make money, get out of debt, and have a job that will work with my college hours once the next semester starts. AND it can’t make me lose my mind. I can’t find it. I can’t make myself do any of my hobbies and just enjoy my summer because I’m so stressed about money and figuring out a new job. indeed is not showing me good restaurants hiring around me, maybe I should just move away from serving again. I don’t know what to do with myself. I don’t want to doordash anymore because my car is awful, so I can’t even do that to fill my time. I’m currently dog sitting, but they’re stressed out, throwing up, and they’re old so I’m irrationally anxious they’re going to die at any moment. I wish I was at home with my cat :(",1
"Another, ""Oh, that's why.""","I only really became aware of my ADHD as an adult and really only as a byproduct of dealing with the onset of my bipolar disorder, which comes on in your mid 20s generally, and considering it seriously. In the intervening years as I have become more aware and paying attention for it there are a lot of things that make a lot of sense in this new context. This used to happen pretty frequently but on top of having the experience I had got to a decent level of Adderall prescription. But I haven't been able to get my regular Adderall prescription because of the shortage. So I have been bouncing around trying other drugs and they aren't working great. Or at all.

  
So today I was talking with my wife and while she always had thought this and thought I knew. But one of my weird habits is that I'll hear a song I like, then listen to it repeatedly a bunch of times not necessarily all in a row but an extended period of high in rotation. Then out of nowhere it just falls out. I don't dislike it, but something else will cycle in. Repeat.

  
I knew that this was uncommon, it drives the people who I have had to share an office and home with bonkers. Even with headphones the muffled beat repeated 300 times a week will make anyone tear their hair out. I just figured it was just a weird difference of taste and didn't put any thought into it. Some people don't like strawberry ice cream, it is what it is. She pointed out that was textbook ADHD hyper fixation. I had dealt with that before but typically it was me focusing on some new hobby or interest. Getting super engaged and then dropping the interest nearly as quickly as I started it. It is very infuriating and frustrating. But I had never really put the two together.

  
It seems like this new awareness should maybe be a good thing but it isn't like it would change my behavior knowing that one way or the other. But it is in yet another way my growing awareness of just how different I really am and how much it affects my life. With my bipolar it is a mood disorder so it has a larger scale effect and when I watch out for the signs I can usually deal with it, somewhat. Or at least I can understand it. It is like wearing a pair of tinted glasses. Everything is shifted, but shifted in a similar and somewhat familiar, usually unpleasant, way. But my ADHD is a moment to moment problem and sometimes is effectively going mind blind. Not even tinted glasses, just black. And it is constant. Bipolar is spectral and once properly medicated, somewhat intermittent. Not so with even treated ADHD, much less untreated.

  
Multiple times a day I will be speaking and completely forget what the hell I was trying to say because mid sentence I go think about some other random bullshit like what the oldest food in the fridge is. Despite the fact that the conversation had nothing to do with anything even remotely related to that. And it isn't like this is just casual conversations. This happens during meetings at work and it is super embarrassing and makes me feel like an idiot.  Since I have hadn't had my Adderall it has been so bad and now that I am aware of the difference in symptoms I wonder how it is possible I didn't think I had this problem before. Was this what it was like before I was at all medicated? Because if so holy shit, it makes me really scared if I ever loose access to my bipolar meds. That, fortunately, I have got a good prescription for.

  
When I do some dumb shit when I am manic or am unable to enjoy anything in a depressive phase at the very least that has a clear and pervasive cause. The ADHD stuff, while pervasive, is executive function and task oriented. So when you experience a negative consequence it is intermittent and often unclear because the thing that you are needing to be being aware of, your attention, is the thing you lose when you most need it.

  
For a long time and even now I would hesitate to self describe as in any way disabled. Despite the fact that I very clearly and significantly am. Almost like it's a combination of slur and mental excuse hall pass rather than just a functional descriptor. I'm even in a good place right now. Things are really going my way lately and while the Adderall problem is extremely infuriating and inconvenient, it isn't like it's heart pills to keep me alive. But I don't want to self describe as such because it feels like it's a crutch. An excuse for me to explain away my shortcomings. Because at least that way it is me being a fuck up and can maybe do better if I just don't suck so bad. Rather than me being... disabled.

  
It isn't always an issue. Sometimes the symptoms are well treated or the mood swing is mild. Other days I can't get out of bed, or can't get into bed, or can't finish a god damn sentence not in text where I can go back and reread what the hell I was saying before. Everyone loses their train of thought from time to time, but my train doesn't even have tracks some days. Despite all available evidence I want to convince myself that it is absurd you would even consider putting me in the same category as someone paralyzed, or blind, or had an amputation like you would have with more visible handicapped accommodations. Not even in the same category as someone suffering from autism, or Parkinson's disease, or even PTSD.

  
Most of the time it's fine. I am abled bodied, I can take the stairs and walk the whole length of a parking lot no problem. So where the hell do I get off making excuses for myself like I'm Tiny Tim. You've got legs, USE THEM. But in a thousand different ways on a thousand different days I am reminded just how much different I am. And I always will be. It will be treated, it gets better and it gets worse. But there is no cure for this, I will never get to be the person I know that I could be if it were not for this. So no matter how much I may try and convince myself that I can run, some days I can't even walk. And that really fucking sucks.",1
A little thought at 4 am.,"I'm [M19] unmedicated and undiagnosed (but ""suspect ed"" or something. basically doc refused to give official diagnosis without overpayment, as my mom told me) due to money and some crappy psychiatrist, but when I was 4 or 5 they prescribed meds for me. When I took them I could concentrate and my scores at school were good, but the teachers told my parents that I'm not myself, so they stopped giving me the meds. I've never been good at school, was always behind due to attention problems, etc. This resulted in reluctance to studying, crappy grades and nearly not passing many times. I wonder what would have happened if I never stopped taking those meds. Maybe it would have spared the time I spent on trying to understand something, the pain of knowing that I'm always behind and the bullying. Sorry if it's nonsense, I just wanted to rant and pass the thought.",1
ADHD and waste. I’m tired of feeling guilty for being wasteful.,"I don’t know if this is a “me” issue, but I feel like my ADHD symptoms make me a wasteful person. Food waste is the first one that comes to mind. Things spoil mostly because I forget to eat them (hello, morning coffee) or that I bought them (sorry yogurt from three months ago). I try my hardest to avoid this. My dad had a rough childhood and we are very sensitive to throwing out food. But most often than not, it still happens. 

Another big waste is my hobbies. I have too many of them and often don’t feel interest in it for more than a couple months. Paint dried up beyond repair, candle making chemicals go bad, coloring pens are ruined because I swear I closed the cap (I didn’t). 

Money is also wasted. Subscriptions I forget to cancel. One year deals I get because I promise, this time I’ll actually do duolingo everyday! Or stuff I purchase without reading the full description and end up regretting it. By the way, thank you Adobe for the outrageous cancellation fee.  

My carbon foot print must be huge, between all the waste and the amount of times I had to go by car because I forgot to leave early enough to walk. I’m trying to do better but most times I’m wasteful, I only notice it when it’s too late.",1
"I feel like the worst thing about my ADHD is that for so many years I tried to make it look like my life is going good from the outside, while inside I feel in shambles and as if my life is already over.","I feel so lost, like my life is not going into any direction at all. I have literally no clue what I am doing and I am 26 now. Did not even finish my university degree (that I absolutely hate btw).

It’s getting to the point where having ADHD is making me want to breakdown,"I despise having ADHD, i can never focus on anything even with my meds. it makes my self esteem so low because no matter how hard i try at academics, i can never actually sit down and focus without drifting off, becoming overwhelmed, etc. i don’t know what to do at this point, i want to be an individual who is organized and can keep it all together but it’s so difficult. it’s also very embarrassing for when i struggle to recall certain things in my memory or when i zone out mid conversation with someone else and they get frustrated. it’s disgusting that people romanticize ADHD so often because it’s actually making me miserable.",1
Frustrated from always forgetting,"There’s an event coming up that some friends and I wanted to go to and I was in charge of getting tickets and I knew they were going to sell fast I was so ready to be on it but I forgot to set an alarm and the day of I completely forgot and I went and checked and they are sold out.ik this is a petty thing to be upset about but it’s not just the tickets it’s just important things(tbh just everything)that I never remember.I was trying not to cry cause ik my friends won’t be mad but it’s still frustrating that my memory/object permanence is complete shit and it feels like i can’t “hold on” to anything.


sorry if this isn’t worded the best just kinda word vomiting atm",1
Impulse Control: Waiting Your Turn in Conversation,"Sigh. I have this problem where I interrupt people constantly because while they are talking I get an idea or five and I feel like I have to tell them. I don’t in the moment feel like I’m being rude, I feel like I’m almost chiming in like, “snap, snap, dude. We’re at a poetry slam and I’m feeling it” but with adding whatever I had to say instead… 

Then, I see their face if I’m looking… which most of the time I’m not because I despise eye contact. Maybe it’s a change of tone of voice. So anyway… I realize only then, each and every time, that I’ve upset someone yet again by not having manners and hijacking the conversation. It’s a tendency that I sometimes hate about myself and it’s a tendency that has gotten so bad and out of hand lately that I’ve pushed everyone out of my life.

Someone literally said to me that it seems like I have it all figured out… when I don’t and it was total sarcasm but it’s because I couldn’t shut up. I know this is my ADHD which is currently going unchecked while I’m having a medication adjustment for whatever else has been going on… but everyone acts like it’s me just being a garbage person. They are mad at me. Sometimes I’m mad at me too. 

How did you learn to stop doing this?

Edit: I should also add that because I seemingly have no impulse control it’s caused arguments when I suddenly am on the receiving end of an irritated person.",1
Help with executive dysfunction,Can someone tell me that I can't do the things I've been trying to do for weeks so that I can do the thing? Like that you don't believe I can do it? I've been really struggling to do some things and it's piling up. I am studying to become a data analyst and I am in a technical bootcamp as well. I have two mentors and am working to become a teachers aide in my class. Current life events have gotten in the way of me being productive. I'm behind on a lot and if someone could just tell me that I'm not capable of completing all of this my ADHD brain will try to prove you wrong. If anyone understands this it would mean so much to me.,1
"Unmotivated, no willpower","I’ve (26f) been fighting a really nasty inflamed muscle in my shoulder. I had a lil back pain for a few days until I woke up a few weeks ago unable to move my head. The pain is horrible, I’m highly medicated now and can move but my body is still sore. 

I’m now in the middle of the second semester of my third year vis com degree - I’ve never been good at doing any homework in school but with all of the other things I simply cannot find the willpower to do my assignments and briefs. I’ve always done things last minute and it hurts me bad, I was diagnosed at 21 so I’ve never had the chance to learn how to actually learn in school. 

 I just can’t for the life on me find any good ideas or have any comprehensive thought process about my assignments, and when I do, I just have no willpower to do it. I feel like doing nothing. 

Any advice?",1
I can’t stop crying over nothing.,"I’m 17 and I have moderate social anxiety that I’ve been working on for a while now, I also recently passed my driving test and got keys to a car and I’m still really scared of driving on my own. 

I just went to pick up my strattera prescription up from the pharmacy, drove there on my own and got it on my own, felt really proud of myself, got home and they’ve given me the wrong thing. I’ve been sat on my kitchen floor crying for about 20 minutes, all I need to do is go back and explain it shouldn’t be a big deal but I just can’t stop crying it’s so embarrassing. 

I called my mum to tell her what happened and she told me off for crying and I got so mad I swore at her and hung up, I feel really bad now and no doubt there will be consequences later. 

This isn’t a one time thing either, I cry at really minor things all the time. Yesterday it was that someone had eaten my ice cream, few months ago I spilled ketchup on my favourite t shirt, stepping in water, loosing my keys. I cry and get angry every time. I don’t want to be like this. 

Is this even an ADHD thing? How do I stop being like this?",1
I get very distracted by hot people,"I thought I was just really horny all the time (I probably am) but now I'm wondering whether it's the ADHD. The amount of times I've nearly walked into a lamppost when I've been staring at a hot person whilst walking down the street. I'm sat at my desk trying to work right now and there are some very handsome delivery men walking past the window. I cannot work in these conditions!

P.s. I'm not creepy about it! Just an observation I've noticed in my behaviour.",1
Missed appointment for diagnosis.,"So ye. 2 or 3 months ago I finally got an appointment for this month. Wouldn't be an immediate diagnosis/test, but at least a first step. 



I saved the date in my memo file and went on with my life. 


I was aaaaaaabsolutely sure it was on the 30th....... I remembered so well because that's also the birthday of my recent ex. 



Well..... Just checked..... The memo says 15th.....
Apparently I saw the connection of 30 being twice of 15,and then made myself believe the date was the 30th.
Or some other stupid train of thought..... 
Missed my appointment. 


This will set me back at least half a year x-x

"I have been waking up at 4:30 a.m. every day for the past month to study, but I still can't focus.","After having read David Goggins book, I was really inspired. I mean the man went through Navy Seal, Marathons and intentional acts of adversity with sheer willpower while having a hole in his heart. 

I wanted to try this out. Medications hadn't worked for me. After all, I was running out of options to treat my ADHD. So, everyday for the past month I forced myself to wake up at 4.30am. A minute past 5am and I would be handing over half my day's pay to my friend. And, it worked. 

However, focusing was still a pain. While I did make some progress, I failed miserably.  RIP.",1
I feel expected to be in cleaning mode when other people are,"(edit: I forgot I posted this and then found it again. Wow that's a.lot of comments to go through, but I will get to them all eventually. I feel so validated and less alone but I hate that so many of us have gone / are going through this trauma. Even just thinking about it, I feel the panic response.)

I've had this issue with multiple relationships I've been in. When someone I love with is in cleaning mode, they expect me to be too just because they decided it's time for everyone to clean right this moment. Even if I was literally asleep. They'll usually get mad about it too. Do neorotypicals see someone clean and instantly get energized to clean, stopping what they're doing?",1
I feel invalidated with my new psychiatrist,"Before my first psychiatrist left the facility where he worked, he concluded that I have ADHD, the inattentive type, based on the problems and struggles that I am personally going through. He first diagnosed me with depression and anxiety, but I told him that most of my struggle still exists on regular days when I have no stressors. I don't know where he went, so I was forced to look for a new psychiatrist since the medication he prescribed didn't seem to work (it worked for a bit, then it didn't).

When I first met my new psychiatrist, I couldn't tell her my story. Whenever I told her my concerns and why we concluded I have ADHD, she said I do not have ADHD since I was not ""properly"" diagnosed because I wasn't given the ADHD diagnosis test. She insisted that all of these problems may have caused my depression. When I told her I was taking Atomoxetine, which worked for a week or two until the effects wore off, she told me my medication is also an anti-depressant.

I won't see her again for the next three weeks since I have stuff going on, but I can't keep living my life anymore, not knowing what's wrong with me because it's already affecting my personal life and relationships. I sometimes even think that I may have borderline autism since two of my siblings have autism, and some of the symptoms of autism are something I am struggling with in my personal life.

I am not one to self-diagnose, but these ADHD (and sometimes autism) posts or videos have helped me a lot, not only to understand my struggles and behavior but also to know how to navigate my struggles in everyday life.",1
How do you forgive yourself for what you didn't/couldn't do while unmedicated?,"I'm F(37, 38 soon) and was diagnosed at 31 while I was finishing up an engineering degree. I didn't get on meds for a few years after because I couldn't accept the diagnosis. I was abused and have cptsd so the thought of ""another thing wrong with me"" was too much. I have 2 other undergraduates in unrelated fields that i wasn't ever able to use. 

Finally, I have a real engineering job. I spent 4 years as a technician and was able to break out. I've been here for 1.5 years. I feel so dumb. Everyone around me has this vast amount of knowledge and even though, yes, they have more experience on the job, this is stuff I should have learned in school but didn't. Either because of my severe imposter syndrome/very high anxiety/other crap and/or being unmedicated. 
I feel like I remember nothing. Or I'm not able to think through situations because of the anxiety/shame spirals. I spend forever researching ""basic"" things and the shame is horrible. It's like I didn't absorb anything! 5 years of education and it's gone? Did I ever really understand anything?

I still feel new to ADHD and maybe I'm missing something about how this all works. I don't understand how I can be ""smart"" but it takes hours of repetition to remember something and even then I have to review it again and again.
The tiniest details derail me. If I don't understand one small thing then I can't move forward. And if I ask questions about it, I feel like I look dumb because others around me 1.) Don't ask it and 2.) Look embarrassed that I don't know this, so I assume I've do e something wrong/""should know this"". 

Now I'm just rambling. Today was a rough day for me and I'm obviously not taking it well.",1
Marriage and ADHD... just how to balance?,"I am 37... I got diagnosed last year with Adult ADHD. It finally explained a lot of why I was so miserable throughout the COVID Lockdown phase. It also gave a face/label to a lot of my undesired behaviours of being lost, being uninterested, being frustrated... and being closed up. This is the good part.

But, on the flip side, I am still trying to understand if there is any hope that my ADHD can be managed enough to bring good days to my married life. My wife, who is not ADHD, has been through so much with my feeling of ""not enough"" professionally (always seeking new things to do and get bored easily), my forgetfulness, my lack of expression of empathy, my tantrums with being in house 24/7 (which was due to lack of external stimuli I had with office life). She has lost belief that I can be better.. and it is so difficult and scary that with one mis-step.. i will be back on old ""not so good to be around"" self.  


I am at last on medication.. starting with smaller doses.. and I know they are working. But, this feeling that I will never get better enough keeps clawing at me.

I want to be better.... can someone tell how to not feel lost when you make mistake or just can't get rid of bad habits.... not sure if I am asking right questions here... just wanted to vent and hope someone gets it...",1
Adderall has ruined my life in less than 3 months,"I started taking Adderall a little while ago after finally being diagnosed with ADHD. 

It has changed my personality. I am moody. I am irritable. I feel so much rage. I didn't realize it and hurt people around me (not physically, but still). Realizing all that I've done, I've never felt more like a useless person and I am so ashamed. I will never take it again but I dont know how I'll ever fix the things that I did.

I hope that, if anyone is reading this and potentially may start taking it or just started, that you keep an eye out. Tell someone you trust to look out for this. It is dangerous. You may not see it at first. You may think its worth it to be slightly more irritated. But it may blow up on you in ways that you never thought it would.",1
discouraged about finding a med that works,"Hey guys…honestly just look for some encouragement here…

I feel like I’ve tried so many different medications and am not finding one that works but doesn’t cause bad side effects. I know there are people who have tried even more than me, but I’m just getting so frustrated 😕 

Strattera did absolutely nothing. Ritalin seemed to help a little and might’ve been better at a higher dose but I had to stop it because the anxiety and rage were so bad. Wellbutrin did nothing at all for my adhd but helped depression/anxiety a lot, so I stayed on it- at least that’s a positive…there’s a few others I’ve tried but can’t remember all of them, I just know everything I’ve tried has either done nothing or had bad side effects 😔

I’m starting adderall tomorrow and I’m hopeful that it will work, but definitely discouraged. I feel like I’m just cycling through so many things and running out of options, but my adhd is so bad that I’m barely functioning at work or home and don’t know what to do if I can’t find something that helps…

Sorry for rambling at this point, I guess I’m just hoping someone else who’s had a similar issue can offer some encouragement 😕",1
How the hell do you write?,"I struggle getting my thoughts out. Fortunately I don't have any essays to do at the moment, but I'd still like to get this book out of my head.  
My method at the moment is to do bullet points, then go get help.  And that only sometimes works.  I know what I want to write about, or what the scene is about... but I don't know what to write.

My medication is Giving me some weird side effects…,"Today I started taking my meds for the first time (half the pill) and I felt great, I was able to focus, didn’t felt the need to binge eat, my memory was better I could read and talk better, but it also gave some weird side effects like making my heart beats go faster and gave me a weird sensation on the throat (more precisely the thyroid), and now I’m afraid to take them by night when I’m supposed to…I can’t get into contact with my psychiatrist, and I don’t know what I should do….",1
Just a bit of a rant,"So I met up with my friend who recently got told by their therapist that they probably have ADHD. She said when the therapist told her that, she felt so relieved and like she’d found it easier to accept who she was and the way her life has worked out. I’m really happy for her but when I said I was feeling overwhelmed at the moment because I had a lot on and my own ADHD assessment was coming up which was really playing on my mind, they countered me by saying “A diagnosis isn’t going to change who you are so why worry about that? Just accept you may have ADHD and use it to propel you forward.” I thought it was a nice sentiment but as the conversation continued I started to get the impression that they thought 1) medication wasn’t even something I should consider because it would change me and I was lovely (disregarding how depressed and anxious I currently feel. Almost like “I like you as you are so you don’t need to think or feel differently“) and 2) that they have managed to turn the idea that they may have ADHD into a positive in their life and I can too if I just learnt to. 

I just feel like now there’s a pressure on me. Like, why can’t I just be happy with who I am and use an idea of a diagnosis (rather than a diagnosis itself) to use the thought that I may have ADHD as a superpower? Why’s it so easy for them but I feel like I’m drowning? Have I got swept up in all that talk of ADHD being hard and something to manage when really if I just change my perspective of the issue it’s a gift? 

I just need someone to help me put everything into perspective. I feel proper lost and I just need someone to remind me that going for a diagnosis is not stupid.",1
Worth checking? Need expert opinion on this,"Hi all! First of all, I’d like to state 2 things: I am not looking for a diagnosis here, just opinions, since you have a lot of experience in the subject. Second thing: English is not my first language so sorry for the gramatical errors :) 

I am a 33 year old male, and never gave too much thought about ADHD since about 1-2 months ago when I stumbled upon an article where some of the main symptoms were listed. Actually almost all of them checks out for me:

1 Inattention. This one is the strongest. From childhood I always struggled with it. My mom told me I am just lacking concentration, and I am inattentive because I am not interested in things and need to pull myself together. She also told me that this thing runs in my dad’s family. I have never asked her to visit a doctor, guess I just accepted that this is my fault, this is how I operate, and I just need to focus more on things. Till this day, when I read something in work (IT Support) or at Uni, I need to read it like 4-5 times like I am an idiot, meanwhile others don’t have problems with it. When I watch a movie, I often don’t know how the characters end up in certain situations, only when I watch it again it makes sense. My mind often wanders around, meaning I am daydreaming a lot on different things, I can even spend like 3-4 hours with this “activity”.

2. Procastination
It is bad. Often with tasks which require full attention, like university assignments.(Computer science). Also studying is extremely hard, I often spend a lot more time than necessary with simple things.

3. Impulsiveness 
I often make impulsive decisions which I almost always regret later on.

There were other symptoms too but I just wanted to list these 3 as I think these 3 are the worst for me. 

According to these, do you think I should visit a doctor? Is it worth checking if I have ADHD? Or maybe my mom is right and I am just “slow”. Which is fine, I can accept that.",1
Just standing in one spot,"Does anyone else do this? (I've been doing it more frequently) I often just stop and stand in one place, stare the same thing, thinking as usual that I for example I need to get my clothes out of the washer after a few days.. Or all other stuff that I need to do. So my mind is still the same. I'm not feeling any different, confused, or spaced out. I do kind of stare at the same thing while I think like usual. Maybe it happens that I might be in front of the TV and even if I'm interested in the show, my feet are glued to the floor. But usually I'm staying at the same thing. I realize what I'm doing, but I'm still frozen/paralyzed. I do hate that I'm wasting so much time. I'm not sure what lets me finally break away. But I I still have theclothes in the washer, so I'm still just as unproductive as always. (That's a whole other issue lol)
 It happens anywhere in my house, at no particular time. Just random and often. 

I sleepwalk so maybe it's the daytime version, opposite, I don't move when I want., Instead of doing things I don't want to do",1
Can't focus on anything. Feeling anxious and depressed,"I have exams next month and I can't study at all. I haven't studied anything and there is no time. My brain is like melting when I open my books and I can maybe read one paragraph in an hour and understand what is being said. I am feel depressed and useless and overwhelmed and all I'm doing is lying in bed, frozen in panic, not being able to do anything. 
I have a very short trmper and everythjng is pissing me off rn.

I'm undiagnosed but I'm pretty sure i have adhd. But getting diagnosed is expensive in my country and I'm completely dependent on my parents financially and I feel bad asking for money for anything. 


I don't know what to do. I feel like crying I'm so stressed",1
But I have seen others worse than you do better,"Some hurtful words from someone I love.
The comparisons from a partner who's father and brother have ADHD both spent time medicated or not and have achieved so much more.

Their father apparently suffered such severe symptoms and yet managed to change careers and complete degrees unmedicated and remember all the sweet gift moments and ideas.

Their brother who deeply loves their wife, only periodically takes medication and does elaborate planning, successful job and house life.

And here I feel like a shambled wreck of failure, only recently diagnosed thanks to their help to realise that maybe the anxiety, discalcula, depression, risk taking behaviour and apparently death wish of poke dangerous things for a reaction who never finished school, couldn't get into uni, has failed degrees and barely had successful traditional careers aside from one I fell into for 7 years.

I want to remember sweet things, now medicated and getting the therapy I need some things are easier...like if I had all this as a teen I'd probably match their expectations.

It just hurts to hear ""But they have it worse and do more, if you cared you would remember or try harder"". I'm giving it my all and drowning just trying to keep up with what is normal for everyone else.

There's more to the story but...how do you deal with being less functional than others who have what you do and yet are better off?",1
Looking for perspective and tips on how to do well in exams with loads of content to memorise (Biology and Chemistry),"Keep doing poorly on exams and feel like it's almost impossible to do well however I won't stop until I get a good grade so open to any alternative revision and study methods

I've tried reading over the book and summarising(didn't find it benefical) and anki(which I found good for some of chemistry however biology has way more long notes which I couldn't figured out how to do as they steps or things which are all linked into one question), tried caffeine to help with focus however felt like it helped somewhat but then affected my sleep some much it wasn't worth it.

Also, would you say you experienced a major comparison between memorising loads of info for an exam medicated vs unmedicated?",1
Struggling to understand what to do,I'm currently in a complicated situation with a partner of nearly 3 years and I am really struggling because I'm doing everything wrong when I'm trying my absolute hardest to not start arguments or anything but somehow the words come out wrong and I cause something.

Some days it’s EXTRA difficult to get through a single tv show.,"(also I apologize I wasn’t sure which flair was appropriate for this!!)

Okay so I had to share this because I know I can’t be alone in this. 😂 I’ve been watching (well trying to watch) a show on netflix for the past 45 minutes. I’ve only gotten to minute 10:41. Why? Because every little thing I think of while watching this show has led me to at least 5 different google searches. Pause show, “Why don’t they show the net worth of each cast member”. Don’t find answer but find an article about each members net worth so duh I wanna read it. Oh wait now this article is mentioning Billionaires Row in New York? Google search number 2! Now I find a video of a realtor showing a 113mil (I think that’s the number) pent house in NY. I watch maybe 6 out of the 10 minutes then theres a video below showing a 220 million dollar island home in Palm Beach. Of course i have to watch it! (and i watch the whole thing trust me that marble book matching is to die for). Okay NOW get back to the show jeeze!!

Start show again and watch for about 5 minutes before I remember the whole “Billionaire Row” search I never really answered so going back to google. Find an article about a day on Billionaire’s Row so I start reading that and wait! 220 Central Park South is the most expensive home ever sold!? Yay another Google search!

And that lead me here hahaha. I just think it’s wild how my brain MUST know the details behind everything but I get frustrated because I think of so many different things at once that I want to look up that are related😅 


I hope this made sense and not a total ramble!! But curious to hear if this is common for anyone else and also how annoying right😂",1
i'm so tired,"excuse my english as english is not my first language!! 

i'm 22 and i haven't yet been diagnosed with adhd, however i've been seeing a psychiatrist and i have brought a very thorough description of my life and why i believe i have adhd, and she agreed with me that several symptoms and manifestations of adhd are there, however she wanted to first rule out some other possibilities that could cause these symptoms, and i've been on antidepressants for a bit over 2 months now. 

on one hand, my anxiety has reduced over the last two months, however i'm still fucking struggling. i'm so tired of being told i'm not reaching my full potential, i'm tired of watching myself not being able to get anything done unless it's absolutely urgent, i'm tired of watching myself struggle to put everything in order when i have 10 things to do and i start all of them at once and never finishing them, and even now as i'm typing this out i have a sinking feeling in my stomach that maybe it's not adhd as i'm not diagnosed with it yet (i'm going to get my diagnosis done in june) and i'm just rambling on the wrong sub, and i'm struggling to organize my thoughts in order to maybe make some sense of this post. i'm disorganized as hell in all the possible aspects of my life, i struggle with my executive function a lot, and every time i see my psychiatrist she asks me how my symptoms are and i just feel so sad when i tell her that it's the same as when i first started seeing her.

i just feel so alone in this because i'm very aware of my potential however i just dont know what else to do about it. 

has anyone felt this way before their diagnosis?

Feeling lost dealing with verbally abusive parent who doesn’t believe in ADHD,"Hey I’ve never posted here before, but I read you guys all the time and resonate with so many stories so I figured I’d do some healthy venting. My names Quinn i’m 19 years old. I just recently got my ADHD diagnosis and I am in the highest 7% of those diagnosed. I spend a lot of time at my Dads house and he is very narcissistic, always talking down on me and treating me more like an acquaintance than a son. He’s extremely rude to me and plays it off like it’s a joke, but it’s constant and he doesn’t really ever show me a real side. I used to think it was normal. He often yells at me for small things. Never says “I love you”. Takes up 95% of the time during our conversations and barely lets me get a word in. I cope by just shutting down to have his rants go by faster. He preaches meditation whenever I mention ADHD or anxiety and doesn’t hear me out because he’s convinced it’s the only way, and even talks down on me medicating. He literally said “Hey guys look Quinn’s nervous” during a family event when I was playing with my fidget toy. I don’t know what do you guys recommend I do? I know he won’t change anything but is there a better way to work around him?",1
Losing track of things and time,"I know that having ADHD means that I'm going to have a hard time regulating time or keeping track of items/things I need to do. I'm in therapy, and I'm medicated, both of which are helping me. On the surface, everything seems to be going well with treatment.

However, I keep finding these symptoms getting worse. In the last 24 hours, I've lost three extremely important items, including my prescription glasses, and I just keep beating myself up for it. This time last year, I had similar issues with slowing my brain down enough to focus enough to make a to do list, let alone complete the items in the list. It caused me to break down crying in my classroom during school, and I'm supposed to be the teacher. Lately, I've felt the symptoms I described above making me feel the way I did last year before I started meds. 

Has anyone else had these struggles? Have any of you found methods for coping that make things a bit easier? TIA",1
Feeling guilty for having ADHD while my brother already has autism. Tired of keeping things to myself as to not overwhelm my mom.,"About three weeks ago, I (23) found out I have ADHD after years hiding my struggles and pretending everything is fine. About a year ago, my brother (15) found out he has level 1 autism. At the same time I found out, he started to present Cognitive Rigidity and have issues with going to school. It has been a struggle. My mom is suffering a lot and so is he. She cries everyday and feels impotent, scared and like she’s not enough. 

She has been juggling taking him to therapy and to his psychiatrist, keeping his school and teachers updated and working towards accommodations, and supporting him as best as she can. She doesn’t understand certain things like “wait mode” and having to do things in a certain order the way I do. So that left me with helping my brother deal with that and comforting her throughout this hard times and explaining that somethings that are easy for her (like brushing your teeth every day) are not as easy for us. 

I love my mom and I love my brother. I just want the best for both of them but I’m struggling. The ADHD diagnosis has been harder to accept than I thought. I’ve suspected it for a few years but actually knowing is a bit hard. I’m mourning for all that I’ve lost because I didn’t know sooner, and coming to terms that there’s in fact something “wrong” with me and that it’s not something I can make go away.

The medication is helping but the side effects aren’t that great. I don’t feel hungry and forget to eat, my mouth is always dry, I feel exhausted after it’s over and the headaches suck. I also have trouble staying asleep. I just wanted to talk to someone about it, but my mom has too much on her back. My dad is not very helpful as he doesn’t know how to deal with this stuff and always change the subject. I’m just so tired.",1
I am rude but never without reason,"I am in my 40s have adhd. When cornered and under stress I am rude and blunt. In other words I am the asshole. 

Situation causing me intense anxiety 

Mom :  75 years old , not healthy, obese. Has moved on with us from out of the country after my dad passed away. She cannot and will not stay by herself even with house help. She has no insurance in the US. I love her to death but I can’t sleep thinking of the time bomb that her health is.

I’m sometimes rude to her why I’m too stressed.

Kid : 13 year old  girl. Also with adhd. I have to be after her for everything. She is doing ok on school but is not doing another extra curricular activities. No sport. Very defiant. Very picky eater. I love her to death and I’m constantly worried how she will compete and be successful.

I’m rude and harsh with her when she’s doesn’t do things after repeatedly telling her to do something nicely. 

Wife : We loved each other to death. And we still love each other. I think. She is very hardworking but in the evenings likes to be on a phone, insta , making reels. She is a performer and very much into posting reels of her comedy, dance , friends. 

We sleep in separate rooms since my daughter sleeps in the master bedroom with her. They are very close. My wife is very patient with her does not force her to do anything (which irritates me). She has basically stopped caring about what I feel and does what she wants. But she takes care of the house even though she works. 

Me: I’m constantly reflecting on situations , sexually frustrated, indisciplined and not always completely cheerful. I try to sit in my room when I’m low. But I try to help around in the house but I’m not consistent. I just can’t get into a routine. I’m doing ok at work , earn 150k+. But it’s stressful and I’m paranoid about the future. 

The situation gives me intense anxiety but I get up everyday telling myself I’ll improve . I have low self esteem because of my inability to have self control.

I get angry but only after my polite ways are ignored or when these people are rude or unfair to me. And then I’m rude and an asshole. I always try to explain why I’m angry in every flare up .

I have best interest of everyone in mind and I try to be fair but people only point out at how I talk at times when my back is to the wall.

How do I deal with this ? I don’t want play the victim but I realize my post sure sounds like that.",1
"I still haven't reached the gifted point of falling off, but I'm teetering on the edge","i got the best score for a cumulative final in my stats class of \~100 students. i'm happy that i got the score, but not happy that i didn't study. i'm not happy about skating through classes and not really excelling. my grades and ability to keep up is on the level of my peers, but i know it's a short matter of time before my lack of study habits and homework skills quickly drags me behind. i failed the 2 easiest classes this semester just because i didn't do the few easy homework assignments a week. i want to have a good character, strong abilities and habits, that dawg in me if you will, but it's hard to consistently put in the work to get that.",1
Failing and stumbling and struggling and failing some more to succeed so little,"

My life I always been failing, been screwing up my whole life, and now I have alot of regrets, I can't have what I wanted and it's all because I didn't do the work. That's the thing adhd makes the grinding and work so much more harder. You want to be better, you want to do good, you want to be more but always fall short, in all aspects of my life I have been failing and continuing to fail. Having adhd makes it so much harder for us, we are constantly trying,  trying to do good and just messing up. We been like this our whole life's. My family can't depend on me, my friends think I'm a bad friend, I not successful in my academics or my love life, I just been failing and failing struggling up a hill to move a Boulder up the hill and adhd is like having both my shoe laces tied together with glue and metal and welded together. I have been struggling and struggling my whole life to be better and I always fail short. Failure is common in everyone but let's just say that having adhd is encountering more failure. This failure is made it so sad. You see yourself trying and working at it but your not progressing like your peers. Your friends are able to be good friends and your family are able to depend on each other. But me, i just am messing up. Always 1 stop forward and 2 steps back. 

This failure is too much some times, but that is the thing. If you can master and get over this failure. If you can take all this struggle and pain amd just keep moving forward you can win. You can be better. You can do what you want to do and make your dreams come true. You can be a better person, friend, partner, brother, sister, mom, dad and you cam achieve your goals. You have to see this failure and say fuck this failure I want to win I'm tired of losing, tired of never getting things to go my way, tired of always being picked last and always been slept on by my friends and peers. You have to be persistent you have to be resilient, have to take all that pain and struggle and just keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. Thats how winning is done! So everyone whatvever failure you have, whateve stuggle and problem you have and you seen to cant get over your obstacle or been stuck, i wish you the best of luck, you cant give up, you cant quit, and when you achieve it you can be even more proud amd happy knwoimg that you acheive it with all the struggles and problem had along the way. ,",1
Just been diagnosed with autism as well and wow the emotions,"So I was diagnosed with ADHD 10 years ago and while I was accurately diagnosed, there was always a niggling feeling there was something more.

Anyway, I was talking to my therapist on Wednesday and she told me I am autistic. Normally, I would be fine because I basically knew but I had a close family member die last year and all I want to do is tell them, but I can't. It's tearing me up. Damn my brain!

One of the things that really tipped me off is that whenever people described autism vs ADHD, I couldn't understand the difference, no matter how many times people explained it. To the point where I was convinced that ADHD is a form of autism. Nope, I'm just autistic. Although, still not entirely convinced it's not, the comorbidity is so damned high.

I always took those online autism quizzes and I was borderline autistic according to them, but if I corrected for my ADHD, I was firmly in the autistic category.

When I was 10, a kid was introduced to us who had autism and they were explaining what it was, and I remember thinking that was very relateable.

Also, everyone who knows me are like ""you're autistic.""

The signs were all there, but I'm female, so I'm not exactly surprised I got diagnosed at 36 years of age.

I just want to tell that one particular person but I can't because they're fucking dead.",1
Dopamine crash,"I go to concerts a lot because I love live music, but I find that I often feel awful the next day. For a long time I thought it was just “post-concert depression” but the most recent time it happened I realized that the amount of negative thoughts and feelings I have afterward must be from the large fluctuations in dopamine that happen in such a short period of time. I just saw a few posts about this made in the past that helped me out a term to what it is I experience.

It just bums me out a lot because what is supposed to be a wonderful experience to think about is soured because my brain doesn’t have the super awesome dose of dopamine it received the day before. Instead, I’m just sad and disinterested in things that could be mentally stimulating/beneficial for me. I guess I’m just wondering what other people’s experiences might be with this kind of dopamine crash and what y’all do to cope or work around it.",1
Things that suck about ADHD that nobody talks about:,"1. Never being able to fully take in information: my brain just refuses. When someone asks me to look at an excel spread sheet and make sense of the information in it, I just shut down.

2. Which brings me to point two. Impulsively deciding what is and is not important. Like sometimes I’ll email a piece of work to my manager knowing full well that I have not read all the information but my mind is too jumpy to sit an comb through everything in order. Actually this sometimes even leads to me reading things from top to bottom or just hopping around hoping to find importance somewhere in the body of text.

3. Being so foggy that you feel out of touch with reality. With yourself. With your emotions that sometimes you can’t even understand how you feel, why you feel that way and how to change it.

4. Getting the ick. I don’t know if this is ADHD specifically but I get the ick so easily from people I actually like and have feelings for. Then I find it impossible to know how I feel about them because my emotions are now all over the place because of something so stupid.

5. Feeling self disgust. I am so tired of myself and my ways that I sometimes feel repulsed. I hate that I’m sensitive, I hate that I’m moody, I hate that I feel like I’m always underperforming, I hate that I always think everyone hates me after one wrong look or flat text message.

6. Never realising your true potential. When I’m on meds I am amazed by how much I can actually achieve. How nice I am capable of being, how much energy I have to be fit and eat healthy. 

7. The exhaustion. Mental and physical. The tiredness lies somewhere deep within my bones. 

8. Cutting corners to stay above water but feeling like a fraud. I have always had to find easier ways of doing things to stay ahead with minimal effort but this has always made me feel like a cheater and a fraud. 

Feel free to add yours.",1
How do you all deal with feeling like you’d be so much better to be around if you didn’t have ADHD?,"I’ve just had my 3rd bad argument in a week with a loved one and all of the arguments have started over them being frustrated with my ADHD behaviors (hyper-fixations, inability to focus, misunderstanding social cues, not being “present” enough, and a few other things). I guess I’ve just really been stuck in a slump of feeling like I can’t do anything “right” no matter how hard I try bc my ADHD brain just doesn’t know how to function and never will. I always say the wrong thing or accidentally ignore people or keep droning on about the same topic when people have had enough and it’s so discouraging. I know us ADHD folks are all valid, wonderful, human beings, but it’s hard existing in a neurotypical world and I can’t stop wondering what I would be like without ADHD. I just feel like I would be so much more likable, less awkward, and way easier to get along with and it sucks.

So sorry if I literally brought everyone’s mood down with this post lol. Not trying to be a downer or anything. Just currently having a not so great time and wanting to know if anyone else has ever been in the same boat.

Edit; Thank you so much everyone for the kind replies. I was crying last night reading these. It breaks my heart that so many of you are struggling too but I’m so grateful to have a community of people I can relate to and be inspired by. We’re stronger together and you all are awesome <3",1
ADHD and Alexithymia,"This reads like shit, you've been warned ⚠️ 

I'm in a bad spot with life honestly. I want to do so much but it doesn't manifest into anything because if Alexithymia. I can't stay on anything because of ADHD. I hyper fixate on shit but nothing comes from it because nothing is meaningful. If I can't recognize the emotions I'm feeling, then how am I going to feel joy in anything? What makes memories is how you feel towards a certain action but I'm blind to it, this cause me to not create anything new and meaningful. Compound that with ADHD and now my supposed ""hyper fixations"" have no feeling to them, making them just passionless interest. I can't even feel love or sadness right.
When my dad passed, I felt nothing. I cried but didn't know why because I didn't feel sad before hand.

Does anyone else feel somewhat like this? I have ADHD but the typical approach doesn't really work in my case. I'm having trouble enjoying anything long term because I don't know why I enjoy it in the first place.

I know this turned into a post more about Alexithymia than ADHD but I'm still gonna post it.",1
Making Friends,"Let me just start by saying that I've always struggled with making friends. I maybe have 3 people, other than my partner, that I would actually call friends and I met them all through work. 

I went out last night, it was my first time going out since being diagnosed, and was having a really good time. Probably about 3 hours into the night, I met a friend of a friend of a friend and they seemed lovely. Let's call them K. We really bonded over recently being diagnosed with ADHD. That's what I thought at the time anyway. 

A lot of the night from there was just K and I talking about ADHD. How the process was for us, how like changing a diagnosis can be, hyperfixations, the lot really. It was really, really nice. The friend I was planning to catch up with that night has lost their phone while changing venues, so it ended up being just K and I for a good chunk of the night. 

At about 11pm I decided to give K some space as they wanted to talk to someone else there. I don't like being the awkward person just standing there. Over the next 10 minutes or so, K walked passed me probably 2 or 3 times, first to get drinks and then too leave with the above person. Each time I tried to flag them down, particularly when I saw them leave, but was ignored. 

Thankfully the friend that lost their phone showed back up just after that and we had a chill rest of the night. I still can't help but wonder what I did wrong, it feels like the only thing in my head and has brought me down so much I wanna curl up and just cry. 

Thanks to those who read this, I'm sorry I know it's long. It means a lot.",1
Only cleaning out of embarrassment,I have this huge problem of only cleaning when there’s a potential of someone else seeing my mess. Is this a symptom that resonates with most of the adhd/add community? I am usually perfectly fine living in a organized mess of things until someone wants to come over. My bf is also diagnosed with adhd but for some reason he doesn’t care as much as me about embarrassment. He has had friends over when the living room is in disarray and I’m always super pissed at him after the fact. I constantly want ppl to be oblivious to the fact that I throw clothes everywhere and leave dishes in the sink way too long but the only others I know with adhd do not share this trait with me. What gives?,1
ADHD Torturing My Adult Life:,"(M22) in a span of 3 years I’ve had 10 jobs and the longest one I stayed at was 6 months. I feel like I’m going insane, I don’t even mean to do this but it just keeps going and I want to make it stop. 

I was diagnosed with adhd at the age of 7 but multiple doctors have told me due to my high blood pressure I shouldn’t be on any medication. I refused at age 21 and made them give me some meds as I let them know how my life is spiraling. 3 months after taking it I end up in the hospital for having a hypertensive crisis (my BP was 220/180). Since then I had to stop taking the medication, now I feel hopeless.

I need guidance as my family doesn’t understand adhd no matter how many times they claim they do. I never used to be like this and it never used to be this bad, it’s almost like it got worse during the pandemic.",1
She can’t keep getting away with it!,"I really wish my brain didn’t need the dopamine hit of doing something last minute to actually do a task. 

Had a presentation today for a client on an intricate topic I’m not super familiar that had been scheduled for a few days. Waited until an hour before the meeting to do the slide deck. 

Finished the deck while all 30 client members were joining the call… and fricken knocked it out of the park. Client was extremely grateful and loved the presentation. I got away with it. 

This may sound like a humble brag, but it drives me absolutely insane. I don’t like cutting things SO incredibly close or my brain needing that type of panic response to be able to do something. 

I don’t know how to stop waiting until the absolute last minute. Any advice?",1
Summary of the life of being diagnosed but wasn't treated.,"I was diagnosed at an early age (M7) but wasn't treated. 

I hadn't known what ADHD is and how much it affected me, until I researched about its symptoms at the current age of 18. It was shocking of how many I displayed in the Inattentive spectrum, but there was also something that turned my shock into rage. 

I was diagnosed at the age of 7, yet, my parents never treated me with meds except therapy for a short while. 

I asked them why I wasn't prescribed with meds and found out my doctor who diagnosed me claimed that ADHD is not a neurological disorder, and can be ""cured"" with just therapy. Even though therapy did cure my abnormal behavior, it didn't cure anything else. They were still there, which my parents always interpreted it as just me being lazy, not only that but also blamed and shamed me for every time I get distracted, couldn't get things done on time, always forgetting. 

I was also never been accommodated in any school since my parents never disclosed about me having ADHD, so I had to keep up with my peers. 

One time I got fed up with all the blame that I told them to blame the illness for everything, but nope, they didn't listen to that and instead blamed me for ""being proud"" of having ADHD. I never brought it up again as accusations towards me continued. 

Recently, it was graduation day and I was late because of my time blindness and executive dysfunction, and my parents just had to accuse me of being late on purpose, even though I rushed my ass on suiting up. I fought the urge to scream at their faces there that it wasn't my fault and just shoved it down and kept the rage subtle. 

It was supposed to be a happy day, but I was just upset most of the day. Worse, there was nobody I could talk to about it. 

Now, after graduating out of Senior Highschool (more like surviving through it) I don't know what to do. I don't know which course should I pick. I picked Graphic Artist but I hadn't drawn anything since two years ago and I don't have the motivation to draw anymore and shifted to story writing, which I barely write now because I'm losing my focus on it and motivation like drawing. 

I didn't want to lose the motivation to write like I lost the motivation to draw, and I hate ADHD for changing my focus yet again. I also wanted to move out of the family home but I don't have the confidence due to my incapability to organize and my parents doubted me living alone. I also don't even know the procedure to do it.",1
"Can't get the right meds, and I hate how I feel without them. Just need to vent.","I started ADHD meds just a couple months ago, after taking wellbutrin for a few months. My doctor immediately went straight to adderall, and it worked great for me- after I finally found it that is, after calling almost a dozen different places for it. I decided I didn't want to fight that battle again and wasn't confident the pharmacy that I got my first prescription from would be able to fill it again, so I asked my doctor to switch. Well, he put me on ritalin, but the dosage was wearing off halfway through the day, so he switched it to a low dose of concerta. Well, shocker, the pharmacies do not have that either. I am almost out of the ritalin and doctor is out until Wednesday, plus I don't even know if he will write me a new prescription to go back to ritalin before my next appointment. I have some wellbutrin left over but it doesn't work the same obviously, so I'm back to being spacey, brain fogged, and forgetful with no motivation. I'm just mad, sad, and discouraged because I have seen how I CAN feel and function better and I miss it 😞",1
I'm so incredibly grateful for you guys.,"Sincerely - before I found this forum, I really felt isolated. I'd been diagnosed when I was young but always thought it was just wrong because so many people were also diagnosed with this. And for so many years I felt so much pain, sadness, guilt, humiliation and self loathing, I felt like an idiot not being able to accomplish simple, basic tasks.  
After reading responses here I feel so much relief, everything written here is just, uncannily accurate in describing how I think. Now I feel like a human again, and I don't feel so alone. It feels so, so refreshing to know that there are so many people out there that feel the same way and have the same difficulties that I do.",1
Adhd and keys!!,"The damn keys of everything either i keep loosing them or forget where i put them. 
2 days ago I was driving mum to hospital for regular check up but missed the appointment coz i lost the keys within the house which i clearly placed in my pocket (or i thought so). After searching whole house and parking area i finally found them in the f**king pocket

I'm in a rough place,"So, my family and I are still in the moving process and It has been intense for me. Between two energetic kids, constant tiredness from working and moving, and trying to keep it together, I've been snippy. My wife said that it started when I upped my Straterra. I can see the correlation as well. I was cooking dinner yesterday and talking to my wife and the kids kept interrupting whole they were playing outside. My son kicked the ball over the fence into the neighbor's yard and I got extremely frustrated. My wife asked what was the matter and all I could say was ""I am trying to keep focused."" I stopped and took my son to the neighbors and they did not answer. 

Honestly, I feel extremely overwhelmed, overestimated, and exhausted. I want to scream and cry and just lose it for a moment but I can't because of my wife and kids. In a way, I have to mask what's going on to keep going but it's hard. Because everything is packed up, I can't do what I would do to decompress. Not being able to find anything (including clothing) is making it worse.",1
Advice to talk to / handle self when family fusses.. so much,"Everyday I get told that I show no emotion, ""do you even care"" comes out a lot. Now idk if this has anything to do with it but I have memory issues. I do not remember most stuff that isn't fun, or useful. Even then the useful stuff I forget and becomes automatic. I'm told that so much is done for me that they are so much older than me and I have to show them respect and honor. Imo they fuss, randomly, and about random things to many times in a day and they expect me to stop whatever I'm doing (this includes when I'm in that focus state) and listen to them. I'm only 16 and the last time I tried to talk to them about it they literally laughed at me. Not to mention i take welbutrin 350mg every single day so it takes so much just to not yell at them, to tell them I'm sorry I don't understand what you want me to do because RANDOMLY ARGUING DOSENT SOLVE ANYTHING! When I tell them that tho, I get called a lier and when I say that's not true I don't think that way, they say ""you callin me a lier??"" 

I really dk what to do reddit. I really want to stay in my room and listen to my music. But then they would say something.

I never fully feel awake. My depression is exacerbated and I don’t know how to get through my days at work.,"I am currently diagnosed with depression and am on 300mg Wellbutrin. I have regularly scheduled checkups with my NP and a weekly visit with my actual therapist. I was scheduled to see my NP at the end of July butmy therapist convinced me to set an earlier appointment with him to discuss possibly being medicated for my ADHD that I was diagnosed with as a child. 

My family wrote it off, told me, and everyone around me that it wasn’t real, and I was just a terrible kid. Now that I live alone, and all of these feelings are coming to the surface, it’s really hard to deal with. I have a mental breakdown every single night and I don’t know what to do. I’m at work right now and I feel like I’m going to vomit because I just feel like absolute shit. I ate lunch, I’m hydrated, I drank a pot of coffee, and everything it’s just still too much for me.

Afterpay and all it's cousins are scourges on my bank account,"Any else feel this? You break the big number into smaller numbers over time and the ADHD gremlin in your brain says ""oooh we can do that""

One of the worst things about ADHD - Knowing how much effort you need to do “just enough”,"I’m sure people will also know the feeling, I’ve basically felt it all throughout my working life.

I’ve been good at most of my jobs, but after a while, I quickly find out what is enough to be in the “acceptable” range, where I’m not exactly doing amazing but enough that I’m not doing bad either so I get no hassle from my boss, but the problem is it’s just so difficult to gather the motivation to perform better. 

I will have the rare day in which I feel really good and go into work and smash my targets with relative ease then I’ll come back down to earth again with having enough effort just to avoid any criticism.

It’s heartbreaking at the same time because I wonder what could’ve been if I was able to perform to the standard I know I’m capable of. 

I’ve recently started medication with 20mg Elvanse/Vyanse, while it helps my anxiety and calms my racing mind, I still feel the exact same, constantly procrastinating and putting things off until later👎",1
One of the hardest things for me.,"I was horrible in grade school - high school, I never applied myself in anything and I dropped out my sophomore year.

I can never celebrate anything I accomplish because I am so hyper-focused on what I did wrong. Does anyone else ever feel like they’re stuck in this torturous never ending cycle. I should celebrate that I have straight A’s in both my classes I have a gpa of 3.9 but it’s not a 4.0 it could be better and because it’s not a 4.0 you’re a failure. 😞 This happens in every aspect of my life most especially at work.

I have ADHD and BPD,"So I was diagnosed with ADHD couple of months ago and with BPD couple of years ago since I often deal with HUGE mood swings and I’ve lately realized something and now I’m like kinda hella confused… I’ve been on Vyvanse 30mg for about 2 months now and everything is going well but I somehow barely have mood swings now??? Like I know ADHD can cause mood swings too but I’ve had INTENSE mood swings for YEARS like my days and weeks were a legit roller coaster of emotions and now since on Vyvanse I barely have some and if I do they are less intense?? I’m so confused what’s happening lol but ig I’m glad… but like does that mean having those 2 diagnosis can make your mood swings even worst??

(PS: I wasn’t diagnosed with BPD only because of intense mood swings. I have several extreme symptoms other than intense mood swings.)",1
I don't know. Can my ADHd get worse?,"I have ADD (now ADHD-pi?) related to Neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic disorder known to cause ADHD. 

I've opened and closed and put off this post for the past few days but I've decided I'll sit down and write what I can. I have ADD, I was diagnosed at around 7 years old. Never really thought TOO much about my ADD other than it being the reason I'm a bit unattentive. To be honest, I got this far in my post and already tabbed out.

One major and unique? thing right now is I'm dealing with major memory problems. I thought I had dementia at one point.

But, despite this I was still able to focus on things I enjoyed. At the age of 16 when I left school I spent like 12 hours a day on a video game for over a year. Same game I played after school every day in my adulthood. Whilst I'm not particularly proud of this, it showed that at times I could sorta focus on stuff I was interested in.

17-18, yeah, went to college, could still game and watch TV shows, follow the story of a game. Play pretty advanced games too. To 18-20/1 I was pretty active in an online community for like two years and even when I struggled with memory, I was there.

Let's jump past covid because it wasn't that bad of a time for me personally. In the past year or so, my attention, memory and focus has taken a major hit. Conversations are hard, focusing on anything is so hard. I can't enjoy video games like I used too, I feel like a broken shell of a person. Relationship with friends has taken a hit, my social presence has taken a hit.

Looking through problems associated with ADHD for me is basically like a checklist.

I'm unable to engage with friends, don't think I'm depressed, just feel lost.

Want to restart meds, don't know why but when I was first prescribed ritalin when I was around 7-8, I wanted to stop taking it. Don't think I noticed much change at the time, not sure. Didn't like it maybe. In hindsight, I think maybe it was not strong enough? and the routine of taking it bothered me.

Got promoted at work and like, whilst it's good I fear I'll be able to learn anything to do with my promotion. OG role was pretty easy, worried I'll fuck the rest of it up.

I want to be a normal human.",1

I’m so tired. The harder I try the more I feel like I’ve failed",1
Someone posted this yesterday as part of a post but it got ignored and I’m really curious how many others deal with this,"The poster identified “impulsivity in work” as a symptom of his add. 

I relate to this so very much and I actively try to stop it but it’s like I really can’t control it. 

Anytime I am working on something at work and realize a problem/issue/interesting fact, I cannot control my urge to immediately reach out to someone to address it, even though I very much know that I don’t have all of the facts/haven’t read the entire document/didn’t do any research: 

More times than not I end up looking dumb, bc a minimal effort to look into the issue would have released it’s actually not an issue/was already resolved or whatever. 

I don’t know what this compulsion is. If I had to identify it, it’s probably based on my imposter syndrome and wanting people to know that I am working? But at the same time i recognize that it actually has the opposite effect bc it makes me look lazy, not paying attention to details, not reading things that are in my lap. 


Can you relate?",1
Just once it's like to get in bed once a night,"It seems like every single night I get in and out of bed multiple times. Climb in bed, oops left the light on, go turn it off. Get back in bed, crap left my phone in the bathroom, get up and put it on the charger. Get in bed, where is my kindle, oh it's under my kids bed from story time,... on and on it goes. 
I'm surprised my amazing wife hasn't kicked me out of the bed cuz I know it wakes her up every time I get in and out of it. Anyone else got the same problems? Any suggestions?",1
Just been diagnosed and at a loss,"I'm 33, I was diagnosed an hour ago and after the initial euphoria of feeling validated for the first time about all the things I've been repeatedly told are wrong with me is an actual genuine medical condition I'm now suddenly jarringly at a loss.

I've been struggling for years with this damn thing and what happens next when I get my prescription is terrifying. Am I going to miraculously feel better, be motivated and do things to suddenly succeed? Or is it not going to be so magic and easy and still be a battle?
What if I'd been diagnosed years ago, would I now be some mad CEO of an award winning start up because I had nothing holding me back? Some successful version of the current me? Will I change and forget who I used to be taking something that's going to actually affect my brain chemistry?

Did/does anyone feel this way? How did you handle it? I'm really in need of advice as I'm now spiralling out at this next step in my life and I have no one else to ask about it",1
"I’m tired, boss. Dog tired.","After another week of poor decisions and self sabotage, those words fell out of my mouth while descending the stairs for the 3rd time because I couldn’t manage to remember everything the first (or second) trip upstairs. It wasn’t until after I heard myself say them that I remembered, “The Green Mile”

Normally my constant need to please and feel appreciated drives me to excel in my career. For the last month, despite my hardest efforts and relentless dedication, I’ve struggled to pull off what I’ve effortlessly done dozens and dozens of times.  The clients know I’m dedicated and they appreciate me, but they are also counting on me. The complexities in this instance are more than I anticipated, and today resulted in 2 more promising potential chances to succeed just… drop cold.

I’m tired. I’m trying my fucking hardest, but it’s not working. I make poor choices to numb or distract from the feeling of failure and disappointment. These choices have made every day more difficult and stressful than the one before. I don’t even enjoy what I’m doing to myself. I know I don’t. I hate it. But it takes my mind off the self loathing, only to amplify it the next day.  (I’m not on needles, lol. It kind of sounds like it though).  

I’ve tried for 3 weeks to create more routine and implement habits that help me grow. I’m really trying, but I’m so fucking tired. Tired of feeling like I’m making my best effort but still not doing the things I know need to be done. “But I’m getting closer”, I tell myself while still ending every day in the same place as the one before.

Took a big step tonight and pushed my shame aside to ask for help. Tomorrow will be better. It has to be. I have to tell my clients, “Sorry, still nope” but even that impending disappointment can’t be worse than today.",1
Sometimes I think it'll never be enough,"

After years of struggling and a freshman year of college straight out of hell, I was diagnosed with ADHD on May 3rd, 2023. I was put on the medication Concerta on May 18th, it worked really well for about 3 days but now for the most part I've fallen back into my old ways. Being aware of this disorder is nice and it's good to know for once that I'm not just a pathetic lazy ass. 


But I'm still struggling bad. I guess I thought the medication would be a magic bullet but it's not. It was rather naive of me to assume that, but I'm a rather naive person in general so I'm not surprised. 

I've got a lot of goals and plans. I was in the habit of making a checklist of things to do every day but I never got all or even most of those things done so today I just kinda quit. I want to be normal so goddamn bad. I'm struggling to maintain the blog that could let me achieve my dreams of being a sportswriter (I actually got fired from a part-time writing job not too long ago because I wasn't putting out content enough). I'm struggling to maintain doing work around my house like I promised myself I would do this summer. I want to put myself out there and look for a loving relationship but I don't know if I am loveable. If I had a partner I feel like I'd make their life a burden. It's not just ADHD, it's Anxiety and very possibly (but not confirmed) OCD too. 


Growing up, I was told that my quirks made me special, and some of them did because they actually worked in my favor instead of against me. I used to think my wacky brain was a gift, but for the first time in my life it feels more like a curse. I wish I could just screw the top of my head off, take this brain out, and put in a normal one. What is it even like to be a normal person? I don't know, I don't even think I can comprehend it. It has to be a whole different world. 


I feel like I only have so much energy. Maybe I can hold down a job well, but my hobbies and relationships would suffer. Maybe I can do a lot of my hobbies, but my job and relationships would suffer, etc. I've tried for so long just to pull myself together and it seems like I not only fail but don't even get halfway. I don't know how or even if I can change it.",1
I can’t sit through a movie to save my life,"I cannot sit through a movie to save my life

Sometimes I get up to go to the bathroom even when I don’t need to just so I don’t have to sit still in a seat in the theatre. It bugs my partner and I don’t know how to fix it. I fidget so much and most toys that satisfy that urge are too loud for movie theaters. Since I can’t use my phone in a theatre either I don’t know how to focus on strictly the movie without slowly going insane",1

I will have to will myself out of ADHD.,"The only legal ADHD medication in my country has no effect on me on the maximum dose. Not even a slightly raised heartbeat. I tracked my symptoms in terms of what I was doing and not only how I was feeling, so I know my behavior doesn't change either. Today I stopped taking them cold turkey and I have been doing exactly the same as yesterday, and as usual. My own doctor told me that I could try to get some other medications illegally on the internet if I wanted. 
I already take wellbutrin, strattera is not available, other  narcolepsy pills cost way too much and there is no way of getting them for cheaper. I already do sports, eat proteins, sleep 8-9hours per day. 
 I don't know. I don't want to move country and be alone just for my meds. 
So I just will have to cope with it. I'm struggling. I don't want to keep living like this...",1
Am I in the wrong?,"
This post might be a little long and I apologise in advance for any grammar or spelling mistakes since English isn’t my first language. 
First of all I will give you some context, me and my best friend are in the same class and we took a course to get an English certification during the school year (from October to march). 
We had to eat at the school cafeteria every time since the course started one hour after our lessons ended so we didn’t have enough time to go home and eat. 
We used to eat at the same table with this boy, whom we already know from the year’s prior school trip, but during those lunches we started becoming closer friends. 
our classroom and his classroom went on the same trip this year so we were in the same hotel and the three of us spent most of the nights together.
After the school trip we started hanging out after school and text everyday, as friend, as I am not interested in a relationship atm.
Fast forward to today when my friend decides she wants to talk to me before class and she tells me that the two of them have been hanging out together (without me, as I live far away from them) and that she thinks that there might be a little bit of love interest from both parts.
I have been upset all day because of this news because I expected her to tell me since she had known she had feelings for him for almost two weeks. 
I had a shitty day and I have been crying all afternoon because I know that, if they get into a relationship, our trio will change. She told me that I don’t have to distance myself from him because she knows that we are good friends, but i feel like I should and this breaks my heart. 
I’ve been crying all day and now I’m starting to wonder: is it okay to be upset about this situation or am I being to sensitive? 
I really don’t want to be their third wheel but at the same time I don’t want to break our trio…
Can someone tell me if my anger and my sadness are justified or if I’m overreacting? I might go crazy over this!!! 
Thanking in advance everyone who will comment and I apologise again for my grammar.",1
Doubt and discouragement over stimulants not working the way I expected them to,"Hello,

I (30M) am finally making the move towards serious ADHD treatment after enduring a horrifically severe bout of depression, anxiety and insomnia over the past winter.  Thanks to Paxil, Mirtazapine, and therapy, I am in a MUCH better place than I was, but still suspect that the bulk of those issues may have been rooted in my ADHD brain's inability to slow down and get itself together.

I was diagnosed with ADHD/executive dysfunction when I was 13, as I really struggled to concentrate in class, get assignments done, etc.  This never went away in my adulthood, affecting my work and innumerable other factors in my life.  

**The biggest symptom I'm trying to address is the constant racing thoughts and inner chatter**, which although I've learned to somewhat manage it on its own, can quickly become a nightmare spiral when combined with anxiety.  Thus leading to the unspeakably horrible insomnia I faced over the winter.

A few weeks ago my psychiatrist assessed and re-diagnosed me with ADHD, and prescribed 15mg Focalin XR.  The first day I took it, it only felt like a slight energy boost, like I'd drank a lot of coffee, but not much else.  The second day was similar, except this time I drank caffeine a little later in the day (one cup of matcha tea, but still a stupid choice probably) and was still wide awake by bedtime, which triggered an ugly anxiety spiral in me, but I ultimately was able to fall asleep fine later in the night.

This experience scared me off from taking it again, so my psych then prescribed me Vyvanse 30mg to try instead.  I'm currently on day 7 of that but unfortunately it's the same general feeling of drinking a lot of coffee, feeling energized and slightly jittery, but very little improvement to my ability to focus and quiet my mind.

I guess the ultimate question I have is: **if I'm feeling these physical effects, but no real effect on my actual inattentive ADHD symptoms, am I on too high a dose, too low a dose, or the wrong type of meds for me?**  

I've searched reddit far and wide but can't seem to find anyone with a similar situation as mine.  It's honestly making me doubt myself and whether or not I even have ADHD, despite checking all the boxes for inattentive type, and being diagnosed in both childhood and adulthood.  Any advice, anecdotes, whatever would be hugely appreciated!",1
Emotional deregulation,"Hi everyone, I'm new here and fairly new to ADHD having only been diagnosed a few months ago. I wanted to ask about emotional deregulation and people's experiences of it, and how you manage it. I'm someone that gets very emotional about things and can feel extremely overwhelmed about it. To the point that I feel like everything around me is crumbling down and IV messed up in a major way. I'm aware that these issues aren't world ending but to me they feel like that even with the logic firmly established. I'm currently in waiting lists for professional help so for now I'm on my own and wanted some advice and other people experiences.  Hope you are all having a great day and look forward to what is said",1
Need motivation,I have some writing to do today and I have time to do it but I can't get myself to start. I really don't want to do it. And then I keep wanting to procrastinate by doing the other billion organization tasks I need to do. My house is a mess. Kids are home sick.  I need some help. Any tips?  Give me a pep talk please!,1
Anyone gone off meds bc they are sick & it really dinked things up at home?,"Been very sick with a vicious GI virus — vomiting or diarrhea non-stop—& unable to take meds for 5 days.

My mother in law died on Sunday. So ya, the timing couldn’t be worse for me, or anyone who needs me right now.

I’ve been awful. Impulsive. Moody. Lonely. I feel like a toddler. I’ve said terrible things to my husband, things I know would never escape my mouth hole if I were in proper shape (medication-wise & health-wise). I’m still not well, even today. The doc says it could take a full week to recover.

It’s been a long time since I’ve gone this long without meds & I’m not exaggerating when I say there is a huge mood component, largely tied to impulsivity. Of course, awful behavior is still awful behavior, and I own that. I just don’t know if it would have gotten this bad if I were not off my meds for so long, on top of being sick. On top of grieving. I guess I wanted to know if anyone else has had this experience.

I’m hard enough on myself. Not really looking for a stern chat, here. I get it. I have behaved despicably. Just looking for the “ya that’s happened to me before” people in the crowd. Thanks, everyone.",1
I had a horrible day and struggle to move on.,"Wednesday was the worst. I went to work in person, which I hate. The first thing I was told was that I forgot a step on the very last day of our biggest project of the year. I did not. Someone else accidently deleted it.

I sat at my cubicle and discovered that yet another person used it for storage without my knowledge and that my shelves and drawers are now full. They even moved my personal stuff. It's the third time it happened.

My doctor called with bad news. 

My 2 closest coworkers somehow forgot about me and went to an important meeting without me, leaving me to struggle to figure out where to go (we have multiple buildings) and did not save me a place so I had to sit by myself. By then, I was really tired and irritated. 

The meeting was with a higher-up that I don't know well, and he was talking down to us and being condescending, like we were too dumb to understand the situation and he had to simplify it for us. Of course, I had to run my mouth and tell him that we are, in fact, quite intelligent people. I won't get reprimanded, but I certainly did not make a good impression. 

I went back to my desk and opened my email just to find a dozen new emails about the project mentioned before, most of them so outrageously stupid that I don't know how to answer. 

Yesterday, I had to take the day off for more health tests. The most likely scenario is that I have brain cancer. 

Now, it's Friday morning. I have to log in to work in 39 minutes, and I am paralyzed. My head is spinning, going back and forth between being mad at my coworkers, knowing that the stupid emails are waiting for me and thinking about dying. Being sad, disappointed, or stressed always transforms into being angry for me. How in hell do I get out of the spiral?",1
