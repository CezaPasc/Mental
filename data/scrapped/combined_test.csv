"When I was about 13 or 14, in high school, i used to feel like someday, for whatever reason, someone (not someone in particular, just about anyone) would attack me. I started bringing box cutters in my jackets and eventually a knife in my backpack for self-defense. It pretty much went away when the pandemic started and we no longer had class in person, around spring of 2020.

By autumn of 2020, I had driven away a few online friends from me, because I kept thinking they hated me and were telling everyone I was a bad person and I would end up isolated, and I eventually lashed out at them.

And as of now, I fear most of my friends dislike me and at any time will make me an outcast. I dont know why I think that way, they have invited me to meet them in a few months and have even bought me a thing for when I go. But I still do feel that way and I fear what that will lead me to.",5,paranoia

"It‚Äôs 2am and I am very upset right now just pondering like usual and thinking about how lost I am in life.

"Good evening everyone, I don‚Äôt know where to start.

I can‚Äôt do this anymore.

Long story short, I have social anxiety and I always overthink.

I am a college student in a business school (I finish in a year) and I have 0 friends.

What I‚Äôm about to describe always happens to me ever since high school but today I‚Äôm just wondering why this keeps happening to me.

We often have teamwork during classes. When I‚Äôm in teams with other students, I feel very uncomfortable, especially around girls my age. I don‚Äôt come from a nice background and I feel so fucking worthless in front of these people. They all seem to be doing better than me in every spheres of life and that directly affects me. When we do group work, I have a hard time speaking up because I feel so uncomfortable around them and I feel like I can‚Äôt speak. I kid you not I panic so much i can‚Äôt talk.

Then when i do talk, I‚Äôm not even joking people ignore me and don‚Äôt even make eye contact, as if I were a ghost. I am never acknowledged and seen by people and it really is hurting my mental health. Can you imagine the courage it takes for me to speak up and then be fucking ignored by 4 people?

Whenever I‚Äôm in class i can‚Äôt concentrate as my mind is always thinking about how ugly and how useless and inferior i am to the rest of these people. 

I feel like a loser whenever I‚Äôm in class. I feel worthless. I feel that all these other students are far better than me in every aspects of life. And they probably are. They‚Äôre all good looking people while I‚Äôm the most ugliest guy out there (I‚Äôm 23 y/o and still never had a gf, it‚Äôs a me issue at this point). 

I really want to get a girlfriend who will be there by me and from who I‚Äôll learn things and possibly improve my wellbeing. I just want to have a shoulder on which I can rest my heavy head.

I just can‚Äôt no more guys.

Idk what‚Äôs so bad about me that people feel disgusted about to treat me in such a way.

I‚Äôm often tired and when I do feel energized, I get totally overwhelmed by the way people treat me. I see all these other students talking with other students they never met, smiling and laughing and no soul even dares to ask me my pathetic name.

Wishing the best to the rest of you all.

"I fear if I were to tell people what I experience then they would lock me away‚Ä¶ How do you talk about your experiences without fear that a psychiatrist or therapist will recommend for you to be sectioned? 

I have told 2 therapist‚Äôs at different periods in my life what was going on for me in terms of my mental health, I was bluntly open and honest and then they became angry and sort to intimidate me and made veiled hostile threats to have me locked up in a institution through wilful force of their own. 

It‚Äôs made me question how mature these therapists are to just outright come out with threats simply because they feel uncomfortable or challenged. It has made me question a lot about human beings. 

So how do you take the risk to tell people what‚Äôs going on for you if they are in a position of power that may result in them directly contributing to having you locked up against your will and they may do so at a whim if they feel you aren‚Äôt doing what they want you to do‚Ä¶ Seems a bit of a power play and these therapists are willing to use extreme cards on the fly if it appeases their ego and they do so in a reckless and careless manner just to gratify their own ego‚Ä¶ That ain‚Äôt right",5,paranoia

"I go through periods of time in which I experience more hallucinations, disorganization and particularly delusions. Medication and therapy has made them less frequent and severe, but they keep occurring.

These is no regular timing and I have never found a pattern in them. It's hard for me to recognize when I'm entering such a period. When I'm in too far I am unable to recognize my own situation. I think recognizing it sooner can help me get treatment sooner and prevent my life from going further off the rails.

But, lately I've been suspecting an episode coming up. I'm not sure, but I'll bring it up with my therapist. It's better to have a false alarm than becoming too psychotic to function.

"Was talking to my friend on discord the other night and we reached the topic of how messy my room was when she came over a couple weeks ago. A corner in my room had begun becoming a bit of a ‚Äúdepression den‚Äù, with trash and boxes piling up that I was too depressed to take care of.

I‚Äôve always kind of considered myself to be functionally depressed, because I can get up and do things for the most part, and I can go to work. But I‚Äôm constantly suicidal and depressed. When it gets particularly bad is when I start to stop taking care of myself and my belongings, hence this pile of trash that had built up in my room. 

Somehow we shifted our conversation to this and I apologized she had to see it when it was in its worst state (which wasn‚Äôt entirely true, but I didn‚Äôt wanna go into detail about the other times my room turned into a trash den). After I said that she told me, ‚Äúif that was your worst, then you don‚Äôt know what true mental illness is‚Äù. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. I don‚Äôt know if she necessarily had bad intentions, but she knows I have depression and anxiety, so hearing that from her honestly just felt like a slap to the face.

She doesn‚Äôt know how bad my mental health has been lately. It‚Äôs a miracle I‚Äôm still alive. Hearing her say that felt so shitty because it almost sounded like, despite the shit I‚Äôve been going through, it‚Äôs not enough to be *actually* depressed. It just left a bad fucking taste in my mouth and I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about it. It just feels like a really shitty thing to say to someone who is clearly struggling with mental illness. It‚Äôs not the first time she‚Äôs said weird shit about my mental health. She treat my depression like it‚Äôs a fucking joke and I‚Äôm sick of it.",2,depression

"TW ‚ö†Ô∏è: mention of c*tting

I‚Äôm 17 and I‚Äôve always suffered from low mood I have it where I‚Äôm in a really dark place for months/years at a time . It started when I was 12 I c*t myself when I was 12 . It makes me sad to think that , when I was 14 I got over it and  was sooo happy living the dream and now I‚Äôm 17 and about 7-8 months ago it has came back . I thought it had gone for good but no . I actually cant do this I never ever ever feel happy I had to quit my job drip out of school because I couldn‚Äôt mentally do it . And I‚Äôm wondering if depression will ever go I try sooo hard to ignore my thoughts but the more I push them away the stronger and louder they become.

I wish I were normal. I don‚Äôt find pleasure in anything like I used to and everything is just torture even seeing my friends is a chore I only do it for them because I do love them but I would rather sit in my room and rot . 

I‚Äôm literally a kid I need to get out of this ‚Äòphase‚Äô I want to be like everyone else . I want to be happy and see everyone but I can‚Äôt . 

Recently in like October I c*t and when I looked at it it made me so sad because I hadn‚Äôt done it sinse I were 12 and it reminded me of being a kid and not knowing why I hate myself so much . That made me stop c*tying for good . Ovc I get voices telling me too but I can‚Äôt do it again .

Sorry for rant it‚Äôs a bit embarrassing because I don‚Äôt talk like this to anyone irl . And sorry if some bits don‚Äôt make sense I‚Äôm really dyslexic.

"Yesterday, shortly before falling asleep, and after staying up all night drinking energy drinks and playing GTA V Online (trying to grind out some in-game cash, which is hard to come by for free), I had the distinct impression that I was rapidly losing my mind.

Normally when I'm tired I just fall asleep no matter how much caffeine I drink; the caffeine just helps me stay alert while I'm already awake. However, last night I guess I hit a 'sweet spot' and I sort of got stuck in between sleeping and being awake. I figured the game was making me twitchy from being alert too long, and began watching YouTube to unwind.

The first and only video I watched ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJEF\_U3L0B4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJEF_U3L0B4), I remember the video because that's when things got weird), I found my brain randomly latching onto little things in the video's content, like words, gestures, etc. and I got the most literal 'tunnel vision' effect that I've ever experienced.

This startled me, and I jokingly thought to myself something like, ""Ha, my brain's playing tricks on me."" I then suddenly had a frightening and nightmarish hallucination of a really vivid brain. Just the otherwise harmless word triggered a terrifying response.

I immediately slammed my computer shut, sprinted to my bed, and hid under my blanket like a four-year-old. I fought my way toward a restless sleep, in which I constantly felt like my back was exposed to some unknown threat, even when I laid face-up.

Now, after having slept and detox-ed, I still have lingering effects from this incident, mostly of needing to shield my back with a wall, or the floor... like I become afraid of staying standing if I lose focus on what I'm doing. Note that I really only delayed my sleep cycle by 8 hours or so, and consumed no more caffeine than I often do.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? It's like everything I normally do is 'realer than life,' and there's a creepy.... something lurking behind me.",5,paranoia

"Just kinda ranting a little bit... but I've been thinking about how modern life seems to be detrimental to everyone's health.

Most of my life is spent sitting, laying down, etc, and this is probably how it is for many people.

Even though I can go to the gym, or walk around outside, it's still difficult not to feel caged in sometimes. I don't want to go out at night because there are drifters and scary people walking around, but I wish I could. I wish I lived next to hiking trails.

"This sounds like such a simple problem to ‚Äònormal‚Äô people, but when you think people are imminently about to kill/torture/rape you, how do you override your instincts to defend yourself? I‚Äôve attacked a few people now; verbally and physically (staff I thought were trying to hurt me when I was properly ill in hospital) and it‚Äôs becoming more and more of a problem and I can‚Äôt think my way out of it. 

I get delusions where I think people are trying to kill/torture/rape me. Reflecting back on it, it‚Äôs clear they weren‚Äôt but in the moment I had felt no other way out than to defend myself against them when they did something that I believed was them starting to actually kill/torture/rape me. To make matters more complicated, people have genuinely attacked me in the past. I can‚Äôt distinguish between delusion and reality in the moment, only after lots of careful reflection.

When I‚Äôm not in crisis, I actually already underreact to situations because I‚Äôm so scared of overreacting again. For example, today I got hit (not hard) by a car and was so busy apologising and wheeling off that I didn‚Äôt stop to think how awful it was that he had pulled out of the pavement and ran into me without ever having looked down at me on my wheelchair. There‚Äôs lots of similar situations where I‚Äôve allowed myself to get into danger for fear of overreacting. And yet, when I get ill, I‚Äôm so scared, I‚Äôm like a cornered animal.

Is the solution to just try to never react no matter what under any circumstances? If so, how should I override the primal urge to ‚Äòdefend myself‚Äô? What happens the next time I am actually attacked (either in hospital or outside in the real world)? How do I work around this? I don‚Äôt want to hurt anybody yet I‚Äôm also incredibly fearful of being hurt by others as I have been in the past.

"So I've always kind of had a fear of the dark as a kid. I think everybody has at some point? Maybe not? I'm not so sure.

But recently, within the last 6months, I've been completely and utterly terrified of the dark.

When I get home from work past midnight, I triple check outside my car, just to make sure nothing is waiting for me to get out.  When I'm home and it's also past midnight, and when my roommate is already asleep, I can barely leave my room to go to the bathroom because the whole house is completely dark. I feel so immensely paranoid that someone has broken in and is waiting to kill me. 

We DO have an alarm system, so I try to remind myself that nothing will happen if it doesn't go off. That it's completely safe because I'm guarded by this very expensive system. And my very kind roommate recently got night lights in the kitchen, living room, office, and even the bathrooms so I don't feel so scared. 

But even then, I still feel like it's not enough. Someone or something is actively tryna to get me. Sometimes I hear shit around the house, like a rustle or someone outside talking and I get so frightened I start triple checking if everything is locked and the system is on. 

I get so paranoid from the dark that I keep my closet closed and my windows covered up completely with tapestries. I lock my bedroom door, and keep the lights on in my bedroom while I sleep. I actually got curtains for my bathroom window (even though it's painted glass and you can barely see anything out of it) and keep it shut at all times. I cannot even stand the idea of having my completely dark with just a tiny night light. Like I need to be able to see every corner of my room. Sometimes when I'm EXTRA paranoid, I keep my laptop at a low volume so i don't hear anything else but a video playing or something. 

I even got a big ol dog to keep me company at night when I feel so paranoid.

It's starting to really affect me. I cannot do anything at night without feeling like someone or something is watching me. I can't even imagine going to late night parties. It mortifies me to say the least. I just CANT do it.

I hope someone can relate to this. Please tell me I'm not going crazy for having this extreme fear/paranoia of the dark.",5,paranoia

"After spending like 6 months just trying to get a diagnosis, I finally got started on medication earlier this year. My doctor said she wasn‚Äôt going to prescribe adderall because of the shortage, but there were other things we could try. First we tried Vyvance. My insurance said they approved it, but they just meant it would count towards my deductible, and I got a surprise charge for the entire $350 or so. I can‚Äôt afford that, so my doctor switched me to dextroamphetamine the next month.

Both medications worked really well. I thought it was going to radically change my life. And maybe something will, eventually. But I‚Äôve had to fight to get my medication covered every single month since my diagnosis, and I just can‚Äôt do it anymore.

"I grew up in the hood, I grew up being taught about death, gangs, loveless marriage. I never knew what happiness was. I spent everyday of my life wishing death on myself barricaded in my room because I was hated. I kept myself alive with daydreams believing I could have something more one day I fought hard I clawed my way up I put myself through hell held my head up high through discrimination, sexual abuse, let boss‚Äôs believe they had a chance just so I could have a possible future; I did this until it stopped working. My high end life came with a cost which was my soul. I was living in San Francisco being verbally abused by a meth addict, I was abducted and raped by a Lyft driver that got covered up by the company, I was used by socialites for image appearances until there was nothing left inside me. I slept in bed everyday barricading myself once again then I got fired while I was trying to work through it. My mental health issues ruined the job I had to let a boss touch my thigh for. I went back to the valley with family and it‚Äôs great I remembered I had a soul but I can see the damage in my sisters life how her upbringing affected her. We were ruined. Our father a liar and a cheater. Our mother who stayed for a better lifestyle. They abused us and now we are all the same. Disasters.

"tldr or smthg : scared i might have tbi/brain damage due to concussive state in year 9, minor incidents in year 5 and year 10. high results all round, never really study too much.

&#x200B;

**Experiences**

When I was in YEar 2 - Year 4 I was very bright, smart child and commended by my parents, teachers and other specialists. In year 5, I got in a fight and someone hit me in the back of the head with small fists around the back of my head (the area where hair usually ends after a fresh cut), and the area had swollen parts to it for a while that hurt to touch. I don't remember having bad symptoms or any head aches necessarily, but remember crying and having enough capacity to tell teacher and stuff. 

After than incident I have done still really well in schooling with scholarships everything etc and NAPLAN up until Year 9, where I fell hitting the topish of my head, I think i got a minor concussion as my walking was very fuzzy and weak, I still remember everything that happened clearly on that day and even remarking to my friend about it, also I had bad headache that day that went away. stupidly, i didn't tell others in my recollection and didnt get help, just slept it out.  After that incident, I still did very well in school, but had a study slump where I had bad mental health etc that could've impacted it but i thugged it out, and got really high grades that matched my previous performance and even better in the circumstances. 

Fast forward to Year 10, my brow bone where my eyebrows are got hit by cricket ball with helment, that didn't do anything as it hit up rather than straight at my head, and this unlucky happened 6 times over two months, but it definitely wasn't forceful hits just stung. The last two hits led me to feel little tired but nothing out the normal, i definitely think that it was just my mind making it up as i was worried about it.  

Tbh after these incidents my year 10 is of to very strong start with math and science, so idk.

**Reaasoning**

TO these events, Im scared something could've impacted my intelligence and cognitive ability. reasonig for this is that i feel my memory decreased, it could be attributed to my constant fatigue sometimes, mental health sadness and that i've stopped reading. 

Also, i don't have proper reasoning for my iq reducing as my scores are high and my school results are constantly competitive with top 3 at shcool but i did completely flunk NAPLAN which i didn't try and was late to as I got high Band 9 for math, and some band 10s for english when in year 5 i got decently higher (yr 7 skipped due to covid). However, like im not sure with my worry and anxiety over this i started picking up when I forget things, and its worrying.

If worse comes to worse, Ill thug it out, it gets better eventually.

&#x200B;

**Background context etc**

Ive done IQ tests including Italian one that had large sample data, MENSA norway i think and the psychometrics test by WASIQ i think it was, and I got 133, 118 (very tired on that day and distracted and under stress pressure), 135 respectively. Im not sure if it really has been impacted however.

For some reason, in maths I always find myself performing bad on NAPALN and stuff as such for some reason but do very very well in other tests with minimal practice.

I procrastinate a lot in my studies but still manage to memorise when it matters and do pretty welll (A - A+), sometimes i start studying 5 days into a two topic test for example.

I struggle with mental health, dont have any bad thoughts but when i do struggle i thug it out, shi but thugging it means i get brain fog and just fatigue with the sadness.

Im 15, year 10.

I have a lot of test anxiety and make silly mistakes that take away marks and never that I don;t understand a topic in tests.

I am studying to be a doctor, im afraid this could impact my ucat.

"In theory, I‚Äôm a pretty ambitious person - I‚Äôm studying to be a social worker, I volunteer, I care a lot about social issues,  I crochet, blah blah blah - but a lot of the time I kinda feel like it‚Äôs not really me doing all this, or at least not doing it for myself. I do care about the world, and other people, and there are things that genuinely make me happy, but when I pull back and think about it, I sort of feel like an automaton. I don‚Äôt really feel any driving force to achieve my goals, I just do stuff because I feel like that‚Äôs what I should be doing. 

I recently got hired at a job I applied to, and I had to pretend to be excited when I told my parents because they were thrilled and I felt like I should be too. Now I‚Äôm going through the motions of onboarding and training, and it just feels like it‚Äôs not really me doing it. I don‚Äôt dissociate as far as I‚Äôm aware, but I‚Äôve been getting this weird detached feeling with pretty much everything I do, and I hate it. Not sure what to do about it except keep trucking along and hope that I just miraculously wake up one day feeling like my heart is finally in it.

"Backstory: I do a lot of internet deep dives, usually looking for obscure media. I never look for anything illegal. I always stay on the surface web, I don't actually know how to use the deep web. Sometimes these sites are not in English.

I'm afraid of us getting hacked or looking our internet connection because of something I looked up. I'm afraid of my family thinking that I am some sort of weirdo.

We moved last year and had to switch to a different ISP. It's satellite, so we have limited data, so we can check on how much we have. For some reason I'm worried my family will look at my internet logs and question me about it. I feel like I have to sometimes ask them about what they are looking at it listen in on them. Although, they usually just stuff like pay bills or look up landscaping stuff. Our anti virus software also logs our history, and we tend to check on that more frequently.

I have a collection of cosplay photos, nothing that's too NSFW. Many of these pictures come from a behind the scenes blog from a Japanese adult film studio, that uses a lot of well made and detailed costumes. I have no interest in the adult films they produce, I want only pictures of the costumes. I was looking though their archives recently, I had that open in one tab, in another tab I was looking up information about an obscure foreign kids movie. I got this paranoid thought that, because I had NSFW content in one tab and information about a children's movie in the other, the feds would mistake me for looking at CP. I thought that they might come to my house and search our stuff and my family would be mad at me.

Next up is that I torrent shows. I have an external drive full of old TV shows and anime. Sometimes the batch files can be large, so I try to download little bits at a time, as to not use too much data. I'm worried I'll end up using all of our data. Our ISP, doesn't turn off our access, but would slow it down a lot. 

Although I use a VPN, I'm worried that our ISP will send me a copywriter strike letter. I'm not sure what I was do if I was in some sort of legal trouble. I don't know how I would even pay for the fees. I don't have much money, that's why I still live at home.

I once posted about someone using my father's SSN to open up a bank account, me thinking it was something I did, even though I would never give it to anyone, nor do I even know it. I don't even use the same computer as him, so I don't know why I thought that. (We later learned that two of my mother's patients had the exact same thing happen from the exact same bank.)

Finally, just yesterday when we were having landscaping done, an SUV pulled up near our house. I buy got out, wrote something down, then left. My dad thinks he was here to do estimates about our yard, but left because we already had someone out here. (My parents called around to get estimates, two of the companies sent out guys to look at our yard without telling us they were coming. My dad thinks it's a case of that.) My first thought is someone was spying on us.

I keep telling myself that I need to stop doing this stuff. I'm not looking at anything illegal. I've been doing this for years, and it was never a problem. I don't know why I'm so worried now. I think that it might be because that things are different now. It's stupid to worry this much, about what would amount to nothing. I know that it's extremely unlikely that someone would come for me. It would take too much time and money to go after just one out of millions of people who the same, if not worse stuff than as me.

I'm mostly worried about what my family would think of me, if they knew about this. I'm afraid of having an awkward conversation about it and their opinion of me changing. I'm horrible at talking about uncomfortable things, and feel like I'd end up getting physically sick, something that had happened before when I became overly nervous.

Can anyone give me some advice? I feel like I need it.",5,paranoia
"The neighbors across from me haven't been home for a few weeks. Their driveway is on the other side of the street. 

For the past week or so there will be a car that just stops on their (non-driveway) side of the house and you'll see it just wait for 5-10-15 minutes.  I feel like whoever is stopping is looking at our house.  It's been kinda creepy.  The longest I've seen someone hang out there was 30 minutes. 

Today I opened the front door and a car drove off. 

The neighbor (whose side they park on) has a gigantic fence. So if they were casing their house it would probably just show that the lights were off.  Also I don't really imagine some epic heist that would take place there.  Car break ins are becoming more common around here but the side of the street these cars are on rarely has cars parked outside ( we parked ours in the garage).   


I'm sort of trying to wrap my head around why cars are just stopping at this location in our neighborhood.  Part of me tries to reassure myself that maybe its a person who got lost in texting or a mom who wanted to finish her podcast before pulling into the driveway.",5,paranoia

"Really‚Ä¶‚Ä¶is this it? It has to be better. I mean it was. I basically lost 16 years of my life. I was in a relationship, I had 3 kids I raised and 1 that came from me. After my ex wife and I divorced I lost my kids. Not legally. Our relationship was spotty to put nicely. She pushed buttons and I‚Äôm not a fan of that. Being from an abusive father I tried not to be him the the genetics lead me. Now that stigma of me still lies with them. Even my ex, I still get the third degree of how I was not how I am. I don‚Äôt know, i wish they knew how it‚Äôs hurts not to talk to me and I spent way to much trying first. Now my current ex. She was a sweetheart at first. Beautiful woman, loves sex, loves to be kinky, she said I was the only to give her multiple orgasms. We lost our baby and I think after that was the turning point. She had a trouble past and alway would bring it up. I had a trouble past and my past was in a good place, way long behind me. I know this is all over the place. It turned out bad because she would always leave then I had trust issues. Granted when I explained what pushed my buttons and open to talk about them she took it offensive. So naturally I‚Äôm the asshole. Once again I‚Äôm the asshole. I‚Äôm always the asshole. Always will be. I will die being the asshole. My kids still think I‚Äôm an asshole.

I eventually got the strength to leave him and start over, but it left me in a terribly financial place. I was laid off last year. I finally have a good job again but I feel like an imposter. 

I don‚Äôt think that my kids (now 21 and 19) need me anymore, or particularly want me around. I‚Äôm alone most days, with my cats. It‚Äôs lonely. 

Due to my layoff, I just had to file bankruptcy. Which, because I was trying to keep my house, meant filing Ch 13. Those payments will leave me with barely enough to pay my utilities. 

I cashed in my entire retirement between leaving the ex and being laid off. I‚Äôm flat broke. I will never be able to retire. (I‚Äôm in my mid 40s). 

In 3 years, my life insurance through work would pay out enough to leave my kids with a solid nest egg, and my youngest should be through college. I‚Äôm just not sure that I can make it that long. 

I‚Äôm not even sure why I‚Äôm posting. I usually get high when I feel like this, and I‚Äôm better for about a week. But then the numbing darkness comes back.

"Okay so, I was diagnosed with ADHD in like 2012, but only recently diagnosed with Autism as well in 2021 so I've been doing some research.

Just now however, I read an article about ADHD masking, and identified with 95% of what was listed.

So, now I'm crying. I'm not entirely sure why, maybe. I mean, I'm pretty sure it because I identified with nearly the whole list of very much self destructive tendencies, but ya know. 

So yeah, apparently I'm ADHD masking, which I didn't know I was doing, and this stupid article is like yeah this'll lead to depression (check), anxiety (check), and substance abuse (no check, hopefully not ever). But also it said that it leads to a diminished sense of self like the person masking might do it so well that they can no longer find their true selfves from hurried under scripted responses and faked emotions.

I cant hold a job long enough before being fired or quitting for being miserable. I barely graduated high school then ghosted community college because i cant even handle a cheap liberal arts degree.

"Hi everyone.  I just got off from work and I feel horrible. I printed a personal document that I shouldn't have while at work. Now I am paranoid and can not settle down.  I did research and saw that printers have internal storage so even if you did delete the document off your cpu, it is in the printer's internal storage still. This is an all in one printer and research has shown that they keep internal storage longer. My mind is over thinking and I'm afraid that one day someone will find out. I keep telling myself, why would they check the internal storage? I even made copies too.  Can someone tell me if I'm overreacting? How can I calm down? Before I left work,  I looked at the menu to see of my recent print, copy and fax jobs were in but it looked blank. Please tell me if I'm thinking too hard?",5,paranoia

"I didn't go to pre-K, I did go to a morning class but I never went to pre-k. In 1st grade I went half days, and my mom would take me out in the afternoons. I did go to a homeschooling teacher for a little while, I can't remember how I did. Then 2nd through 4th grade I went normally. Then, she took me out to homeschool me, it didn't work out so she stuck me back in later in the year. 

I surely fell behind because I couldn't stay focused on my schoolwork at home, that's why my mom put me back in public schooling. Which I'm thankful for. I missed a lot of school through my education years, due to an illness I had which had me vomiting quite frequently. They took me out of class for math because I fell behind, and I had comprehension issues due to my ADHD. I have attention deficits. But, now it's gotten better. In 5th grade towards the end of the year they brought up to my mom they would like to place me on an IEP due to falling behind in a few subjects; Reading and Mathematics.

Fast forward to current time, given I was in an IEP I feel like I'm intellectually or developmentally delayed. I feel like I'm slow, I currently live at home and work in the hospital as a certified nursing assistant. I work full time, but I feel dumb. I pay rent at home even though I'm so bad with money it's insane. I'm impulsive with money especially, I prioritize things badly. I know I'm doing it too, it's just like impulsive. It's weird. I have bad anxiety, social anxiety as well.. anxiety for every situation it seems like. I've gone to therapy for it, because I feel like I'm existing... not living. My therapist says that given that I was able to pass my CNA state certification I'd have to be average or above average in intelligence to even pass it. 

I feel like everyone around me knows something is ""off"". Even though I haven't heard it, I'm sure they talk? I don't really care about anything else anyone has to say BUT the thought of them thinking that I'd be slow or intellectually delayed bothers me. As a kid I walked and talked on time, and passed my childhood milestones. It wasn't ever indicated I was intellectually delayed. 

I got employee of the month 2 months being in the hospital, but I've made big mistakes no one got hurt. I've been a CNA 4 years prior. These nurses are my age and younger and they seem so mature. I feel like sometimes I feel dumb and inadequate. I'm quiet, but I want to be smart and an intellectual. They always say how a hard job I do. These nurses hangout and are friends with each other. I feel out of sorts here. There's been times where they come sit by me cause I sit away from them. Do you think they think something is off? They seem to like me and keep me included. THEY are articulate, I think I'm articulate online but offline it's bad. 

I don't know if I'm overthinking this?",4,anxiety
"I‚Äôm not talking about the voices that we are here for the negative ‚Äú inner monologue‚Äù that people tell us that we are hear, I‚Äôm not talking about our own view of our self worth. I‚Äôm talking about literally other people in the external world looking at us and watching us and harshly judging and criticising. Absolutely everything in anything we do, when they very well know but they‚Äôre commenting and judging a person going through what we go through! I mean it‚Äôs like the people that deliberately mess with someone‚Äôs head, just because they think it‚Äôs fun! To me that is more sickening that absolutely anything to induce a traumatic episode and experience, for someone is to literally put them through harm worse than any physical harm in my opinion. Because that physical wound you can heal from, but that mental wound is something that someone either cannot recover from, or it has to try incredibly hard to even come to terms with recovering. Anyone who knows anyone else has a diagnosis of schizophrenia and knowingly pokes find them and judges them is worse than any scumbag out there in my opinion. Because they are just trying to make anyone feel bad and project, their own insecurities there, too afraid to face in themselves. that‚Äôs cowardice. Anyway, I know it‚Äôs not just in my hair because I literally have voice recordings of my neighbours are looking at me and point to me and judging me for my diagnosis.

"I‚Äôm a SAHM and ever since my second child (3 yrs) was born I haven‚Äôt felt much happiness. She‚Äôs been a much more difficult child than my first (7 yrs). I feel like a terrible mother because I never feel much happiness around anyone anymore. I feel like I have no one to talk to or any sort of support system. I have my husband and he tries to be supportive but eventually gets frustrated when I put any sort of responsibility on him to help me out of this like putting our toddler to bed every night so that I can have some sort of break after being with her 24/7. He says he will do it regularly but somehow we fall into me doing it. His family are the only ones around to help us with our girls but my MIL watches my nieces so she doesn‚Äôt have much time for ours. Which is fine but she asked me to watch my niece a day a week so she didn‚Äôt have to and I told her I didn‚Äôt want to (lots of reasons for this which I don‚Äôt want to unpack). She cried when I told her no because she doesn‚Äôt dare to tell my SIL no and she said back in the day family helped family which has made me feel like complete and utter crap since she said it. Like she will only take our girls if I help her out with my nieces? That‚Äôs not fair. They‚Äôre not her kids. Besides I wouldn‚Äôt be a SAHM if I had free childcare like my SIL gets from her. It‚Äôs so messed up. This was months and months ago and that and so many things just have me so so down. Also so many sicknesses the past two years have trickled through the house so I get no sleep for a whole month at a time between me and my girls being sick. Last year it was literally without exaggerating 3 months straight of sickness (Covid, a cold, then a stomach bug). And now I‚Äôm currently recovering from a stomach bug that everyone got before me where I couldn‚Äôt eat for an entire week and lost 10 pounds.

"So my sisters used to spend their money on expensive alcoholic drinks during parties every weekend. My dad was like that too as a teen.

And I?

"Trigger warnings: True crime mention

For background, I've had anxiety since I was a child that manifested itself into a very bad anxiety disorder due to childhood trauma and chronic pain/health issues. 
Before, when I wasn't working on my anxiety and my issues, I was able to do a lot of stuff without worries. Watch scary movies, go on the big rollercoasters, drink more than one glass, listen to true crime, etc. But after finally going through and processing my trauma and opening up and working on my mental issues I have become way more sensitive. I have always been sensitive and emotional, I wear my heart on my sleeve, but now I am extra sensitive to everything bad/sad/scary. 
For example, if I watch a documentary on a serial killer I worry and fear that one day I am going to ""snap"" and become a killer and I obsess over the possibility of this happening to me. 
Because of this I don't make certain decisions that I feel like are affecting my life too much. Another example: I watched a video of a mom that went into postpartum psychosis and killed her baby, and now I am never gonna have kids out of fear. 

I do see a therapist and I have been taking medication for 12+ years, I just wanted to see if anyone feels the same way I feel and what tips and tricks they do to help.

I've gotten really close to someone online over the past five years but have always felt this fear in the back of my head that I'll never be special and will be forgotten about eventually. It kind of happened a few times in minor ways but I would always isolate myself first before I could be isolated, then I would reunite with her when I felt the threat of being replaced was gone. We've visited each other several times in person and spent a week or so at a time at each other's homes. I would consider her my best friend and that my fear of being replaced just gets in the way of me embracing that fully.

I get really scared whenever she mentions meeting other friends. I know this isn't healthy and is just a product of my irrational fear. I'm planning on travelling to meet her in less than two weeks. She's just told me that she doesn't know if we're going to be able to see each other again for the rest of the year, at least not the summer, because she wants to get a job and is planning on having a different long distance friend over, who happens to have the exact same name and hairstyle and glasses and eye colour as me, and she doesn't want to have both of us over at the same time since we don't know each other.. I don't know how to cope with this. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for almost half my life and I've been getting better recently but this has pushed me back several steps. I can't even talk to her about this because I know this is a completely irrational fear but it's too much of a coincidence, it's driving me crazy.

I have been seeing the same number constantly for a long stretch of months. I try to calm myself down by telling myself it's just a coincidence but I know its not a coincidence anymore. I believe in angel numbers. im too scared to type out the number because I feel like I might manifest it or someone I know will realize its me, but basically its two digits and I see it-- EVERYWHERE. it is not a coincidence, I understand I should rationalize it but I know that what I am experiencing is not a coincidence, it is real. I'll use XX to represent the number. I check my phone at the same increments of time-- 10:XX, 8:XX, 3:XX, a lot of times in order too, 5:XX, 6:XX, 7:XX, 8:XX, EVERY HOUR IN A ROW like that, and im not on my phone checking the time either, ill go downstairs, come back up and bam, 8:XX. my mom will say ""hey can u tell me what time it is,"" I check, its 4:XX. this is just the tip of the ice berg. ive recently started to get a sixth sense like sensation when im around the number. ill get a hunch, a feeling or sensation like ""If I look behind this paper theres going to be XX on it"" and there it will be, I get a feeling ""somethings telling me XX is to the left of my screen, I look and the video im watching was uploading jan XX or whatever, this is not a ""once a day"" type thing either mind you, this is constantly. CONSTANTLY. as in this number thing has taken over my life, essentially. im afraid that the XX is warning me of an approaching death, because I try to keep track of what I am thinking of or what the XX is next to when I see it and the signs are pointing to either me or my family member/members dying. I went on a YouTube live stream of my favorite tarot reader and asked her to clarify what XX meant. she said its going to be a massive change, ""like a door slamming."" this sounds very frightening, not the change part, but the door slamming part. that can't. be good. I pause a video. its landed on XX. I randomly get a feeling to search a celebs birthday, because somethings telling me they were born on XX, I search and they're born on that day. all of these little details are happening to me day in and day out. im aware it sounds crazy and I hate it because its literally driving me crazy. trust me, I literally try to rationalize with myself ""just ignore it, you're probably looking for it now and now you're gonna notice it more."" I search my problem on google--- ""paranoia about a number that I keep seeing"" the post I click on, the person lists their age and its XX and then... to my ABSOLUTE dismay and horror... I go to the comments and there are XX COMMENTS....... I wish I was making this up, but im not, and because of things like this, no one can convince me this is all just one big coincidence. what's worse is I tell myself ""if I see XX within the next minute, it means \*insert bad thing, like someone I know or me Is going to die\*"" and then within the minute ill see XX, or like today I was interacting with a loved one and they go ""look, its XX!"" and point to a box that MYSTERIOUSLY has the number XX printed GIGANTICALLY on its label, instead of literally any other number??? so then im like shit, if they're pointing it out, it must pertain to them... and my astrology chart said this next year there might be a car accident and that loved one has to go somewhere they've never been before tomorrow and im so scared im just so scared. I feel like something really bad is gonna happen. and I know the way ive typed this out all ramble-y makes me sound neurotic, I just hope y'all believe im self aware of that LMFAO... please, theres no WAY this can be a coincidence, I didn't even reach the tip of the iceberg of all the times I see XX and sense its presence, Is this is a spiritual thing or am I paranoid, please help and thank you SO, so much

"  For the last 2 years I've been extremely sad at almost all times. About 2 years ago my grandpa died, obviously I'd be sad. I feel like that just opened the door to all my bad thoughts and emotions. I haven't ever had a good outlook on myself, I think I'm a 2/10 at best, I'm not funny, and I absolutely hate myself in every sense of the word. 
  I've never had any luck romantically(I know that's very common) and rejection is never a surprise anymore. As a result of the constant rejection both romantically and socially I never talk to anyone new EVER. I actively avoid all social interaction if possible and I don't feel like I have anything to give anyone. I'm just an annoying burden with absolutely 0 worth. I've tried all the things and they don't work. ""Talking about it"" has gotten me nothing but judgement and some of the very few people I talk to think I'm making an excuse to not do things with them. 
  It's gotten worse recently, for the last few weeks all I've been thinking about is how much better the world would be without me. I've completely stopped drawing/sketching (The only thing I liked to do) I have no inspiration and feel like I'm forcing it too hard whenever I even attempt to draw. So I stopped. I am a shell of my former happy outgoing self because I've got nothing to show for it. All I did was be nice and considerate and do what all good boys and girls are supposed to do and I've got absolutely nothing for it. I'm aware I'm not owed anything but it would be nice once in a while. I've only gotten bullied for existing, which at this point in time I'd love to stop doing.

I can't do it, I don't know what in the universe is making me this much of a coward.

"My friends and I are autistic too but our symptoms don't manifest like his. We're all incredibly independent (Even though we all constantly crave guidance) And our friend is so dependent that hes willing to put up with abuse.

So we have a friend who's 25 and mildly autistic. His Mom is a narcissistic psychopath who treats him like a servant. His dad is afraid of his mom but hes too old to do anything. They live in the deep country and he has nobody around him to help. No family. No friends that live nearby, we live states away.

Ever since September we've been flying/driving down and visiting him, but nothing we do can convince him to even spend one night outside of his home. His entire life is under lock and key, he's even afraid of walking away from his parents at the supermarket. He has a breakdown and starts sobbing like a kid every time we ask him to tell his parents to let him spend one night outside of his home. We always feel terrible about asking this, but in the same breath he'll tell us he's unhappy and feels like a prisoner. It's even gotten to the point where hes been lying in manipulating us to try to get us to do things for him because he refuses to stand up to his mom. He told us that his parents were beating him, but then he admitted that that was a lie. He was just trying to think up ways where he could legally justify leaving. But it was always legal, hes just afraid of standing up to the mental abuse. 

He even catfished a girl from another state to fly down and visit him without telling her the way that he was living, and tried to manipulate her into a long distance relationship and sex. She spent $2000 on him during her visit because he was really good at telling her what she wanted to hear over the internet, like a fantasy. She dumped him after he couldnt keep the charrade up any longer. He didn't want to take advantage of her initially, but hes so desperate to have a life outside of his abusive mom he's willing to do anything. His dad really wants him to move out and move on, and not tell his mom. But he keeps telling his mom because he wants her to support him. (I think he tells his mom because he's secretly afraid of growing up, but thats just me) In reality she just wants to use him like a slave until the ""Great Lord"" takes her away. 

Shit's psychotic but we have no idea how to help him. We keep giving him numbers and people who have spare rooms but he refuses all the help. (And then after feeling abandoned he wants the help again) We've driven down for hours (some of us drove for 6 hours) and ask him to come with us but he chickens out at the very last second every single time. But he tries to get us to do it again 6 months later! We're tired dude, we want to help him but we have no idea what to do at this point. He obviously needs therapy but no one will drive him to therapy. He obviously needs support but no one with power will support him and hes too afraid to leave. 

What do we do? We all really care about him but I'm starting to think we shouldn't get involved anymore...",1,autism

For example I want made an account in Grindr but I don't because in my mind the ones I talked about my depression would think I was faking to having it, I don't and I'm just trying to acting more normal as possible...or a word, a phrase...something really stupid.

I wish i goals or hobbies but I can‚Äôt swing it. I can‚Äôt even keep a job. I wish I could talk to my parents about it more, but they just don‚Äôt understand. It has been 5 years since I have hung out with friends and at this point I don‚Äôt think I can make more.",2,depression
"Having multiple different friends messaging me mostly every day, whether to have casual conversation or invite to something, has been really suffocating me recently. I feel bad for thinking this way since many other young adults, as well as some of my friends wish they had more friends / people asking them to hang out but that's why it's very hard to express. I love my friends, and I usually have a good time online and in person, but I have an extremely low social battery. 

When I spent 3 days in a row doing spending even a few hours with friends I'm drained, and I want at least a day or two to recover and spend on my own things. When I do something social, I feel like my entire day has gone out the window since it disturbs whatever plan I had laid out for myself. If I reject one invitation, I might still have 1 or 2 more to reject that day or a text conversation to hold for an hour or two while I'm trying to focus on something else. And it's not really good to say, ""I'd just prefer to go back to what I'm doing than talk to you right now"" when I don't necessarily interact with that individual a lot. Even if I'm not doing anything important at a given moment, losing this time unexpectedly usually means I won't keep up with other things I wanted to get done. I can explain that I have a low social battery and that these things are more taxing on me since I have ADHD, but none of my friends, even ones that also have other mental illnesses, understand how straining it is for me to keep up relationships, especially online ones or if I'm expected to be reaching out first. I told that to someone and they must've misunderstood it because they still try to start a conversation every day (sometimes multiple times if it fizzles out) and think it's not straining since I'm not initiating. (Said they ""would do all the heavy lifting"") 

Explaining this to friends, especially since they don't know all of my other friends are or how I've been dividing my time, sounds like me complaining I have too many friends and that I'm annoyed that they remember my existence lol. I can go weeks without messaging a friend first because I just haven't thought about it. With a lot of my friends over my life this has been completely normal and worked out fine, but its difficult when I have so many things to keep in check just in my own day to day life. 

I wouldn't trade having my friends for anything, and I could only imagine how terrible I would feel if I didn't have any, but it still often feels like an obligation to me. I got diagnosed in Fall 2022, so I'm still learning a lot about myself and unpacking things like this",3,adhd

"I've never used paranoia to describe my mental illness. It always falls under anxiety when I talk about my issues. But I just wanted to share this feeling with people who might understand, who can tell me yes or no, if what I'm experiencing is paranoia.

It's not like the stereostypic ""someone's looking at me through my window"" or the more serious ""I think someone is stalking me everywhere I go."" It's more like, I think the entire universe is out to get me. Like, I'm seruous when I say this, I feel that some being is going out of its way to make me miserable. It knows when I'm happy or feel safe and secure, when I'm most vulnerable, and it drops a bombshell on me. 

My life isn't exactly bad to be honest, I have it pretty good. I have a boyfriend and an apartment and an internship, but every so often, almost like in a sitcom, something utterly stupid happens, something totally out of my control, and it ruins my life for a few days, weeks, months, and in some instances forever. Nothing could have prevented it, an illness, a car accident, losing a job. Not always me but sometimes it affects those around me, indirectly affected me as well.

""That's just life,"" yeah I KNOW that but, it just doesn't feel that way... The universe is sending me a message. Sometimes I hear it talk to me, when I'm at my worst. It's just in my head though, so idk if it's related to my mental illness. I'd like to imagine it is, because the thought of the universe coming down on me the moment I realize it's playing games makes me wanna puke.

I've been like this since... middle school I guess. I remember distinctly. I got bad grades because the universe wanted me to be stupid and everyone else to be smart. I would study and memorize and still get B's and C's. It didn't matter that I tried, everyone else was better. I think it's the universe's way of saying I was never meant to be here and that I should stop trying. I'll never be good enough.

There's no trigger. It's been a gradual progression to this point. I tried getting involved more, going out more, doing things. But it all just kept losing its luster. Nothing is enjoyable, anymore. I only turn on music or TV for background noise, and can't even enjoy my usual go-to songs/shows. I still go to appointments and such, but I typically don't really want to. I just feel obligated.

I'm not suicidal. Honestly, suicide and even self-harm feel like they require so much energy, and I definitely don't have it. If the universe would just cease to exist all at once, that would be ideal. That way, no one would have to mourn anyone else's disappearance.

a year ago my life turned into a nightmare, due to gambling addiction (which I got rid of), I spent all the money I had + my wife's money + I made loans in the name of my father, mother-in-law, wife and the company.

after I got into terrible debt, I started to become frivolous. thus I lost clients and now I have two lawsuits in court with two different clients, because I did not respect the delivery deadlines.

I run away for 3 days, came back and they never cared about how I felt. I moved at 20 and cut contact but they found me and we talk to each other time time but now I am the one being very agressive. I was the calm guy all my life, quiet talking to no one. I stopped going to school because I was having suicidal thought. And I don‚Äôt even care anymore. I could be on the street right now and I would be careless. I‚Äôm just writing this in hope In 2 years i will feel better and look back to this text I made. 

I‚Äôm currently just working on a business on the side that made me feel less depressed. I‚Äôm still planning to go back in school even tho it will be the third time I would take a break from it. 

If no one never said it to you

I love you and hope your life goes better",2,depression

"ive dealt with severe non-existant health issues for the past 3 months now sorta expecting to die. i just started kinda getting over it when just about 20 minutes ago, laying in bed. i woke up and knew i was about to die as well as my dog. for some reason i believed there was someone outside with a gun. i dont know why i thought this. i didnt hear anything. i didnt dream about anything as i had only been asleep 10 minutes. i genuinely believed it too. im always in a state of fear but i never think of such specific things without reasoning.",5,paranoia
"I work at goodwill and have told them about my disability (paranoid schizoaffective with Bipolar and BPD) and they work around my income and hour restrictions and abilities(even though the job is all i can handle getting 12 hours a week), anyhow‚Ä¶ Yesterday I had a hallucination that I was about to be fired and just left before they fired me, so i thought at the time. It was at the end of the day. So I cut out 10 minutes early. I felt like I was on fire, or suffocating. Figuratively speaking, mostly. 

I was criticized slightly and everyone was tense as it was busy. I felt so scatter brained and hopeless, I just had to get outta there. I‚Äôm going back and thought it over. I feel okay about it now and thought it over, and just am taking the attitude that when I go in next it‚Äôll be a new day. I was convinced I‚Äôd get a call, and somebody would call me or find me to tell me I‚Äôm being let go. But as with many of these cases with me, I calm down and find no true evidence of these delusions being true. 

I really like this job, believe it or not. They have been supportive. Although, I do think I get some resentment because my days are shorter, like I said before it really is as much as I could handle but coworkers don‚Äôt understand that I‚Äôd kill to have a clear mind again, and go back to the grind and make decent full time money without the the help of social security. 

They are still a job so they have policies and it sets a bad example for other employees, yet, I really do have a hard time staying focused, fighting voices, delusions, hallucinations, etc. 

I‚Äôm asking for some support as well and would like to hear your stories of yourself or people that you care about going through these things. 

P.s. for the record, I do have shame, and I do hate not being a reliable worker like I used to be at other jobs. I don‚Äôt do it because I‚Äôm lazy and don‚Äôt want to work. I have unshakable urges from my condition. And workplace environments aren‚Äôt always great environments for me to focus and do my work in. I just want to succeed.",6,schizophrenia
Back at work! #Depressed! This week off went so fast ;(,0,negative_samples
"To all readers I understand that I am a shitty person. I am not looking for any sympathy from anyone. I simply need to get some things off of my chest. I apologize for the structure of this post. I am not very good at composing my thoughts into words so this may come across as more of a rambling than anything else.   
  
I‚Äôve been battling with depression all my life. I always thought that once I hit that ‚Äúbig event‚Äù my depression would finally go away. Despite hitting several of these ‚Äúevents‚Äù during my life my depression has only worsened. A few years ago I finally broke down and reached out to a doctor and was prescribed antidepressants. After a few trial and errors with different drugs I finally found one that worked well for me. They didn‚Äôt fix my depression, but they definitely made things more bearable. However, now after a few years they have either stopped working entirely, or are working too well. I‚Äôm now completely disassociating with the outside world while facing internal conflict like no other.   
  
My job pays pretty well, but it isn‚Äôt exciting work by any means. By nature I am a good worker. I am a bit of a perfectionist whenever it comes to my work, and I will get tasks completed fast and efficiently. I do not however get any sort of fulfillment out of my work. My co-workers act as if they enjoy what they‚Äôre doing. Perhaps they are lying to me or themselves about enjoying the work, and they are truly as miserable doing the work as I am. Regardless I am jealous of their fulfillment, or ability to lie to themselves because I simply cannot do this. I know I hate my job, and the thought of doing it for another 30-40 years fills me with a sense of dread. Further, I cannot think of a job on this planet that would give me a sense of fulfillment. I think that no matter what job I have I will eventually come to hate it.   
  
I have always had low self esteem. As a former obese child & teenager I never had anyone show romantic interest in me throughout my teenage years. Because of this I despised the way that I looked and turned to porn for comfort. As I came into adulthood I decided to get a grip on my health and managed to lose a lot of weight, but I still hold onto the body image issues (along with stretchmarks and loose skin) from the weight I once held.   
  
I managed to have two serious relationships in earlier adulthood and then eventually met my now wife. I went into relationships with the intent of marriage from the very start. I was coming from the mindset that if I don‚Äôt lock someone down I will never be able to get someone in the future. After the first relationship went south I decided that I would marry my next girlfriend no matter what. That‚Äôs when I met my now wife. She was pretty enough and had a good enough personality, but more importantly loved me. While dating I wasn‚Äôt convinced that I loved her, but kept forward with my original promise to myself and married her anyway. Fast forward five years and we‚Äôre having issues exclusively because of me. Some days I like my wife and her personality. She has a sweet side and knows how to make me smile. Other days a different side of her comes out that I simply cannot stand. On top of this despite an initial attraction, I am no longer physically attracted to her. This has made our sex life basically non-existent and has caused an even greater strain on our relationship all because of me. I know my wife loves me, but I do not think that I love her. I can keep on faking love for a while, but I think it is becoming more and more evident. I do not want to hurt my wife, but I don't know if there is another option besides separation. She deserves to be with someone who loves her.   
  
I have family and a few close friends, but they don‚Äôt know this side of me at all. To them I am the guy who always has something funny to say. I am rarely serious around them and try to make sure everyone is laughing and having a good time when I‚Äôm around. Despite this the second I am no longer around them I return to my depression, often worse than before.   
  
Sometimes the only thing that gives me comfort during difficult situations is fantasizing about killing myself. I don‚Äôt think I will actually ever do the deed, but thinking about it helps me get through whatever shitty situation I am facing in the moment. If I didn‚Äôt have anyone in my life that my suicide wouldn‚Äôt adversely affect then I would do it, but I cannot bring myself to put someone else through emotional pain no matter how much I hate myself. For the meantime I will continue to numb my pain with weed and alcohol.",2,depression
"I'm afraid of people finding out that my different accounts on different different websites are all me for my security, even if there isn't anything criminalizing, so I word my posts and comments differently on different accounts.

Like if I posted the same question on  a different website, I'd ask ""Is this going a bit too far?"" and never use the word overboard on that account. On Reddit I go back and forth between ending the last sentence with a period and not, but on Twitter I almost never do. Another reason's the character limit, but I'd do that even if there wasn't one. Even this throwaway account's a little different than my main Reddit account. I wasn't always doing that on this, but now I'm making them more different.

I don't want the chance of some person to look at one of them and think ""Why do they sound familiar?"" and figure it out.",5,paranoia

"I was on Lexapro several months ago and one night for no reason I woke up and had a horrible panic attack. I had never had a panic attack before so this feeling was completely new to me. I didn‚Äôt know what it was at first. I thought something was seriously wrong. After that I felt like I never really felt the same. That following week I had another really bad panic attack and I had to be put on hydroxyzine which really helped because I felt in a constant state of panic everyday. 

I switched off of Lexapro shortly after thinking that is why I had the panic attacks. I then went onto Zoloft. I had previously been taking hydroxyzine before bed every night in fear that I would wake up having a panic attack again. I finally tried not taking it during the night and found I would wake up with increased anxiety for no reason. So i would take some hydroxyzine and I would usually be able to calm myself down eventually. 

A few months later I felt like Zoloft just wasn‚Äôt doing anything for me so now I am on Effexor. I‚Äôve been on it for a few months now on 75mg. To be honest I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs working or not. I don‚Äôt want to go off of it and realize that it was helping. But Im worried that if I go on a high dose it will mess me up like the Lexapro did. 

I still sometimes feel that increased anxiety waking up if I don‚Äôt take hydroxyzine. I‚Äôm wondering if that is the meds causing this, or if it‚Äôs because of that one panic attack I had that triggered something in me to just feel completely different after that point on.",4,anxiety

"I'm going to give context, so it's going to be a little longer. Sorry.

I'm 28 years old, I love photos and movies since I was 10 years old. I learned to edit videos at 12, I started creating videos at the same age. My first YouTube video was in 2006, and the idea of YouTube and exposing it to the world was amazing to me.

I went to film school where I learned to be a filmmaker, while taking all the Journalism classes (photojournalism).

Leaving college, I started working in the field of marketing, since my country doesn't give a damn about national artistic production and the only types of films are the same comedy scripts. I focused mainly on working with brands and companies, to be able to deal with less EGO (dealing with money is easier than with people's egos). I've been working in marketing ever since, and it's had its ups and downs.

But my dream has always been to work with cinema. I love to tell stories, I love to create, and I need to let my imagination go, otherwise I get very depressed.

So in 2018 I decided to move to Germany even though I had never left my country or even spoken another language IRL. I started working hard, doing 16 hours of work every day of the week. I saved enough money to move and I came to Germany in August/2019. I started working here and gently paved my way until covid happened.

Between 2020 and today, a lot has happened: an abusive/manipulative relationship that destroyed my self-image; 2 months in psychiatric hospital; I broke my elbow; ended my relationship; I lost my home;

Since last year things have been more stable. I have a new house, with my pets, I started dating my best friend. I started to find myself again. What I like to do, what I like to wear, what I like to create (things my last relationship took away from me).

And this year I felt it was time to get back to pursuing my dreams and passions in filmmaking.

&#x200B;

**And here we come to the point of this post:**

&#x200B;

I just can't do what I've dreamed of my whole life.

Not for lack of skill or knowledge, but for lack of social ability. I can mask enough to work full time, but I suck at networking.

Like, HORRIBLE HORRIBLE at networking with new people

&#x200B;

And that's 80% of what's needed.

&#x200B;

I reached the point of thinking it would be easier to become famous through the internet. And now I'm 72 days into posting regularly on Instagram and YouTube. Going out, filming, create, plan, posting. For a little recognition and a lot of frustration (algorithms, people hating for no reason, no reach, much shitter content blowing, etc).

You might say it's only 72 days. But for me it's much more than that. It's years. It's a change of continent.

I feel like I'm banging my head against the wall (metaphoric) every day because I can't do a simple networking task. And even doing photo-shoots is very difficult, because the need to interact with new people all the time, giving instructions and being friendly. When I try to do it, I feel so frozen, it's like forgetting everything I know. And this is so frustrating.  


I don't know what do to anymore, because I'm tired and frustrated. I can't go further. But at the same time I don't like to give up. Photo and film are part of myself, my personality, my hobby, my job, my passion. I'm overwhelmed by my feelings, by the situation, without being able to get out of this, to find my way out, and how to overcome. I overthink everything and spend hours and hours trying to find solutions. Meanwhile the only thing that I get is a lower life quality because the constant anxiety crises.

&#x200B;

Mine therapist is very good, specialized in autistic people, but I'm tired of saying the same thing for him over and over. hahaha

"I dont know what to do

I'm 17 and my life has never really been useful, i spent most my teenage years getting physically and mentally abused by my parents and for the last few months I've been wondering if ive developed depression. I can't remember the last time i genuinely smiled and i dont enjoy the things I used to like. I've been contemplating running away from home and starting off somewhere fresh recently as I still live with my parents and they are no doubt the main cause of my issue

ive been born into a life where my parents are in severe debt because of an accident before i was born and i work 2 jobs per day, just to help them pay off their debt and it'll be fully paid off in about 6 years from now if i keep going, but frankly im not sure if I'll survive for a single more year. it's not nice to work your ass off after a long day of college, work 2 jobs and still not be able to buy the things you want to buy, because all my money goes to my parents debt, and frankly I dont want to throw my life away for this.

I know it's not right to abandon my parents as they aren't able to work anymore and their massive debt, but ive spoken to a few people and the general gist i got was 'you need to think about your own life', so i thought on it and I've done nothing to deserve this life that im living, and I'm genuinely baffled on what i should do in this situation. the family i live with is extremely toxic and i dont like it here but i also feel a strong sense of responsibility as the older sibling, and i know my younger sister wont be able to deal with it if i disappeared one day.",2,depression

"6 years ago I had an interaction with a sex worker.  It was short lived and I wore protection the two times I saw her and have been rigorously tested for STD's.  After both encounters the lady took the condom into the bathroom and flushed it, or so I think.  I believe her age would be somewhere between 40-50, and she was living with another worker in a very rundown motel.  At the time, I was a virgin and 20 years old and felt the need to lose my card in a non-judgmental way but have since determined this instance to be the worst mistake of my life.   Now to the paranoia:

What are the chances that she took the condom, didn't flush it (I didn't visually witness this) and used it to impregnate herself?  Would someone do that, maybe in a child-support ploy?  Would it work?  I blocked the number directly afterwards.  But her profile was deleted two months later, around the time someone would discover pregnancy?  

I worry that one day my future children will get some kind of 23 and me testing and find a sibling, and I am having a hard time reconciling whether this is some kind of paranoid, anxiety-based thought or something with merit?

I‚Äôve never really had a paranoia problem before as far as I can tell in my childhood. Now I‚Äôve had anxiety for a while to the point where I would cry and place mistrust and assume S/O‚Äôs are cheating on me. But after some traumatic events I can‚Äôt help but avoid certain crowds of people because I just believe that these people seem like they are out to get me. It‚Äôs got to the point where if I see anyone I know I walk around them or wave and speed past.,5,paranoia

"So I genuinely made a post asking something (not important). I asked ""Is x okay?"" (irrelevant to this story, but I know you will look it up anyway, so\~). And the comments were pretty straight forward ""Yes"", ""No"" -  classical  questions n' answers.

But the 3-5 people started private dm-ing me asking ""Why do you think it's not okay?"", and my paranoid head just couldn't get, why would so many people, at the same time, ask the same answer? Do you think that they are mocking me? Or do you think that I'm just paranoid.

"I don't want to exist anymore.  I am tired of the grind tired of life.  I guess I have been depressed most of my life.  Nothing really works to bust through it.  Pretty much everyday I wish I didn't wake up, yet I do.

I have some pretty serious suicidal ideation, which obviously no one in my life knows about. But I'm too much of a wuss to follow through. On my worst days the only thing that stops me is the idea that I would ruin that day for others around me.

He was soooo understanding and listened so well. I feel so relieved! I feel like finally I'm being heard and that I'm going to get the help I need and deserve. Right now I'm on haldol orally but he wants to switch me to the injection so it stays in my body longer to try and control symptoms. He said that this belief of feeling this darkness inside is definitely a delusion and that I'm not crazy, but that it is the illness and it's going to be okay. I'm also taking abilify again which I hope will also help me because these symptoms are really kicking my ass right now. I'm hoping the haloperidol injection wont make me too tired? And that there aren't alot of other side effects. He also said if I need a hospital stay to sort all this out that he will bring me in and see what he can do.

I have major paranoia and anxity when it comes to doing anything with other people male or female. I have extreme social anxiety.  I have a very bad problem especially with women especially when I find them attractive I almost can't even function. I become so paranoid and anxious I hear stuff and thing stuff like she is watching me she is judging me. Then I look to see if other people are watching me because I think they are watching me talk to her and stuff. It's very bad even if I am by some attractive girl not even talking once to her I get these voices and racing thoughts and I get all red. It's even embarrassing because either have a new boss who happens to be an attractive women actually double my age embarrassing as it sounds and everything she is just by me I turn red and get voices and thoughts and she actually laughed about it are times it is so embarrassing.

"Lately I have been trying to get the most out of managing and treating my adhd symptoms. I know high protein breakfasts are really important for stimulating dopamine production, so I have been looking at recipes. I want to find stuff I can make on the weekend that I can just grab before work that week.

The problem is I cannot search ""high protein muffin recipe"" without getting results geared towards health nuts. I'm looking for a muffin with lots of protein - I don't care about low carb low cal low sugar low fat whatever. I'm trying really hard to regain/maintain a healthy relationship with food, but all these suggestions seem to be coming from a place of borderline orthorexia. 

I guess I'm just frustrated that the obsession with ""healthy living"" and diet culture make it so there is no option between indifference and obsession.

" I  just...don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm looking for, reassurement, validation. Maybe it's those things. But I'm really scared right now. I'm 25 years old, and I feel like my life is just over or that I'm not gonna go anywhere because of what's happening with me.

For context, on my last post I mentioned my paranoia taking over me. Re-reading things multiple times when i looked at them because I was scared that I was looking at it wrong, saying my family relative's names in my head because I'm afraid of forgetting them. Feeling slow, forgetful. Paranoia immediately making me think I have schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, dementia. Anything. I rewind videos several times to a certain part that I wasn't sure what was said to reassure myself that I heard that specific part correctly. I remember most things obviously, I'm not forgetting old or new memories exactly, but it feels slower and I can't focus. My thoughts are just overthinking or paranoid thoughts about how I'm forgetful.

I take meds currently, diazepam and escitalopram. I freaked out tonight for example, because I forgot to bring half of a pill to my room, but then remembered later. Because it was something more important than rewinding because of a clip of a video that I wasn't sure if I heard it or saw it correctly, I freaked out even more. And now I'm typing this to vent, and HOPING to god that I'm not alone in these weird things. I feel like crying and just vanishing. I don't know what to do. I'll form a thought in my head to check discord for example aswell, I'll keep repeating the thought in my head so i remember to check discord, I'll then sometimes proceed to do something else that I wanted to do, forget about discord for a few minutes, check it, and then REALIZE that I was trying to not forget about it, and then I'll feel like a screw up.

My paranoia makes me fearful that I'm going to lose my entire memory basically.

I just don't know what's wrong with me and it's hard to fully explain and rationalizing it without sounding stupid and crazy.

I'm already re-reading this and feeling that I'm a crazy person typing this crap. I'm sorry for the long post,",5,paranoia

"Hey there,

I don't even know where to start. My life took a big nosedive ever since 2020 (not because of covid-19).
Reason was that my father, who lived one house further did terrorize me and my mom. He was screaming, hit the windows at like 2:00 or 3:00 AM in the morning and even broke one of our windows and stole some stuff from our house, insulted me and my mom heavily and even damaged both of our cars slightly.
He began drinking again at the end of 2019. Basically this stuff was ongoing for like a year. We did sue him many times and we called the police nearly everyday. But they couldn't do anything because when they came he behaved normally. It's hard to explain the details tbh.
From this point ongoing I was getting even more depressed than I have already been. I performed badly in school, bad at work and all because I had so many sleepless nights without any hope.

Then we moved out of our home where I've grown up at the start of 2021. Surely the situation was getting better because my dad couldn't find us anymore and we had peace. But the more time has passed the more I realized that I didn't heal. 

Before I was a rather emotional kind of person. I could feel empathy for people around me. I could feel fear, sadness, happiness and I were able to listen carefully when people where talking to me and I could remember most things.
Now I think im such a mess. Anything from the above I can't do anymore. It's like I'm another person and rarely it feels scary. But to be honest I don't care anymore about anything in my life. 

I have a girlfriend I am dating nearly 5 years now. The first two years everything went amazing and I truly enjoy my time with her. She helped me alot and I am more than grateful for her. But ever since my trauma starting from 2020 to 2021 I behaved like another person, which she told me aswell. I don't know how to communicate anymore. Everytime she wants to talk about our relationship and how to save it etc. my mind is just blank. I can't think of anything and how to even sort things out. She is mad at me and tells me that she's tired to come to me to sort things out. I should be coming to her now. But I just never know what to say.
I think I even became kind of unable to relate. I don't feel anything like love or attachment anymore. Not only for my gf. Just with nobody (same as my family). So it's hard for me to even figure out how to fight for this relationship.

My life is so meaningless to me everyday I search up for ""quickest"" methods to suicide. But fuck me I seem to be too scared to finally do hang myself or something.
I don't deserve to be here anymore and I'm sure everyone would be happier if I would die already.

If it wasn't enough I am addicted to masturbation and nail biting alot. Especially the part about masturbation fucks me up mentally since I do waste hours on it every other day. And my pervertions go to a level where it isn't considered normal aswell.

Just wanted to write my thoughs out which are killing me inside.

I feel fundamentally broken to the point where I can't ever be ""normal"". I don't even have a bad life really. I don't have friends, but I have a girlfriend, and a job I don't hate that pays okay. 

I just don't feel *anything*. I don't know what I'm thinking most of the time. Nothing makes me happy, or sad, or even really mad, and I'm constantly in a fog. I don't feel alive, just that I exist.

I don't feel like my experiences are the same as everyone else's experiences, and I can't relate to people. It feels like whatever part of the brain that makes everyone else normal, functioning, feeling humans, I just don't have.

I've felt this way my entire life, and so far no amount of ""getting help"" has changed anything one bit. I'm 24 now and I feel like I've wasted so much time doing and being *nothing*.

I don't want to rush to make a family, throw my self into responsibility of a family man. I can't ever see myself waking up to other people and not being self aware that i get exhausted around other people. Being alone for majority of my life, and switching to a family man in what seems like an instant will exhaust me.

I have no one to talk to either. I spend most of my day alone. I have no friends in school and don't speak 98% of the week in school.

I can't get any help either whether it be socially, mentally or anything else.

"Alright i will start by giving you a little bit of background info, and as much info as i can so you can fully understand. I'll try to make it as short and to the point as i can. I am 33 yrs old now and from 22 to like 25 i was addicted to heroin, i got clean from heroin but then started doing a lot of coke and crack. I then got clean and straightened out my life. once i got clean i had terrible anxiety to the point where my face would turn red and my pupils would get huge and i would have this look of fear or paranoia on my face and i could tell cuz when other ppl looked at me it made them uncomfortable or have anxiety themselves. my heart would b racing and i would sometimes shake like my hands would shake. i then went to my doc and told him everything that was going on and from like 26 to now 33 i have tried damn near everything out there to try and help my anxiety. i got on suboxone to get off heroin and while on it my anxiety was gone but once i got off subs ive tried sertraline, trintellex, venlafaxine, buspirone, propranolol, atenolol, citalopram, xanax, clonazepam, mirtazapine, fluoxetine. The benzo's worked great for my anxiety but i don't wanna have to take that forever or a long time nor should anyone since there not a long term treatment. 

My anxiety has gotten better over the years, like my face doesn't turn red anymore, but i still feel like i am missing out on life. i also never had anxiety before my drug use. In highschool i played sports and was constantly go go go. I had no problems in social situations, everything was good. I now don't like to do anything except have sex, masturbate or do, extremely fun or adrenaline fueled things like driving dirt bikes, atv's, motorcycles and snowmobiles. I don't like to go anywhere out of fear or im scared i guess i dont really know y. I don't like talking with ppl because it's usually about dumb shit i don't care about, the only time i usually don't mind talking is when its about something im genuinely interested in. Im basically a hermit and it really bothers me cuz i never use to b like this and im missing out on life. 

In the past i have dated some very attractive women and the women in my life that i have dated have been a big part of what motivates me in various ways. Now that im not in a relationship or have a woman in my life i find it very difficult and to b motivated to do things for me. I currently take Buspirone, Trintellex, Seroquel for sleep and 25mg during the day to help with anxiety, and adderall which i don't always take cuz it can make my anxiety worse sometimes and i might have my dosage reduced or stop it all together. I don't notice any changes or improvement from taking the Buspirone and Trintellex 20mg and the seroquel 25mg during the day kinda helps. At a random time in the day usually at evening, my brain or body like releases a chemical that makes me feel really anxious, like my pupils get big and its hard for me to look ppl in the eyes. Thats the best way i know how to explain it, i don't really know what's going on or why it does that. At work i usually start walking around or start doing something like cleaning up while my boss is talking to me, cuz i dont want to look him in the eyes or stand still and have a face to face conversation with him. I do Carpentry/Remodeling BTW. 

Im writing this because i don't know what to do anymore and wanted to see if other ppl have gone thru similar situations and what worked for them as far as anxiety or how i can get my life back. I want to want to do things even if there little things or enjoy the little things, i want to fall in love again and share memories and experiences with someone, i want to enjoy life and not just feel like im going thru the motions everyday, like go to work come home eat go to bed and repeat. My life use to b the complete opposite of what it is now and i know im the only one that can change that and there is 1 thing ive been struggling to do or get motivated to do is working out and going to the gym which i think will help a lot. When i look at my life from the past i was extremely active, played soccer so i ran alot, i also played other sports. I was just all together physically active. Working out cuz i wanted my body to look good for my partner and myself. When you look good you feel good or at least thats how i felt. And please do not judge me on my drug use im not proud of that section of my life and it is behind me, im ashamed of myself cuz thats not who i ever was i was raised better than that.

"This is my first time in this community, but I figured this would be the best place to ask.

I have had anxiety and panic related issues for as long as I can remember. I have put a lot of effort into trying to maintain it and live normally, breathing exercises and whatnot. However, somewhat recently, I have begun to have vivid, memorable nightmares. I won't go into detail about them, but its gotten to the point that I've been often sleep depriving myself just so I don't go to sleep. Its hard for me to call them nightmares because, I used to have nightmares, but never ever to this degree of intensity. I tried explaining this to my roommates, but they didn't really seem to understand it as a problem, saying ""that just sounds like a bad dream"".

My doctor recommended that I should probably start taking anxiety medication, but my (also quite anxious) mom is very against it, saying she has had nothing but bad experiences with anxiety meds. I also worry how the medication would clash with marijuana use, as that is currently how I manage stress, which has been pretty helpful for whenever I've been too stuck in my own thoughts.

I'm incredibly indecisive, but I know something has to be done, because I have to sleep in order to work. So, should I ask my doctor to start me on medication? Or perhaps there is something else I could be doing to help   myself out? I also want to start therapy, but I don't know if I can afford to cover it, even with insurance.

Any advice helps :)",4,anxiety
"I (33f) haven‚Äôt had a boyfriend in 10 years. I struggle maintaining relationships and boundaries. Friendships are few and far between, often not lasting longer than a few months or years. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel so lonely, used, alone, depressed all the time. I feel worthless and unwanted. I like to have fun, I try to love myself, I take myself out to dinner/dates. Guys that are interested see me as a wet body to use. No one really cares about me. I get lonely and suicidal, but I never burden anyone with those thoughts. It‚Äôs hard for me to find anyone to hang out with and trust, and oftentimes I‚Äôm left feeling suicidal by myself, which scares me a lot. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. How do I make friends? I feel like I‚Äôm so old now that it‚Äôs just becoming more and more difficult to meet people. What do I do?",2,depression

"21M I am in college but I‚Äôve been staying at my parents house (which is in the same place as my college). I usually am living at an apartment but my roommates have been really awful so I moved back home.

I‚Äôve been home for about a month and I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôve regressed while at home. I‚Äôve stopped working out, I barely get homework done, and I sleep too much.

Today I slept until 10:00 AM and my mom burst into my room screaming at me and called me a ‚Äúsuck‚Äù which is what she says in place of ‚Äúwaste‚Äù.  She said that she can‚Äôt have me sleep in and that I need to work out and all I care about is sleep and food.

She works out daily and has completely turned me away from wanting to work out when I was younger. I don‚Äôt mind cardio and when I was running briefly a month ago, I was really excited. I even lost some weight.

She however said that I have to do weights and that running isn‚Äôt enough. I gave up on running because I have chronic headaches and neck pain. The only escape I get from the world is sleep.

I went to bed at 10:30 last night and got up at 10:00 today. I know it‚Äôs a long time but it was good. I had a dream that I got back together with my ex who broke up with me because she lost interest.

I really cared for her and she made me feel at home. I miss her so much and my mom woke me from the dream and immediately began to call me a waste.

I can‚Äôt move back to the apartment because two of my three other roommates are super toxic and stay up until 3AM every night. They hate me.

Home is the best choice for me but my mom who honestly is toxic on her own (I love her but she constantly criticizes me for anything I do) is making home also miserable for me.

"tldr: i‚Äôm paranoid about an evil entity that is stalking me and waiting to be able to take over my body even though it has nothing to do with my trauma (rape and emotional abuse) 

the TLDR says it for itself. but i had my first psychotic episode october 29 2020. i thought something was watching me. i sat at the foot of my bed watching TV and puking for what felt like 10 minutes but when i looked at the time nearly 3 hours had gone by. 

beyond that point i was a wreck. i was crippled by my own mind. everyday and night i thought there was something watching me. i was constantly burning incense, yelling at things that weren‚Äôt there to go away and that they weren‚Äôt welcome around me.

some months go by, i get put on 20mg of paxil and .5 of clonazepam. it worked for a while. after a few months i could tell it was wearing off. for the first few months i had zero paranoia. now i do. i see shadows that other people don‚Äôt see and i assume i‚Äôm the only one who can see it for a reason and it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs targeting me. billboards are sending me secret messages, typos on my phone are sending me secret messages and all of them are that i‚Äôm in danger. 

i asked my psychiatrist if this could SOMEHOW be related to my trauma and she said yes, although i show more severe signs of paranoia than other patients with ptsd she has treated, and if it gets worse she‚Äôs going to look into what antipsychotic is best for me. 

my question is how the fuck do i have this level of paranoia from sexual assault? it doesn‚Äôt make sense? there‚Äôs no correlation? does anybody else have this type of paranoia? if so, do you know what caused it? 

mine seems to have come out of nowhere. other than watching horror movies? but i‚Äôve been doing that since i was a child. i don‚Äôt know. i‚Äôm frustrated that the medication isn‚Äôt working anymore and i‚Äôm at a loss.",5,paranoia

"I have a high stress career that's fast pace. I know this isn't my dream career but at the moment I have a contract I can't get out of. I have to perform just about every week day and when I don't do something right I fail and have to redo it again the following day. The thing is, it is different per instructor I perform with. For example, the guy next to me made a mistake that would cause a fail,  but he did not fail the student, the instructor either completely missed it or let that go without saying anything. I, however, failed my ride, and it wasn't until I felt dead inside when I started to perform better and without the anxiety. I ended up being the only person who failed in my class.

By ADHD standards I have a pretty decent grasp on my life. I have and continue to hold down a great job that I enjoy and am able to navigate the world we live in despite having a spicy brain.

The one thing i struggle with is relationships. I‚Äôve done a lot of internal reflection, work with therapists on the topic of romantic relationships but I seem to always find myself in a constant need for interaction with partners due to the all the feel good chemicals that come with being in a happy relationship. 
The problem is, a healthy relationship often requires time apart and to live our own lives, and when that happens my brain just craves to be back with them. 

It‚Äôs not affecting my relationship as such, because I do a good job of working through it myself. But it does often make me feel pretty irregulated and I find it affects my mood a lot.

Just curious to know what, if anything can help with this. 

Thank you!

"I have a great, musically talented, smart, funny kiddo. He will be 17 soon. His dad and I aren‚Äôt together anymore (about 5 yrs now) but we coparent well. We both have safe loving homes where he is 50/50. We tell him we love him all the time. I‚Äôd hug him if he‚Äôs let me but at his age he would prefer not. Oh well, fist bumps it is. 

I‚Äôve noticed he‚Äôs been really angry/mopey for the last year and it‚Äôs gotten worse lately. And when he‚Äôs angry/annoyed everyone around him feels it. A short fuse with the dogs that he adores stomping around and short one word answers to questions‚Ä¶or no answer at all like he didn‚Äôt hear. The air is toxic. It worries me, and makes me feel like shit at the same time. But this isn‚Äôt about me‚Ä¶

His primary Dr recommended antidepressant a year ago which both he and his father were adamantly against. I was over ruled.  

He doesn‚Äôt like many kids at school. Says they‚Äôre assholes. I thought maybe he was getting bullied? We talked to his teachers and they said he could come to the office anytime he felt frustrated or bad in any way. He will never name names. 

I know he was getting teased about his weight. And for a few weeks I couldn‚Äôt get him to eat. That was scary. 

He‚Äôs decided he would like to change high schools for his final year. This may help? Or it may be the same ol same old. but I‚Äôm willing to try anything!  

He has no interest in doing anything fun with us. Laser Tag, a Summer Vacation of his choice, going to see a movie. He just says ‚ÄúNah‚Äù and goes back to his room. 

He will not talk to his father or me about what SPECIFICALLY is going on. He said,  ‚ÄúEverything sucks and is annoying. Home, work, school I hate it all.‚Äù I asked him what I could do to make his home life better as I can control that. He had no specific requests. And I mean I‚ÄôM WILLING to change anything I‚Äôm doing wrong. 

I would like him to go to therapy. And am open to getting him on antidepressants but, again, he has been very against it. It seems like he feels like he would be less of a ‚Äúman‚Äù. Like it‚Äôs a sign of weakness to get help. This sucks! I didn‚Äôt raise him to shove down his feelings. It also doesn‚Äôt help, as I said previously, that his Dad, is against the therapy or meds too. 

Last night everything came to a head and we all talked. His dad said he should take two days to think about what he would like to do. And how we can help. If he doesn‚Äôt know what to do, that‚Äôs okay too. AND dad said that something needed to happen, like therapy, so he could be happy again. (So glad he said that!) I asked if he‚Äôs ever had thoughts of hurting himself and he said no. But is that the truth? 

Today my son said he would like to try medication. He will talk with his dad tomorrow about it. I wish he would do both talk therapy and meds (even for a short time) so he can feel happy again.

"I needed to make a throwaway account to vent my feelings, because I just have to get some things off of my chest. I hope this post won‚Äôt get deleted because of my nonexistent Karma score on here, but we‚Äôll see what happens.

I just hate my life. All of it. Sometimes I wish I was never born, and sometimes I just wish things were different. I hate being perceived as an incompetent weirdo, simply because I‚Äôm autistic. I don‚Äôt have the luxury of a support system, nor does anyone care about me. I‚Äôm all alone, fighting every day to even just get out of bed.

The more I do this, the more weary of existing I get. I live such a dead end existence, working a job that I‚Äôm so burned out on and have no motivation for. I‚Äôm in debt and can barely save any money at all. It doesn‚Äôt help that I have a chronic spending problem due to it giving me somewhat of a temporary high to fill the empty void where I‚Äôm given no affection whatsoever. It makes me feel good for a while, but it doesn‚Äôt truly make me happy. 

I don‚Äôt have a partner either, and I wish I did so that I could at least focus more on them instead of my broken mind and heart. I miss my Ex still even after we broke up in November. I want to be back with them but they already are with someone else. It‚Äôs super hard finding a partner at all these days now, and no matter how hard I try, I come up with no results. I guess I‚Äôm just not what people want, and I‚Äôm to die alone. Who knows? 

I lost faith in my religion as well. Nothing but bad has happened in my life, and when I turned to God for answers, more bad just ended up happening. If he exists, then he definitely hates me. I was told I was never meant to be born either way. Maybe this is my punishment for existing.

I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôm not hooked on alcohol or drugs as a substitute for covering that gaping hole, but it just doesn‚Äôt really appeal to me. 

I just don‚Äôt see my life going anywhere anymore. I just want it to end, or I just want things to go my way for once.

I‚Äôm sorry for things being kind of crazy in this post, but my mind is just venting my scrambled thoughts.",2,depression
"I generally feel like my family talks about me behind my back a lot. This bit isn't paranoia because I've walked in on them many times and I've often heard them say things about me (after an argument)  that kind of stung - my mom told my brother that she doesn't care about the things I get for her as long as she's got him and when he mentioned that I can hear her, she said that she "" doesn't give a shit"".  After that I was expected to let it go because she was angry. I mention this because it kind of traumatized me and my relationship with my mother was essentially over after that even though we're still living in the same house.

In the time since then, I exchanged exactly one look with another person. My mother, she and I were there, and we were talking about charity and my mother turned it around to how everything at home is sorted and we have everything we need. It was just a second but for my part it was very, very judgemental but the other person and her have a very good relationship and I often catch snippets that sound less than appealing to me. It's none of my business though so I stay out of it.

The thing now is that I tend to get very paranoid about them talk about me and based on basically everything I've heard my mother ever say in my entire life, I feel like I'm anticipating the worst. Even ridiculous things. One day, for example, there was a small earth tremor and the second it hit I recognized the sound with the vibration and I started counting the number seconds it lasted as I went to my safe place in my bedroom. My mother and I have both experienced earthquakes before then (her in the 60s me in 2018)  and I didn't recognize it the first time and I slept right through it (this was in Japan where some major quakes have hit not long before I was there so they were experiencing aftershocks). It scared the hell out of me that I didn't recognize it  so I read tons of accounts about what people hear and spoke to people who were there to try and figure out what I might expect. When the tremor hit where I am now, I heard a crack before I felt the shake and I immediately figured that this was it. Anyway, I told my brother (who didn't feel it at all) and mother that I heard it (tons of people did and tons didn't) and they gave one another ""the look""  now I am trying to figure out how this can  be used in one of their gab sessions to make me look bad. To me it feels like this would be consistent with everything I've experienced with them but it still feels so dangerous - like anything I say can and will be used against me, even something as ubiquitous as hearing an earthquake!",5,paranoia

 ive been depressed for years but rn i feel overwhlemed. im in my final year of school and i have exams in the next months. i'm not very worried about my grades because i can do well, but the homework and study i am required to do is exhausting.

 i have no plans for my future because A) the only hobbies i have is art, english and poetry & B) I haven't sat down with my parents and asked for their help. Every time over the last year i've asked my mother for advice on what to do next year she hasn't given me anything. And any time there was a college/uni open day, or anything, she wouldn't go with me. I feel like my parents don't care about my future. and it's painful because i see my friends and their parents give them guidance on where to go in life, and they are supportive of them and boost their ambition, but with me when i say i want to do a course in english or something my mother doesn't approve because it doesnt give me a qualification. 

my dad is a drunk. he came home an hour ago after using going to church as an excuse for drinking. i would rather my mother just left him and everyone would be happier. he's also depressed but he doesn't talk about it to anyone, and i'm not very close to him either.

i have 2 sisters and 1 brother. my brother is nice but hes small minded. my sister is nice, but only when she wants to be ( when something upsets her she snaps). my other sister (in her 20's)  bullies me constantly. when i used to complain about her fighting with my mother she called me a baby and told be to get a grip. i try not to talk to my other sister if i can because she makes me uncomfortable but she always starts fighting with me over nothing.

also, i haven't gone to a professional barber in about a year. i started cutting my hair myself because my social anxiety got bad, and i didnt feel safe in a men's barbers as a queer man. this has become a constant topic for my famliy to get angry with me about. my mother tells me my hair looks awful and shouts at me to get it cut. it makes me feel bad. my sister also bullies me about this and makes me feel like i'm worth nothing.

i want to either go to college or emigrate the country and live in another european country, but both options would be expensive and i may not be allowed to leave the country by my parents.

i live in a very expensive country in europe and i want to move away from my dysfunctional family but i'm afraid that i won't be able to afford to live independently . also my country is depressing - there is a housing crisis, which means even if i do find somewhere to rend it will be thousands a month. in the cities, there is antisocial behaviour and hate crimes that happen to people daily. our capital city is dirty and is full of teenagers that attack others. this makes me scared for the future.

to be honest i don't even feel like a regular person anymore. i'm not able to do simple tasks that all of my friends are able to do, like keeping a job or socialising. this also worries me, like i'm some kind of freak and im stagnant developmentally.

"Edit: skip to the end if u don‚Äôt mind just answering a couple general questions.

Hi guys, I‚Äôm 19 and had my first psychotic episode last may during finals week from a combination of my adderall prescription, weed and stress. It was a terrifying 4 months. For the first half, I was manic believing I was telepathic with my d1 hockey dorm neighbor. For the second half, I was paranoid shitless that he hired a hit man to kill me because he was tired of hearing me. 

For 4 months, I kept hearing voices despite months of different medications. I was declared treatment resistant but Electroconvulsive therapy eliminated the voices completely. I was diagnosed with schizo affective disorder somewhere in that period

I stayed clear of all drugs but when I returned back to UW Madison this January, I started using weed and alcohol daily until I heard an external voice while riding my bike on campus. It sounded like a person talking about me within hearing distance but I turned my head and no one was there. This was my only psychotic symptom but scared me enough to stop weed completely(still sober from weed and plan to for decades). I heard external voices like this every 5 minutes but only while I was outside. It lasted for a couple days after last smoking weed then it went away. Then for midterms, I decided to buy a few adderall as I figured I‚Äôd be fine since I stopped weed. I combined this with little sleep and i heard external voices while outside for a few days then it stopped(exact same features as post weed). This was my only psychotic symptom as far as I know. Does this mean I‚Äôm close to a full blown psychotic episode? 


I haven‚Äôt heard an external voice in a couple months. But after my midterms, I noticed that EVERYTIME I thought about what someone is thinking of me, I heard the sentence I think they‚Äôre saying as loud as my internal monologue. Currently, those internal voices have decreased to a level im comfortable with. That level is around imagining someone else‚Äôs thoughts as half sentences and half non sentences(or a feeling). Please try this quickly by thinking of something you did recently that impacted someone and let me know if what you think they‚Äôre thinking is in sentences or non sentences? 



I have an addictive personality but have managed to decrease my alcohol consumption from 20 to 10 drinks per week since the emergence of these voices I experienced. Is this level of drinking likely to cause another episode eventually? and how long would you estimate it would take the average person? I currently don‚Äôt have any psychotic symptoms so I also plan to take 20mg xr adderall 4 times per semester(early, though, so my sleep isn‚Äôt effected). If this is dangerous in your eyes, I can definitely be persuaded to not take it to study for finals this week as Im not stressed about failing. I plan on limited by drug use to adderall and alcohol.

"I've suffered from clinical depression all my life. It's strained relationships with my family and friends. Like so many who carry this burden I struggle to find meaning or any kind of basic enjoyment. Staying busy helps. Spent most of my youth building a career for myself and moving place to place. No real connections and no desire to build them, until I got older. Eventually I bought a home. Didn't even need a mortgage. I feel as empty as I am successful. It's never enough. Lost touch with everyone I've ever known as I struggle to relate with anyone. It took a long time for me to stop hating myself but, I feel like I'm simply waiting to die. No relationships and children. I didn't want to risk passing this affliction to them. So now no one will remember me and no one will care. I only wish I valued the things in life that truly matter instead of chasing money and ""success"".",2,depression

"When I took my exam to get my driver's license (early 90s), they were using computers for the first time so software and graphics were primitive. The passing score was 18 out of 24 and after every question, the system would tell you if you answered correctly or not.

Question 1, good answer. Question 2, good answer, Question 3... 4... 5... 10... 15... Question 17, good answer, all good answers. I come to question 18 and I know if I get this one right, I'm home free. I answer, hit enter, good answer!

As it was programmed with proper manners, the system would inform me that I have enough correct answers and that the test was done. Congratulations, you passed.

I go to the counter, get the paper copy of my results :

**Result : 18/24 - PASS**

I went back to the counter arguing that this was wrong. That I did not get 18/24, I got 18/18 and the paper should reflect that. ""Why do you care? You passed. It doesn't matter"". ""It DOES matter because 18/18 means I absolutely nailed the exam because I was prepared. 18/24 means I barely passed and one more wrong answer and I would have failed. There is a HUGE difference"".

They couldn't change the paper of course, and my parents never believed me when I told them the computer stopped at 18 because I had a perfect score up to that point.

So if you were a programmer in the late 80s, early 90s and you programmed the software for driver tests in Quebec at the SAAQ, know that your shitty code changed the course of my life.

"Hello I just wanted to post because no one around me seems to be able to relate. I've been struggling with mental health my whole life (depression, anxiety, ADD).

 In the last year my primary doctor has suspected I may have chronic fatigue syndrome. There's no test for this other than to rule out everything else my fatigue could be. All my blood tests and insomnia test were negative, and the last test to rule out was sleep apnea. So for over 3 months of waiting to get tested for that I was mentally preparing for either. I honestly was hoping it would just be sleep apnea because that is treatable and cfs is not. 

 I got my test result back a few weeks ago and I have the lowest possible sleep apnea positive score. I was relieved at first because I had only mentally prepared for it to be one or the other. But when I saw my primary again, she said most likely my light sleep apnea isn't what's making me so fatigued all the time but she can't diagnose me officially with chronic fatigue syndrome until I attempt to fix the sleep apnea. So she told me it is most likely both.

Now I have been waiting even longer for the sleep doctor to tell me what to do and I still haven't heard back almost a month later. I may not find out a real answer for another year or maybe never. I'm feeling so hopeless because I researched and all they know about chronic fatigue syndrome is that you can get bedridden from it and it's not treatable and may in fact take up to 20 years off your lifespan because of higher rates of heart attack or suicide. 

Does anyone else have chronic fatigue syndrome officially that also struggles with depression and anxiety? How do I live with the probability of this? I am already out a job and can no longer leave the house easily by myself because I don't feel it's safe to drive. But I'm not much closer to finding the true answer so I just feel hopeless. I haven't included all the ways my fatigue affects me but it has ruined my life. Anyone dealing with something similar please share how you deal with this",2,depression

"My life is so just slightly not great. I have a job, I live with my mother and my free time is spent however I please. But with the lack of apparent friends and incredibly ill brain I have, I get depressed super easily. Whether it be dwelling in the shame of not going to college or wallowing in self pity and lack of a social circle, I always turn around after a lil bit. I usually end up in trains of thought similar to:

""Nope, I'm fine, might as well be happy, cause lingering in any other feeling does me no good.""

And then I just act completely fine and inevitably feel fine. I'm always cracking up my co workers, making them smile and laugh. But I get so sick of it sometimes. I'm the only damn person who's positive. Despite how depressed I feel when I'm not working. It feels like a role that I've adapted to. And I just keep going with it. 

You can only fake it so much before you get exhausted and give up trying. Trying to act like I'm fine, and/or that things will get better. Cause at this pace, it's not. I barely have anyone in my life that I'm real with. The extent of my social circle is really just friends online, which are great dont get me wrong I love each and every one of them. But being able to see and touch an actual human being is very different.

"The most extreme thing I'm struggling with lately that has made this obvious is that I worry about being transported to a horrible place. There's a story I've seen about a boy who pressed a button to receive a million yen in exchange for being transported to an endless empty void for 500 million years, and then at the end of it he forgets all of it. It details all of the immense suffering and loneliness he endures and it's pretty horrible. Basically I worry about that happening to me, that when I fall asleep I'll wake up there, or maybe I already have every night and I just don't remember any of it. For weeks now I've felt uncomfortable with falling asleep in general, since that sort of temporary death experience scares me. But now it's to the point where my brain is telling me that falling asleep will actually result in hellish torture. I suffered from this to an even worse extent when I was younger, I thought it couldn't happen to me again, but it has.

&#x200B;

Reading other posts here I'm also realizing that I'm paranoid in other ways. Like when people don't respond to me quickly especially my boyfriend I worry about and even visualize them being dead or in immense harms way. I also feel like if I don't constantly outperform myself and do my best and work as hard as possible, the world will crumble around me and I'll be on the street or dead. These feelings are both similar to posts I found, and I was shocked that I related so much to posts on a subreddit about paranoia, because I've never thought of myself as paranoid before. I also have really bad OCD these days and worry about stuff like touching a surface and then getting sick, or I touch the surface and then my eyes and then I'll become blind. I also have to check stuff so many times, like my car being locked and especially that the burners on the oven are off, even if no one in the house has used them that day. Despite a lot of things in my life going really well, my anxiety and mental health in general has just been falling apart over the months, and it's becoming so hard to deal with.",5,paranoia

"Today, I failed my driving test for the second time due to ongoing mental health issues. When I turned 16, my mother urged me to start driving to reduce future car insurance costs. However, my anxiety and depression, diagnosed at 16, made me delay obtaining my license until I turned 18. Throughout my life, I have experienced various forms of therapy, seeing nine different therapists since third grade. In one of my therapy sessions, a psychiatrist recommended medication to manage my disorder. Unfortunately, my mother declined. I needed parental consent to take it since I was still a minor. I'm thinking that my struggles with school, road tests, and other necessities stem from a lack of access to medication and strong family support. Now that I'm 18 and can consent, I can't afford mental health help. Despite my fears about driving, my entire family insisted that I learn to drive. Their gossip made me feel like a failure for being afraid of driving. On my first driving test, I failed due to speeding at a dip. The examiner's yelling from the start increased my anxiety. Today, I had a kind examiner. I stopped at a 4-way stop sign. However, someone to my left was speeding. My nerves got the hang of me as I drove, thinking I could pass them, but my examiner had to brake. She informed me that I had only four errors, including one critical error. She realized that I had a severe anxiety disorder based on my reactions and offered some suggestions to pass the test. Her kind words made me feel less hatred for myself. However, I still bawled my eyes out at home because my instructor downplayed my mental health issues, saying I was simply making reckless decisions and that it had nothing to do with anxiety. Next time, I should expect that Californians can't drive properly and cheat at a 4-way stop. I am scared that I will get a stricter examiner the next time and have to apply for my permit again. I hate that my family ridicules me because my younger sisters drive better than me. I also wish that my family would understand that I'd rather take public transportation than put my life at risk by engaging in something I dislike. In the future, I plan to move to a more affordable state or country with better public transportation options even if I attain my license. Once I pass my driving test, I will still use the bus. However, I'm doubting my chances of passing the driving test on my third attempt. It feels ironic that as a Psychology major, I'm seeking advice from others in this situation.",2,depression

"

Sometimes, I will doubt my ability to think about things. For example, I might try to analyse what is wrong with me and then I doubt my analysis. I doubt everything I am thinking. I doubt my ability to think. I think I may be biased. At that time I feel very disconnected from myself like I have lost control of myself. WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THIS? 

Once, back when I was a kid I had this episode the day before one of my exams. My mind was saying some stuff i.e. I was thinking about things. I was panickimg and telling my mom "" Mom my mind is saying things and not letting me study. I cannot concentrate. It will not let me study"" I was crying vehemently. I was inconsolable and I thought I'd fail. But I passed with flying colours. I WAS NOT HALLUCINATING. I WAS NOT HEARING VOICES IN MY HEAD. This episode shook me to my very core and had instilled in me a fear of exams. For the next few exams I told myself ""this is your own mind speaking to you. You can ask it to quieten down. It will listen because this is your own mind"" 
For more clarity, I would like to tell you I never prepare for my exams beforehand so it could have been stress. But this was just a one time thing. To this day I do not know what had happened to me that night. WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

Background information about me: I suffer from OCD. I have never suffered from a head injury. I am a procrastinator. I am high achieving and have always gotten good grades without even properly studying ( because of the procrastination ) I had an emotionally unavailable father growing up. I donot hallucinate.

"So sometimes I‚Äôm afraid of my shadow and convinced there are people in my house. I can‚Äôt ever find them but sometimes I 100% believe they‚Äôre there. This only happens (so far) when I take a little too much of my Abilify. It‚Äôs a long story but I take 1-2mg every other day because I have super sensitivities to meds. I told my psych about the people in my house and she said that‚Äôs just anxiety. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but people in my house that are real to me feels like borderline psychosis at least but paranoia at a minimum. I am afraid people will break in. I‚Äôm afraid people are in. Not all the time, but for example, right now my light is on because I‚Äôm afraid to go to bed and be in the dark‚Äînot because of people, but because I‚Äôm uneasy and afraid something will come. My heater came on and my first thought was someone is in the house and turned it on. No, I just thought I turned it off when I checked it this evening. If I hear a beep like my refrigerator door beeps when it‚Äôs open I immediately think something is very wrong and the world is ending. Beeps send my into apocalypse mode and it‚Äôs hard to feel normal after. I know my thoughts are irrational. My sane brain is still sitting in the back of the bus but I‚Äôm pretty confused about what to call this. I have been diagnosed as OCD, bipolar NOS, and Gen Anxiety Disorder. I don‚Äôt have any of the common schizoaffective symptoms, just what I described above. What do I call this?",5,paranoia

"I‚Äôve had anxiety for two years now. It‚Äôs on an off so I don‚Äôt constantly suffer with it ( at least not extreme anxiety). Usually I do not pass out, throw up or any other extreme things like that but two nights ago I was sick due to an anxiety attack. This has never happened before and now I‚Äôm terrified of it happening again. The slightest bit of anxiety and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh no I‚Äôll be sick‚Äù.

Hi !! For background I suffer with anxiety ocd and panic attacks. Since I went through a traumatic experience in the new year my anxiety has worsened and I have started to feel a new symptom that is a tight throat/choking feeling but it only happens for a split second or so and can happen one after the other. I can‚Äôt work out if it happens because I‚Äôm having a panic attack or I‚Äôm having a panic attack because it happens. It does cause my stress because I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs my heart. I have had ecgs before that are normal. Does anyone else suffer from the same thing?,4,anxiety

"Hello there, I doubt most people will read this but it never hurts to let some thoughts out. For starters, I apologize if there‚Äôs any poor grammar in this post,English class wasn‚Äôt my best subject. I have been in this world for 19, almost 20 years and the sad thing is, I still live with my parents, I‚Äôve never been in a relationship, and I have little to no friends to speak of. It‚Äôs been like this my whole life and it‚Äôs constantly fucked with my mind since. One reason is that I‚Äôm a little on the fat side and I know people look down on those type of people but I am working on that, it is however a very slow process that I am aware of. Another reason is my looks, I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit that I am ugly and that I will always be this way, no matter what. One more thing is that I have a certain condition I don‚Äôt want to reveal but let‚Äôs just say it makes me harder to connect with others, especially on a personal level (yes I do know it‚Äôs not an excuse but I felt like I wanted to point that out). Because of my circumstances, my mental state has been going down hill since about high school and I really don‚Äôt tell people, not even my family cause what‚Äôs the point, they‚Äôll just tell me the cliches like ‚Äúit‚Äôll be alright‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here for you‚Äù and that never really fixes anything. What doesn‚Äôt help was the my high school is full of rich stuck up white trash brats who think they‚Äôre better then everyone else, and I mean EVERYONE. Not only that but if I tried to talk to someone, they would just silently respond to me and move on to what they were talking about with their friends and completely forget what I said. Those 4 years of high school were the worst of my life mentally but not academically since I managed to ace a majority of my classes but I was so depressed, there were times I would sneak into my stepfathers safe and just contemplate on grabbing one of his pistols, loading it, and just finally ending this still pathetic and worthless life I live. If people saw me and the life I‚Äôve lived they would think ‚Äúwhy is this guy complaining? He‚Äôs got what most people wish they had.‚Äù Yes I will admit I am very fortunate in life because of the great decisions my mother and stepfather have made and I am very grateful for that. To those who have that exact thought, I do agree with you, why should I complain about my life and when so many others are having it worse than others me. Who am I to complain when I have food, clothes, a roof over my head, and a ok paying job. But I my mind, there‚Äôs no point of living a good life, if there isn‚Äôt anyone else to share it with. I do have people around me but it‚Äôs a very small number. My mom and stepdad won‚Äôt tell it to my face, but they want me gone, my dad is barley around and while he is a nice guy for the most part, he lives a very poor lifestyle and will end up dead sooner or later, and last but not least are my grandparents on my dads side, they don‚Äôt have much time and I don‚Äôt see them as much as I want to. I love the people around me but I‚Äôm selfish enough to say that it is t enough, I wish there were some people out there who could understand me and some girl to see me as a charming and caring guy and not some fat ugly slob of a loser who has no one. I will always cherish the great things my family has done for me but I always feel like a burden and that if I were gone, people would just forget about me and move on but I wanna fell like there‚Äôs till hope for me and that my life with take a huge turn. Thank you for those who managed to read the ramblings of a man with little worth in life.

"I'm an 18 yr old female and I just went to Walmart to grab some swim goggles. On my way into the store a man, probably double my age stopped me by saying ""Excuse me miss, you dropped something."" I'm not wearing any clothing with pockets and only have my bag so I know I can't possibly have dropped anything, I ask ""what did I drop?"" before he said ""My phone number."" 

This wasn't really all that creepy but he asks for my number and just keeps saying ""you look nice,"" and all that. There weren't any people in the aisle and I didn't want to tell this man no without somewhere to go, so I pulled out my phone and he read his number, asked if I was single (no) and what I was doing today. He must have seen my phone background because it's my boyfriend, to which he says ""oh, a white boy? you don't like black men?"" (he was black). I say something about him being the only one I've loved so far. Apparently the part of my brain that should have gone into panic mode and lied about anything it could have decided to shut down because I blatantly told him I'm going swimming today, to which he pointed out the swim trunks I didn't notice in my anxiety driven state. He proceeded to say ""tell him you're sick, come swim with me,"" and ""swim with me tomorrow then,"" and kept pestering me to join him. I kept awkwardly laughing and just saying stuff like ""no, I don't think so, not today,"" before he puts his arms out and asks for a hug. I was so scared I just gave the man a hug and he proceeded to walk away saying ""message me, really."" 

I immediately turned around and walked towards where I was originally headed, took a glance at the swim stuff, and immediately left. I'm so paranoid, I don't know. I just feel like he did something or put something on me. I took the longest way to where I was headed so I could make sure all the cars behind me completely cycled and nobody was following me. I'm horrified and waiting until I can see my boyfriend because he'll make me feel better, but I can't shake this horrible feeling.",5,paranoia

"Idk if this is considered paranoia but I needed somewhere to put this. Today I (M) was at my girls house and everything was good as per usual and I left, as usual now bear in mind I‚Äôve walked this way home around 50 -60 times and never experienced anything like this it‚Äôs about a 1.5 mile walk takes me around 30 minutes. As I‚Äôm walking out of my girlfriends block of houses I start to hear like a quite deep sobbing sound almost of that of a middle age woman. I shrug it off and continue walking, as I‚Äôm walking by the school near her house I then start to hear the sobbing again, this time  much higher pitched also this time I actually heard it as if I could pinpoint where it was coming from whereas last time I could only pinpoint a general direction. While I‚Äôm hearing this a man comes out and starts walking his dog and continues paying no attention at all to what I‚Äôm hearing. I continue walking but now I start doubting myself so I start videoing and cannot hear it in the video I took. As I‚Äôm walking I‚Äôm growing more and more scared so I phone my friend and at which point I now hear the voice again this time it was humming some sort of tune in a lower tone it was humming the song of one of those old music boxes. So I kept walking and at this point I start running in attempt to lose this voice but when I stopped running (about half a mile from where I‚Äôd first heard it) I started hearing the sobbing again and I was getting really freaked out and felt like this thing was following me. I continued running and got to about (a mile from where I‚Äôd first heard it) and thought I‚Äôd lost it. I then heard the sobbing again from a garden near me and sprinted again right up into a housing estate where I could no longer hear the noise. I then got to me house (1.5 miles away from where I first heard the noise) and while I was waiting on my little brother to answer the door I heard it for one more time before entering my house I don‚Äôt know what to think of this do I need peoples opinion on what I should do.",5,paranoia

"I wish I could understand what keeps people going. I mean, there's absolutely zero meaning to life for me, I know most people do think life has a meaning and I respect that, but if you think about it, it doesn't matter if life was terrible or perfect, it all ends someday, even if you leave something for people to remember you, it does not matter as you won't be there to see it.

I used to be happy when I was a kid, but as I grew older everything started to seem so pointless. I started hating everything and everyone. Now I'm not so hateful like then, but the deep sadness is still with me. I used to be afraid of death, but now it's what I think about the most, my own death.

Me and my family changed states, we live closer to our relatives, I have a job close to my home, I now have a dog that I love, my first dog ever. I do love my family and we get along. But I can't ever feel satisfied, I'm on medication for anxiety and depression, which in the start of treatment they helped, but now after a bit more than a year I feel like I'm not on meds at all.

I'm always thinking that I should try exercising, studying something to maybe get a better job in the future, but I can never bring myself to make these changes, it's just so pointless. I struggle with suicide thoughts almost everyday, if something goes wrong at work or at home I feel terrible and just give up for the day.

I've been wanting to give up on this job for a long time now (I've been working there for 3 years), but I know that I won't find a better job still close to home and with an OK pay like I have now, I only finished high school and did a few short term courses so I could start working, and my bosses have been very patient with me, even though I'm as slow as a slug, I wish they would fire me already but I don't think they will. I work with heavy machinery, and I have already hurt myself on purpose once there, but what I actually want is to just crush my head in that machine for once and never have to wake up again.

You know, I just wish I could endure life, because in the future my parents and my brother who is disabled may need my help. But after they're gone, after I've served my purpose on this planet, I will finally have the guts to kill myself and truly rest. The only thing keeping me from ending it now is my family.

She is on vacation and I‚Äòm too (we didn‚Äôt travel together). She called me yesterday at 5am to tell me that she dreamed about cheating on me. She called me in her dream to tell me. She also said that she was into it while she was asleep. She felt guilty and all of that. I know that she can‚Äôt influence her dreams, so she is not the one to blame.

"I have been the victim of several instances of children / teenage boys seeing me and accusing me of racism. The first instance I was out at about 8 or 9 pm, sitting in a chair outside eating a burrito. A group of boys came out of a shop nearby and immediately one of them yelled ‚Äúwhat is he doing out? Doesn‚Äôt he know it‚Äôs too late for him to be out?‚Äù He then took out his phone and started yelling for his other friends to come over while saying ‚Äúthis guy attacked me!‚Äù They came out and asked what I did (I was about 20 feet away and never saw the boy or said anything to him before in my life). He responds ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, haha, just who he is I guess! They‚Äôre kind isn‚Äôt supposed to be outside this late!‚Äù 

I was sitting looking at my burrito and glancing back at the boy as he yelled. I didn‚Äôt say anything or move. Eventually they left me alone but the incident startled me.

Last week at Whole Foods, I was looking at pizza. Out of the corner of my eye I looked over and a five year old girl was holding up her hand like an imaginary gun shooting at me. 

Today I was at the park walking my dog. I was going to throw a bag of dog poop away and two boys were on the bench nearby. One of them had a skateboard and he loudly popped it against the ground. Startled and beaten down from months of threats and intimidation, I looked down at the ground. Then I heard him say ‚Äúyeah!‚Äù He was staring right at me with hatred in his eyes. I felt like he was purposely threatening me. Trying not to give in to fear, I looked back up at him and threw the dog poop away. Then I walked off with my pup. My dog walks slow and makes lots of potty breaks so as he did one I turned around to see the boy with the skateboard taking pictures of me. He then started to complain to his friend how ‚Äúthey will say he‚Äôs just walking his dog.‚Äù And how ‚Äúhard it is to get this guy‚Äù. 

I am very afraid that the younger generation is learning to weaponize their phone against anyone they don‚Äôt like. All they have to do is threaten or insult the person, then whip out their phone and film the anger. It‚Äôs so easy to make anyone look like the bad guy, and you have no proof that they insulted you or threatened you for no reason. 

Why don‚Äôt I take out my own phone? Is it fear that holds me back from filming them in response? Stupidity? My PTSD silences me. In the moment I cannot speak, which is probably why I am still alive and free. But I am afraid they will come for me soon. 

I‚Äôm making this statement now, trying to raise awareness. If anyone is out there, be careful around children who may be entrapping you by inciting anger or rage in you. They want you mad, they want to film it happening, and they want to pretend that they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong so that you take all the blame. 

At this point, I feel that I am a victim of serious abuse. I am suffering regular mental breakdowns and fear for my life. I just want to be left alone. I just want peace and quiet. I don‚Äôt know what caused all this rage and anger, and I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm the target of it, but at this point it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter.",5,paranoia

I know people are gonna say ‚Äúoh I know guys who are bald and do well with girls‚Äù or something like that but those guys are clearly the exception, not the rule. Not everyone looks good bald. Some guys are pale and have weird shaped heads like me and it just sucks. I‚Äôve tried the hair loss meds but they cause a lot of sides. Finasteride is really good at preventing hair loss but it definitely causes major sides, especially sexual sides.

"I‚Äôve been depressed for the past 11 years, and I‚Äôve had many people (mostly schoolmates) point out that I looked angry/miserable. Yet, no one in my family has ever asked if I‚Äôm ok. If I attached a quick selfie of myself to this post to show my general facial expression, all of you would agree that it‚Äôs obvious. In fact, it‚Äôs so obvious that I‚Äôm actually incredibly self conscious about it. I cannot leave the house or be around other people without worrying incessantly about how I‚Äôm coming across to people. 

I suppose it‚Äôs maybe my fault for not bringing up my issues often, but then again it isn‚Äôt because I‚Äôve talked about it a few times in the past without success. Most of what I say gets undermined. I already have a very difficult time asking for help (regardless for what), it takes A LOT of courage for me to make myself vulnerable to people in person. It‚Äôs part of the reason why I ventilate on Reddit so often. If the only place I feel comfortable doing so. 

I‚Äôm going through one of the most stressful moments in my entire 11 year history with depression right now. No one seems to give a damn. I‚Äôm literally on my own here. I get that people are busy with their own problems, so not many people would want to hear me ventilate. But the fact that everyone around me refuses to address the elephant in the room and pretend that everything is fine annoys me.

Then, I developed an eating disorder and became underweight ( can we even call it an ED tho ? I was obese, some of it was needed) . I felt a bit more confident at first , bit eventually it wore out, I was just as depressed as before . Still, no one was interested in me. The ones who congratulated my weight loss were all girls . I tried making the first step, all of my 3 attempts were rejected . I felt ashamed: how could I even think of going out with someone, didn‚Äôt I look in the mirror to see how ugly I am ? Those guys were probably looking for someone better, why would they settle for me ?

Now, I developed binge eating disorder. I already gained half of my weight back. I am more depressed than ever. I keep fighting and fighting but I just want to give up . Call me selfish , but I just want someone to like me, romantically, and not in a friend way . But the sad truth is that will probably never happen. My chances of finding someone keep getting slimmer as binge eating takes over my life . 

And I know, I know, love has many forms , not just romantic blah blah . Obviously, I love my parents and my sister, I could sacrifice everything for them and I am SO thankful to have them, because not everyone is blessed with a family . 

But I don‚Äôt know, I just want to experience being in a relationship. Don‚Äôt ask my why. I have no idea either .

"I am a first year university student looking to make a campaign ad/film concerning paranoia and the importance of reaching out to someone when in need of support.

The story follows a woman as she tries to find the source of a constant banging noise in her house and a figure that follows her around by appearing in places around her. The idea is to use the figure as a way to represent her stress personified and the banging noise is meant to be an auditory hallucination.

In the end she calls up a friend and all the rising stress comes to a stop as she briefly vocalises her emotions to her.

I am afraid of coming off as tone deaf and insensitive/misrepresenting the struggles people with Paranoia face. I apologize beforehand if the idea is crass or inaccurate, it is not from a place of malice, but rather from a lack of understanding.

"hey i have this problem for a while now i get up and every time i get out of bed i have no motivation to do anything that day. Let's say it's the day before and I say I'll do it etc and then the next day I don't do it anyway. 
I'll start by saying that a year ago my boyfriend proposed to me to do OF and at first it was going well and then at the beginning of the new year I made big progress upwards with OF. That year I really enjoyed taking pictures on instagram and OF and generally staying in and doing something to develop it. Now, in February, my grandfather suddenly passed away and it really upset me because I didn't expect it at all and I was left with just my uncle and my grandmother, who has had 2 strokes and is very forgetful, which makes me very sick of her because she is really annoying a lot of the time. After this death I started to have some strange depressing moments more and more often. My boyfriend was very supportive of me in these moments and even came to the funeral. Since the funeral I have been in a very bad mood at home, complaining about everything all the time, worrying that without my grandfather's pension we won't be able to make a living and arguing with my uncle much more often. He has often threatened to punch me in the face, to throw me out of the house even though I am still a student. I am still studying, but I am finishing school in June and I am going to move to my boyfriend's town (he is studying 300 kilometres away from my town). Since I've been in such a gloomy mood at home, I can see for myself that I'm constantly depressed and generally don't want to spend time at home, because it's really hard to cope with my family since the death. In March I was in a better mood after I had done a lot better in the OF and it gave me a real chance to go far in it and my boyfriend and I were very happy with these achievements. In April I did not do so well in the OF and then I started to fight more often with my boyfriend, among other things when he wanted to take me on a bike and I had forgotten how to ride because it had been a long time since I had ridden a bike. Out of stress I didn't even want to go on the bike anymore and I stayed in the room alone while he went rollerblading. Later he told me a lot that he was disappointed in me because, as he said, 'you don't forget to ride a bike'. He also told me that I was restricting him a lot with the bike. Then my mental state started to deteriorate. I had more thoughts about everything and was generally depressed. Now I still have the OF, but my boyfriend helps me less and I have no motivation, my family is still depressing, I feel unwell at home, I have no motivation to do anything useful, I have no one to whom I can talk about my problems, I hear from my boyfriend that if I go to the gym, etc., it will make me feel better, but I know that it will not.
I wish I had the enthusiasm to do things I enjoyed doing again like I used to and not spend all day crying in bed and wondering about the meaning of my existence. I feel like my boyfriend is cutting and rude to me. I would like to be motivated and get up and do something on social media on OF etc because I want to develop myself but I feel sucked out of any desire to do so. I don't know how to help myself anymore.",2,depression

"
So a few nights ago I had a bit of a headache but thought nothing of it, I get headaches pretty often. All of a sudden thought I had this crushing sensation in my head like it was being squeezed, and then when I went to move my head it felt difficult and I had intense pain shoot behind my eyes unlike any headache pain I‚Äôve had before. It freaked me out and I ended up phoning NHS24 (UK‚Äôs 24 hour health hotline) to describe it to them and ask if they thought I should go to the hospital. They told me if the pain subsided after those few seconds and pain relief helped I should be fine, which put my mind at ease a bit. 

The next day I didn‚Äôt even think about it whatsoever really, but yesterday I was back to work and halfway through my shift I started getting pain in my chest, struggling to catch my breath, tingling in my limbs and around my lips, feeling faint, nauseous and extremely agitated. My mind instantly jumped to that headache a couple of nights before and I started convincing myself I was gonna die and that I‚Äôd had a bad brain bleed and that the symptoms had been delayed. I felt so on edge and looking back irrationally anxious. It was mild as far as I‚Äôve seen panic attacks go, and I might be an anxious person, but I‚Äôve never had a real panic attack hit like that.

I told my parents and they sounded concerned but told me there was nothing physically wrong with me. I phoned the doctor‚Äôs today and when I described just the symptoms, without mentioning that I thought it was a panic attack, the receptionist‚Äôs immediate response was ‚Äòyou need to go to the hospital‚Äô. I explained that I thought yesterday was a panic attack rather than physical (although I have no way of knowing this for sure and don‚Äôt trust my panicked opinion at the time and so would have loved a doctor‚Äôs opinion), and she is instantly changed her tune and told me I‚Äôd have to wait a couple of days for an appointment, because if it is anxiety it isn‚Äôt urgent enough.

I feel like I‚Äôm going insane. Last night I almost had another panic attack cause I‚Äôm so hyper aware of my body now and it feels so weird. I know I might be irrational but I‚Äôm not worried for nothing here am I? Sure, panic attacks make you have crazy thought loops, but the crazy headache and crushing, followed by chest pain, limb numbness, trouble breathing, etc. a couple of days later with no previous experience of panic attacks is objectively concerning. Like yes, I might not be thinking straight and it‚Äôs hard for me to have an unbiased opinion, and it‚Äôs probably about a 99% chance that I just had a panic attack, but i don‚Äôt like how my symptoms are clearly concerning and seem to just be putting down to a panic attack with little follow up just because I mentioned the anxiety possibility. I already felt like I was going crazy from my panic attack and it doesn‚Äôt help that everyone‚Äôs acting like I‚Äôm unhinged for wanting to take precautions with my health when weird out of character shit starts happening to me.",4,anxiety

"My wife has depression and I'm always trying to learn and support anyway I can. A common issue we run into is that she can let very minor things totally de-rail her day.

The only thing I've seen work so far as a solution is to just talk out whatever the situation was about and give her space until she can bounce back and then she'll come to me when she's over it. This solution is ok but depending on the bounce back time can take 20 mins or sometimes up to 24hrs for something bigger.

Some moments I'm so stuck thinking about the past and the future that I don't feel like myself anymore, I feel like I'm living my life in third person. And more than everything else I really feel alone: I'm almost 19 and I never experienced real love and almost no relationships. I think that this affects my situation in a major way, because even though often times I like being alone (especially during one of those ""high"" moments), during these worse moments from the first second I'm left alone it's like my mind falls in a black hole of negative thoughts and the spiral begins.

I sometimes wonder if therapy would help, but being that I've been in it most of my teenage years and it never helped then, although I was told to keep quiet about home life in fear that they would take me away from my guardians. It's also an issue financially for me to even start therapy. 

I just really don't like who I am, I act on impulses often, I have full on break downs, I have no close friends. I struggle to even form sentences its just like a running dialog of negativity. I try to do things that might make me happy and can only focus for a few minutes until the numb feeling over takes me again and forces me to just curl up in bed and replay every time I've been a shitty person.",2,depression

"Hey guys,

my anxiety hit me again after having a somewhat calm phase.

Now I'm dealing with feelings of intense breathlessness and the fear of passing out or suffering damage from low oxygen levels.

During those moments I check my oxygen levels and they fluctuate quite a lot, jumping back and forth between 95 and 98%. Sometimes even dipping even lower than 95% for a few moments.

When I'm somewhat calm my oxygen levels are kinda steady around 98%, only sometimes dipping to 97, 96ish and quickly getting back up again.

Not quite 2 years ago I had an X-ray done, when having similar symptoms, with the report showing no acute pathological findings. 

Went to the pulmonologist who told me my lungs look fine.

And here I am still breaking my had over those oximeter readings, thinking there might be something serious going on, and maybe low oxygen is triggering my anxiety.

Anyone else notice oximeter readings going 'bad' when you are anxious? 

Thanks in advance guys",4,anxiety

"So I‚Äôve been on geodon for over a year now and when I first started taking it I didn‚Äôt sleep for two days. Eventually I got more used to it and had a sleep schedule going but as of late every night is a struggle to fall asleep. What‚Äôs your best advice to get to bed at a reasonable time every night and actually sleep properly?

Before I was on medication I would be asleep by 10 and then I was in latuda and it would knock me out quick. But now no matter what I try I just don‚Äôt get tired. 

I‚Äôm on cyprohedtadine for sleep but it‚Äôs not making me tired it‚Äôs only helping with my nightmares. I‚Äôve tried melatonin and that only works sometimes. I tried not getting on my phone or watching tv last a certain time. I‚Äôve tried reading before bed. It just seems to be random when I get tired no matter what I try. The only thing I haven‚Äôt tried is getting out of bed at the same time everyday no matter what. I guess I will try that out tomorrow as I have somewhere to be in the morning but I‚Äôm running out of ideas. 

After school gets out my doctor said I soils take my pm meds at an earlier time so hoping that works. But when I was trying to figure out a time that worked for taking my meds it took forever and I felt awful and life sucked back then. Maybe now that I‚Äôm more used to it it will affect me less. I sure hope that works.",6,schizophrenia

"Hey guys, I‚Äôm writing this as best as I can because I still feel fragmented- like right and left are not connected- in my body or in the world. I don‚Äôt use drugs a lot. I guess you could say all the ‚Äúweed and mushrooms are the new frontier and they will cure everything‚Äù talk got to me. A yer ago I tried a very small dose of weed edibles. I had a full on psychedelic experience where I was stuck in a time loop, nothing was real and time stopped making sense. I had what i now realize is a psychotic break. A year later I still wasn‚Äôt recovered. 
This weekend, stupidly, I did mushrooms. I believed all that talk about expanding drugs, how they can only help you, etc. it was even worse. I felt full on fragmentation, I could only talk in the third person referring to myself. I can‚Äôt even say it was myself talking, I truly was other people. Even now I feel my left and right brain as separate entities. I experiences the worst and deports terror I could possibly imagine, with no way out. No solution. 
It also confused me even more about time. I‚Äôm screaming still whenever I have to think of any temporal concept, time is sideways now. It makes no sense. I can‚Äôt function. I feel like I‚Äôm not here, time isn‚Äôt here, it doesn‚Äôt go forward. It‚Äôs all jumbled. 
I regret doing this. My brain is broken now forever. Do you feel this time perception with schizophrenia? I don‚Äôt have schizophrenia but when I was in college even smoking a little bit made me entirely paranoid, which is why I lost interest in drugs for my adult life. Fuck, even typing this the timeline doesn‚Äôt make sense of being in college then later then now.",6,schizophrenia
" 

Back story: I used to work at a small independent grocery store. There was a man Tim (not his real name) who was a regular customer. He was creepy guy, I don‚Äôt have anything specific to say why, he just gave me the creeps the way sometimes people do. At some point he applied for a job at the store. After he was passed over for the job, he became somewhat of a nuisance to management. He would regularly visit the store and talk to the owner, or the meat department manager, trying to convince them to hire him. I was also a manager and, one day, I saw a letter he had written to the owner, begging him to give him a chance and hire him. It was in this letter that I learned the reason they wouldn‚Äôt hire him. He had a criminal record that involved theft at a former workplace. 

Fast forward, I no longer work at the store. I quit two years ago. The weird thing is that I keep seeing Tim. I see him at the grocery store, walking on the sidewalk as I drive by, in a vehicle that I pass while driving. One of the weirder encounters was when I placed a curbside pick-up order at McDonalds and Tim was the person that brought the order out to my car. I live in a meduim-ish populated town (about 60K people) It feels weird that I keep seeing this guy. Why do you all think?",5,paranoia

"Hello,

I am curious about what I am experiencing. I have been diagnosed with PTSD but I question this diagnosis, as I do not experience flashbacks, intrusive memories, etc. What I do experience, periodically, is high sensitivity under certain states.

This could mean that yes, fireworks, loud vehicles and so on alarm me. However I also have been convinced at times someone will break into my apartment at night, that someone will follow me or attack me while walking from my car, or even that someone is following me while I am driving if they take the same roads.

Lately I've been worried my doctors have given me sugar pills and that they do not believe me about my health related symptoms. I am on lamotrigine (for MDD and PTSD) and I am on levothyroxine (for thyroid, mostly controlled). I almost stopped taking these meds. I am almost at the point of ghosting my medication professionals (I have this habit).

I am worried my former best friend may be stalking me online, so I keep creating new reddit accounts to try and remain anonymous. I still have the feeling I am being tracked. I continuously worry about my phone/search history being monitored.

My doctors first told me I am bipolar, now I am apparently not. Fine. I don't want to be bipolar. Honestly I feel like selling almost everything I own, taking off, cutting contact with everyone and finding a way to live in the woods. I hate society and I know I could build someone for myself.

"Hi, I don‚Äôt know how to continue with my life. 
A bit of contest here. 
I‚Äôm 21f and I was diagnosed with depression in the last months by my therapist. I always had depressing thoughts during my life and also some suicidal ones but I‚Äôve never ever done anything in the concrete, I think I was too scared (just one time I tried to take a lot of meds together but I stopped and asked for help). 
I never considered myself ill, nor everyone around me. I have the perfect family and I live in a privileged contest, middle class kind (not rich but I always had what I wanted). Others think I‚Äôm a pretty girl, skinny and very gifted in social contests, outgoing, always first in my classes with fantastic grades, not very good at sports but it‚Äôs not important. I‚Äôm very empathetic and always had some kind of ‚Äúperception of the deepness‚Äù around me, and my therapist says it‚Äôs a gift. I write, sing, and have too many hobbies including gaming, reading, painting and so on. I‚Äôm the gifted kid of the extended family and the good girl type, that did something rebel only one or two times. Now I study history and work as an emergency rescuer. I have tons of friends in real life and also online. I wanna be a writer.
I have the perfect life, I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôm so lucky and I just don‚Äôt understand why I am ‚Ä¶ I am depressed. I know I had problems in my growing. I was the loser, always bullied by everyone and against me there was intellectual and actual violence. I had to be always perfect because of my parents and my family, I am the first of the grandchildrens and so I‚Äôm the role model. At 19 I had a toxic relationship that leaved me with the fear of love and also a little stomach sindrome caused by anxiety, but never less, I didn‚Äôt have a real trauma. A REAL one like a bad family or rape or something like that. I always been dark and sad all my life and i know that when I was a child I was so happy and a little overwhelming so others will call me ‚Äústrange‚Äù or ‚Äúfreak‚Äù but I was so innocent and wanted the friendship of all of them. (I want to return to be that happy, like a child.)but this was never something like real real trauma.
Now I‚Äôm here, trapped in my bed every time I return from work. When I am at work I am someone that is happy and I help others and fight in very difficult situation but when i return home I just turn off. The worse thing it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm numb every time, also when I am happy at work. I worsened in the last weeks and I‚Äôm trying to don‚Äôt see my friends and it‚Äôs working. I have a deadline for my university studies soon and I didn‚Äôt study. I feel useless and I hate so much myself. I hate the way I look, the way I act, the way I think and the way I am. I hate every inch of my being in this world. I want to see my self being wrong and fall into the deep end. I love my friends and I will do anything for them, they deserve the world and I want to cancel myself for them. Right now I have only two girl friends that I try to be in contact with but three days ago I messed up over a very stupid thing because I panicked and with my anxiety I didn‚Äôt responded to them. Part of me don‚Äôt want to lose them but the other part knows I want to be alone cause I think I deserve to suffer, I deserve cause I‚Äôm an horrible person. I feel like an impostor that it‚Äôs acting all her life and everyone just sees the good things while I‚Äôm so horrible and selfish. My therapist it‚Äôs trying to convince me that it‚Äôs all in my head but I don‚Äôt believe her. I sincerely think I am a freak, a bad person, a sociopath of some kind. I don‚Äôt deserve the life I have and had , I don‚Äôt now why I had such a good childhood and I will happily switch it with someone more worth of my family and the ppl I have around me. I don‚Äôt deserve anything. Im wrong. And now my two bff are so angry with me, I tried to explain them I panicked and I wanted to write to them, not ignore them, but I didn‚Äôt have the courage because im so scared of the anger of others. If they go away how will I do? It will be the end? I‚Äôm not lucid, idk what is happening in me or around me I just wanna sleep all the time.

I feel like I‚Äôm about to start crying and punching shit but at the same time I can‚Äôt move. 

Im scared as shit right now and I feel like I‚Äôm being watched but I know it‚Äôs stupid but I have this feeling like something sinister  is going to happen. 

All week I‚Äôve had this feeling looming over me that something bad will happen, I brush it off as my anxiety but I feel like something is actually going to happen this time.

I don‚Äôt know if it makes sense and I don‚Äôt know how to explain it In words it‚Äôs just a feeling I get it‚Äôs like pure terror when it happens and I sit there and it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt breathe for a bit. 

My heart is beating so fast and I feel like I‚Äôm about to cry I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening but I‚Äôm fucking scared , I feel like something in the universe shifted and something is wrong. 

It‚Äôs been like this for a while it‚Äôs like one day somethint changed, I don‚Äôt know what it was but the world changed. 

At my old school I would have this same feeling and I would have to speed walk through the hallways so I wouldn‚Äôt start crying, it‚Äôs like everyone was staring at me.

"I‚Äôve been really really struggling with my job over the last couple months and it is bleeding over into all aspects of my life. Last year, I got a new job which is entirely WFH and sitting in front of a computer screen. I never have done remote work before and didn‚Äôt have to do Zoom university during COVID and it has destroyed all my focus and work ethic. I know how to do all the individual tasks, but my thoughts just race all day and it is literally exhausting. I‚Äôm crying writing this right now because it is so overwhelming.

I‚Äôve been having panic and anxiety during my workday now bc of my inability to prioritize my massive backlog of tasks, and I have been losing sleep, forgetting things more than usual (sometimes I‚Äôve always done during stress), and having GI issues. 

I set up a consult with a psychiatric NP today to hopefully get started finding help with medication. But I‚Äôm honestly terrified thinking about it and can‚Äôt focus on any work before my appointment. Can someone coach me before my first appointment? What can I expect for the appt and also for the first days/weeks on medication? I‚Äôve only ever taken SSRIs in the past.",3,adhd

I had a terrible headache the next day and I ended up at urgent care, they did a head ct all clear. Ended up feeling ok by Sunday had some wine and got to enjoy a concert. 
I've had a lingering headache on and off since and some pain in my neck. Im a bit anxious about a slow bleed. The dr wasn't super worried but of course she said there can be a slow bleed that we wouldn't know about until symptoms show up. Im unfortunately on a blood thinner so that made them initially worried to do the scan and just being on these pills have given me anxiety. Id love to get an idea when I can relax a bit more. I've been pretty nauseous since and I had a few moments of dizziness.  No one could give me a solid answer on when i could potentially be in the clear and and i keep questioning if i I need to go back and get yet another scan and im constsntly checking for symptoms and every headache or bout of nausea freaks me out.  Im now worried about too many scans and wasting my life in a hospital. I have camping trips this summer and I just know this anxiety from stuff like this will ruin it.

"Sometimes the mere thought of existing scares me. Or maybe life scares me. The uncertainty of life, the overwhelming possibilities, the fact that we could die at any given moment. Right now I don't know what to do with my life and I'm scared to figure it out (not that I know why). And I feel pressured to know what I'm doing but I don't. I get that most adults feel like this (I'm 21) but I feel like whatever I'm doing now just isn't good enough. But sometimes when I'm like ""I need to do something like move to a new state or just get out of my hometown"" I don't know where to start or if I can even make that happen. I've also been in and out of college but i dropped out because it was expensive and because I also have a full time job. So now i don't know how to get started with figuring out what I want to do or even how to get to where I want to be.

A lot of times it feels like my dreams I once had just get crushed under the weight of everything. Ive wanted to be so many things and one by one they all get crushed. I feel like I'm not good at a lot of things and that's part of the reason why I've had so many failures. I also get anxious about how life keeps marching on and I don't think I'm ready for many of the parts of life like losing my parents. I know no one is ""ready"" for that kind of thing but I've never been exposed to death (grandparents died before I was born, no close family) so I don't know what I'll do. 

I also get so scared because I'm in a relationship but I don't love him and he's not great and clearly doesn't love me but he's insisting on me living with him and marrying him but I don't want to. I don't know how to break up with him and I don't really want to lose him but I don't want to be with him either. And it scares me that I can end up having to spend the rest of my life with him. Or that things can go as far as marriage when I don't want that. He always tries to make his dreams into mine, and he never cares about what I want to do. I know he just wants a girlfriend, it doesn't matter who. He just wants someone pretty, he doesn't see me as a multifaceted human being. Whenever I try to tell him what I want he says stuff like ""I think I know what you want"". When he says stuff like that, I realize he knows nothing about me and he doesn't care to. I've never broken up with someone so I'm scared to do it. I also only have one friend and I'm really bad at making friends.",4,anxiety

"I know it‚Äôs an absolute clich√©‚Äî everyone wants to be young again, even if it‚Äôs for a day. It‚Äôs practically in our nature to cling to the past and miss the old days. 

But man, is it the most depressing thing (for me.) I‚Äôve struggled with depression for about 10 years or so, my therapists have attributed it to an after effect of anxiety. I‚Äôll momentarily have *up* weeks, but majority of the time‚Äî I‚Äôm depressed. It started because of a variety of other reasons, but recently it‚Äôs been nostalgia related.

I‚Äôm just turning 20, so I‚Äôm not far from my infantile days; I can still remember vivid details down to at least 3 years old. I‚Äôve been missing my little friends, the ignorant bliss, my grandparents (who‚Äôve passed), and it stings because it feels like more and more memories pop up every day.

Turning 20 has really given me a wake up call, I know I‚Äôm not old but I‚Äôm at most 1/5 through my life. It‚Äôs just crazy to suddenly realize: shit. Im really like UP here now. Im a genuine adult. 

I worry about future me missing the time that I‚Äôm spending right now, and all of the people that I‚Äôll inevitably miss. I live in constant fear and denial of loss. I‚Äôve recently tried meditation and practicing Buddhism, but it‚Äôs difficult for me to adhere to a genuine hobby or thought process. For the most part, my medication, therapy, and (as dumb as it sounds) philosophy have kept my spirits up.

I am a diagnosed autistic and I have been in services like special education and ABA therapy since I was young, however my parents didn‚Äôt really do any research outside of what professionals have told them and the basics and I‚Äôve had to teach them about meltdowns, stimming, masking etc and it‚Äôs exhausting. I am no way insinuating my parents are stupid but it‚Äôs low key kind of exhausting teaching them about things they honestly should‚Äôve already known about. I‚Äôm convinced they think autism is just little quirkiness with your brain but otherwise your like everyone else, which is not true. 

They think things like meltdowns are like toddlers having a tantrum and deny I have sensory issues at places like school and church and that I need to grow up and deal with responsibility.

It's most likely depression and burnout, but I don't know how to make it go away. I want to start making projects again, but the thought of making people dissapointed in me again is just too much, so I end up procrastinating everything.

"Hi

I don't know how to start this properly but I want to talk about me feeling like im nobody.

I am 23 years old and living in a big family of 18, i am number 15 in line. From childhood i got little to no parenting from my parents, not that they weren't amazing parents, they just did not know how to raise a child to have good routines. When i was a child i did not go to kindergarten, we had an aupair while my parents were working at their company. They were never strict on me brushing teeths or showering, they would tell me to do it. But as a child, if you don't want to do something then you don't do it unless you get forced to. 

So as i am in school, i would start to skip days because i felt like it had no consequences. Which then without me knowing made me the weird kid. I had my friends, that are still my friends to this day and are great. Anyways the reason i am bringing this up is because this didn't come to my attention before one of my friends told me that i used to be the weird kid. And then everything clicked, now i understand why no one ever had contact with me outside of school, it's because they wouldn't want to be seen with the weird kid. I never felt bullied, but more unnoticed. And that is how i still feel, because it's kind of true.

2 years ago i went on a work and travel program where you can live for free in another country by working for a company in that country. We were 10 guys and i felt like we had so much fun and i felt like i made so many new friends. After the 1 year of working had past, we had become somewhat close at least that's what i thought. You see, everyone was close except for me but i didn't know this. I found out about this by seing all the Happy Birthdays posts they made for each other on instagram. But no one ever made one for me, and i see that they are still hanging out. While even though i have contacted them, no one has ever reached out to me... Like i don't exist and so that is what started my feeling of being a nobody. 

I feel like no one remembers me after having a deep conversation or shared laughs. 

And i feel like i haven't accomplished anything in my life. And i know im not dumb, i passed with top grades in school and have an iq of 120 according to mensa. It's just the feeling of nobody will ever remember me that weighs me down. 

We have a family chat group and everytime someone has a birthday, everyone congratulates people, and compliments them with 'Thanks for always showing up when we need something'. Meanwhile i haven't got a single meaningful comment like everything i do for my siblings or how much i care about them which i try to show them by coming visiting them. Its like they don't remember.

Right now we are doing carpentry work at the family cabin, and i hear ""Great work sibling!"" And i have a lot of carpentry experience so i was making the kitchen but all i got was complaining (from one of my brothers) all though everything i did was by the book and looks nice. 

And then he said a comment to me that made me absolutley resent him. He said you are just pretending to know how to do carpentry, while i put my heart and soul in to that project. And hadn't boasted anything about stuff i knew. It was so painful to hear that i felt physical discomfort. No one has ever expressed that they appreciate me. And i feel like i can't talk to them about feeling unappreciated.

Feeling like a nobody is draining and very deeply sad. 

I think the reason i feel like i haven't accomplished me is because i have never been recognised. And not being recognised also leads to lack of motivation.

Anyways thanks for reading my messy post, i will gladly take any advice or other thoughts on the subject.",2,depression

My grades are doing awful because I kept procrastinating and struggled to keep up with work. My motivation is so low it feels impossible to get started. Today I tried to finish a project today removing my phone so I won‚Äôt get distracted and sat near my teacher to stay on task. I just sat there for an hour struggling to do something. I could not focus at all my mind was going back and forth between reality and daydreaming. I kept moving and messing with my hair desperately wanting to do something but just couldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs bad enough my mom is on my back about this. She says she‚Äôs willing to do anything so I won‚Äôt stress her out about school anymore but she won‚Äôt let me on medication.

"I want to start by saying a few things. I genuinely don't understand my mom or what could possibly be going on in her brain to make her think and act this way. Also, please don't comment anything like ""why don't you talk to her about how that makes you feel?"" I can't. she doesn't ever listen to me and brushes off my feelings all the time. Either that or she'll somehow turn the blame on me and make herself the victim of the situation, claiming that I don't understand her struggles, or that I'm just trying to accuse her of false things to make her look or feel bad, or go on about how she could never make me feel that way because she ""loves me"".

so, back to the original point of this post. 
i have diognised ADHD and suspected/undiagnosed high-masking autism. 
damn near every single time I try to bring up something that I struggle with or cannot do (because I'm neurodivergent), she always says something like ""you just forgot how to"" or ""you need to teach yourself how to do that"" or even ""just ignore it"" ""just stop.""
one of the main things is that I have time blindness. she just keeps telling me to learn better. and then she guilt trips me and lectures me about how if I don't learn to manage my time better, I'll never get anywhere in life, that I'll constantly be losing jobs and be excluded from social groups because I'm always late. great. thanks for that, mom. 
I cannot control my time blindness. time feels very different for me than what most others feel (I think). 5 minutes can feel like 1. 2 hours can feel like 30 minutes. I cannot estimate time or how long something will take me. that is not something that my brain do, I cannot fix that.
I also struggle to complete and turn in homework on time. she just tells me to stop doing that and try harder. that I need to ""stop making excuses"" and ""stop using your ADHD as an excuse, it's not"". she's right, it's not an excuse, it's a reason.
another time I recall is when we were out somewhere, it was outside, and there were powerlines over the place. my biggest sensory issue is auditory, mainly loud and/or high-pitched sounds. The powerlines were buzzing, they were so loud and bothered me so much. I could hear them no matter where I went. I was starting to become closed off, visibly upset, angry and irritable. my mom told me to stop just ignore the buzzing and just ""pretend"" to have a good time and stop wrecking the mood for everyone else. she even got mad at me when I tried putting in my headphones and listening to music to calm myself down. 
another time, when i was having a meltdown over a ""prank"" that she pulled on me. she refused to apologize, turned my lights on, made me take my blankets off my head and take my headphones out. she got really angry and told me to ""get over it"" and ""stop living in the moment"" or ""stop feeling bad for myself"". 
this has happened a few other times recently. she said the same thing to me both times. one was me telling her how I cannot recognize my body's signals (such as hunger). the other time was when I told her that I struggle with volume regulation and often talk too quietly without realizing it at all. she told me that I just ""need to learn that skill"". I just wish she would understand that I can't. my brain doesn't work that way.

another thing, I feel like she tries to ""relate"" to me but it just comes off as ableist to me. there's been several instances where she has said to me ""I get distracted sometimes, I think I might have ADHD too."" 
I'm like 90% sure she doesnt, but my dad does (diognosed), so I know that's where mine came from. 

I'm just fed up with this.",1,autism

I have no choice but to wait,
For the silence to overcome me,
I must accept my fate.
This darkness feels so inviting,
The comfort of it all,
I should get up and soldier on,
But again I choose to fall.

This feels so fucking familiar,
Its become my favorite place,
I tell myself I'll be okay,
As tears run down my face.
I know that I should fight it,
But instead I embrace the pain,
Knowing one day I'll find the strength,
To face the world again.

Suddenly there is no more silence, 
As torturous screams fill the air,
I constantly look over my shoulder,
But darkness is all that is there.
My demons are coming for me,
Please dont let them take me away,
I promise that i will do better,
I'll try harder and harder each day.

I'm screaming for help, can you hear me?
I know I cant do this alone,
Please bring some light to guide me,

for the record, i (17F) recently graduated high school and is going to college this year. i'm healthy aside from cptsd and chronic gerd

yesterday i was in the car with my family on my way home from a neighbor's wedding and an ambulance passed by

fast forward to last night and i had a dream where my friends and i were just hanging out where all of a sudden an ambulance went by. not long after that, we heard a death announcement and the name they said was mine (though they pronounced my name wrong). we all looked so confused, and then we saw one of our teachers standing across from us. we then ran towards her and screamed saying how they got the name wrong. she then calls out towards the people announcing... and then i woke up at 4am

idk this all feels sooo weird. i'm not religious at all but looking thru the interpretations according to ibn sirin just fuels my anxiety even more...

"I came to the realization today when I heard a story about neck injuries. When I was about 14 or 15, I went to a church retreat. They had bouncy houses and a bunch of games to play. One of the bouncy houses was an obstacle course where you can race another person to the end. The house started out having you crawl though some obstacles until you got to a climbing wall thing. At the time of the event I had really long hair, like mid waist almost hip length hair. My hair was in a low ponytail also. We begin the race and as soon as I try to crawl past the second obstacle I step on my pony tail and wrench my neck, it didn‚Äôt hurt but the sound my neck made is similar to someone getting their neck broken. I was stunned for a minute but continued on with the course.

From what I remember I continued my day and life after that with only minor neck pain. 

The thing I can‚Äôt stop thinking about is ever since that incident my life has changed, I developed depression along with a bunch of other mental health issues and my life was just weird.

I understand the age this happened to me could be caused by hormones and stuff but I talk to my therapist about that and she‚Äôs no help at all.

"Since I was young, I have constantly turned to the internet as a form of judgment of my character. The most important thing in my life (And still is today) is being a good person. And the only way to decipher who a ""Good person"" is, would be the majority of people online (Twitter, redder, any social media). And at 25 years old, I feel like I have failed that task.  
  
With this, I am in a constant state of guilt over my past actions. I constantly scour the internet, reading over other people's opinions on how they judge others in specific situations (Think about the comments reacting to a cancel culture scene). It makes me think, ""What if that were me?"". These people who have done bad things in the past are permanently exiled from communities; is there something I have done in my life that would get me canceled (Assuming I was an influencer)? It makes me sad thinking that even if they were to have changed and genuinely become amazing people, these past actions will forever label them as unredeemable.  
  
The most disheartening part of it all is reading about someone being compassionate for someone who is guilty of something, only to sprinkle on an ""Unless you did something REALLY bad, then you deserve the misery"". And of course, everyone has a different definition of something that is really bad or not‚Ä¶  
  
An example of this type of behavior would be Atrioc. Someone who for all intents and purposes, was a very stand-up citizen. Hundreds of thousands of people looked up to this gentleman, for it all to be stripped away from one mistake. Does all the good he has done, and all the good he will do in the future, not mean he is able to recover from one bad action that he regrets? Even if he came back in the future, I can assuredly see hundreds of people raising their pichforks in anger over his return.  
  
I am 25 now, with a decade of self-hatred. Every day it grows, knowing I have wasted a beautiful day on this planet being miserable. I want to feel better, and I want to be happy more than anything. But then I see posts of people who have made mistakes in the past, with people replying to them on how they don't deserve to be happy regardless of the good they do.  
  
Today my therapist had me choose if I wanted to continue our sessions. Asking if I truly thought I could envision myself improving, and wanting to improve. But as someone who is guilty of past actions, of course, I don't think that. Because I don't believe I deserve happiness. So, that was the end of it, and I have never felt so alone. I want to be happy, but that is a selfish thing to ask for someone who doesn't deserve it. So I won't beg for something I don't deserve. There are too many good people out there, who have never harmed anyone in the slightest, that deserve happiness over me  
  
.  
  
Even if someone does comment on this post with a kind-hearted message (Which I am sure someone will, as there are lots of wonderful people out there) it is much easier to be kind to someone when you don't know the full details. If I was a truly evil person, who did terrible things, would you still be as compassionate? Would you still think I deserve happiness? I am willing to bet the majority of people wouldn't. So why should I forgive myself?",4,anxiety

"For some context I was a pretty normal kid growing up until my parents got divorced when I was around 10. I felt like I needed to grow up for my mother who always had a hard time finding good men so I kind of acted like an adult sometimes even when I was young, and I think that cut off some of my childhood. When I was around 9 my dad got remarried to someone who seemed really nice but she is a selfish prick I learned as I continued to grow up in the house. My mom ended up getting into drugs pretty bad and I couldn‚Äôt see her for a few years in college. But I managed to graduate Highschool with a degree and almost a valedictorian, but not quite

So here‚Äôs where the story is. I just got back from college and suffice it to say that I messed up pretty bad my first year. I failed a bunch of classes because I ended up getting really sick in the second semester and once I got back to being able to go to classes I felt so far behind that I didn‚Äôt think I could keep going to classes. When I started to stop going I beat myself up for it because I felt like a disappointment to my parents. I finally got back from college a few days ago and I told my parents that I needed a gap semester for myself to figure out what I really want to do so I‚Äôm not just going to college to go to college. When I talked to them I talked about wanting to maybe explore the world a little bit while I‚Äôm still young and able to and my dad interjected ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how the world works‚Äù and that hit pretty hard because I‚Äôve always just taken everything that they say to me because every time I‚Äôve interjected I‚Äôve been grounded Or berated for expressing myself or an opinion. What my stepmom said to me was far worse in my opinion as she said ‚Äúyou know we co-signed that loan with you so if you don‚Äôt pay it we are the ones who get hosed‚Äù which really told me where her priorities with me were. My mom has been pretty supportive to me about this and she understands what I‚Äôm going through. I recently decided to move in with my mother because I don‚Äôt know if I can keep dealing with them. A little of a side note but my dad is basically telling me I have to get some 40 hr a week job by the end of the week, and I think that‚Äôs a little bit unfair because I‚Äôm still young, I want to hang out with my friends while I‚Äôm still young but they insist that I get a job, almost like they think I‚Äôm going to be a bum, as they would say

For the depression part is I think I have depression but I don‚Äôt want to just say that because I‚Äôve grown up in a household that isn‚Äôt really good with emotional sharing and while I was in college I had thoughts of suicide but I didn‚Äôt want people to deal with the gruesomeness of my corpse and I didn‚Äôt want to upset my mom.

"I asked for help in penis related subs and have been told to come here for advice. I hate my dick so much. I know I shouldn't think this much about it, but I can't help it for two reasons. 1.) I have absolutely no desire  to be alive and I'm repulsed by my body. I'm not being hard on myself when I say that I have zero reason to love my physical appearance. It causes me so much pain to think of how I'm trapped in this dumbass body for another 60-70 years. 2.) While most women wouldn't have issues with my size, I have no interest in having sex or being involved with anyone. I don't want a huge dick because I think I need it to satisfy others. I wish I was huge because it would bring me pleasure and enjoyment that I haven't really ever felt. Again, I know that women don't care too much about size, but I don't want to have sex. I stress this because people always tell me, ""Dude you are literally fine as long as you aren't micro or huge.""",2,depression
"Recently, I got into a minor fender bender as I was trying to park my car in for the night. It was slow speed, nobody got hurt and we both exchanged info so it was nothing out of the ordinary. After getting into contact with the other person, I find out they filed an insurance claim right away which I‚Äôll be the first to admit is a smart move.

However, after a bit of back and forth texting, told them that paying out of pocket would be better than dealing with insurance. They said they‚Äôd talk to their parents and get back to me which they did a day later and said that it would be ok to do that. So I called up my insurance and told them the situation. At this point, my anxiety really shut off because I won‚Äôt have to worry about a mark on my record and paying extra money for insurance for years.

Fast forward to today, they tell me they talked to someone else now they want to go through insurance. I had already called my insurance and told them to cancel the claim after confirming with that person that we were going to settle this on our own. Now they go back on their word and I‚Äôve been trying to convince them otherwise the whole day but they won‚Äôt budge.

Now obviously if they want to go through insurance I won‚Äôt stop them. But it‚Äôs seriously a massive inconvenience to me because instead of paying them $200 to fix a broken headlight and scratched bumper, I‚Äôll instead have to pay probably close to and extra $100 a month on insurance for 3 years until the ticket is off my record. 

So I‚Äôve basically been in and off freaking out with every indecision they make. I‚Äôve spent the week at school and work trying to keep my composure in front of my peers and today I was so stressed, I couldn‚Äôt even eat lunch which is usually my main meal of the day. Man, I‚Äôve been saving up for a new car for years now and now I‚Äôll have to wait more because it won‚Äôt be worth the extra money insurance is going to scam me out of.

Idk what more I can do to prove I‚Äôm trustworthy and that I promise to pay them every cent of the repair. I‚Äôve given them every step they need to take to get a repair quote including a body shop location. I wish they could just open up their heart this one time and let me pay them out of pocket. Even mentioning insurance is like torture to my brain.",4,anxiety

"Hi there,

My friend and I don't have any visible issues but every time I was in a group with her, I did more work, felt a lot of stress and she acted like she contributed evenly. She is toxic as an individual but she's not a bad friend per day to me at least. 

I have a hard time with confrontation and I switched myself to another group without saying anything (I'll use the excuse that the prof did it). 

The issue is the prof didn't switch any one else around and I just don't want to worth with her group on this. She's seen I'm not in the group and is asking I switch back. 

Not sure how to deal with this, I was thinking of telling her I'm fine with the group the prof switched me into but I'm worried this will impact our friendship etc. 

For context I'm in a graduate program that requires A LOT of group work, I'm working w her for all the classes except for this one now. 

Any advise is welcome, this has been causing me more anxiety (the thought of getting back to her is literally so nerve wracking) than necessary.",4,anxiety

"Hi, I hope this is ok to ask, I would love any thoughts. 

**Background**: My dad (I‚Äôm an adult) has schizophrenia. He is currently unmedicated and in a (so far) 2-month long psychotic episode, suffering from delusions. He is seeing a psychiatrist. His anosognosia is very strong. 

**The issue**: My dad‚Äôs delusions are persecutory, with my mom, my brothers, and me being the main people who have treated him poorly. His psychosis is progressing. He will often accuse us of things we have not done or ask why we said something we never said. We try to follow the LEAP method but are stumped when asked aggressively, for example ‚ÄúWhy did you manipulate me for entertainment on a reality show?‚Äù It‚Äôs hard to not immediately just say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about‚Äù or ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do that.‚Äù 

**The question**: How can we respond to being questioned about or accused of things that never happened? We want to minimize agitating him or making him feel gaslit or condescended to.

At the same time, I never had a job before and I'm struggling to keep up with my new obligations. Sometimes I wish I could just give up and die, but it would mess up my family really bad so I can't do that. I can definitely keep on going if things go well, but sometimes I feel overwhelmed.

The one that isn't marked or distinguishable as mine and has a smart lock and a deadbolt. And they are going to kill me and my wife and dogs while we sleep.

They are two separate people, 2,000km away from each other and another 700km away from me, who scammed me online last year. They don't know each other. It was a fucking baseball card thing. I paid, they scammed me. They both got away with it and threatened me with violence if I reported it. So I didn't report it. I have a locked down internet presence and totally removed myself from it as a hobby after it happened a year ago, but the fear lingers. I keep thinking they found each other and are targeting me, that they laugh at my willingness to trade and accommodation and friendliness and choose to obliterate me. I don't really think they are, if I stop hard to consider it. But the impact it has on my brain is so, so real.

I'm in therapy. It isn't really helpful for this. Because if it isn't one thing, it's another. Car accident, heart attack. I am so afraid to go to sleep and I used to love, love rest so much.

I know this is compounded trauma. I know the logistical impossibilities- people move, people have stuff going on. I know the real trauma likely already happened.

"So much of what i see, especially on the internet, but even outside of the intenret, is my own internal experience, memories, and associations, reflected back at me through other experiences, things, names, and people.  its awful.

Some days i honestly feel like how Mal felt in inception, or how Truman felt in the Truman show when he realized everyone was keeping him in the dark and that his life was just a play.

I'm afraid of these feelings affecting others, but this is really how i feel about my own life and its scary to me.

My brain seems to spin narratives out of nothing, where i feel overconnected to the sounds my neighbor makes, and even find myself subconsciously going to the bathroom at the same time as them, only to find out after hearing them flush while im in the bathroom, and its like what they're doing is a reaction to what i am thinking. same with the (loud and annoying) cars outside my window, and of course i just HAVE to live on the bottom floor by a busy street, its like my parents did this to me on purpose, for revenge on me living with them insufferably for years after dropping out of college. even tho i know thats not how they think they feel, i think that's how they feel sometimes, and they wont admit it, but who am i to say how they feel, despite them gaslighting me and me gaslighting them.  so fucked up

it happens with the TV too, feeling like my brain is having a conversation with the TV itself. i know that's ""hallmark paranoid thinking"" but as long as im aware of it, im ""still in the prodrome"" or whatever. i know i need psychiatric help and that's what im getting, but i want to be able to pull myself out of this way my brain works without meds, because i have had really bad experiences with meds and they scare me more than this does.

and yet sometimes when normal life feels less real than this, i really dont know what to make of it, and i dont know what to do.

it doesn't help that i'm really socially isolated, and yet people trying to encourage me to be more social, while not offering up themselves as a social person to be social with, just makes it feel like their help is really misplaced.   doesnt help that because i was socially isolated before getting a job, i tried to force friendships on people i ultimately didnt even want to be friends with and was probly honestly not a good ""match"" for them because i projected what i thought they were onto them, based on appearances and past friendships.

on a different note, i can't believe this is how my life has gone, i had friendships in high school and college, but those were before i came out as trans, and in retrospect, those friendships weren't that deep because i was always acting and being someone i truly wasn't. but since those memories are real, and since the fucked up person i am today is really detached and dissociated, that person i used to be feels like the realest me i have, even tho back then it felt like i was repressed. so now i feel like im trying to find my old self just to get to my new self and its all traumatic.",5,paranoia

I don‚Äôt know if you guys know what Hypnagogic hallucinations are, but they are basically hearing conversations or noises kind of out loud when you are waking up or going to sleep.

I‚Äôve also noticed that I have random memories that pop in my head. Or just a random words that basically are intrusive thoughts. I did mindfulness today at school or I focused on my breast in for a good bit of time I felt normal and just told myself, yeah, maybe I am going crazy but I‚Äôm not focused on that right now and I actually worked. I cannot stop worrying and I constantly need a distraction. That basically sucks me out of reality to stop it all.

"Hello Reddit! It's been a while since I last posted something of significance.  A lot has changed, lately. I don't see the purpose in my life anymore. That sounds far fetched considering I'm a 23 y/o with a fiance, a decent paying job that isn't too strenuous, family that cares about me, etc. But it's true. I feel as though my life is a never ending groundhog day situation th at is inescapable unless I die. I would love to get help, but due to having no health insurance (it costs too much with rent and everything else piled up) I can't get the help I know I need. All I do is work, come home, clean, eat, sleep, repeat. There is nothing in my life that brings me joy anymore. One reason for this is bc I don't have a car. That should be an easy hurdle, but it's not. I feel trapped and miserable with nobody to talk to. I hate myself, and even when I know the feeling of wanting to die is temporary (for the most part) I just can't seem to see the ""bright side"" of any of it. I've never planned my inevitable end, but I've thought about how peaceful it must be to not exist. If you have no consciousness, then I'd have no need to feel in the first place. My life feels like this cruel joke, and it feels like I'm chasing my own tail every time I try to better my life. I want to give up, buy I know if I do I will just disappoint or frustrate anybody left in my life that gives a shit. And any time I try to talk about it with anybody I'm met with ""that's life"" or ""grown up shit"". Fuck. That. This is not part of ""being an adult"" this is dark and empty and there is no white light that guides me to a better future. I'm stuck.. and i don't know if I'll ever get out. The only solace I've found is that through Satanism and even the fulfilled heart I grasp at is fleeting once I put my book down.. and just a fair warning, i don't need the whole ""God has a plan and is waiting for you"" speech. I'm a Satanist by choice, because it's the only thing that brings me satisfaction when I'm at my lowest. I would get more involved, but nobody I know believes in the same stuff as me.

"What do you do when nothing matters?   
  
I'm 45, Male. Going through what I'm sure countless others are going through. But it sucks more when it's YOU. This ""story"" will probably jump around a bit. Sorry about that, I'll try to keep it short.   
  
Been married 20 years, no kids. I'd say I have a happy life for the most part, great wife, great dogs, a few good friends. Full time job, as well as a small  
DJ/Entertainment business. Sure, things could always be better, but I'm doing ok. The problem? I've never been more miserable. Why? ... I don't know. It's been getting progressively worse for the last 10 years at least, maybe 15? But why? Is this the beginning of a ""mid-life"" crisis? There are plenty of reasons to be happy. But I am not, & honestly can't remember the last time I was.  
  
I had goals. I have achieved some, and still have some more that might never be realized. I've slowly given up on most of them. We won't get into what they actually are, it doesn't matter. It seems the last twenty years or so, have been spent treading water for the most part. Just getting by. BUT, I'm getting by. That's a good thing. I consider myself kinda smart, I've had many ideas for side hustles etc. Nothing ever sticks. It's probably my OWN fault. Could be undiagnosed ADHD? When I was young, that was never a thing. Point is, I want more. Maybe that's part of the problem, I'm never happy enough. People say be grateful for what you have, and believe me, I am. But...  
  
My wife and I have both dealt with pretty severe health issues for years. Me, diabetic for over 20 years, on insulin. This has led to multiple foot problems. But, thankfully, they all seem fixed. I had 2 foot surgeries last year. Everything seems good now. Other than the diabetes, I'm pretty healthy. Chubby, but healthy. She's doing good too, despite her struggles. These are good things. I should be happy.   
  
I SAY I'm healthy, but AM I? The Docs say ""For the most part, your doing pretty good. Ya need to quit smoking though"". My problem is ME. I don't love how my life has gone. I see friends and acquaintances doing (what looks like) so much better. Thriving small businesses, nice houses, shops, etc. I've been working toward the same thing for years,..and nothing. Also, no real vision of how to get it done. (the shop part at least, credit sucks due to medical bills) My Dad passed away when I was a year old, so none of that cool fatherly advice, or help. This is NOT a pitty party for me, I don't want that. Just pointing out facts. I also had big dreams involving music. None of which came anywhere close to true. I'm a drummer, not in a band currently. I've thought seriously about selling everything. The full DJ trailer, the drums, everything. I'm from a small town, so not much out there anymore. I don't know what I'd do without an outlet for music. But I don't know what to do WITH it either.   
  
But it's not ALL doom and gloom. I have a modest house, and small garage that we own. Also, no credit cards. These are good things.   
  
But, I'm still generally miserable.   
  
I used to be over 350 lbs. and my body has taken a hit because of it. My ankles, knees, feet, back etc. always hurt. I drink a little, nothing too bad. Six or so when I mow the yard etc. pretty normal stuff for any guy really. I've tried the jazz lettuce. I like it. May have to get a medical card, since I can do that here in Ohio. I have a somewhat stressful job. So does the wife, we're both in Management. I work all week, then the weekends are either DJ gigs, or doing work around the house/yard. Currently, the wife is off work due to hip surgery (she's almost better), my truck is broken, lawnmower is broken, house needs some small repairs. Not enough money or time to fix everything. I know it sounds like I'm just bitching, and I am. BUT, back to my original question. What do you do? I know I'm not the only one. 

I used to have dreams. Now I just foresee more of the same until I die. I see NO reason to care, try, or plan for the future. I have no one to talk to about this stuff and no way to make sense of anything. It's not like I'm suicidal, but I've seen enough. I don't care what happens. I wouldn't kill myself, it would be terrible for my wife, mother, even dogs. But then that means I'm just living for them, not me. I'm just so over it, and I don't see any way out.

"I have major depressive disorder for many years. But I am not suicidal and have never attempted suicide. But I was locked in the Citrus Health Network by the Baker Act and kept under stress for 29 hours.  They threatened me, exacerbated all my phobias, brought me to a big panic attack and a heart attack. They forced me to sleep on a very hard bed in a terrible cold, although I warned them about the big problems in my spine. I could hardly move from the pain and could not sleep. After this ""medical care"", my life is broken, but no one answered for these crimes. When I tried to sue them, the state court dismissed my case because Citrus uses the federal budget, after which the federal court dismissed the case again because everything happened because of the Florida state law (Baker Act)! There was a catch 22. The judicial system does not allow to judge the tormentors! Where is the justice? Where is the humanity? I went to the doctors for help with my depression, but instead of help, they killed my health completely. What to do? These killer doctors continue to torture sick people! Who else has been tormented in medical facilities in Florida?",2,depression
"I have been diagnosed at the beginning of 2022. I was 21 and when I got meds for the first time I was 22.

Now I am incredibly lucky because I got to my diagnosis within 6 months but my ADHD treatment feels so nonexistent.

I take elvanse 50mg and the psychiatrist that diagnosed me also treats me. It was and still is the only clinic I can go to because most don't accept new patients even if they already have a diagnosis. Or most just don't treat adults. The place that I go to has several psychiatrists working there.

When I had my first appointment they told me things like ""you most likely don't have adhd"" , ""woman usually don't have adhd"" and ""most people grow out of adhd so don't worry too much about it, it will most likely be gone until you are 25""

My assessment was with a different person and she actually listened and told me that she has no doubt I have adhd and that the other psychiatrists will make a treatment plan with me.

Well on the day that I should have made a treatment plan with the psychiatrist he just basically talked about ""only meds can fix it"" and that stimulant medication is the only thing that works. Which is horribly inaccurate. He also told me (and my mother who wanted to come along) that therapy is no option and it will not help at all. I didn't even know coaching was a thing and I left really discouraged but I had my hopes up bc I finally had a diagnosis and got meds prescribed that could possibly help me really much.

Despite me being happy about it I still feel like there is a lot of tings wrong with how my treatment goes (I am now with another psychiatrist and she at leas is open for everything but its not that she suggests things. Its rather me suggesting things and she then talks about it with me and maybe she will go though with it like changing my medication after I had horrible side effects from the first medication.

Also other things like depression or anxiety and other things are not really taken into consideration. 

And one of the worst things for me personally is that I only got help because I was at a breaking point. Everything was overwhelming and I had constant brain fog. It got to a point where I slept just an hour or less a day and that continued until I was so physically and mentally drained that I slept 15+ hours on weekends because I could not get myself out of bed.

This issue has unfortunately not been fixed yet.
I sleep much better but still 3-4 hours of sleep per day is just not enough and honestly I don't know what to do about that.",3,adhd

At the same time I have to accept that there have been times when I've dreamed things up out of nowhere,  but when you're told that you're living on a whole other plain of existence where there's your version of things and that those things are separate from things that actually are and there's this dual narrative going on where everyone in your life can be nasty to you one minute and nice to you the next without any recognition of the fact... lets just say it gets disconcerting.",5,paranoia

"Whenever I have to be alone for the night either at my parents or at my own place I always have to have all the lights on in every single room, even while sleeping because if I haven't had them on, I've usually gotten nightmares. I'm scared to look around corners, into empty rooms, mirrors, closets etc. because I'm scared that someone is gonna pop out or I'm going to see something terrifying, I even move my head extra slow so I don't accidentally scare myself with a strand of my hair (which happens often). It's hard for me to fall asleep because of gow scared I am ans whenever I close my eyes I can literally hear and see tereifying things that stop immediately after I open my eyes again. I also often get scared of my own face in the mirror and my own shadows.

I feel like this paranoia is mostly related to me being scared of getting scared, like you would from a jumpscare in a movie. Being alone overall gives me a lot of anxiety so every little thing can trigger a panic attack in me, but I'm not sure.

"I‚Äôll try to keep this short and to the point.
About ~9 months ago I started taking flecainide and metoprolol for an irregular heartbeat. At a similar time or a bit earlier  I started having depressive episodes. Episodes where I would feel passively suicidal, hopeless, irritable, and at times full of rage. During these phases I fantasise about running away, abandoning my husband and kids (for at least a while).

Every time I tell myself it‚Äôs just PMS and to wait until my period is over before I do something hasty. And once I‚Äôve had my period I come good again. Recently it‚Äôs gotten more severe though, during these episodes there is a lot of uncontrollable crying and feeling hopeless. I came very close to telling my husband it‚Äôs over on the weekend, and I embarrassed myself in front of his family with my hostile and miserable mood.

I‚Äôm thinking about seeing my doctor and requesting SSRI‚Äôs to control PMDD. But I haven‚Äôt had sex with my husband in two months - will SSRI‚Äôs make my libido even worse? I‚Äôm in a miserable and depressive dry spell.

My husband is very supportive but it‚Äôs starting to take it‚Äôs toll. I can sense the kids are picking up on the bad vibes too. 

Does this sound like PMDD? If you‚Äôve dealt with something similar, did SSRI‚Äôs help you? Was anybody able to see a libido increase getting it under control?",2,depression

"As i've grown older I've became more happy in my own company I have got rid of friends that I felt didn't treat me the way I treated them and I felt happy with these decisions but with this then gradually spent a lot more time on my own.

With this I've then also noticed i'm now unable to keep a job for any longer than a few month before I lose/leave it.

It's hard to explain but whenever I start a job I go into it with the set plan of i'm going to just do the job professionally like I'm a robot, Limit my interactions with others to nothing more than small talk and everyday will run like clockwork same rules/structure/plans etc and this is how I am able to keep my mind happy.... I thrive on structure/plans and organised.

However this can itself lead to paranoia as I start to feel others might find me boring/cold etc.... but I dont mind too much as this is when I do the job best but also I know there is no way I could have said or done anything to have offended anyone or be judged on as i've limited my interactions to the bare minimum and I always do my work on time/correctly.

I purposely try to behave this way because I know if I let it slip that I can be very chatty/goofy and an oversharer and with these qualities might say/do something to offend someone or lose respect from others.

What I mean by this is my natural personality is very chatty/weird/kind and goofy and over time when people get to know me they begin to take liberties with me as something about my personality screams "" we can take the mickey out of them and they will be cool with it "" and also when I let it slip my paranoia begins to kick in as i'm constantly analyzing all my interaction I've had that day combing for anything I could have said that may have offended someone or given them reason to think less of me/mock me or talk about me to others.

I dont seem to have a middle ground... 

I'm either Robocop - Super serious, controlled, work is done on time and very well organised with zero chance of having said or done anything to offend anyone and i leave work fairly happy only worrying people think I'm a dick for not interacting but fear nothing more.

Or

I let my guard down and then begin to slip into goofy mode... work turns to crap and i become a paranoid weirdo that overshares and regrets every interaction I make and then spends the rest of the day worrying I've said or done something wrong to someone and it starts to spiral.......

At this point is when I end up leaving my job.. I can't seem to keep the charade up.

I have\\had group assignments where I'm not doing much, I know that, I've apologized to my friends that are doing them with me, but most of the time I just can't **make myself do it.** Since being diagnosed and getting on meds (Ritalin), I've been ok at forcing myself to do things, but it just hasn't been working lately.

I just have this sense of failing in every aspect of my life (college, living alone, managing relationships, having any ability to get a job, even as trainee...) and it's tiring, for me and for the people around me. My boyfriend thinks I'm depressed; i disagree. I think it's me being generally bad at being a member of society, mixed with having a period that usually messes deeply with my mood (it's supposed to come this week, that's why I'm wondering if the last shitshow week could be a result of it, but it's usually not that bad). 

Some things in my personal life also messed with my emotional, so yeah, it's been...a month. I'm just wondering if it's deppression, my innability to do things, hormones, a mix of some, a mix of all.... Tired, that's something I know I feel most of the time.

Next month I'll look for a therapist that my ensurance covers. I'm not doing it for me though; if I waited until I felt like going to a therapist for me, I just wouldn't go. I don't like the ideia of just talking about personal things to a stranger (yes, i realise the irony of posting something like this online, but I can't see you, you can't see me, so it's easier and less likely for me to get embarassed and shut down), it doesn't exactly makes sense the whole process of it, to me. Even more so after i tried therapy before, and the therapist complained to my parents I wasn't opening up fast enough after six months. 

So I'll do it for my parents, for my boyfriend and friends; for the people I fear hurting because of the way I feel about myself.

"I really don‚Äôt know how to start this, other than by saying I‚Äôm sorry.  I‚Äôm sorry to my mom and my dad, who have done everything in their power to ensure that I can live as comfortable as possible.  I‚Äôm sorry to my two siblings, who I love more than words can describe.  I wish I could have been a better brother.  I am sorry to my girlfriend, for being the way that I am.  You deserve so much better.  You deserve the world.

The world has given me everything I could have ever wanted and yet it‚Äôs still not enough to fill the void in my chest.  It doesn‚Äôt matter how much good I put into the world, how many people I help, or even how many people love me, the OCD will always find a reason to tear me apart.  I can‚Äôt fucking take it anymore.  

I‚Äôve done everything!  I‚Äôve made amends!  I help people!  I refuse to harm people, I never HAVE harmed another being, and still I cannot for the life of me stop trying to find reasons to hate myself.  It‚Äôs always something new.  There‚Äôs always something wrong.

I just want it to be over.  I just want to be happy.  But it‚Äôs clear that my own brain won‚Äôt allow me to.  

Thank you for giving me everything.  I‚Äôm sorry but I can‚Äôt accept it.",2,depression

"It's a Ruger Redhawk in .44 Mag. I was lined up on the brainstem through the soft palate. I was fantasizing about how nice it would be to just turn off instantly. Like flipping a switch and making all of the hurt just go away.

I see posts here of people talking about how rarely they shower. Or how hard it is to force themselves to eat or go outside. I get up every day. I shower, I shave, I groom myself. I eat. I go to work and maintain performance. I interact and socialize. I paint a smile on and continue moving forward. It feels necessary, but meaningless at the same time. I'm not allowed to leave. It's not fair. I have people who rely on me. To teach them  how to perform safely and get through high stress, dangerous conditions. Two beautiful children who need guidance and support. But I feel so empty.

The medication does nothing to alleviate the suffering. I have therapy every week and it's all I look forward to. But once that hour is over, it's back to this unbearably painful existence. The one person who ever made me feel joy in this life is gone. I've lost all interest in everything that once I was passionate about. For 30 years I've toughed it out. And I thought that I had been sent a savior. But, like everything else that provided any relief, it's been torn away. Leaving me lower than I ever was before. And I've almost done it before.

I work in conditions that most would consider unacceptable. And I've always loved it. I'm not scared. But I have such a fragile heart. I have so much love to give, and I feel like everyone just takes it, and leaves with it. It builds in me until it hurts. I need someone to give it to or it's going to kill me.

I really wish the best for everyone. And I hold out hope that, somewhere in this world, joy does still exist. Even if it will never be mine.",2,depression

"Hi i am a 25 year old male and ive never been a good writer or been very good at describing how but here is me giving it a try .
i feel or maybe it feels that way now because to be honest i feel like i dont even know who i am anymore.
I feel like i have been depressed for most of my life and i feel like i am living through a third person view i can hear see and feel what is around me but it is like i have no emotional repsonse to anything almost as if i was blank. I do not want to live like this anymore sometimes i even ask myself if i even want to live because i dont see the point in anything, everything just seems like a struggle. The hardest part about all of this is, I basically have no social life.

When i look back i never had many friends but i was always outgoing as a young kid   I had a lot of people who wanted to be my friend  thought i was cool but i never knew how to maintain a relationship
Today when i am around people i feel as if i am a ghost and have nothing to bring and give to a conversation i feel empty and hollow, it is almost as if i was a zombie i hear people talk but nothing comes to mind to add it is almost as if i am frozen watching people in my own body not being able to react.
this for me is the hardest part to live with because i just want to be able to have friends and make connections with people more than anything but i just cant seem to do it anymore, it used to be natural when i was younger but it seems to slowly have started to fade away piece by piece.

I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder at around the age of 13 but it has been slowly getting worse as to now feeling like i have severe social anxiety and bordeline agoraphobia.
This is my first time even trying to describe my emotions which is really hard but it feels nice putting them down almost giving me a sense of existence.

I was always passionate about things i would read and learn new topics, i had a deep desire to be alive to feel and be someone i had things to talk about but now i feel as if this is all gone and i really just dont feel anything anymore.
Almost as if my brain does not fucntion everything is hard to do and even feels like i have an attention dissorder at this point where even if i was interested in something i wouldnt have enough mental
Strength to focus on the topic which leaves me wandering through life not knowing what to do or who to be.
I feel like i just getting worse as time goes on and i almost feel like soon i wont even care anymore, i guess since i am writing this i do care and i do want to be here,
But if things keep going this way i just do not see a point anymore, i will probably just isolate myself even more and become suicidal but somwhere deep inside myself i do feel like there is hope, i wish i had a answer to these issues but i dont, i just wish i had someone who could help me figure this out everything just feels so lonely and i do not want to live like this anymore",2,depression

"Hey reddit.  
  
I've never made a post on reddit before, but I've read alot of post lately because I'm going through some sh\*t and it makes me happy to see a community support eachother, so I thought I maybe give it a shot.  
  
I'm M 24 and I live at a university dorm. Some weeks ago we had a easter party with my dorm kitchen and our neighbour kitchen. When I arrived at the party I saw a girl I havn't seen before and she just moved in a few days ago. I remember looking at her and the thought of her was amazing, but that would never happen. Fast forward a couple of hours and we're making out in the kitchen and after the party we hooked up.  
  
After the party everything just felt right. She's so nice and pretty and I definitely liked her. We found a day where I could help her find some stuff for her dorm room and after that we just sat and chatted in her room for hours. I found out that she was really drunk at the easter party, I was also a little drunk, but I didn't remember her being that drunk. So I started questioning myself if she actually liked me at the party or if she was just drunk. But after that day I just liked her even more cause we have so much in common and I really enjoy being around her.  
  
Fast forward to last saturday (may 6th). We had another party, this time with alot of other kitchens. I hoped that at this party I could figure out what me and this girl had, if it was something or if it was something I just made up. I wanted to be around her all the time, but I didn't want to feel clingy, so I gave her some space and enjoyed the party. After some hours i noticed that she has been talking alot with this guy from my dorm kitchen and I was starting to get at bit jealous. At some point they were in his room, with the door open so I guess they didn't do anything, but my thoughts were all over the place, I decided I had to talk with her about us. So I did that and yeahhh.... She didn't like me back, but would still like to be friends and I told her I was okay with that, I'm not btw, but it was better than it being awkward between us.  
  
Fast forward to now. I've thought alot about everything. I've never had succes with finding someone i really liked like me back, so it's not like this is new to me, but it's just like eveything felt so right this time and I really had my hopes up, but after alot of unsuccessful atempts at finding someone who likes me back I'm starting to lose hope. I get attached to people so quick and I hate myself for it. If I just didn't get attached to her so quick, then this wouldn't be so difficult. I mean, I've known her for maybe a month and that I feel so much for her already irritates me. I'm realy starting to lose hope and hating myself alot for making things so difficult. I'm seeing her again this monday, just to hangout. A part of me wants to keep being around her and try to become friends instead and another part wants to forget about her and just move on even though it would be hard cause we live like 3 dorm rooms between eachother.  
  
I don't actually know what I want to get from posting about this. Maybe it's a cry for help, maybe I want some guidance or maybe I just want to know that I'm not alone in this and that everything is going to be alright. I've just not talked to anyone about this, I've actually not talked to anyone in person for the last 6 days. I just keep to myself cause I'm scared to have a breakdown infront of someone and show them what a mess I am. I feel so hopeless all the time and so alone. I have nothing to look forward to. Every day is just a day I have to get through and I just don't feel like I have anything to enjoy anymore. I sleep most of the day because I enjoy the few seconds when I wake up before I realise what a mess my life is. I'm not thinking about ending it all, I could never do that to my family, but it's starting to worry me that it's actually just my family that's stopping me from doing it. I just feel so depressed all the time and I don't have any motivation to do something with my life.  
  
I'm sorry for grammar mistakes, english is not my first language, but I hope it's readable. Thanks if you've made it this far and if you feel like you could have written some of this then I'm sorry and I want to believe that everything is going to be alright for us.

"Hey guys,

I didn't really premeditate this, so forgive me if it sounds a bit garbled.

I've hand-held my depression for years, when the risk factor went away in my teens - it became a looming sort of grey-area. I'm no longer suicidal, but have adopted this sense of apathy that has been bothering me as of late. As grim as it sounds, it's the whole 'would never seek to harm myself, but if harm sought me out, I doubt I would move' sort of deal. 

All the things I would love to doing slowly fade out into my apathy-zone. From sports and socializing to trivial things such as movies, music and art. I have constant fidgets, and an overbearing weight of guilt that constantly sits on my shoulders like a little gremlin constantly whining that had I spent my time better in previous situations, I would have met more success 

Rationally I understand how unhealthy it is, but can't find the drive or energy to be better, so I just sit with my thoughts and flow through a cycle of beating myself up. I'm real tired of my internal monologue.

I've prefaced looking for help, however, in Canada the wait times for therapy and what-not for somebody 'not-at-risk' (which I totally get, but still) leaves me in what possible could be year-long wait times, on top of finding a General Physician (which took me two years last time). It's not looking so good over here,lads.

What I'm wondering from this community, is have any of you found a way to break these kinds of cycles? 

Maybe pulled out from your 'apathy-zone'? 

Any tricks or habits? 

Thank you for the consideration,",2,depression

"I met him on vacation, and we hung out for two days. I'm a very socially anxious person, but with him, I felt like I've known him for years. One night, he told other teenagers that he liked me. They all told me, and they were hyping me up saying stuff like ""oh look your boyfriend's here"". I was so excited. I never had a guy like me before. Ever. All my life, I was treated as a freak, so I was just glad for this opportunity for something special. So I went up to him and asked him if he liked me. He told me he had a girlfriend, and got really mad at our friends for telling me.

  
He cut off all contact with me after. I blocked him on Instagram after he rejected my Instagram request. I was so sad that the guy I liked decided it would be best if he never saw me again. The one person who saw me for all the good I have to offer, and he still gave it up. They broke up two months later, and he still looks at my social media. We're not in contact, but according to my friend, a playlist on his Spotify was made as a birthday present to me. But I don't forgive him. I've never had the privilege of falling in love before, and he just took it away from me. I'm not mad at him for having a girlfriend.

"Bien. Posiblemente ni un alma lea esto pero bueno, creo que ayudara a desahogarme y sentir algo.

Siento que estoy roto, no tengo metas. No tengo nada que esperar de esta vida m√°s que humillaciones.

Esta tortura comenz√≥ en 3ro de primaria. Yo era bastante sensible y a mis compa√±eros les gustaba jugar con eso, sol√≠an golpearme y llamarme ""bebe llor√≥n"" o simplemente ""perdedor"". En ese tiempo solo contaba con una amiga, yo la apreciaba mucho y quer√≠a hasta que descubr√≠ que solo me hablaba por pena y para contar mis secretos con otros compa√±eros y as√≠ burlarse de mi. Eso me destruyo. Mis esperanzas en este mundo se terminaban, a mi corta edad ya pensaba en tirarme de un maldito puente y olvidarme de todo, volver a nacer en otro lugar y no tener este cuerpo sensible de mierda, no ser yo.

Comenc√© a alejarme de las personas, comenc√© a ser solitario hasta que me aburr√≠, quer√≠a contarle mis ideas a alguien. Quer√≠a tener amigos. Ah√≠ conoc√≠ el internet, me enganche al instante, el hecho de que pod√≠a hacer un mont√≥n de cosas sin salir de mi cuarto o moverme me fascinaba pero aun  no me sent√≠a satisfecho. No me siento satisfecho.

Los amigos que llegue a tener en el internet no eran suficientes as√≠ que lo deje. Trate de volver a la realidad y activarme un poco, eso paso el 18 de Marzo en 2021 pero ""OH SORPRESA"" mis piernas no funcionan, mi cuerpo no funciona. Tan solo estirar mi cuerpo me duele, y mucho, no aguanto ni dar 10 pasos para caerme rendido. Al inicio no le di importancia pero a los pocos d√≠as comenz√≥ a darme una obsesi√≥n con el tema, probaba dar unos pasos y descansar para seguir caminando pero no funcionaba, tenia miedo, aun m√°s por no tener a quien contarle.

Decid√≠ olvidarme del tema y seguir viviendo por el internet pero ya no era lo mismo, saber que mi cuerpo no estaba funcionando bien me puso paranoico y ansioso. Mis horas de pasar jugando videojuegos pasaron a revisar paginas medicas, buscando que me pasaba. Lo m√°s parecido que encontr√© fue un ""tend√≥n inflamado"", no estoy seguro si es esto pero me esta matando.

Al volver a clases. No pude comunicarme con mis compa√±eros, ellos trataban de hablar y conversar conmigo pero yo sent√≠a un nudo en la garganta, algo no me deja hablar. Siento que algo me obliga a no juntarme con nadie, que algo trata de hacer lo posible para que no me mueva del ordenador. Siento que algo me mira. No s√© si ya estoy loco o si es mi paranoia quien me hace creer esto. Siento que esta detr√°s m√≠o, escondido en la profunda oscuridad de mi cuarto, puedo ver algo correr de un lado a otro, puedo escuchar algo ah√≠ atr√°s, algo llam√°ndome, algo pidiendo que termine este sufrir. Tengo miedo de levantarme, quitarme los aud√≠fonos y verlo detr√°s de mi, observ√°ndome. Quiero pensar que estoy loco. Quiero creerlo. Quiero creer que solo creo que hay algo persigui√©ndome por esta maldita soledad y el vac√≠o que siento en mi. Quiero pensar que mi padre esta afuera tratando de entrar, que trata de sacarme de este infierno. Quiero sentir el calor de un abrazo y que me digan que todo esta bien, que solo fue una pesadilla y que tengo muchos amigos esper√°ndome para hablar y hacer locuras juntos pero no, estoy solo, solo con mi oscuridad y con este sentir de que algo me persigue.

Quiero salir de esto, aun si la muerte es necesaria.

"Hi, this is my first time using Reddit and I thought I could use some support. I can't regulate my emotions and it's just so frustrating even tho I know I shouldn't be hard on myself. I've been working hard for a school interview that I did today: I hesitated on an answer and after the interview I felt like everything was going bad and I couldn't get a grip of myself. Now I've spent the last hours overthinking and on the verge of tears every time I thought of the interview. I also have this thing when I'm frustrated or overwhelmed where I stop talking and I shut down completely and it made it even worse. I was more angry at the fact that I couldn't find the force to speak or answer texts, but at the same time I didn't want to be alone. Sometimes I just want everything to turn off but I can't find a way to calm down when this things happens. I apologize if this was long but I needed to get it out.

"I'm so fucking tired of people seeing neurodivergence as a mental willpower thing.

Our brains have physical structural changes. Phineas Gage had damage to his prefrontal cortex and became an abusive swearing alcoholic with impulse issues. 

Individuals with parkinsons have problems with the substantia niagra, they can't just stop shaking, even with medication.

These fucking people like to think that mental = you can control it. 

Not every neurodivergent person is the same either. Congrats your neruodevelopment doesn't impact your ability. 

I can sit in a loud fucking room 24/7 and I'll still be fucking in pain, I can't control that. 

I can however modulate by wearing earphones, etc. That doesn't make the pain go away though, it just helps alleviate

Modulation are tools that reduce the overall but will not fix the entirety. So yes, Neurodivergence isn't an excuse, it is a state of fucking being. Eat shit you ableist fucks.",1,autism

"When times get tough and my world narrows, I know it‚Äôs time to fight back. I negotiate a new start with myself and convince myself into a routine of yoga, mediation, and exercise. Along the way, I‚Äôm constantly searching for ways to help myself get through the struggle I have with my perception of what people are thinking of me. Especially the work life.

Navigating through the minefield of paranoia has always been a struggle but I have always found a way back to a place where I forget that paranoia has a strangle hold of my happiness. Then, not before long, the cycle starts all over and I‚Äôm once again at it‚Äôs mercy. My self perception and paranoia are happy to see each other to pick up where they have left off.

This time around, it‚Äôs different with the pandemic and how the entire world has made a massive mental  shift. Having everything and everyone under a microscope seems to have become the new black and who knows what the short -long term effects will be on our psyche. 

It has become extremely difficult to let go of paranoia. I‚Äôm always asking myself if it‚Äôs because of the state the entire world is in right now and will I eventually find my way back to my old relationship with paranoia.

"i've had an issue with this show since it came out. it's not a good portrayal of autism/the struggles of autism at all, and what infuriates me the most is how shaun's actor (freddie highmore) is NOT AUTISTIC!! he says he prepared for his role by ""talking to people in his life with autism and watching autism documentaries."" it wouldve been so much better if the writers or actors were actually ND. plus, the whole plot of every episode is:
shaun had a bad childhood. and hes autistic with savant syndrome. his coworkers think little of him because hes autistic and constantly doubt everything he says. fast forward near the end of the episode and turns out he was right all along! and then repeat that for six seasons across anywhere from 18-22 episodes per season. another issue i have with it is the whole attitude of ""autism is a superpower!!"" that goes on through the show. for instance, because shaun has autism he can.. visualize things?? like, he'll stare off into space and information/diagrams of the human body appear around him? üò≠üò≠
plus the whole viral clip of him sobbing and having a meltdown about not being called a surgeon is PAINFULLY IRONIC considering in another episode he continually refers to a transgender patient by their assigned gender, despite having it explained to him several times..
i could complain and rant about this show for HOURS!! it makes me so mad and annoyed to see autism portrayed in such a harmful way. autism is NOT a superpower, the entire show just gets autism all wrong, and when it's shown to tens of millions of people, they're all going to think that's how autism works. it doesn't just give you innate abilities to do stuff, it's a lifelong struggle to be seen as normal and it's exhausting.

"last year at 22 I got diagnosed with adhd and have been on vyvanse ever since. it has helped a lot school wise but i didn‚Äôt realize until now all the other issues that adhd has caused. 

my boyfriend that i was dating for over a year just broke up with me and i‚Äôve finally realized that it was adhd causing so many issues for me in our relationships as well as my difficulty to make/ keep friends my whole life. 

I didn‚Äôt even realize what the true issue was until i started to research adhd more and it has finally made my whole life struggles make more sense. 

but now i am also struggling with the guilt of ruining my relationship with someone who meant a lot to me. i struggled with emotional dysregulation a lot which made me cause a lot of fights as well as not being able to communicate how i felt effectively. i struggled to be social with his friends sometimes out of fear of rejection even though they were always nice to me. 

i know that not understanding my adhd made it impossible to stop these issues. now that i do know i‚Äôm working on managing it so that i can avoid these problems in the future. i just wish i would‚Äôve known sooner.

I‚Äôve started seeing a counsellor to help me work on it. I just hope that one day he‚Äôll give me another chance. I know i made a lot of mistakes and it sucks that i didn‚Äôt even know that i was doing it till it was too late. i know that i need to work on it to have a healthy relationship. I just know that i wouldn‚Äôt have lost him if i didn‚Äôt have adhd. i am already improving and hope to continue improving each day. i know i needed to learn this about myself and grow as a person but i just really hope there‚Äôs another chance for us in the future.",3,adhd
"please be kind to me. I don't know if this is the right place to say this.

I'm neurodivergent but allistic. my mother is autistic. people talk a lot about allistic parents with autistic children. I rarely see anyone talk about what it's like to be allistic with an autistic parent. I'm not here to spread hate. I just want to share my experience.

growing up with my mother was very lonely. it often felt like she was in her own world. she never hugged me as a child. she often neglected me in favor of her special interests. when I cried, she would remain completely silent. once, I told her through tears that it felt like she didn't love me. she walked away without a word. 

when allistic parents have autistic children, they read books on autism. they talk to child psychologists. I couldn't do any of that. I was just a child. I didn't know what autism was. all I knew was that my mother acted differently from other moms. I'm not a kid anymore. I read about autism sometimes. I understand now that my mother didn't like me crying because it was a form of sensory overload to her. I understand now that she didn't like it when I interrupted her special interests because it wasn't just a hobby to her. I understand all of that now as a grown-up, but that matters little because child me didn't know any of that. I go to therapy once a week now.

I second-guess myself sometimes. maybe she did love me. maybe she still loves me, in her own way. whatever it is, I don't understand it. I don't know if I ever will. she doesn't like talking to me. she tells me to stop talking when it doesn't interest her. she turns away from me and engages in her special interest. I don't know if she knows it hurts me. it's hard communicating with her. she doesn't seem to have any interest in me. I see posts sometimes, by autistic people talking about how much they detest allistic people. I wonder if that's how my mother really feels about me. 

I don't know where I'm going with this. I'm not saying autistic people have to conform to allistic standards. I'm not saying autistic people shouldn't have children. I'm just sharing my personal experience. and if you have a child, please just tell them you love them.",1,autism

"Hi from Germany! 
I have negative thoughts all day long. 
When I have a very (paranoid) episode, I am completely convinced that someone has all information about me and is spreading it. In 2014 I lost my smartphone and when I got it back all the pictures were gone. At that time I was already struggling with negative thoughts about other things and was very suspicious of my surroundings.
Strangely enough, in 2014 I didn't have any obsessive thoughts after my smartphone disappeared. In the meantime, however, I think about it all day long. I think in all situations that people have private information about me. When people around me laugh, I think that they are talking about me.
But not only that, I also have other (paranoid) thoughts that keep coming from time to time. In the meantime I also suspect that former friends want to harm me.
When I am in a bad phase, I also look for evidence and spend a lot of time with it. So for all my negative thoughts I find evidence if I search.
At the beginning I thought that only my pictures were stolen. Meanwhile I think that they have synchronized my Google account or installed a spy app. 

Finally, I can say that since 2014 it has never happened that a picture or something similar was ""published"" about me.
The only thing I feel is that since 2016, I have been treated extremely unfairly in my work. For this I also have concrete facts. I do not have a plausible reason for this. Therefore, I can only speculate.
Physically, the compulsive brooding costs me a lot of strength.
Especially when I have an (paranoid) episode, then I can not sleep, have to throw up and feel extreme restlessness. I have realized that I have to change something.

Even if my fears are true, how can I stop the negative obsessive thoughts?
And how do I know what are paranoid delusions and what are legitimate fears and worries?",5,paranoia

"I'm a 45 year old man. I was diagnosed with ADHD during a meeting with a psychologist... 6 years ago.  I knew about ADHD, like everyone else. But it never occurred to me that I ""had it.""  To be honest, like most everyone else, I wasn't even sure it was a ""real thing.""  I certainly did not think it was something that applied to any adult. So... anyway... I am in a real ""bottom of a well"" situation right now... and I just thought I might reach out for some help after watching a YouTube video where someone mentioned this subreddit. If you read this post, and think... ""Well... okay... but what specifically are you asking?"" I must pre-apologize... because I am not 100% sure. My life situation has gone from doing-okay... to NOT doing-okay... in record time. And right now, I have more problems than I could ever squeeze into a Reddit post. So... I'm kind of just... reaching out... hoping someone can give me... some kind of perspective or advice.

My job:  The job that I had up until I was laid of in March, was... the text book definition of... the WORST job for someone with ADHD. My job was one of those jobs where, my manager would assign me some mega-task... where it was not clear to anyone whether the task might take someone 2-3 weeks, 2-3 months... or even > a year. The team was made up of absolute golden-soul kind-hearted people... so... it seemed to me like a *perfect* job. They would basically ask me how long I think something would take. I would give an honest answer. But... I always over-estimated how long it really takes to do something. Like... I would say... ""I can have that done by Friday."" only to discover... I should have said ""three weeks."" But it was okay... because they would always say... ""No problem... just have it done by the end of the quarter."" i.e. deadlines of three months were extremely common. So... of course... I would intend to get right on that. But then... two-and-a-half months later... I was always scrambling to get something done. And always disappointing everyone.  I am a very charming guy... so i was always able to get help from all my resources... and I would get it done. But. for 5 years, this job was one big feeling of... Oh my God, I am a terrible person!!! dot com!!! dot  gov!!! dot ORG!!!

Then... when COVID began, I had to do my job from home. I'm divorced, and live alone. So... I became the shut-in-extrovert. And.. after two years of the most complete loneliness I've ever felt... plus... having a job that I was clearly destined to fail at...  my outlook on everything was (is)... bad. Very bad. And... I could not seem to explain it to anyone. My mom... sister... friends... Try explaining how your job is basically a cake walk in the park... and it's making you miserable!!! No one understands. They think it sounds perfect! Flexible deadlines.. Given months to complete easy stuff... blah blah blah. It all sounds like job-porn to most people. Anyway... my self-worth was at -11... and then... one morning... I get an email that my position was being eliminated. Laid off. 

At the time... I was not even upset! I honestly felt a deep feeling of relief.  I felt like I could finally get back out there and find something that I could be proud to do. Well... now... it's been 2 1/2 months. I have done some very minor online job searching. I've completed my resume and sent it to some companies... but I have not actually gotten down to business and started a solid job search. My insurance lapsed, and as I type this... I have no health insurance. I don't even know what COBRA is... and I feel absolutely paralyzed. paralyzed with fear that I might have an accident and have no insurance. Paralyzed that I am 45 years old and have NO IDEA. what job to search for. I don't know what I want to be when I ""grow up."" I was taking adderal, but that ran out 2 months ago. I was also taking Lexapro for anxiety... that also ran out.

So... yeah... I was already depressed, lonely, and feeling worthless. I lost my job... and within a couple of weeks, I've gone from feeling worthless to not even knowing it was possible to feel this bad. Stopping those medications cold-turkey like that was... terrible. I am not a ""sad person."" Meaning... I do not cry often... I do not think bad thoughts... In general, I'm a pretty ""peppy guy"" usually. But... since I lost this job... I've been crying, every, day! Like... sobbing in the shower!!! I haven't slept an actual night's sleep in... months. I wake up at 6:00 pm... feel like I'm in some kind of bad dream where I am awake all night... and then pass out from exhaustion at 7:00 - 8:00 am... trying to NOT do that... so i can reset myself and try to stay awake so I can ""get normal"" again. 

I've started walking every day. I try to really push myself to do exercise hoping that it will reset my clock.. and I can get some good Vitamin D from the sun and some endorphins.  And I do feel a good sense of accomplishment, but it is not helping with the sleep. I don't drink alcohol (thank god!) I did in the past... but... I got away from that years ago. And, I've been trying to do as many ""Reaching out"" activities as possible. i.e. using Meetup dot com to find some hobby groups... tried online dating... trying to just meet some new people. I think the dating part is a little stupid right now...but to be honest... it's been great! I have been starving for just conversation... so... I enjoy it, even if I am not exactly ""boyfriend material"" right now. 

Anyway... I will end this post now... but really... my main ask... of you guys... is... How on Earth can I find a job that fits my ADHD brain? I did some Google searching for ""Best jobs for people with ADHD,"" and they were all jobs that I cannot just... get. Like... Teacher. Journalist. Food Service.  I'm 45... single income... have a $1,500/month mortgage. I can't just... be a teacher. or ... become a journalist. And Food Service... I wouldn't have the slightest idea about that. 

Does anyone here have a resource for, ""ADHD Tech jobs."" I honestly feel like my ""calling"" is to be something where I am helping people. But... like... within a tech sector, environment. Like... a manager... or a consultant. But I don't have any mgmt experience and... I just don't know where to turn for some help with getting my head straight.",3,adhd

About 4 years ago I was diagnosted with dysthymia by a neurologyst when I went for sleeping problems,  is a mild chronic depression but i never took the antidepressive meds that were prescripted because my family asked me not to, i think that was a mistake. I had some traumatics events in the past but I was able to function, even though the thoughts that all I did was for nothing never left, I was able to made peace with that and keep them for myself, put a mask on and go as I was optimistic to my enviroment outside my home.  


My condition was very well controlled while i was in college, but when covid pandemic strikes, It got worse,  I was in my moms house like for 2 years, so now i struggle a lot with trying to get out of bed, i do lots of things in my room for trying to shut my head and dont think in anything, games ,videos, i sing and play guitar, anything that make me not hear my head, my anxiety, and my sadness.  
I been living with this my whole life, and now Im at a point that im burning bridges with my closest friends, being mad for any reasons while they are very far away and dont have a lot of chances to get them back.  


I started to go to a psycologist but at the 2nd session he told me i also need a psychiatrist as well, and Im going back to my neurologist. I m going to try to do all they said but I cant shake the feeling that is all for nothing. I dont know what is going to change. Also I notice my family is getting really affected by this, they are trying to help, but they dont have enough tools, they end up getting mad and saying horrible things, even though i know they are trying to help the only way they can.   


I really dont know what to do because I feel like my life is getting destroyed by myself, and even though i can rationalize that is my sickness, the feeling that is just me who is doing this wont go away.

I feel so burnt out. I‚Äôm 28 and work part time as a teachers assistant and can barely handle the 15-20 hours that I‚Äôm currently working per week and feel like I‚Äôm failing everyone around me. The collective sound of all of the students in my class yelling/speaking and the constant arguing makes me want to break down and cry. I‚Äôve become quiet, distant, bitter, and have to take several bathroom breaks a day to press my knees against my chest and rock back and forth in an attempt to recover some level of peace. 

I want to be kind and patient with myself but I usually just ended up calling myself lazy and unproductive and a waste of space.

I just wanted to know if anyone else on the spectrum has experienced anything similar.",1,autism
"Hello all,

I‚Äôm not a part of this sub, but I‚Äôm here because I don‚Äôt know what other sub I can talk to about this issue. My mother in law is an amazing woman, I love her, she‚Äôs always gone above and beyond for her son, me and our 3 kids. The past couple of years she‚Äôs been talking about people watching her from electronic devices. She refuses to share Wi-Fi passwords with people, even us and when we bought her a smart tv, she put it in storage because she swore someone was watching her. She has two phones, an iPhone and a flip phone. She mainly uses the flip phone with a bandaid covering the camera. She leaves her iPhone in the garage most of the time. We figured that it‚Äôs probably just her not knowing how electronics work, but today she said something that truly worried me. 

She said that she went out to eat at a restaurant the other day and she usually leaves her purse with her iPhone at the table with her husband while she goes to the bathroom. This time she forgot and took her purse with her. When she noticed she took her purse, she decided to leave it in another stall while she went to another to use the toilet. I told her if she has her phone in her purse no one can see her, she said that they can see through her purse! 

We (my husband, i and her husband) have tried talking to her and explaining that no one is watching her, but she insists that God told her they are. I‚Äôm scared of leaving my children with her now. What if she starts to think they are sick and gives them medicine that they shouldn‚Äôt have? Which is something she did once. 

She‚Äôs never gone to the doctor for this, she refuses to, but my husband thinks the medications she takes daily are causing her to be schizophrenic. What can I do to help her? I don‚Äôt want to have to keep her from being alone with my kids, they love her so much.",5,paranoia

"Hi 
I‚Äôm 20, went through a lot of fucked up stuff (abuse etc etc), and still live in the same environment of abuse and all the good stuff you know 
My main issue now is my Major Depressive Disorder , I started anti-depressants at 14-15 years old, I would take it , a while will pass like a year and a half , then it stops working , same happens to the others ( molecules) I would take after the previous stops working but the ‚Äúworking period‚Äù gets shorter and shorter , so I‚Äôll take this one , would work for a year , then stops, take the next chosen molecule, works for a little less than a year , then stops working , and it goes on to today, where the last one I tried  , nothing, I don‚Äôt respond to anti depressants anymore 


Anti depressants not working = depression symptoms ( and ofc they worsened with time progressively all over thoses years as if it wasn‚Äôt enough ) 

I‚Äôm doing bad , really bad , I have no word to describe what I‚Äôm going through , and no will to since i‚Äôve wrote all the long texts expressing it that all I wanna say now is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm living in everyday torture‚Äù

I‚Äôm currently taking ‚Äúbreak yearS‚Äù ( yes pluriel) because of my depression, I can‚Äôt go finish highschool-> because I can‚Äôt study -> because of depression ( right at my last year of highschoolü§© , how lovely isn‚Äôt it ?)

Let‚Äôs say I went to every psychiatrist in my city so far over the years , and like, 5 psychiatrists when it was official that anti depressants aren‚Äôt doing anything ( I didn‚Äôt stop taking them and prescribed medication ) 

Everyday is hell , I really don‚Äôt have the energy to write a lot about details now, specially that I suffer from other things (anxiety disorder , conversion disorder (hysterical attacks) etc etc) , and  , specially that I just came from the ER for a panic/hysterical attack and first time deciding to tell them I‚Äôm extremely suicidal and need assistance ( idk why , Idk how I‚Äôm still here despite being extremely suicidal/attempted , let alone ask for help to not do it , I don‚Äôt get why it is so hard for me to just do it ) and my ‚Äúmother‚Äù made a scene once here home as she religiously do to make it about her , and my father and ‚Äúbrother‚Äù are abusive so I have now flashbacks of all the abuse because my ‚Äúbrother‚Äù is being loud with slamming the doors to join her to wherever she took the car keys to go 

Well , back to what I was saying, I did rTMS ( for simplifying to the ones that don‚Äôt know about it , basically a machine put on your head that send magnetic waves to create changes in your brain to hopefully fix the hormonal mess in it, you are awake (no anesthesia no nothing, you feel it vibrating and irritating your scalp kinda , that‚Äôs it) , and well , IT DIDNT WORK ü§©‚ú® 

Now the ‚Äútrue plan‚Äù is ECT ( yeah electro convulsive therapy , where you are under general anesthesia and they shock you with electricity to create a brief convulsion to , again, fix the mess in your brain) 

Knowing that nothing is for sure when it even comes to the ECT even if it‚Äôs the most effective treatment out of everything ( and results don‚Äôt last ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù anyways ), and that I could , just not feel a change or relapse ( I don‚Äôt believe something good can happen to me anymore lol ) 

The question: Am I ever gonna come out of this? Do I just got to accept that : ‚Äúyep, I‚Äôll never be okay enough to function ‚Äúalmost‚Äù like a normal human , this is it , you are now part of the unwanted people in this society my friend, doctors for sure can‚Äôt tell you that since it will be contradicting to what they are told as a protocol , but we all know that this is it , this is the end , all that striving so you can come back to having a treatment or something that makes you ‚Äúalmost like others‚Äù is from the past now, the reality is , you lost everything , this is it, this is all you‚Äôre ever gonna be from now on  ‚Äù ?",2,depression
"I tried looking this up but could only find people reporting the exact opposite problem...

I can never cry when I'm alone; honestly, I never feel emotions very strongly at all when I'm alone. I'm a 25 y/o man and I consider myself to have a healthy view on crying/emotional release.

I generally consider myself to be a very emotional person. When my girlfriend tells me a sad story from her childhood, I'll tear up. When she says something sweet to me, I'll also tear up. I frequently cry at touching moments in movies, both happy and sad (I guess this is an exception to the ""alone"" thing, but I still feel like I have some emotional company and something to cry about).

I'll occasionally tear up a bit when answering a question from my therapist. Otherwise, I have an extremely hard time crying alone or about my own life, even when I feel exceedingly sad. 

For some context about me: I've dealt with anxiety and depression for most of my life now. I've also struggled with some fairly serious physical health conditions as an adult as well as severe chronic pain.",2,depression

"Hi!

I need your help. And maybe my help helps you?

I was talking to someone about his schrizofrenia and his past and we talked about needs, Maslows piramid of needs.

The base layer is physiological needs. We needs nutricious food, enough water, rest and excercise to have a healthy body. The layer above this layer are safety needs. These two layers are the basic needs of a human.

If you don't feel safe you get fear/ paranoia.

My thoughts are as followed; Trauma can cause two problems:

- Not able to fill in the needs to feel safe and secure.
- Not able to guard boundaries so you don't feel safe and secure.

If my partner is able to define her needs, she can fill them; and if she is able to define which boundaries are crossed, she can learn and develop strategies and skills to fill her needs and guard her boundaries.

Basically when we are young our caretakers teach us how to do so, but if they are the ones who took away the needs or crossed the boundaries... how could you have learned these strategies and skills from them?

My question for you is:

Can you verify my thought process? 

If you reflect on yourself, how are your skills in filling you needs for savety and security and how are your skills in guarding your boundaries so you can feel safe an secure?

If is all about a lack in strategy and skills, I'll be able to ask for specific help for my partner so she can learn and develop herself and hopefully be rid of paranoia.

Thanks for reading and I hope some of you take the time to respond. I see my partner suffer so much.. and I want for her to have a normal life.

And as an extra question: What environment / situation would be the best for you to start building these strategies and skills?",5,paranoia

And now, I just can't think of avoiding them. I didn't, and still don't know what to do with my life. I have ADHD and probably developed through depression some personality disorder, but having ADHD and growing tired and bored with things kinda fast, I just can't work, between being in a office, working 6 days out of 7 like my mother does, I prefer die. The only thing that can bring me joy, are gaming, but I guess with the many people doing it, the little pubblic being Italian gives, and being shy/depressed myself, that can't turn in to a job; the other thing is art. I went to an art high-school, and I had a wonderful time, finding friends and teachers that I liked, even if sometimes it was rough, and there was Covid in the middle of everything, I knew it was worth it. Then, nearly a year ago, it ended. I didn't found anything beyond it, I didn't know how to be an artist, all my friends were too far away, not even in the near cities, I didn't know what do to with my life. I thought I could get that figured out in time, while I attended an art university, but has since passed a year, I still don't know what to do, and everything that teached me university is pointless, nothing I can't find on the most basic of the YT channels.

Now, I'm thinking, they were right, not for the reasons they gave me, of course, but I am wrong, I can't find my place in the world. Even if I quit university, what's in then for me? Finding a job that I'm going to hate and quit? Waiting to become a famous artist while playing tons of videogames? Very recently I'm starting to wish that when I go to sleep, I don't want to wake up.

"I finished moving out of my room in my apartment today. I was having so much paranoia and mistrust of my roommates. I got my exit and I left. The biggest thing being thinking there's a camera in my room. I kept dismissing the thought. But it was so persistent. It just kept coming back. It was better for my mental health to leave, and live with people I knew I could trust, regardless of fault in this relationship. But I kept going back and forth. Thinking there really was a camera and the roommates really were saying the things I thought they were. And then telling myself that that's a delusion and I need to let it go for my own health. I've been out of the apartment since September but just finished grabbing the very last of my things today. I'm stressed. Sure, I bought a house and there's a lot of things on my mind including other things at work and family things. But as pressed as I've been I've been staying positive or atleast neutral. Today was a stressful day. A lot of things to do and my new roommate was mia for health reasons. Plus I had done a carpet patch and I was worried the roommates would complain about the quality since the color was not an exact match. So maybe it was that. All the stress and worry and anxiety. About finally saying goodbye to them. But then, as I went to finally leave. For the last time. I came up to my roomate sitting on the couch to say goodbye. And I swear. On her phone. She was watching my face. I didn't get a great look and I have trouble recognizing myself in videos and photos. But as I walked out the door. I swear I heard her start to say to her boyfriend ""she saw.."" This is why I have to leave. Real or not it's causing me severe mental distress. But the idea that there really has been a camera in my room this whole time. The idea that all this psychosis I've been worried about struggling with for my whole life. Is actually just gaslighting.

"I have diagnosed ADHD with multiple comormidities: major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, mood disorder with bipolar features (meaning I just barely don't meet the diagnostic criteria for bipolar 1 or 2), and stimulant abuse disorder (in remission). I haven't abused stimulants in 10+ years.

To spice things up, I also have a rare metabolic disorder - glutaric aciduria type 2 late onset. Google it if you want, but basically my body doesn't produce the necessary enzymes for me to properly metabolize fat. There is no cure, and the symptoms include exercise intolerance and extreme fatigue. The treatment is a high carbohydrate, low fat and low protein diet. I cannot go into a calorie deficit at all or I will start to metabolically decompensate, which means a hospital stay for fluids and monitoring. I've been hospitalized seven times since my initial diagnosis two years ago. I've also gained 20lbs.

I recently switched psychiatrists because the one I had been seeing for 12+ years has no expertise in metabolic disorders, and he's located two hours away. I was also having issues with the old psychiatrist re: stimulant meds. Non stimulant medication has never been effective for me. I've literally tried them all. I need supratherapeutic doses of medications like Concerta or Vyvanse to have any effect at all, and my old psychiatrist viewed that as drug-seeking behavior.

My new psychiatrist has been practicing at Massachusetts General Hospital for 25+ years, went to Harvard medical, and lectures at Yale. He's been doing academic research in the psychiatric presentation of digestive illnesses for the past 10+ years. After our first appointment two weeks ago, he took me off all my old meds (prozac, Seroquel) and put me on abilify, lamictal, and trazodone. No ADHD treatment at all due to history of drug seeking behavior (obviously he and the old psychiatrist talked, which I authorized). Since I've gone on these new meds, I am sleeping excessively - like I go to bed at midnight and don't wake up until 4pm the next day. I'm crying spontaneously with very little provocation. I can't take care of my toddler (thank God for our nanny), I've been unemployed for 8 months, and I can't perform the most basic tasks like showering, cleaning (thank God for the maids), and cooking dinner for our family. My poor husband is pulling all the weight, and I feel like such a failure. I just want my life back. I want to be the wife and mother my family deserves.

I have a second appointment with my new psychiatrist tomorrow morning and plan to share all of this with him. My husband (who is a primary care MD) went through the ASRS ADHD assessment with me and had me write down concrete examples for each question, as well as how it's affecting my life. Despite severe symptoms having tangible negative impacts on every aspect of my life, he strongly cautioned me against asking for stimulant meds due to my history. 

I completely broke down. My husband sees how bad I am and feels the consequences more than anyone, but even in his professional opinion, I shouldn't have access to the treatment I need because I abused it in my 20s.

I don't know what to do anymore and feel so helpless. If I can't get the treatment I need, what's the point? I don't want to live this life being a disappointment and a burden to everyone I care about. 

I'm not looking for advice or answers, I just really need to vent. Thanks for reading if you got this far.",3,adhd

Not close like that with either one of my family, only really my Nan and she‚Äôs elderly so I don‚Äôt want her to stress about anything hence why I can‚Äôt even talk to her about certain things in my life. 
I have a lot of unhealed trauma that I just keep pushing to the back of my mind. 

I‚Äôve basically fucked things up with the guy I really like, might even love him. But it‚Äôs the fact that we aren‚Äôt even together so it‚Äôs just so weird. He‚Äôs around me 24/7 vice versa, but my trust issues and insecurities just makes things worse. I‚Äôve grown up in a house full of arguments and it‚Äôs like l can‚Äôt be normal around him without feeling the need to argue. 
I pretty sure he doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with me and I honestly hate it. 

Life in general is just so shit. Has been shit for quite a while I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore‚Ä¶",2,depression

"I've been going to therapy since the past few months, and it's lowkey working fortunately. But I still feel a tad empty and hollow. Things seldom excite me or make me feel actually happy. It's just me who's putting all these conscious efforts to keep myself sane and happy and it's tiring. It was never like this before, happiness was natural and quick to come and never felt like a chore. The more I delve deep into myself and my life the more I realise that life is indeed pointless and I struggle to find meaning in any of the stuff I try to work towards. Logic seems to fail when I'm overpowered by my emotions. I've got a life ahead of me but these feelings of hopelessness haunt me. I'm struggling to find out what's actually causing me this and how did my perspective on life change so quick. I don't know where life is heading.",2,depression

"Basically, a car followed me to my house, which is on a loop.  This loop is the very last section of a larger neighborhood.  Only one way in and out.  Single street access to this loop.  I am new to the neighborhood, so I don't know many peoples cars yet.  My house is the first at this loop, where it meets the street, so everyone who lives in this back neighborhood (30 houses).  This car follows me all the way home (about a 13 min drive with 9 different turns).  Nothing about their driving was suspicous besides the fact that they were behind me the entire way.  They made each turn I made, then when I parked at my house, I thought to myself, let me sit here and see if that car that followed me leaves this neighborhood loop.  Sure enough, that car circled the entire loop in less than a minute and left.  I took a picture of the license plate.  Now I know there's a possibility that other car driver near me, and maybe they just needed to drop something off real quick then leave back out, which seems very rational.  But I am a paranoid person.  Do you all think it was probably coincidence?  I will probably go out late tonight and see if that car is visibly parked at any of the other houses and hope to God I see it.  Yea, I have a problem.  Thoughts?",5,paranoia
"Hi

I 15(M) won't succeed in life. You probably when you read this think, ""how can this guy be so sure about that he won't succeed in anything?""

I'm so sure in that, because I don't do anything all day have to repeat a year in school. I don't have any good friends and just am suffering.

I don't do anything which helps me. My mother tells me, how much I ruined her life. I can't even shower consistently so, how should I manage to have a successful life? I just simply can't. 

I guess many people will say that ""I shouldn't compare myself, everyone goes at a different pace."" I guess everyone goes at a different pace but for me comparing is essential. Because through comparing I see how much I failed.

My stepdad pushed once pushed me down ths stairs because I didn't shower, which is understandable. Also I told psychologist and staff in my mental hospital, which i'm in that my stepdad did that and they said it wasn't severe enough for an intervention.

I'm a failure. I have to repeat a year and everything. I also don't deserve anything in the world other better and more kinder people deserve all the success.

I'm in my early 20s and in college. 3rd year specifically and am an Education major(A.K.A. I do wish to b e a teacher). And I just feel absolutely worn out. In the last month my girlfriend of 4 years broke it off with me, I had to visit  several wakes of my friends(this includes my uncle, my old teacher, a few friends from Church) have my money stolen from my crackhead brother and am having anxiety attacks which stop me from actually moving forward with my research papers and other school papers.

As I write this, I'm trying not to fall apart as I've been informed that I'm failing two subjects and have no time to revise or redo any of these projects.

&#x200B;

I'm just done. It's been so long, I'm so fatigued, school is hell, especially in asia which gives us more than 25 units each sem. I'm sorry if this may sound like a stupid copypasta or may sound like I'm Karma farming or shit... It's just. I need some support if that's okay.

"I may be out of place here since I am a teen and could just be playing victim of depression however I just want to vent out. A lot of stuff happened in my life, at age 10 my dad left me without saying a word. At Age 11 my family broke off and we all had separated ourselves. It is hard, having the responsibilities that I should not shoulder but who am I to complain? I want to ask my mom to bring me to a psychiatrist for I thought I have depression since I am showing off symptoms but I thought it was just my imaginations and I shrug it off. But as years passed I am lost. ""What am I supposed to do?"", ""How can I do this?"", ""How should I carry out my responsibilities plus the responsibilities I have to shoulder?"" These questions pop in my head. And now here I am, in reddit asking people what should I do, to be honest I'm tired of continuing my journey in life and sleep eternally 6 feet under. When all hell is let loose I am always the one to blame, in every chaos I am the troublemaker, in every bad situation I am always the one to blame. I've had enough already, this journey of mine feels nothing more than a freight train of pain and suffering. It irritates me that I have no power nor the materials to improve myself and rely on what is presented at the table. I feel useless as if I exist as a mere jester to make people laugh at me. I just want someone to value that I exist and that I have feelings but looks like it ain't happening. I guess this might be the fruit of my sinful life, and everything is just the consequences of my actions. Anyways, I hope you guys have your salvations and live a desirable life.

"So, I have this friend. And as far as I can tell, he is a genuinely kind person who has been *exceedingly* (I'd go as far as to say entirely too) kind to me and genuinely enjoys my presence... And I feel like a complete jerk for it but I can't shake the feeling that he secretly thinks I'm a loser which is probably just projection because *I* think I'm a loser because I *am* a loser and he is more or less a normal person with a job and a life and other friends and I haven't been able to maintain any other friendships so why would a nice normal person *want* to be friends with me? Not to mention I've already ghosted him twice during a depressive episode and he's been patient and gentle with me through it which just makes me feel worse and through no fault of his own makes me feel more like the dumb little mentally ill pet that he says nice things to in order to placate me so I don't do anything stupid.

We're both writers (not published or anything, mostly as a hobby) and even that is a constant source of unwarranted paranoia on my part. I regularly show him drafts of things I'm working on for feedback and he always tells me that it's good and that I'm talented. So naturally my awful gremlin brain latches onto the idea that either 1. he's just complimenting my abilities so much to humor me because I'm his sad loser friend who doesn't have the attention span to do anything *but* write and he pities me (bolstered by the fact that he tends to not actually have any criticisms of my work despite them constantly being contrived, formulaic and absolutely *riddled* with typos) or 2. if it's so good then one day he'll steal my ideas and put them forth as his own because he actually has a body of work posted that people like and expect more of and he wants to keep up with demand (I've been too much of a coward to share my work with anyone but him thus far). I have no reason to believe either of these, especially not the second one. The first one maybe, I can definitely see him being the type to be too nice to accurately call me out on my BS especially now that he knows I'm depressed but there is *literally* no evidence of him stealing other people's work and even if he did, his stuff's already good, he wouldn't need to market my trash ideas as his own, and he's just a good-hearted, talented and (I pray) honest person who doesn't deserve to be suspected of something so underhanded.

I feel awful because he's great and absolutely deserves a friend who isn't an obsessive paranoid little freak and he's always telling me how much he likes talking to me and it just puts me more on edge cuz I'm always anticipating the day that he no longer likes talking to me and this is why it's easier to just not have friends, as sad as I am when I'm alone >\_\_\_>

Even when we're just speaking about random stuff, I always get the feeling that I'm asking too many questions or misunderstanding too many things or just plain being an idiot and he always reassures me that I'm not and I'm fine but *of course* he'd say that if he didn't want to hurt my feelings by being upfront about what an awkward weirdo I am >\_\_\_\_\_\_>

"I hosted a house party with my partner once and I swear I could hear his friends talk shit about me and make fun of me behind my back. At times I could hear them say shit to my face but as I was the host, I somehow went through the night without confronting them or creating a scene. As soon as they left, I told my partner about everything that happened and he swore none of the things I was accusing his friends of were true. But I heard them loud and clear. It wasn‚Äôt even whispers. 

This has happened in the past too, whenever we meet someone in a social setting..people always talk shit about me/directed to me and my partner always claims that it never happened. How do I know what I am hearing is actually real ? I know I hear voices, it‚Äôs usually my own voice. But when I am with people, I hear them in their voice.

"Does it make you feel angry too when people use the word depression inappropriately?  I just wish people understood that depression is not just feeling sad but it is something that actually affects your lifestyle and is debilitating in every way.  The incorrect use of this word bothers me a lot not because it takes away something from my condition but because I think that if you use it incorrectly you start to be treated less seriously. I've been suffering from depression for several years now and when I hear some of my friends say ""I don't feel like going out because I'm depressed"" it really makes me angry.  There is a difference between feeling down occasionally from feeling bad almost every day. Am I exaggerating in saying this in your opinion?",2,depression
"I‚Äôve suffered from depression most of my life, but growing there was at least always some piece of future optimism I could hold onto. Moments of clarity and ambition.

In the 90s and early 2000s the world seemed optimistic too. Yea it wasn‚Äôt perfect, but as a whole society didn‚Äôt seem as bleak. Almost like everyone was moving in the same direction. People of different political parties could at least get along somewhat, politicians at least pretended to not be psychopaths‚Ä¶conspiracy theories were seen as fringe. People could genuinely get excited about new technologies. 

I‚Äôm in my early 30s now, I have a wife, a good paying job‚Ä¶.but Im having a harder and harder time finding any positivity to hold onto anymore.

My many metrics were living in the safest and most prosperous time in human history. The average person has more personal convenience  and luxury than ever before. Wars are less frequent, access to information is universals Al.

But everything feels somehow much darker and bleaker. Social media is dystopian. Political division and corruption feels dystopian. Things like AI advances feel dystopian, sucking up all ambition among artists to be creative. Society almost seems poisoned by disinformation‚Ä¶nobody trusts anybody or any news. Everybody is selfish, and we‚Äôre destroying everything on the planet.

Once I'm not with people around me, or more specifically people who could hit, judge or shout at me, I do no more than playing or doing exactly what immature idiot things I can do until I die.
