"Yesterday my psychologist called to tell me about my evaluation. She told me there is no doubt that I have a moderate combined type ADHD. I finally have a diagnosis after a 2 year wait! ü•π Now my crying 31 y/o ass just needs to wait for treatment ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Sadly when I called my mom (who most likely also has this fantastic dx however she's clinically undiagnosed), she told me something that broke my heart completely. Evidently my dad had discussed some concerns about my behavior with her when I was about 7 y/o, but mom just brushed those concerns aside and continued as if nothing ever happened. I'm really trying to not think of ""what could have been"" but it's freaking difficult when I know that there were people advocating for me as a struggling kid but no help was given to that poor kid who didn't understand why she was different ü•≤

So now I'm torn between happiness, understanding, massive sorrow & relief, and also just plain anger.

Thanks for listening to my rant üíï",3,adhd

"a little brief background about me. i feel like i always had anxiety growing up. at the time, i didn't know what it was nor i was familiar with terms such as *depression, anxiety, mental health, etc.* so it didn't occur to me that i had anything of that nature. i wouldn't say i had intense moments of anxiety, so much that i couldn't live out of my life, but definitely abnormal tendencies, though not to the extreme.

after a very traumatizing part of my life at the age of 19, i have since noticed more of this. i could feel a big jump from the anxiety i had before, after, and in present day. before, i had a little bit of it, but it was manageable. after, it was like i was constantly on anxious mode all the time (heavy breathing, instantly triggered, weird feeling of scaredness/worriedness/on-the-edge every second of the day). after 3 years of having CBT, working it out with therapists, gaining more experience, and time, i am in a much better place, though i do feel like NOW i am not directly affected by anything, but more so still dealing with the reminiscences and habits that i had gained from these past experiences. for example, sometimes i get anxious for absolutely no reason. i just wake up one day and boom, anxious. it's happened so often that i can sort of estimate when i'd have my next anxious day because it happens almost so consistently. another example would be my fear of men. 19-22 year old me was absolutely scared of men, and although i have come a long way, i still feel uncomfortable around men. i identify men as men. the first thought i have when i am interacting with men is that they are men, *what if they this and that*, *what if he asks me something that makes me uncomfortable* and i don't say no, or, *can i trust myself around him?* i definitely brought this up to my therapist. unfortunately, we only had 12 weeks together, for it was free and based on a study, but due to limited time we weren't exactly able to work on it.

anyways, what i am trying to get at is that i am definitely getting better. i am seeing the changes, but... will i always be this way? is this who i will be like for the rest of my days? am i never actually gonna defeat anxiety?

i want to add that i am in no way trying to minimize real individuals with real experiences of anxiety. i know that there are a lot of people in this world who deal with severe anxiety so i don't mean to offend anyone. i am hoping to look for some clarity with all of this and to rant as well.

Edit: after doing some more research, i can confirm that i am at a healthier place with my anxiety! that is to say that i believe that my anxiety is more or less of the normal ""quantity"" that all humans are innate with. i think what makes me slightly ore anxious than the average human is that because i have experienced intense moments of anxiety in my past, i get a little more anxious due to the anxiety because it takes me back to a place that i do not want to remember. however, there are other parts of my life like my fear towards the presence of men that are a constant in my life, and some might categorize that as an interference in my regular and everyday life. i hope that makes sense.",4,anxiety

"I've been feeling anxiety with paranoia. False beliefs and it has got worse in the lockdown over the year which has affected some relationships. When I drink the false beliefs increase and negativity, at least it does at the moment, something that didn't happen before.

If something bad happens I believe it is for a reason and will think it could be due to my father, for example, or such. Same online I can believe similar things. I might think my aunt is secretly doing stuff behind my back, and then my behavior towards her will be worse as a result.

"Just for reference I live a full life most mornings are spent doing something I truly enjoy wether that be walking around downtown, playing piano or even just cooking my favorite meal (homestyle ramen) I love my job and my coworkers and have a beautiful friend group that I frequently hang out with and have a great time with. But I find myself bored and generally just unamused with everything. I know one of my issues is my own knowledge of that fact that none of it matters in the slightest, I'm not religious or hold any beliefs in anything whatsoever, I mean shit I don't even believe in luck. I have come to terms with my own mortality through a couple very close calls. Knowing that nothing matters has given me more personal freedom than I ever would've thought myself to have. I feel truly free to enjoy myself as I please and everyone including me knows I'm a kind and gentle human. But here I am, chronically bored. At this point I don't know what to do, I have everything I could possibly want, so why do I feel this way. Will it ever be different? Maybe I'm just tired of existing.",2,depression

"Hello

I have chronophobia.
I hate looking at something and then check the date and realise it happened 3 months ago!
I fear happy moments because right when they are happening I know they will become memories. And then I'll have nostalgia and feel bad.

My worst memories? The good ones. Because that moment is over and is never coming back.

Most of my memories are very vivid so I feel like everything happened 2 weeks ago at most.

I hate time passing. I don't have a fear of death, I couldn't care less about my own death because the outcome is either heaven or nothingness. Either way I'll be fine.

I fear for my loved ones: ageing, becoming more tired, more sick and eventually dying.

I fear others moving on with life because I feel left behind. I hate looking at the calendar and think ""last year, on that same day this happened with my friend and it wzs super fun... 1 year later, same day same hour she has left the city and we barely chat.""

Why am I feeling like this? Does anyone feel the same.",4,anxiety

I rarely ever vomit or get sick, but I litteraly cannot eat at all. I've tried foods such as bread & jelly but all it led to was nausea & a really bad panic attack. Since this keeps happening whenever I eat, I haven't eaten in the last 5 days.

I have been surviving on water, gatorade & smoothies. I completley forgot how to eat & I'm scared I'm gonna die or end up in hospital from starvation. My fear & anxiety has never ever been this bad. I'm getting medication tommorow for it, but I'm just scared my body will shut down.",5,paranoia

"I feel like I‚Äôve finally reached the last stage of depression which is acceptance. I think there‚Äôs 5 stages to depression, or, there has been for me anyway that are the same 5 stages of grief. The first stage was denial, this was stage I was in for the longest, I simply denied that I was depressed. Of course at first I wasn‚Äôt actually sure if it was depression, I was only 12 not long started high school so I wasn‚Äôt sure if I even fully understood what depression was further than just being ‚Äòsad all the time‚Äô. I denied that something was wrong when my parents started to question why I was sleeping at any point I could and why I slowly withdrew from everything that previously granted me joy. I denied that I was suicidal and that I had thoughts about how I would kill myself to the school counsellor at 14 who had been asked to see me due to my declining behaviour in school and increasing distribution to lessons or the increasing amount of times I‚Äôd not turn up to the lessons all together. I even denied that I was depressed to myself for a long time, I wrote it off as being a teenager and the crazy hormones that occur when you are that age. 

Anger was the second stage. I was absolutely furious that I felt like this, that I had to be miserable and bitter, that I had to struggle to do even the most basic of things and most of all that it was something so difficult to fight. I was aggressive and mean towards everyone, taking my self hatred and anger out any anything and anyone. Third came bargaining, I rang the GP at least once a week asking about therapy or some form of counselling and was told at least once a week that there is a very long waiting list to see any sort of counsellor and that I was looking at around a year long waiting list until I‚Äôd even be able to start counselling over the phone. I prayed to every god or form of omnipotence that I could, I am not religious but I prayed, I begged for god or the universe or anything to help. To make me feel normal, to make me want to socialise with my friends, to let me be satisfied, to let me feel joy, to let me sleep or eat normally, to give me desire to want to do anything with my life, for luck friendship love anything, just to feel happy again. 

Depression was the fourth stage. I know what you‚Äôre thinking how can depression be the fourth stage if I‚Äôm taking about the stages of depression. To be as frank as possible I was depressed that I was depressed. I was in despair, There was not one single drop of hope left, it‚Äôs as if any last bit of light that was still shining in my life  lost power. No therapist or doctor was going to help me, no friend or family member, no god or higher power, nothing I was going to be depressed forever, and this broke me even further. 

I have finally reached the final stage. Acceptance. I have accepted that this is my life. I will always be depressed and thats that kind of. I will never beat this and things won‚Äôt get better because I‚Äôm 21 and by now they would have. I have no talent, no luck on my side, no future, no hope, no qualifications, no romantic experience what so ever, no good looks, I have nothing. And that is how it will be, that is my life‚Äôs path, someone has to be the person that you knew in school who went absolutely no where and lived on a council estate with no job on benefits for there whole adult life and that will be me. I quit my job two days ago. I‚Äôve given up. I‚Äôve accepted it for what it is.

I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else feels like there at this stage or has been in this stage or way for longer and if there is any next steps I‚Äôm unaware of. I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôve gone on too much, I‚Äôm not too familiar with posting and once I started typing i couldn‚Äôt stop. 

Also I‚Äôd anyones wondering why if I‚Äôm at this point why don‚Äôt I just end it all. I cannot currently do that due to be told by more than one person that if I were to die they themselves would bring about their own death. As you can imagine I do not want to be that cause of someone else‚Äôs death especially knowing the people that would be affected by there‚Äôs.",2,depression

"Overwhelm is a mean ol‚Äô bastard. 

I left a super toxic job to start my home-based business and I‚Äôve been swimming upstream since. Problem is: No insurance and no money = No meds. No meds = no executive functioning.

"its a more or less a thought ive had since ive been extremely suicidal and pessimistic since age 5/6, ive always been extremely existential/nihilistic to a point of obsessiveness and compulsion, ive also had chronic health issues be in terms of chronic pain, severe epilepsy, and other huge medical events. I learned about nihilism from a book i was reading in grade one that i stumbled onto at the library.it made sense, my life sucked then,still sucks, and will continue to stuck in the future. I dont have some grand traumatic event that made me have these thoughts or at least i do think ?. i just kinda put my thoughts in order after reading a book. i was never abused or at least i don't think ? i was neglected by a legal definition sure but i only had one extremely poor parent so its expected - emotionally and physically. before my diagnosis a few years ago i never understood why i was so much slower than most kids as i started to reach the integral ages of 7-11 and began to noticeably slow down brain and intelligence development. i was below average in school and only did good on tests,after age 10 everything became so much harder. i never had friends before or any of that so i was already extremely behind in that regard, along with worsening grades, i just couldn't keep up with normal people and that continues to today. im doing terribly in school due to chronic pain from brain injury and now found genetic condition (CJS) which basically just degrades you quickly as you age, which i guess makes sense in my hilariously pathetic existence. Ive tried jobs and failed, i can barely function as a human my age and i dont see much of a real future. i also don't have a easily obtainable bucket list which includes travel and things like romance but i could take it or leave it tbh. ive kinda resided myself to that those luxury are for normal or rich people. i don't really see a point in my future ? im two grades behind in high-school due to my health issues and now im almost entirely reliant on passing a highschiool early out exam or dropout.my existence has just been a comedic play to someone i bet, reel out that carrot on a stick and give me one positive event only for 99 negative things to happen. i dont really see an end to my mindset either. obviously some parts are confirmation bias to an extent but when your told your entire life is confirmation bias it feels a little stupid. i dont have a long reason or point to life to stay around past 18 ? if anyone's got any ideas id like to hear them. there most likely not obtainable but im a severe maladaptive day dreamer so i could always imagine it. thanks for reading",1,autism

"I‚Äôve been off & on ADHD meds for about 14 years now. First Concerta, then Adderall. I started Adderall again about a year ago when I realized my depression was caused by the constant stress caused by my inability to stay focused & follow things through to completion.

I started at 10mg xr for four months, that was working really well. Decided with my psych to move up to 15mg xr, took that for 8 months. 

Then the lovely shortage started. Around this time my psych & I noticed I could benefit from an increase in dosage. We were aiming for 20mg. With the availability that turned into 20mg one month, 25mg the next, 15mg after that, 15mg XR with a 5mg IR the next. Dextro here, amphetamine here.

"24 F.
I‚Äôm gonna try and keep this short. 
First of all I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm autistic or not. I had part of an autism assessment with a psychiatrist today but had some technical difficulties so it was cut short and they want me to do another appointment at the end of the week. At the end of the appointment they said they are not sure I meet the threshold for autism but have some similarities so they want to talk more. 

To be honest I‚Äôm not 100% sure myself if I have autism. And I don‚Äôt have a problem being diagnosed, I actually want to know for sure!
I can relate to some things but totally can‚Äôt relate to other things. It was actually my elder sister‚Äôs idea that I get an assessment as she feels i‚Äôve exhibited  autistic traits since childhood and autism/adhd runs in the family. However some of my family members think I‚Äôm not autistic and just have lack of confidence, anxiety issues and say I‚Äôve been coddled by mother too much. So it‚Äôs very confusing for me. 

The reasons I think I could be autistic:

I did not speak as a young child except to my mother, when I started infant school age 5 teachers were concerned because I wasn‚Äôt engaging and I wasn‚Äôt making friends. Eventually I did make a friend thanks to help of my mother. When I started secondary school I managed to make a couple friends and then was suddenly introduced to a group of friends. I never kept in touch with friends from school though and I never felt that close to them. It was almost like we were just acquaintances more than friends. I was bullied at the end of high school by one of the ‚Äòfriends‚Äô in the group and then I just distanced myself from everyone and became a loner. Still in adulthood I have a heard time talking to people, I get super anxious and feeling like I can‚Äôt get the words out. I am not very social with family members, I feel like an outcast, I don‚Äôt know what to say or how to engage. I was diagnosed with social anxiety when I was 18 and tried CBT therapy but that didn‚Äôt really work. I‚Äôve been on different antidepressants and they also haven‚Äôt helped for the anxiety. My anxiety has gotten to the point I find it hard to leave the house by myself, I don‚Äôt go anywhere unless accompanied by my mother, I don‚Äôt take public transport anymore because I get anxious and worried about not finding my way around. I don‚Äôt have friends or a social life.

I failed in school. I was in the lower sets for all of my classes. Again I found it hard to engage or ask for help. I feel like classroom environments, the noise, distractions, constantly observing myself and trying to fit in made it hard for me to focus. I pretty much remember day dreaming and zoning out in all my lessons and wasn‚Äôt able to process or take in what the teachers were saying. I had some support from a supply teacher but it was never 1 on 1 so it wasn‚Äôt that helpful. 

I enjoy alone time, I prefer being at home on my own or with my mum. 
After socialisation I need alone time to recoup. In some social settings I will even try to remove myself by leaving early or going to a more quiet place away from others. 

I did not enjoy school, hated getting up in the mornings and still do. My mum used to bribe me into school with food or saying she‚Äôll treat me afterwards. I never had tantrums or anything I would just look grumpy and be cold in mood. 

I enjoyed some imaginary games with friends as a kid, I feel like this was because there was less pressure to be social if that makes any sense?
I also preferred games were there wasn‚Äôt a need for much communication involved. 

Sometimes when there‚Äôs loud noises or if someone next to me is taking loud I cover my ears with my hands instead of asking people if they can talk quieter. 

I have found it hard to keep a job. The longest was a week. My last job was night shifts at a warehouse, I purposely chose night shifts hoping there would be less people but I don‚Äôt think that made a difference. After 3 10 hour shifts I quit. I physically felt unable to keep up with demands and was falling behind. I did enjoy elements of the job and if I were able to only do those things and not the others, I probably would‚Äôve stayed longer. I also always feel a pressure to make friends with colleagues and don‚Äôt want to be left out. I feel like I‚Äôm the target of bullying or judgement if I don‚Äôt make friends. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs such an important thing for me to make friends and be liked at work. I guess it makes it more enjoyable for me. 

Reasons I think I might not be autistic: 

I have never had / have no special interests or obsessions. When I told the psychiatrist this I could tell they were taken back and probably expected me to at least have 1. 

I don‚Äôt have any attachments to physical/material things. Apart from my phone and tablet, but that‚Äôs common in this generation right? Using my phone and tablet is my hobby I guess you could say. 
If anything, I would probably say I‚Äôd get more attached to people than to things. For instance I‚Äôve always had a close bond and attachment to my mother, I stayed friends with the same person from primary school into secondary school because it felt familiar and safe. Age 5 I had the same friend till adulthood. 

I have never had / don‚Äôt have emotional outbursts. I hold my emotions in and then have a meltdown when I‚Äôm by myself in my home. 

I don‚Äôt think I have many sensory issues. Strong / bad smells are main ones but again that‚Äôs ‚Äònormal‚Äô right?

I don‚Äôt have picky or disordered eating. I‚Äôve always enjoyed various foods. 

I feel pretty good at telling how someone is thinking or feeling by tone of voice, body language, behaviour. 

I get sarcasm mostly. 

PS. There‚Äôs so much more I could go into but I wont lol. 

I mean if I don‚Äôt get the diagnosis, what do I do? Do I accept that I‚Äôm not autistic? Should I still say that I am because I can sort of relate? Do I seek another diagnosis?",1,autism

"I‚Äôm in this discord server and every single time I say something not absolutely literal, or make a claim outlandish, everyone just spams the chat and laughs and then just ignores me having to explain myself. I used to reply in small responses to try and stand up for myself against any single claim, but at one point I decided that every single message would just get buried. So i would just put everything i need to say in one text and send it, except now i‚Äôm being made fun of for constantly sending ‚Äúwalls of text.‚Äù 

Every single conversation like that becomes an argument and it looks more and more like I‚Äôm the villain when the reality is i only talk about things I‚Äôm confident in and when i‚Äôm wrong i admit i‚Äôm wrong; and if i don‚Äôt know something I ask questions and will immediately correct it to fit the facts. But this group of people constantly insist i‚Äôm wrong instead of taking 2 seconds to listen to my perspective, and in the rare chance that i can actually convey what i mean correctly and adequately, they do admit i have a point. But i always feel like i have a point and before i can correctly explain it, they‚Äôre already making fun of me or just dismiss it entirely.

I know at the end of the day nobody has an ego and everyone involved has the power to be convinced, i just feel like i‚Äôm constantly having to explain myself and nobody ever takes time to give a piece of mind to my perspective, i feel like it‚Äôs always constantly dismissed. I‚Äôve found that in other social situations people do like my thoughts and ideas, so I feel like I have built up enough reputation to have confidence; but in others i feel like they‚Äôre totally dismissed purely because i can‚Äôt ever convey it correctly.

And to clarify, unfriending them is not an option. This is intrinsically a problem with me and i don‚Äôt know how to handle it. Thank you",3,adhd

"TW: Su\*cide mentions

Well, I have death anxiety. It's already affecting my life as a whole, but since a while ago I get very very paranoid. When I started dating my boyfriend, he had some su\*cidal thoughts and I always got afraid that he would act on them. I started having panic attacks and intrusive thougts anytime I ""felt"" he had done something when he took long hours or days to answer a text or post something, yet nothing had happened he was just busy and stuff. I started to see (or maybe notice) posts or comics or any type of media regarding people seeing their partner die, or being widowed. He actually attempted su\*cide at some point last year, thankfully getting help and he's doing so much better now and is improving. But I keep seeing these posts and I keep thinking they're a signal of the future to tell me that it's going to happen to me, and I'm getting so so afraid of that because I really can't escape all this media regarding this and now I don't know if something bad is going to happen or how I can prevent it or if it just mere coincidence and just starting noticing this topic because I'm particularly afraid of it now...",5,paranoia

I've tried every single non-benzo anxiety medication and none of them work. I'm also prescribed suboxone and no provider at all will seem to prescribe benzos even though I originally got my script from an inpatient psychiatric stay. I'm really close to going back to the mental hospital just to get my ativan refilled because I'm having panic attacks like crazy and it's making it impossible to do anything and I feel suicidal and hopeless. I have to get a job and take observed drug tests for probation and both give me really bad fear, the latter from childhood sexual trauma.

Because I have addiction on my record am I never going to have a chance of feeling better? I feel like I'm shunned from getting actual help from the mental health system now that I have a suboxone prescription on my record. I've tried every single anti anxiety medication except for benzos and lyrica; basically they don't want to try any controlled substances.

 Recently I was laid off from a job I really liked. That sent me into a spiral because I thought I was finally going somewhere with my life. I have a new job now, and the thought of going to work tomorrow is really weighing down on me. I feel like I am being sucked into a void that I will never return from. It's a 9-5 desk job and those jobs have always made my depression worse. How do you work through these really low moments? Thanks in advance.",2,depression
"When I was a child my mom would tell me those stories abt murder cases/serial killers and I think it kinda traumatised me because I was really young and she did this for some years. It was to tell me to be careful but I think I am really TOO careful and I really want to change.
 Since I have ADHD I was wondering if there was a link too..

In middle school I used to go to school with a knife or a fork in my pocket (a fork because I knew carrying a knife could get me into troubles). I did it less often in HS and only sometimes now in uni, when I know I will come back late. This is not bcz I'm less scared but bcz I know how weird I would seem if people saw me with a knife of fork. I sleep with a knife next to my bed at night (again since at least middle school). 

I experience nightmares of being chased extremely often.. Usually I wake up when the person who is chasing me (to kill me) catch me (so I don't experience the killing/pain. It's like when they catch me I die so I'm waking up). Sometimes I know the face/backstory of those killers (which are made up) and sometimes I don't see them at all, I just know they're chasing me. When I turn back I know they're here and I die without seeing their faces. When I'm outside, especially at night, I always get paranoid about killers. Every person (more like every man even if I can get suspicious of women too but it's much more rare) becomes a potential serial killer to me and I hurry home. I can have very short hallucinations of people (mostly killers) because I'm scanning everywhere in alert mode. Those hallucinations are like 1 second long or less so it's not really serious. Specifically, my worst fear is someone/ a serial killer coming to kill me at night in my room. I can become very suspicious at night alone in my room for no reason. I imagine that someone is trying to break in into my room, or is on the roof of the building and will try to come through the window. It gets me in very unpleasant states where I feel almost dizzy, it's like the world suddenly seem so suspicious and scary. Like if my room completely changed, there is a filter that changes it and now every furniture becomes unfamiliar to me, my whole environment becomes threatening and I have this irrational fear that someone is going to come in at any moment to kill me so I can't sleep. 

More than death, I'm afraid of suffering, being tortured or raped. Sometimes I feel so bad I think I want to die already, kill myself because then Im sure I will never experience this and I will stop feeling so scared and anxious. Which makes no sense bcz it means that I'm so afraid of death that I want to die?? (I think the issue is that I'm afraid of someone else killing me, not dying).

 My problem is that I'm nurturing this irrational fear by watching true crime videos. I know I'm harming myself when I do this because I will feel so bad for days, weeks, months afterwards! But I just can't stop.. I always end up watching one again. I think that I watch it because I imagine the situation and it's like  a simulation, what to do if I'm in the same situation.

 Also I'm thinking ""I've been too relaxed lately, I need to remind myself how scary this world is, how there are crazy people"". It's almost like punishing myself for being to carefree/not being paranoid ""like I should"". And I guess those videos can also be oddly entertaining/thrilling and give me very strong feelings I cannot get in my every day life. I want to change but at the same time I don't want to because I feel like it would be a bad thing, that I will be killed and think ""you see? You shouldn't have stopped being cautious. Serves you right.""(more like paranoid..). I have this irrational feeling that one day a serial killer will try to kill me, as if it was my destiny..

 I'm writing this bcz my sister was scolding me saying that I should stop being paranoid abt this, that it will never happen.. because two days ago I read the biography of a very famous serial killer on Wikipedia and I felt very scared. This morning I woke up screaming ""nooo"" because I felt very strong pain in my nightmare and felt this pain while waking up. I went to the toilets to uuuh let it all go and my stomach hurted for 1 hour making weird noises. For the first time in my dream I actually experienced being killed with the killer stabbing me repeatedly in the stomach. It was just a man Shadow, all black and blurry, without a real appearance (like the anti spiral in Gurren Lagann). 

I also feel like this is preventing me from trusting men. I'm 21 almost 22 and never dated, never went on a date, never was close friend with any guy..it's like if deep inside I thought that they're all predators/aggressors/killers when I know rationally that it's false and unfair to think this way..I feel like I will end up alone..And I'm tired of those scary feelings which are almost like torture to me..My psychiatrist for ADHD was like "" it's very Freudian you should sleep with a guy"" when I told him abt my nightmares of being chased/killed and I was like????? If you cite Freud seriously I'm never taking you seriously. I'm afraid that seeing a psy wouldn't change anything' my sister says I should try hypnosis..Do you have any ideas what to do?

"Hello everybody, I am M 21  
This is my first post on this sub and I think its going to be a long one. I think I am starting to develop some kind of social anxiety or something similar, let me tell you how it all started. I was always a very outgoing person, never really had trouble with meeting new people or finding myself in a new crowd. I could even say I was life of the party many times. But lately, circa half a year ago I started to feel anxious when I was having lunch at work. Which was weird because I never had anything similar happen to me. I just ignored it and carried on like nothing is happening. Then I started having the same feeling when I was having lunch with my friends, but the feeling went away as soon as I left the table so I didn‚Äôt worry about it that much. Until one day, I call the breaking point, I was taking an midterm and was doing fine, I knew the answers, but in the middle of it I started feeling nauseas and went to the toilet to clear my head, hopping I could finish my exam, but to my surprise I just couldn‚Äôt concentrate anymore. And since the breaking point I am starting to feel anxious in many more situations, like presenting in front of the class or even just sitting in the classroom and listening to lectures. I still can not pinpoint the source of the problem, my main suspect is stress, because I do have I very busy life juggling job, college and my semi-professional sport career, maybe it all just came chorusing down on me lately I really don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶  
I am really afraid in what ways will this affect my life‚Ä¶ But I decided to fight and overcome some of the fears which are totally new to me, I find it scary and at the same time a bit shocking how fast anxiety took over my life

"It all started a year ago with my health. My eczema was the most extreme that it had been and it started spilling into other parts of my health. I ended up getting a lot of eye infections, allergies, immune system related infections. I went to a million doctors but to no avail. 

In december / january, i physically couldnt bring myself to go to work. I basically took 2 months off without telling my family or boyfriend. I was so unmotivated because you need a job to sustain yourself in the future, and i no longer saw a future i needed to sustain. 

Ive slowly noticed the joy disappear from my life and ability to enjoy things diminish. I used to be able to pretend like everything was fine and put on the cheerful front like nothing was wrong. Now when im out and around people, i feel hollow, speaking hollow words.

My boyfriend had been supportive throughout, but recently we got into a huge fight, because he thinks the relationship is extremely one sided. I dont blame him, i know it has been. I realise finally that it is due to my depression that i havent had the capacity to give what he needs, but i dont want to lose him. He told me he needs space and time, but i want him to understand where all of this is coming from from my point of view.

But, ever since, I feel like I'm paranoid about the prospect of ever being that paranoid again.

It's like my paranoid habits are the same of being so watchful and attentive but now my brain frames it as ""well that would be concerning to a paranoid person, but obviously you aren't paranoid.

"Hello! I am the daughter of someone who has recently been diagnosed schizophrenia but has been experiencing symptoms for decades. I love my mom so much, more than anything in this world. I‚Äôve tried really hard to be there for her by calling her almost everyday and visiting whenever I can, but I have been at undergrad out of state for the past 4 years so it‚Äôs been hard. I‚Äôm just recently finishing and moving back near her. Since being diagnosed with schizophrenia, my mom has lost her job and hasn‚Äôt found a new one (any advice on that would be great too). She has money saved up to afford a place, but I thought that when I move for my job I would get a two bedroom in case she has to move in with me eventually. This is where the communication I need help with is. I have always expressed to my mom that moving in with me is a last resort. Not because I don‚Äôt love her or because of her schizophrenia, but because I am 22, newly out of college, moving in with my serious boyfriend of a year, and learning to become an independent adult. Now, that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want her in my life. I‚Äôd love to live near her and see her often, even have sleepovers when she‚Äôs having a rough night or just for fun. But she seems to think that because I am getting a two bedroom that means she can move in whenever she wants. If she was ever about to be homeless or ran out of most of her money or needed a caretaker, of course I‚Äôd take her in. But I‚Äôd much prefer to be neighbors who see each other a lot but have separate places to go at night. How do I express this to my mom so that she understands without hurting her? Because of her schizophrenia she can get really emotionally volatile, feel attacked, lash out, and also comprehend things poorly sometimes which causes misunderstandings. I don‚Äôt blame her at all, it‚Äôs just shitty symptoms that happens when she‚Äôs not doing well with the illness. I was wondering if anyone here with schizophrenia or family members with it would have advice. Thank you!",6,schizophrenia

I have paranoia. I don't know what mental disorder it stems from. All I do know, is that it's very much taking control of my life. I'm paranoid about losing my job even when I don't think I've done something terribly wrong. I'm paranoid about the health and safety of my mother. Especially, for the past few years, I've been extremely paranoid that she will fall in the shower. I check my phone often to see when she was last online, just to make sure she's okay. If I haven't' heard from her in a few days, I get a sick feeling and have to call or text right away, and I get very upset when she doesn't answer or reply right away too. Worst of all, the worst paranoia I have ever felt, is about my boyfriend cheating on me. It comes on fast and strong. It's always the strangest things that cause it too and the smallest of acts set it off. It's been causing a lot of problems lately because I've just been coming right out and sharing these thoughts. He tells me I'm accusing. I don't mean to come off that way. I just want to ask right out if the thoughts I'm having are true or not. It's been all day, every day for 2 weeks now really bad. It's been years with me being paranoid, and normally I am able to push the thoughts to the side and ignore them. But sometimes, they are so strong and so believable I can't help but to give into them. My brain puts all these pieces together, and no matter how ridiculous they may seem to everyone else, they make sense to me. They could never not make sense. Typically, it lasts for a few days, and then I just wake up and I'm not that worried about it anymore. But lately, it's not gone away and every time a new paranoid thought comes up, it just adds more fuel to it and it's scaring me. I don't want to lose this man but I'm doing nothing good for him or us by coming off as accusatory and I don't want to hurt his feelings. I know, when I'm not feeling paranoid, that he would never be unfaithful or do anything to hurt me, but the paranoia is so strong. I know I have issues with trusting people and I often worry that I don't trust him and maybe that's the problem? 

Any advice from similar situations would be greatly appreciated. Also, if you take any medications that have or still do help, let me know. I should also mention, I have very severe anxiety about every aspect of my life and I'm thinking that maybe causes the paranoia? I really don't know. But what can I do when I'm feeling so enraged and fueled by paranoid thoughts? And what if they don't go away? I know I've read it's possible to have a good relationship with someone that has paranoia, but I'm really feeling like this is all my life will ever be and I should just stay single as not to hurt the people I get close with.",5,paranoia

"I hate how media portrayals of autistic characters depict ""rudeness"" that is based on the assumption that we are deliberately and knowingly being rude because autism makes us uncaring. 

An example of a non-autistic character who is intentionally a dick is House. He is knowingly an asshole and has an excellent grasp of social skills that allow him to fine-tune his insults. However, this is portrayed as part of his personality and free choice, with some trauma and chronic pain mixed in. 

Tons of autistic or autistic ""drag"" characters (looking at you Sheldon fking Cooper) are portrayed as rude, but not because of the actual reasons that might cause an autistic person to unintentionally be rude. They're basically written as jerks who just dislike social conventions, rather than not understanding them. It's all part of this horrible mythos that we could be ""normal"" and we're choosing to act like this because we're assholess without empathy or desire for approval and human relationships.",1,autism

"Hey all, idk if I'm paranoid because when I'm in the middle of my thoughts I'm telling myself I'm being paranoid. Idk if being able to call myself out for being irrational or *sounding* irrational negates anything about it, but I thought I'd share anyways

Let me start this out by saying I have a history of religion related issues. Most recently, I think I'm a mistake from God or that God wants me back in some way; I nearly died all throughout my infancy and my birth(c-section) was very traumatic and near fatal for both my mom and I. I met someone today who, within the first hour of talking to them, told me that demi-gods live among us and the church is trying to hide that. They told me God loves me and that the stones I wear as a necklace are masculinizing my face through magic.
I fully do not believe God loves me. I think God wants me to fuckin kill myself since he couldn't take me out as a child.
Anyways I can't really get what they said out of my head.

Also, today my manager told me he full on had people watching him with cameras and shit. Took pictures of these people and everything. They had recording devices and told me how they pretending to park in a neighbor's driveway to watch him through binoculars. He said they were trying to watch him to look for evidence of insurance fraud since he had gotten severely injured that required surgery and they were looking for evidence that he was lying.
That also freaked me out because I often feel like I'm being followed or watched in public. I start noticing things, little slip ups. Seemingly completely different parties whispering to each other as they swiftly walk by, then clearing their throats around me like some sort of code. People staring at me in public, slowing down in their cars as they pass me on the sidewalk, and other little things I don't remember off the top of my head now.

"I hate this so much, I feel embarrassed for being unemployed. Everybody else my age has amazing jobs and everybody else is working really hard progressing in their career and making money and building families. Meanwhile I'm jobless af. I have had various jobs in the past.... In high school, I worked as a cashier and stayed there for 4 years. I had a few other part time jobs during college as well.

I graduated college with my bachelor's degree at the height of covid in 2020, and had the hardest time finding any employment. I remember spending entire days applying for jobs and just never hearing anything. I some interviews here and there, would study my ass off about the company and interview skills and make absolute sure I did my best, would send thank you letters and the whole nine yards, but would get ghosted every time. I would even be applying for jobs thousands of miles away just hoping anyone would take me. Eventually I landed one job.....a minimum wage barista position at Starbucks. It was the worst job I ever had, I was mistreated by manager and shift leads every day, vastly overqualified with a degree, got paid so little and the work was so strenuous. I ended up putting in my notice, and then getting fired one day before my last day because I just couldn't keep up and my manager just had it out for me. I got another job later on, but it was also very low pay and the work environment was so horrible and the commute was so bad, that I didn't even last beyond my first week.

I continued to apply for hundreds of jobs and never got any callbacks. On top of my dad constantly hounding at me for being unemployed and struggling with horrible depression and anxiety, eventually I got so burnt out and couldn't stand the thought of applying for jobs anymore. I had just been through 20 years of school and spending the last 10 of those working shitty minimum wage jobs at the same time, stressed out applying for hundreds of these jobs, writing endless cover letters, dressing up for interviews....and going nowhere. I just got so burnt out because of it. I'm currently living mostly off of an inheritance that my grandparents left me and my siblings.

I feel guilty that I don't have a job. But I just feel so anxious around the thought of applying for jobs and also getting trapped in a bad environment where I'll be mistreated again. I feel so anxious of giving up all of my days to work for a company that doesn't respect me, underpays me and could easily replace me. I feel anxious about learning the ropes at new jobs as most companies I worked for had horrible training and the first 3 months were always hell. And in general I feel so aimless because my degree isn't even what I want to do with my life. I feel that I also wasted my youth, I wanted to do so much more while I was still young. I wanted to travel and make friends and have fun experiences but I basically have to give all of those dreams up to work some underpaying job with back breaking hours for the rest of my life. It sounds like my definition of hell. I just keep waiting for the day where I'll have some revolutionary idea that will save me from this, but it never comes.",4,anxiety

"So my diagnosis process has been anything but smooth. At first my doctor brushed off my issues as depression and anxiety. Put me on meds for both and they got worse. Way worse. I was almost sent to a psychiatric hospital bad. Then he suspected bipolar. Kept me on the other two meds but added meds for bipolar. I started to hallucinate and get even worse! He got rid of the anxiety meds and the depression got really bad. The anxiety had almost completely gone away. I was unable to stay wake for more than an hour at a time. I failed high school and have to go through the expensive process of getting my GED. After enough complaints from my teachers, parents, family, and myself my doctor took me off my meds and agreed to do a screening for ASD and ADHD. (ADHD runs in my family.) when doing the screening the only things that flagged for ADHD were the lap over ones for ASD. Well now since he prolonged my diagnosis process till after I hit 18. The only place that will do a diagnosis for autism is TWO HOURS out of my city. That isn‚Äôt even accounting for the distances in the cities I‚Äôd have to go just to get to the exact location. There is a doctor in my city but the oldest people he diagnosed are 17. I‚Äôve been telling my doctor teachers have raised concerns of me being autistic for long before I was 17. My doctor has made things difficult for me from the start with almost everything. Stomach issues, my transition, therapy, and even just simple blood work so I know if I have some of the genetic conditions that run in my family. I‚Äôve got the paperwork for the place outside of my city because I finally want a set in stone answer so I can access the proper accommodations I‚Äôve needed since day one. I‚Äôm gonna take them in when I have my next appointment. I‚Äôve already had my local hospital help with my transition (which I find out if I start hormones on Monday or a later date!) I‚Äôve done my research on this and honestly once this is all said and done I want to be a voice for people like me in my city because this situation is so draining and isolating. Please tell me my doctor isn‚Äôt the only one? I‚Äôm not even self diagnosing the screening said I‚Äôm autistic and should do the full diagnosis. Teachers have said I probably autistic. If it weren‚Äôt for them I would have never even started the process because I thought I was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù compared to my family‚Ä¶ sorry if that made no sense at all. I‚Äôve had a busy week last week and I still haven‚Äôt fully recovered. 

TLDR: doctor has made my diagnosis process 10x harder by pushing off the actual diagnosis until after I was 18. Now I have to leave my entire city just for one appointment that could have been done here if he had acted 3 years faster.",1,autism

"Hey Guys!

My best friend has been through abuse by his Nmum. Coming from a toxic family has impaired his mental health since an early adult. He has substance addiction. We always used to think his paranoia about being harmed and persecuted were due to his drug. But later I realised when he‚Äôs high yes they became worst but it was an onset condition that he probably didn‚Äôt even realise. He hasn‚Äôt even realised where and how these thoughts and mental torture started. With my knowledge I feel he might be suffering from CPTSD. The psychological damage from Nmum left him with huge paranoia of people out there to get him, control issues, fear of government institutions and etc. Now he is on a recovery programme and he needs to do mandatory urine test every week. The state will charge him if he fails to report or if tested positive. However, since he has this huge paranoia he feels this procedure is a plot/artificial and thus has failed to show up for it. He has been absent without valid reason for two months. If he doesn‚Äôt report in the following weeks, he will be charged severely. We can‚Äôt seem to get him help such as seeing a mental health professional or anyone as he is rather avoidant. He just wishes isolation. Many times he even suspects me and mistrust me. Right now he has isolated. How do we get him help and what‚Äôs running through his mind?

"I've been depressed for 15 years. I've failed 20 medications and am currently maxed out on multiple different antidepressants. 

I take my meds as directed, I go to fucking TMS (which is actually rather painful, by the way), I'm 5'7"" and 145lbs and run 3x a week, and skate on the weekends. I eat healthy, don't drink or use drugs, and go to therapy. 

And I still *can't sleep* and *don't feel any fucking better*. I'm not in the early game anymore. I don't just lay in bed and refuse to get help. I've had all the help that is available to me. Everything that everyone says will make me better I do, out of pure fucking rage. And nothing works. I'm nauseous all day, I can't eat anything, my heart races in my chest for no reason even through my beta blockers, and then when it comes time to sleep, I can't without annihilating my body with Seroquel. I've tried benzodiazipines, hypnotics, benadryl, unisom, melatonin, sleep hygiene, meditation, and exercise obviously.

I don't even sit there worrying about anything, and I don't nap during the day, I straight up do not sleep without Seroquel. My regimen used to be 45mg of Remeron, 300 (three. Hundred.)mg of Seroquel, and 30mg of Temazepam every *fucking* night. I have not slept unassisted in 7 years.

And nobody fucking knows why. My labs are normal. Thyroid and hormones are normal, metabolic panel and complete blood count are normal, vitamin D and iron are normal. 

SSRIs, SNRIs, Mood Stabilizers, Antipsychotics, Anticonvulsants for some reason, all of the Atypicals, all failed.

"Like many, I'm suffering from this shortage. As a result, I haven't been able to get my Concerta (and/or generic) in over a month.

People keep telling me to try asking about another medication, trying something else, and it's driving me nuts thinking about it. It's not like you can call a pharmacy, they tell you ""Sorry we're out of X"" and you can just say ""Well, what *do* you have?"" 

Making appointments is rough enough, but imagine they change you over to something else, the Pharmacy doesn't have that either, so you're right back where you started and then have to make ANOTHER appointment to get ANOTHER prescription for ANOTHER medication

All of this on top of the fact that while I get it (controlled substance and all) I hate that prescriptions expire. ""You didn't fill it in time, so you need to make another appointment and get another""

I didn't fill it in time because you didn't have it though, so how does any of that make sense? (other than, again, controlled substance and all that)

&#x200B;

On top of all that, I can't help but think ""Well if others are in the same boat as me, but they're tripping and fading off instead of repeatedly trying to get their meds, maybe I can get mine if enough of them..."" and I feel so crappy about that. I feet crappy about all of this.

I have a good physique, I have a very solid degree, and I‚Äôm generally well-liked and often make people laugh.

I constantly feel inferior to bigger, taller men. I train bjj but I know that most bigger guys could still beat the shit out of me. I‚Äôve seen women approach my taller friends frequently. They also match with attractive women on dating apps, whereas I only match with overweight and/or unattractive women. I‚Äôve learned to stop caring what women look like, but my friends and men in general will bash me for the girls I date/sleep with and generally respect me less because of this.

"I have always had anxiety, but it‚Äôs always been because of specific things i.e. social events, public speaking, driving, confrontation. As soon as the task is complete, my anxiety is gone. However, I recently weaned off Bupropion under the supervision of my psychiatrist because it was causing random severe panic attacks and all day anxiety that would last weeks at a time with no clear trigger or cause. The first two weeks I was fully off Bupropion were magic. Clear thinking, no anxiety, no panic or paranoia. All of a sudden, the last two days I have been having the same simmering anxiety that just pokes at me all day and eventually turns into an anxiety attack in the afternoon/evening after work.

I've been trying to relax by connecting with my friends online, but I have to step away from any call (whether it's relaxing or working) whenever a housemate is near.

When I try to find the reason of doing so I simply end up with excuses for myself of why I don't want to show anyone my professional or personal work. I don't really know if it's some sort of paranoia or some associated disorder, but it's genuinely getting in the way of my everyday life now.

I just want to be able to show my close relatives and friends my work that I'm proud of, but whenever I  try I seem to find some way to weasel out of it, and whenever I'm not trying to show them a finished work, even when I'm trying to relax, I can't help but keep an eye out for the doorways they might come in by and prepare ""fake documents"" to display if they come in.

If anyone has any way of knowing what kind of problem this is or what kind of problem is manifesting in this way any knowledge on the subject would he greatly appreciated, as well as any general or more specific ways of dealing with these unsure and ""insecure"" thoughts.

They‚Äôre a more spontaneous crowd and tend to just meet up since they live so close, so I don‚Äôt get invited to things. I live with my boyfriend but he works odd hours and is tired and not always as romantic/affectionate as he used to be. He is also going through a tough time and doesn‚Äôt have the energy to do the extra stuff anymore. What sucks is just not feeling wanted. 

Every day I feel like I‚Äôm slowly drowning. My job feels like a dead end, my relationship is losing its spark, I don‚Äôt see many friends anymore, I don‚Äôt enjoy my hobbies anymore. My self-esteem is on life support. Every day I just wonder if this is it and I feel so empty and sad.

I haven‚Äôt told anyone how bad I‚Äôm feeling in a long time. My last therapist dropped me suddenly when she switched practices last year, and I always have such a hard time bringing myself to try again when I‚Äôve had shitty experiences in the past. I have suicidal thoughts most days, but I don‚Äôt really want to die. I think I just want to feel ok again, but my coping strategies are just not enough anymore.",2,depression

"I have caught myself saying that I want to die more times this year than I would like to admit. 

It's not necessarily that I don't want to live.. just to feel a moment of peace. A moment of relief that doesn't seemingly get taken away and discovered later to be a complete lie. I hate that I find myself even struggling to write on the internet ANONOMYOUSLY that I am broken and mad and lost and I wish that my parents gave a fuck about me, I wish I was a priority with friends, I wish I was anyone's choice and I understand that what I'm asking for is too much..  I struggle with CPTSD, ADHD, incredibly high perfectionism + social anxiety.

I feel as though I am lost. I have no idea how to navigate the world filled with weird rules and ways to manipulate others in a self serving nature. Most of the people I have met love the fun, playful, positive and excited person I am - but are never consistent in showing up or working with any part of me depressed or miserable. More often than not, I am told that my grief around not being anyone's first choice or priority is just loneliness and I need to embrace being on my own... How will that heal the pain or allow for healing of the grief that I hold over the fact that I am absolutely no ones choice? Not a first choice, second choice - nothing. I've attempted to articulate this before but continue to hear the same thing - ""learn how to love yourself, be alone, and become your first choice and priority. That's the real magic!""

I try to not hold resentment over the people that treat this like it's so easy to move on from. As if they don't call their parents daily or have someone to reach out to when they are sick, have a challenging day, get into a car accident, need support with their kids.... but honestly, fuck, it is so hard to feel so alone and not a single person can understand this. I am perfectly content being around myself, I love doing what I do on my own, and that doesn't change the fact that I don't have a safe home base outside of myself at all. I'm 32 and I feel like I've been alone my whole life and I am grieving without any end in sight. 

I been struggling with my health for years, very significantly over the past few months and today, I heard back that my body has high nuclear antibody title displaying a homogenous pattern that is suggestive of Systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic autoimmune hepatitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. I'm scared, and I'm alone, and I don't want to do this anymore. 

I feel like I am already struggling with so many basic aspects of my life... how can I keep motivating myself to keep living, when all I want more than anything is to put down my sword and rest? I guess really the whole point of me even writing this was to speak it out loud, my attempt at going somewhere for a virtual hug where I may get ignored and not noticed but at least a hug won't be rejected as I cry.",2,depression

"All my anxiety comes from the fear of being alone. I'm in my 40's. Married with 2 kids, 16 and 19. One in college. When my wife is going out of town for the weekend, even if my kids might be around I get anxiety. I get it a week before it is even happening. I get anxiety about the anxiety I imagine i'm going to feel when i'm alone. Thing is, i'm not already so bad when I'm alone. I used to be. These days it can be ok. But yet I still worry and get a lot of anxiety just thinking about being alone.

Even if it's just the thought of I might be on my own in the evening, or maybe I might working at home on my own (my wife and I both work from home, but she goes out to meetings often during the day).

I am, and have been, in therapy - and we focus on how I can rewire my thought about being scared. Is that how you get over it? Or is there a way to figure out why I feel this way? And if it's just about replacing the negative thoughts, the fear, with positive ""it's going to be ok, there is nothing to worry about"" thougths, what's the best way of doing that?

"The drugs. I think the doctors. Doctors in general. Are giving people useless drugs.

I take medication to deal with. I don't even know.

I don't remember when I started taking medication. I don't know what it's for and I don't think it does anything other than make my insomnia worse.

These drugs they give people do not help them. They are lies. They are there to make you think it's helpful. But in reality they want you to keep taking it so they can make money off of you.

These sedatives merely hide the issue, rather than solving it.

What does it matter? It's like trying to hide the fact that your legs are broken. You want to ignore it by covering them up. But they are still broken.

I think the media is lying. I think society is lying. I think they're all connected as one. It's all a scheme or something. Not some Illuminati who ha whatnot. But something else.

I suppose I wonder, why did so many Germans do nothing about the Nazis? Why did they comply when they knew it was wrong?

I don't trust that. I don't trust people because of how easily they can be manipulated. We learn nothing. The old generations knew, the new generations didn't. History repeats itself. We can teach the new generations all we want but they won't understand. I come from the newer generation.

I don't understand my own generation. I feel weird. I feel above, yet below. The people around me are not trustworthy. Not just because of my probable paranoia, but also because they are imbeciles. They are so reckless that I am. I don't understand. They care not for their property nor their lives. What is wrong with them?

What is wrong with me? Why am I so different? I am the mentally ill one, yet somehow I am above them. That's not how it's supposed to work. I'm supposed to be below them. Not above them. I don't like that.

I am surrounded by idiots. The older ones are too intimidating. I don't trust anyone. I am a little scared. I am a little anxious.

I am very anxious. I don't even trust the people on this site. You'll probably tell me to see a doctor or take a bunch of drugs to suppress these emotions or feelings.

That's the problem though. These feelings are the broken legs.

I am aware of them. I know of them. And I refuse to ignore them. I want to heal them. But I don't trust your methods. I don't think they're gonna help. And I don't think some nut job can help either. Nut jobs with their mystic magical whatnot. They are corporations. They only care about profit. They do not care about human lives. They only care about feeding their own ego.

"Hi, I am a 18 year old male, and I need some advice and help, so I would appreciate any words of wisdom; btw my first language is not English, so please pardon me if the grammar looks a bit odd..

To start off, I think it would be better for me to provide my background information to understand my situation better, since I believe that significant chunks of my problems come from the trauma during my teenage years.

Every time I try to control myself from the emotional damage of the trauma, I feel like I am constantly damaging myself even though I try not to admit it. 

To elaborate, it started when my parents divorced and I moved to a different country for my school, and lived there with my father for a few years. Even though I could stay with my mother, whom I had a really close relationship with, my mother still sent me to my father, for the sake of the 'better future' in the new country. I was 13 back then. I had conflicts with him and was emotionally destroyed from his constant verbal/psychological/emotional abuse and neglect, and whenever he left home to meet his girl friend, it was the shittiest feeling ever that I experienced, and I think it is since then when my attachment issues started to worsen. I spent most of the time alone, and it was really hard for me to be alone even on my birthdays(I don't really care about birthday celebration stuff, but still..it was pretty depressing), and what was worse was when he cursed my mother's family..and every time he did that, would get mentally scared. 

And it was really painful to be aware of the the fact that I worked as a link that tied my mother and father still together, since they still talked to each other to discuss my academic and other stuff, and I knew tht my mother got agonized every time she had to talk with him, since I remember from my childhood her crying when she talked on the phone with him(they lived separately ever since I was born), and because I love her of course, I didn't want her to get hurt not even a bit because of him.

I thought I could handle all these things, but I got hit hard by depression, DPDR, PTSD, bipolar disorder, etc. I gave up on my school work and all other stuff, even my relationships with friends, since I was running out of energy to even barely breathe. 

And recently, I have been taking medication(Xanax and Prozac) to fix this mental trauma, and also having therapy sessions every month, but honestly, even though this did help me a lot, I feel like this hasn't resolved the fundamental cause of the problem. The PTSD shit hits me bad whenever I have a phone call with my father.(He pays my private high school tuition and other stuff for my family, so I can't just cut loose with him).  

Even nowadays, when I talk with people, even my closest friends, I never show my true emotions or thoughts, because it is much safer for me to just fake and protect myself from any potential offense or attack towards my authentic self.

And I hate to admit the fact that I still have hatred towards both of my parents. My father, of course, I think he deserves that, but I shouldn't hate my mother. In fact, it's just not that I hate her, I do love her so much, but whenever the issue is brought up, I feel so overwhelmed and depressed, and these emotions turn into my resentment and blame towards her. And I ask her 'why did you have to do that?' And this just turns into toxic arguments between me and her. I feel like a total piece of shit whenever I go through this, and have been thinking of suicidal thoughts from time to time. I feel like I have been losing so much of me, and I am losing control, sense of myself.

Sorry if this was a bit hard to read and understand, and I really appreciate you for reading this. And again, I would appreciate any advices. Thank you.",2,depression

"I had a friend that meant a lot to me. I loved and trusted him a lot, he was among the first people I told when I was diagnosed with ADHD over a year ago. He told me he would support me no matter what, and I believed him. We had a bad falling out 6 months ago and he ended our friendship. I've been grieving and trying to move on, and honestly I've been making progress.  

But a couple days ago I remembered some things he said to me, like ""You require so much reassurance"". He also said things to me like, ""Are you stupid?"",  ""You're trying to manipulate me."", and ""After all I've done for you. After all the accommodations I've made for you"". That one hurts the worst. And yeah, maybe I did ask for reassurance from him more than other friends,  but with the things he said to me,  I never really knew where I stood with him. I would never, ever speak to a friend the way he did to me.

Now I'm sitting here realizing he never cared for me the way I did him. I was nothing but a burden to him.  My heart is breaking all over again.",3,adhd

"TW for suicidal ideation. I 100% understand if my post gets deleted. I'm posting this to anywhere I think I can find somebody, ANYbody who could give me some semblance of advice.

I'm a 24yo American male and I'm completely lacking in motivation and purpose.

I've always been a lonely and mentally ill person. Anxiety, depression, suicidal, etc. I feel very little positivity and joy. I lack the motivation for self-improvement and self-reliance.

Ever since my youth, I've never been much good at making friends. Was never a very social or motivated kid. I've seen it said many times that charisma and having connections are essential to success in life. I severly lack social skills/people skills and fear that this has crippled my ability to live a well-off life.

I suffered a mental/emotional breakdown in 7th grade due to the stress of the workload. I got diagnosed with Asperger's and spent proceeded to spend most of my time in the special needs classroom. I've suffered several breakdowns throughout my years as a middle and high school student. Lots of banging on walls, lots of crying, lots of screaming, etc. I was the stereotypical ""psycho"", the quiet loner kid with no friends and no social skills. I dropped out of several high-demand classes and clubs as a result of never being able to handle the workload/responsibility (APUSH, robotics, Beta Club, National Honor Society, etc.). I never took the SATs or anything like that. I feel horrifically ashamed and guilty and useless and worthless because I could never make it in these classes/clubs. It's resulted in me feeling constantly suicidal to this day due to never living up to my own hefty expectations of myself.

In 10th grade, I confessed how sad and angry and suicidal I am to a guidance counselor and it landed me a week in a juvenile mental facility. I wasn't allowed to return to school for half a year after that. I totally screwed myself even further. Shoulda just kept my mouth shut.

I'm still living with my parents and am totally dependent on them for everything. I never learned how to do all the things kids are supposed to learn. How to make friends, how to swim, ride a bike, etc. I'm 24 and I don't know how to drive! And as an adult, I know diddly-squat about insurance, homeowning, taxes, etc., or any other important adult stuff. I've been working part-time as a dishwasher at Cracker Barrel for the past 8 years, less than 20 hours every week. I still rely on my parents and grandparents to get me to and from work. I feel like such a massive burden and have attempted to take my own life multiple times.

Sis got accepted into college recently. She's absolutely amazing, an extremely talented and intelligent young woman. An artist, musician, writer, etc. Recently, I overheard Dad telling her how great she is while talking trash about me behind my back. Said I'll always be dependent on him and Ma. He's sick of it and moving out in September. I'm absolutely terrified of what'll happen to us once he goes.

I confided in Sis about what I heard and she told me she wanted to yell at Dad and tell him to shut up right then and there. That a parent should never talk like that about their child. She offered to help me learn how to drive and she offered to help me apply for college. But I'm so genuinely terrifed that I'll crash and burn in college (see my previous academic history of stress and mental breakdowns). I'm so, so, so genuinely scared outta my mind that I'll never make it. That I'll never amount to anything, so why bother accumulating debt if I'm probably just gonna drop out like I always do?

I've become hyper-fixated on the concept of euthanasia. Death with dignity, the right to die, etc. This suffering is just too much to bear. I'm so sick of myself. I wish I was normal. I wish I wasn't so emotional and outbursty. I wish I wasn't so socially inept and helpless. I wish I leaned how to swim and how to bike and how to drive when I was a kid. I wish I knew how to be responsible and own my own place and do taxes. I'm the type of person who needs firm directions from others in order to achieve some semblance of function. Can anybody give me direct and concise orders on what to do next? I can't do this alone...

I apologize if all this comes off as whining and complaining, I'm just so very sick and tired of myself. Seriously, what should I do? What CAN I do?",2,depression

"So this happened just this morning. I was walking to work and I usually walk through a park to get there and there was this guy on the swings probably a couple of years older than me staring at me on the swings. 

His smile was way too wide to be genuine, it was like a big smile with teeth showing and he just watched me walk past him with no other interaction. I was painfully aware that unlike other days the park seemed deserted and so I just pretended I hadn‚Äôt seen him staring and just went on my way.  

I checked a couple of times after I had turned a corner in the park if he was following me and he didn‚Äôt seem to be but it was seriously creepy.  

While I was walking to work I noticed someone else watching me for a long time after I walked from the park and thankfully they not smiling creepily but I think that might be me just being paranoid.

"The meds make me fat. I'm 19m and never dated, still a virgin. We still don't know if it's schiz or drug induced psychosis but my doctor has a hunch it's schiz. Could go away in the course of a year though now that I'm off weed but it's been two months and still no improvement aside from what medication can do. I've been hearing voices for almost two years now but I've been smoking weed for most of that time with occasional breaks. Longest break was 3 months off cannabis with no improvement in symptoms so I just went back to smoking. Finally quit for good though. 

Only time I've ever truly felt love was on stimulants and it was entirely one sided. And my doctor doesn't want to prescribe any stimulants due to psychosis and past abuse of my ADHD meds before I had psychosis.

I've gone up to 193lb and I'm 6 foot. I can hardly manage to lose any weight on meds. Along with psychosis I'm also just generally emotionally unstable. I think about doing hard drugs because the only person I've ever truly loved doesn't love me or seem to give much of a shit about me. I don't even know if I'm in love anymore but I'm nostalgic and miss feeling in love and alive. Medication makes it hard to even feel love.

I just want to do opioids and amphetamines. My family will kick me out if they find me doing drugs other than weed, alc, nic, or kratom though even if they're just research chems, which fall under a loopwhole and can be openly sold despite being analogues and derivatives of common drugs. They just can't be labeled for human consumption.

I loved her so fucking much, hell man I loved her even when she was still going by he I just thought I must've been bi or something. And I don't know if I'll be able to find anyone with the emotional instability, amphetamine cravings, weight gain, and psychosis. I'm a mess. Incredibly self destructive too. If I had a plug for hard drugs I'd already be on them.

And that's not accounting for the fact that I may not even be able to feel love anymore because of meds. I just want to feel in love again even if it was one sided. At least thinking about her brought me feelings of euphoria. I miss the intensity. Feels like I'm doomed to a dull medicated life.

Sometimes the voices pretend to be her just to try to fuck with me. 

It feels like she doesn't give a fuck about me or see me as more than an acquaintance or just part of the same circle of friends.

I have nothing to talk about with anyone either because I'm too apathetic. Stimulants would help but my doctor refuses to prescribe them. If he doesn't prescribe me a low dose of Dexedrine I may end up on either meth or flourinated amphetamine based research chems. Telling him that won't do any good though. If it wasn't for me feeling sappy and self destructive romantically I'd just take low doses to medicate myself where my doctor is failing me.

Wellbutrin worked for like a month or two and after that all it did was make me even more irritable than when I was abusing stims and made me grind my teeth a lot. I never ground my teeth on Dex. But I did on Wellbutrin :/",6,schizophrenia

"This is Buddy, he was my therapy bird, and emotional support animal. My grandma gave him to me when she went into the hospital for surgery to remove some cancer, worried that if something happened to her I would be alone. 
I got him when he was just under a year old, and he thought me so much about body language and indeed he made me feel like I had someone, especially after she passed away, I coddled Buddy like my baby. 
whenever I was upset he'd always crawl or fly up to me and fluff up just comforting me.
I ended up entering a relationship with someone who was unstable, I would clean his self inflicted wounds, watch as he physicality fought with freinds, but when he reacted violently towards his cat I had to end it. During the break up he threatened to set me on fire, and stole just about everything I had. 
I had severe problems after that, I had to move back in with my parents and couldn't really communicate what was going on, and when they started trying to change how I interacted with Buddy I started to shut down. 
They removed him from my room, got upset because he wouldn't shut up.. Really he was screeching because I wasn't around. 
And eventually they said I wasn't taking care of him to their standards and said I had to get rid of him. So he got rehomed to my sister and died less than 6 months later. 
It broke me...as John wick said ""[he] was an opportunity to greive unalone, and you stole that from me, killed that from me"" 
I miss him everyday.. And the place were staying doesn't allow animals.. And a therapy or emotional support animal isn't protected by the disability act.. 
He thought me about gasses, specifically Teflon, which made him sick and I had to rush him to a 24hour vet. 
He died when he was 6 years old.. 
The oldest cockatiel died when they were 30.
He could tell when I was anxious.. When I was stressed, angry..

"I'll try to keep this from being too long-winded.   
  
Something that has plagued me for years, and even now that I'm diagnosed and on medication, is this reoccurring phenomenon wherein I'll get lost in my head hyperfocusing on painful traumatic events from school (sometimes old jobs), while I'm in the middle of doing things I love (or it can even be stuff I don't particularly enjoy such as chores).

&#x200B;

As an example, I am a musician and a game designer, more proficient at the former than the latter since, but I've had a passion for both (or just creating ANYTHING) since I was a child. I also have a deep passion for cooking. So there I'll be, tweaking the rhythm section on a song, working out why the heck I can't get the dang main character to move to the left when he jumps, or simply trying not to make a mess while thickening the roux for the night's meatball and vegetable dinner; the task at hand seems to be done almost robotically, though I am actively thinking about it. It seems though that most of my **conscious** focus will be on reliving a painful moment from school; usually going over what I wish I would've said or wondering why none of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù ever came to my defense too often, wondering why none of the adults around me could catch on to what was happening, wondering why so many adults who couldn't deal with children were left in charge of children etc. All the while I'm actively doing this task. No one observing me would have a clue that I was focusing on anything but that task.  
  
A little background: I (35M) went virtually undiagnosed until *last year*, which is when I finally got on meds. I'm still getting used to the meds, but they are definitely making a difference and have allowed me to accomplish a lot of things I otherwise wouldn't have. YAY! I just wish they didn't feel like they went right through me after only three hours. Boo! (Also I say ‚Äúvirtually undiagnosed‚Äù, because I recall at least one failed attempt to get a diagnosis in my *YOUNGER* youth. Came up negative, so then came the ‚Äúwell there's no excuse blah blah blah‚Äù song and dance from the adults).   
  
For what it's worth, I went to **14** different schools in my school ‚Äúcareer‚Äù, not including the few blissful years I was homeschooled. I'm *not* a military brat, in fact the entire duration I was in school, my family **only moved** ***once***. Every other school year though, I was in a new school environment. Sometimes the start of the year where I could kind of start fresh, many times right in the middle of the year where I had to be the new guy. School is a HUGE sore spot for me. I have so much resentment and untreated wounds from those days (some physical). It seems the downside of being recently diagnosed means I'm going back into these memories and making sense of everything and having to relive things that I was trying to put away. Pre-K through second grade were...ok, but not horrific (all the time). When I discovered my appetite in the third grade, began gaining weight and started wearing these big dorky glasses, things just kind of went downhill from there socially. I've got so much to tell and get off my chest but at the risk of writing a huge book here, I'll save it (unless you're interested to hear and wanna compare notes or something).   
  
I've searched around a few times, but never could find if anyone else ever went through a similar thing. Sure, being stuck in traumatic memories is definitely a thing for us, but what about when you're actively trying to focus on something that's supposed to bring you joy? Can anyone else relate? How do you cope? I know medicine isn't a magic cure-all, but it's kind of frustrating that it doesn't shut any of that up.",3,adhd

"I realized recently how bad my anxiety has gotten over the last few years. And I have realized that in order for me to try and get better, I need to try and do things that help me feel like me again, and not like a shell. I have wanted to write a book for a very long time. I have loads of ideas but when I try and actually write them down and have a story progression I get overwhelmed by the amount of choices the characters have. Who will fall for who. Who will have tragedy. Who will have joy. So many choices and I understand that in order to write you need to write. But, my thoughts consume me and then I stop. So what I'm asking is, how do people with anxiety keep the story they want to tell straight in their mind. How do you not get overwhelmed with choices? How do you not get burdened by the want of your story to have universal themes and undertones and depth? I would truly appreciate any advice.

"Me and my cousin are best mates since childhood. We do everything together. We share the same hobbies etc etc. Me and him are only a year apart in age(he is a year older). But from the last 2-3 years i have noticed that people adore him more than me. he gets good grades,is tall, good facial features, nice personality meanwhile im just a short fat dude with no personality and facial features. We still are best friends but people give him more importance than me. I have never been jealous or him nor will but why the discrimination tho? This has caused me to be lonely all the time and no longer to hangout with anyone. Cant sleep. All i think is about this. Don't have the will to live when i know nobody cares for me.

People listen to him, takes his advice into consideration. He gets all the girls. Whereas, people tend to listen and ignore me. Not taking me seriously. Idk i can handle it anymore. This shit always hits me hard and makes me disheartened and hopeless.

"I had an anxiety attack a few weeks ago that very nearly got me to the emergency room. it woke me up from my sleep. it's impossible to describe that feelings but it's so negative and so intense. you can tell yourself all you want that nothing is wrong and to calm down but you can not get it to go away. I felt the same thing years ago the last few times I smoked weed. It sent me into that dark spiral. Your thoughts race so fast and you feel intense grief, guilt, sadness, dread, agony. You feel insane because your thoughts are too fast to keep up with let alone control. I went to the ER but by the time I got to the parking lot it stopped on it's own, which was about 2 hours after it started. I went to a psychologist but it was like 2 weeks later before i could get an appointment. He didn't seem to think I was under any great amount of stress. I had nothing really bad to talk about other than this incident. My life was going pretty well. He told me I should have gone to the ER for a blood test because it sounded more like a physical thing to him than psychological. So I made an appointment at my GP which I just went to. He said it doesn't sound physical at all. It sounds completely psychological. He took my bloodwork anyway just as part of a regular physical. He said every single vital he took today could not have been healthier. My breathing, blood pressure, everything was exactly on the money. I'll wait for the lab results but he said there is not really a test that will find anything related to this. He told me that if I did go to the ER, there is nothing they could have done for me. They would have talked to me until it went away on it's own. I asked him if they would have given me benzodiazepines, and he said no, that's only for panic attacks which means chest pains.

My anxiety prior to leaving the house or before a planned event/meeting can be so debilitating that I lose sleep thinking about it and I just go into a downward spiral.

My mom, who has suffered with depression and suicide ideation since I was 13, is just not like this. She goes through it differently and copes differently. She's always been able to carrying on with basic hygiene and cleaning around her house, cooking etc. Lately, it takes everything I've got to have a shower or cook for myself, so making plans is not something I do because it just isn't feasible most of the time. 

Lately I've been feeling a bit better, so I said I'd go to her house for mothers day - she was having a bbq with my brother and his family, too. 

The night before I started with the worrying and didn't end up in a good place mentally. I cancelled on her the next day. I've cancelled on her before, but this time she was mad. She ignored my call and didn't return it - just replied to my Facebook message to her saying I tried to call and happy mothers day etc. 

I know cancelling on her was a shitty thing to do, but I just couldn't bring myself to do all of it, and I thought if anyone could understand it would be her. She knows I'm struggling right now.

"I'm afraid to close my eyes. Does anyone else have this?. I think it's because of anxiety, which makes sense. I can't sleep and I'm afraid to close my eyes. I close them and start panicking immediately, so I have to open them again. As you can imagine, trying to sleep isnt easy. 
I also have small fears of being alone and fear of dark. Even when washing my face in the shower, I close my eyes to splash my face then quickly reach for a towel while still standing in the shower, just to wipe my eyes and be able to open them again. 

I think this fear is sort of paranoia on my behalf because I dread the dark, closing eyes, sitting in middle of a room, having back to a door or window, just because I can't see if something/someone approaches me. 

Does anyone fear closing their eyes but for a different reason or is it also part of paranoia?",5,paranoia

"It‚Äôs important to always know that life is invaluable. Maybe it‚Äôs the only thing that really matters. I‚Äôve never been suicidal, I don‚Äôt think I ever will be.
But holy hell, man‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs hard to stay positive. It‚Äôs hard to stay awake.
I manage to lose touch with every good friend I make: maybe I was too much of a downer and got clingy. Or, life just gets in the way, idk.
The people who do stay in my life are narcissistic or apathetic. They keep me around because I‚Äôm easy to be around.. that‚Äôs as deep as it gets.

My first relationship ended in me being cheated on. My second relationship was with a slob who tried to get pregnant by me without my consent.

I fell hard for a girl 10 months ago, and she fell for me. She was like a princess, I‚Äôd never been so smitten. But she lived too far away and we didn‚Äôt want to put each other through long-distance. So we cut all contact.

Society is cold and hostile. Nobody trusts each other. For good reason: so many people do everything they can to exploit the crap out of everything they can. So, when a trustworthy person comes along, they get treated like shit all the same. The chance to prove yourself rarely comes along.. and a lot of people just don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre trustworthy, they‚Äôre too busy trying to exploit you.

Now I‚Äôm here, ranting on reddit, because deep down I crave social interaction, despite being introverted af.
But all my social circles have died off, all my friends don‚Äôt respond to my messages anymore, not because they hate me, they just forgot.

It‚Äôs really just not easy to enjoy life sometimes, it just isn‚Äôt. But life is precious all the same. I just wish I didn‚Äôt have to tell myself that so frequently :/",2,depression

"I'll sometimes tie a noose and put it around my neck, so that it exerts the slightest bit of pressure on my airway & vessels. Or rest the tip of a large knife against my abdomen. Or lean over the railing on the roof of my apartment. Or stand at the edge of a train platform. At that point, a sense of overwhelming dread and fear washes over me, I get chills, and I know I wouldn't be able to go any further. My base self preservation instinct is too strong, as well as my hypochondria and intolerance to any sort of physical discomfort, I guess. I test it out every month or so, just to see if I've gotten more accustomed to it, but the feelings are as strong as ever. I try to rationalise with myself - that even if I didn't kill myself, death will always come with pain (from illness, or an accident, etc) - and so it really shouldn't stop me from just expediting the process.

"It's been a few days since my budgie ciel died.The first day felt strange,i don't know how to explain it but it just didn't feel that horrible.The next days became worse,i believe that's when it finally hit me,maybe i was still in denial about the whole thing but i'm not sure,however i know that it was only after i buried him that i was at my worst.

Ciel was given to me as a gift by a relative,i never even thought about getting a pet bird,but when i did i fell in love with him,he was so gentle,cute and very sweet,the most innocent creature in my world and my best friend...Now he's gone.

I feel awful,it was all my fault.I wish he had a different owner ,maybe that way he wouldn't have died so soon.What hurts me the most is that i know i could have done better,for the past two months i wasn't able to spend much time with him because i have an internship,so i'm not at home during the day,and when i'm back i have to go work on my assignments and some college projects.Of course he would be in my room while im doing my work but i was mostly focusing on the tasks i had,it was a really tough time for me because of all the things i had to do,but i hate myself for it,i should have spent more time with him.

I have no idea why he passed away,was he sick?or maybe being alone affected his health?I can't know the reason anymore,but during his last week he slept a lot more than usual,he seemed so weak to me,he wasn't as energetic as he used to be and i was really worried for him,he was probably sick,i wanted to take him to the vet but i could not afford it,seeing him that way broke my heart i even cried that day,i had a feeling that he was dying,i don't know why or how but i just felt it,that he only had so little left to live.I refused to believe it..i told myself that i was just paranoid and that he was going to be better soon,that i was wrong and that there was no way he was dying.I was going to buy him a friend that weekend,i went to the pet store and the guy working there told me there were no budgies left but on sunday he would be bringing them.I was happy ,now he was getting some company!But the next day i woke up a bit late,my sister came into my room and told me the news,all she said was one word: ""Ciel..."", and i understood.

That day i was still composed,now i can barely do anything right,i'm thinking about him 24/7,i have a report ive been writing and sometimes id just burst out in tears,i can't even count how many times i have cried in the last few days,it's the worst thing that has ever happened in my life.I was depressed years ago but nothing comes close to losing someone dear to you,it's too much..it hurts too much,the pain,sadness and regrets...his death absolutely shattered me.I cannot do anything without thinking about him,he's always on my mind.Earlier i was going through my gallery looking for some screenshots and i saw a picture of him i had taken before,i couldn't look at it,i looked away the moment i spotted it and i put my phone away,i don't understand why but i cannot bring myself to look at any of his photos.

Today i woke up and i realized once again that i didn't tell him goodnight the day before,it was something i always did when he was still with me,and now i feel empty.When im in the kitchen i unconsciously think about how its time to give him his food,but the next second im reminded that he's not here anymore.

I miss him a lot,i want to see him and listen to his cute chirps again,i want to see him healthy and happy...I try to tell myself that he is in a better place now,but it doesn't help at all,in fact all it does is hurt and make me cry again.Why did he have to go?Why so soon?I wanted to do so many things for him,i was going to get a job soon,then i'd be able to give him many things, take him to a vet,buy him toys,and just take better care of him..but he left without all of that..before i even had the chance to do anything for him,i hate myself for not being able to provide things for him before he died,i feel so guilty for not being a good owner.It's all my fault..

It's so unfair..I just want him back..",2,depression

"Hey.

So, I've always had OCD, but ever since my first panic attack last year, I've had this issue that during high anxiety moments, I start 'hearing voices'. The thing is-... I know it's in my mind. I have a lot of trauma, and generally, the voices tend to be of the people that have caused me that trauma-.. for example, them yelling at me in my mind, et cetera. I can't tell if it's an intrusive thought because of that trauma, or if I am really hallucinating? Something important to add here is that my OCD bases itself around my fear of losing my identity / going insane / losing control of my mind. 

Last night there was a completely new problem with that, too. I'm usually at home a lot and can relax and take the day for myself. I don't have many classes this semester so I'm pretty chill most of the time. Yesterday, I had a 12h seminar that went from the morning to the evening, and my OCD exploded a little in the early hours of the seminar. It calmed down after I chilled out, though, and then I managed the rest of the day-... until the night. In the evening, we went to check a theater play (an opera) and it went completely fine! I really liked it, et cetera. My health anxiety spiked a little because I got dizzy, but other than that I was fine. I took a bus, walked the way back home, and immediately laid down into bed. 

That's where everything went wrong. Out of nowhere, I was not falling asleep. Adrenaline was rushing up into my body each time I was about to nod off, and it kept me awake. I was falling asleep multiple times, but waking up with nightmares relatively swiftly, and that's when I noticed I was also hearing things again. I was hearing the singers of the opera in my mind, and I also heard some weird brushing noise. The brushing noise, admittingly, sounded very real and could have been a real noise (my apartment complex can be very noisy), but because I was already scared I thought I was finally going insane. I did, eventually, fall asleep, but I didn't get much sleep before I woke up. I am a lot more relaxed today, but I am still extremely hyperaware about all my bodily sensations, and a little on edge.",4,anxiety

\*\~**Possible trigger warning** I do talk about specific behaviors and I do not know if that will be triggering. More context may be added as well.\~\*

Note: This may count as an update to a previous post.

For context, me and this guy decided to rekindle our relationship, and are attempting to take things slow. A lot happened between us, and he seems to be doing better now.

But, my anxiety is and has always been really bad, and I'm afraid it will push him away. From thinking he's ignoring me when he doesn't text, to wondering if he'll find someone else, someone better, you name it. But rest assured, none of this is his fault. He is a very sweet guy, never cheated, very honest, always reassures me when I need it, and above all he's never harsh or rough to me during a disagreement. All in all, a good guy. He's not perfect, obviously, but who is?

However, my anxiety gets to me fairly often, which causes me to overthink. I do my best to push it aside or distract myself, but of course, it gets to me. Unfortunately, I have a hard time communicating to him that something is wrong. He might ask if I'm okay if I seem off, and I'll say ""I'm fine."" ""Don't worry."" Don't get me wrong, I am well aware why I tend to do this, and I will add that context, and more if needed. So I'll move on with the big question.

How do I deal with anxiety? Does anyone have tips? Anything is appreciated, thank you in advance.

"I think one day I will end up taking my own life. It‚Äôs not a matter of If, just a matter of when.

I‚Äôm currently unemployed, a college dropout, I barely have any friends, no romantic partner. 

I have nothing going for me. The only good thing people can say about me are that I‚Äôm ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and ‚Äúpretty‚Äù.

Whenever I try to make friends I get ghosted. Whenever I date someone it always ends badly. I‚Äôm not good at anything I can make money off of, so I struggle financially. I have extreme trust issues, extreme abandonment issues. Because everyone in my life has ghosted me or stabbed me in the back. Everyone betrays me, so I rarely feel comfortable with other people.

I have panic attacks nearly every single night because when I lay in bed alone in the dark with my thoughts, my mind becomes overwhelmed with intense negative emotions and it‚Äôs given me insomnia.

I tried to see a therapist and I saw her for a few weeks but gave up because she didn‚Äôt seem empathetic at all nor did I feel like she understand how serious my issues were.

And maybe that‚Äôs partially my fault because I am very, very good at making it seem like I have everything together when on the inside I‚Äôm falling apart.

Like the title says, I've recently been dealing with a sudden bought of anxiety the last handful of days which culminated in a panic attack (after almost 2 years without one) and I'm trying to figure out if it was the repetitive thoughts (worries about the future, etc.) or the fact that I've been under stress the last few weeks that caused it. I know it can be difficult to separate, but is there any way to know?

"Hey guys, I'm feeling pretty confused about a recent situation with my girlfriend and could really use some advice or insight. Before I delve into the details, I want to mention that I have pretty severe ADHD, which sometimes affects my judgment and ability to interpret social cues accurately. I'm not sure if this played a role in the situation.

We've been together for about four months, and things have been pretty turbulent but we obviously have a strong connection. However, today, she approached me and said she thought it would be a good idea for us to take a break.

Now, considering my ADHD, I sometimes struggle with reading between the lines or picking up on subtle signals. Initially, I was taken aback, but I tried to remain calm and understand her perspective. I didn't want to push her away by being defensive, so I told her that I thought it was a good idea if that's what she felt was necessary. To my surprise, she responded by saying that if we took a break, we probably wouldn't get back together.

Given my ADHD, I tend to take things at face value, so I interpreted her statement as a breakup since she seemed to imply that the break could lead to a permanent separation. Therefore, I accepted it and expressed my understanding that it was over. However, that's when things took an unexpected turn.

She started calling me repeatedly and bombarding me with text messages, clearly upset and demanding that I ""fight"" for our relationship. I was really taken aback by this because I thought I was respecting her wishes by accepting the break. It felt like a contradiction to me.

When I confronted her about this, she explained that she wanted me to show more effort and passion for our relationship, and the fact that I had initially agreed to the break was not what she wanted to hear. She said she wanted me to fight for her and prove that I cared.

Given my ADHD, I'm questioning whether my interpretation and response were influenced by my condition. Did I misread the situation and fail to understand what she really wanted? I genuinely thought I was being understanding and respecting her wishes, but now I'm questioning if I missed some important context.

I'm really confused about her mixed signals, my ADHD, and not sure what to make of all this. Am I to blame for this misunderstanding? I still care about her, but I don't want to keep going in circles with conflicting expectations. Any advice, especially from individuals who have experience with ADHD in relationships, would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Girlfriend suggested taking a break, I agreed, she got upset and demanded I fight for our relationship. I obviously have ADHD (diagnosed 12 years ago) and I'm unsure if my interpretation was influenced by it. Feeling confused and unsure about what to do next. Any advice, including insights from those with experience in relationships involving ADHD, would be greatly appreciated.

"Its become a problem in the past. I convinced myself a person I had a disagreement with had made a whole conspiracy around cutting me off as many people as they could, and people were getting convinced, and even if nothing happened and no such conspiracy existed I ended up having a nervous breakdown and ended up cutting myself off from those people anyway.

This happens every few months and I just have to wait until Im feeling better. And since that breakdown (years ago!) nothing of the sort really happened. But I fear that now I may be getting too near to that conspiracy mindset again.

Basically, people keep calling me weird and not telling me whats weird about me. My friends, my partner, some members of my family. I have a big issue with this word because people tended to use it a lot with me, sometimes with good reason, but the majority of the time it was simply used to describe me existing.

Looking back on it, it makes me really annoyed that as a mentally fucked young teen I had to figure out what is socially acceptable on my own. So, I ended up using ""weird"" as a cue to stop doing what I was doing, which quickly turned into me repressing just about anything.

So being called weird makes me feel awful. The worst part is that I have to always assume the worst given my history. So people explaining what is wrong about my behaviour is my prefered option, even if sometimes they still call me weird. But being just called weird? Fuck that, it just makes me feel bad and I constantly analyze my behaviour or start asking people if something is weird in advance.

I feel like its way too coordinated and Im spiraling over it. Do they really dislike me? Has it always been like this? Are they telling other people and trying to cut me off? And like, what is actually weird about me now? Nothing and they just want me to feel bad? Something minor? Am I making people uncomfortable, am I overstepping boundaries?

"He's my oldest friend (from elementary school, now we're in our 30s) showed schizophrenic & bipolar symptoms late in HS.  He's been forced into hospitals multiple times since HS when he's become too unstable. He was on abilify for awhile, but stopped because of gambling issues. I'm not sure what it is but he has a daily med but doesn't take it as far as I know. We're brutally honest with each other, no judgements.  He often turns to drugs like weed, alcohol, coke, x, acid and meth. His reasoning for doing crystal meth is it ""gives him clairvoyance"" I hang out with him almost every Saturday. We bowl, Frisbee golf and just chill. He was doing well working for a few years but he has a DUI case that has been hanging over his head for 5 years that has finally gone to sentencing but it has stressed him out and caused him to have manic episodes so he hasn't worked in months. And they can't sentence him because he's mentally unfit when he shows up. There are good facilities in the area, and therapy but he won't go because he doesn't want someone to change how he thinks. He's non violent but his mind races to the point he is no longer in control or his paranoia makes him lock up his computer or not trust anyone. This means he can't work and is fighting so hard just be in a limbo of surviving but not being able to make any progress towards his goals.. I don't know what to do to help him.

"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2,depression

"I (M,22) have been diagnosed with panic disease a couple months ago, since then something really went wrong inside me.

I had my first panic attack, when I was 18 by smoking weed with my friends. I was in an insanely bad shape, cuz my gf just  broke up with me, so when we were smoking, I had a panic attack. 
Since then I‚Äôm not finding back to myself.
I have extreme depersonalization, derealisations, which makes my joyful life really tough. I have been to many many psychologists without any success. I recently started seeing a psychiatrist, so I had antidepressants prescribed. Since I started taking Scippa, an SSRI for about 3-4 weeks now, my life really went for a downfall. I feel incredibly stressed, nervous all the time. I am unable to desensitize myself or to even leave our home ( I live with my mom, she is a huge supporter of mine) since a week now. I don‚Äôt want anybody to sort out my problems, just want to hear some helpful thoughts,suggestions, ideas what should I try.

"Showing someone a cool special interest I have, and sharing it with them is all I've ever wanted. But because of how rigid and linear I think, I fail to associate these people with the interests we share, and thus our friendships remain nothing more than acknowledgement of the fact that it sorta exists

I really never had that luxury with in-personal acquaintances, nor was it genuine with the people I met in online spaces up until fairly recently, when my circle of friends tallied itself into the sorry number of threes people.

Masking myself in front of my family isn't really tough, but oftentimes I see no reason to because in their misunderstanding, they will simply refer to my mannerisms as me being weird.

My doctor said that i have almost all of ADHD symptoms but some key things are missing, like some points on memory or something like that, so she can't give me an ADHD diagnostic. I have been taking SSRIs for a month a half now and it honestly  only made things worse.
The only time i don't feel bad is when for some reason i get extremely happy with something, like some time ago when i moved to a better house. I felt like a superhero, like i could do anything i wanted and all that i had to do was have the courage to do it, and then 1 month later i was back laying on my bed and waiting for the day to end.

"ever since a couple months ago, I've felt that my anxiety has worsened. Back then, like a year ago or so, it had been bad on some days but overall I could force myself through them. However, recently I've felt that it's become unbearable. 

I constantly feel this tight grip on my heart and I feel like puking and I get trembly and blurry visions occasionally. I dreaded living as a whole. While there were those minute moments where I've forgotten about my fears and paranoia, I feel that every hour of every day I feel this terrible feeling in my chest. I can't exactly describe it but it's this uneasy feeling and it's just bad. so so bad. It makes me lose my appetite and I don't like how things have gotten for me.

I used to really enjoy doing my hobbies like learning the guitar and drawing but nowadays even doing those things is difficult because my mind's always in a state of worry and I can't stop it.

I try to calm myself by depriving myself of my senses which used to work wonders but I just can't stop it. Its the fact that it's everyday for the past few months I've felt like this makes it terrible.

I hate going to school. I hate seeing people. I hate leaving my room.

At first I thought I could ride this one through, that it'd end soon but no it hasnt.

It's to the point where I actually really can't talk with people and I'm alone in school. I feel that I've avoided my friends to hide away in toilet stalls because the sight of so many people has become so sickening that I tend to panic so much that I have to isolate myself. As bad as it seems, I feel like isolating myself somewhat helped me through some bad times.

I'm constantly in fear of people and all I want is to hide away and live life invisible. I don't know why I'm this way and I don't know how to stop it.

and now that I've got group projects where I need to partner up with people, it's a pain for me since I don't have anymore friends and everyone else does.

I've got no one to talk to and my parents don't believe in mental health being such a big issue and once I told my mum and she said it'll pass. 3 years later and it's gotten worse so!

"Depression is getting worse. Being around people literally hurts. Everyday, my brain is like static on a TV. It really sucks because I can't articulate anything. I've been dealing with depression for years, and honestly, I'm slowly seeing no point in living anymore. I'm also autistic, and even though I'm high functioning, I can't express myself. I literally don't know how. People laugh at me, make fun of me, and I'm just tired of it. The only thing I want to do, is give into my symptoms. Stop working, going to school, all I want to do is just lay in bed, stare at the wall, and basically wait to die. And I'm 27, so I have a good 50-60 years of waiting to die. Then I feel guilty for feeling this way, because there's people out there with terminal illnesses that just want to live. But I'm just so tired of feeling sad, and so tired of being mistreated and misunderstood. I feel like my Autism is more of a curse than anything. Idk, people are just mean to me, and I'm sick of it. And the only outlet I know is self harm. And I can't so that, because then I'll get thrown into the psych ward again. So all I can do is just bottle it up. When I try to talk about it with my therapist and psychiatrist, my mind just blanks. It's as if my brain was made to torture me.

I‚Äôm stupid and probably the dumbest person on the planet. I make too many mistakes. 
Everyone else is better than me.
I‚Äôm lazy. I don‚Äôt work hard enough. 
Im a lucky bastard in some ways but I feel so unworthy of everything good sometimes. 
I feel worthless to the world sometimes and like I am an alien trying to blend in to a world that I negatively stand out in. 
I feel like all I do is make mistakes and I do nothing right. Every decision I make seems to be the wrong one. 
I‚Äôm defective. 
I‚Äôm unlikable due to my personality and the words that come out of my mouth and the way I present myself. 
I‚Äôm unlikable. I‚Äôm not good enough for the world. Someone as flawed and imperfect as me doesn‚Äôt belong here.

"Hi, for some context, spurred by experiencing one of these moments my boyfriend has recently confided in me that he often has these strange..terrors? Only that's not what they should be called. Trouble is we don't know what to call them.

There are about four, each with their own distinct look. -One is a man who has no teeth and smiles. His neck can stretch high enough to look through second story windows and he watches you. If you turn your head he'll kill you. He usually is outside the window or at the end of the bed. -the other is a being with teeth like a whale, no eyes, and stands on all fours only his joints are all wrong. He is usually found on the ceiling or next to the bed -the third is me but my neck and limbs stretch out and I usually murder him -the fourth is a pulsating ball of nails.

Normally we'd call these hallucinations but the problem is he doesn't see them. He doesn't hear, or taste, or smell, or even feel them either. He'll just be existing in a moment and then feel as if they're there. He has never seen them in person, but feels as if he knows what they look like (this is how I got my descriptions. He drew them and they are thoroughly creepy).

He has more but these are the most reoccurring and memorable for him. They only happen at night and before he goes to bed. (The ball of nails only occured during sleep paralysis).

We want to know what it is he's going through and if we should be looking for some deeper help or if this is just some strange form of paranoia. Please if you have any idea, let us know",5,paranoia
"When the black dog comes, 
you don't hear it arrive.
One minute your happy,
Not a care in the world.
The next moment he is there. 
His tail all waggy,
He wants to play.

You play fetch with your mood,
He runs around with it, from high to low,
Bringing it back you feel quite good
But the dog wants his ball
So you throw it away
Just for him to play with
Feeling negative all day.

You play tug with a rope
Pulling your thoughts all over
Shame he is a strong dog. Not like the rest 
What was fact is now fiction
You question everything.
Pulling on the rope you do your best,  
Such a strong g black dog.

Then there's the stick, he loves it so much,
Knawing at your insecurities
Stripping away who you are bit by bit
Till you question who you are.
A strong tree, reduced to saw wood
By the big, black dog.

When the day is done, all you want is to sleep.
So worn out by the big black dog. You are.
But tomorrow you awake, knowing you have to play with him again. 
It's exhausting. I wish the dog would go home.
But I am his home. And he'll be here again, day after day.
Maybe if I coukd just have some more sleep, I'll one day be okay.",2,depression

"hi, i just found this sub with a quick search because i feel kind of desperate to talk to someone about how i am feeling. please let me know if this doesn‚Äôt belong here. 

i (27f) have had diagnosed anxiety and depression since i was 18. i want to be fully, completely honest here because i never had been before. i have talked about my intrusive thoughts before with my doctors, i have been through inpatient treatment. i didn‚Äôt always have them, it‚Äôs been about 3 years of having the ones about me wanting to die. however i haven‚Äôt described what i am going through recently because i do not want to and can‚Äôt be back in inpatient again. 


i am having intrusive thoughts almost constantly. anytime my mind is left to wander i immediately find myself thinking and sometimes even saying out loud ‚Äúi want to die/i want to kill myself‚Äù. i have never had a suicide attempt and i don‚Äôt feel like i am actually going to kill myself, i just can‚Äôt stop thinking it.


my intrusive thoughts have drastically shifted towards about being paranoid about being murdered. i live in a city with alarmingly increasing violence on the streets and public transit. it‚Äôs almost daily. this past winter i was physically assaulted by someone on the train. there is no specific person i am scared of or have been recently threatened by. but in public i constantly think i am going to be assaulted and killed. i think someone is going to attack me on the bus. i think someone is going to knife me from behind when i‚Äôm walking down the street. i think someone is going to shoot me in the back of the head through my window when i‚Äôm sitting on the couch.  i only ride the first and last subway cars so i can stand near the conductor incase something goes wrong. i get off of buses and trains as soon as anyone one makes me feel scared in any way at all. i don‚Äôt use headphones in public anymore and won‚Äôt look at my phone or read a book on transit. even if i wanted to i hear louder and louder and feel stronger and stronger that i am going to be killed. i didn‚Äôt know how to shake this. if anyone has any advice, books, other subs, or online resources to suggest please let me know! 
i want to reiterate that i am not a danger to myself, i don‚Äôt actually want to kill myself it just fees like a guttural  reaction for me to feel the thought and think i want to die. i am not a physical danger to myself. thank you in advance!ü´∂ü´∂",5,paranoia

"As a forward, I also have epilepsy and Asperger's.

I was at a travel conference in DC a couple weekends ago for a hobby of mine. I had a blast, and low-key ended up becoming minor-leage famous in the industry. Part of the reason for that was helping to organize and host the pre-game party in my friend's suite (so almost all the speakers were there, etc). I don't think I consumed a huge amount of alcohol (3 Pacificos and a shot-sized amount of gin and tonic), but probably more than I'm used to. I believe I had a beer or two the following night, and some wine the day before I went home. And I was rather sleep deprived the whole time. Normally I don't drink too often and when I do it's 1 beer.


Anyway, that was two weekends ago. I came back and I'm literally completely unable to focus on anything. I mean I can look at my monitor and stare blankly at it. I'll go into a directory and forget what I was looking for (which was a problem before, but now it's worse). And I'm working at a snail's pace. 


Granted there's also not a whole lot of work for me to do at the moment. I'm kinda of doing busywork. Maybe subconsciously my brain is trying to extend out the busywork because after that I'll have absolutely nothing to do? I dunno. 


But I definitely don't think the conference was a coincidence in making me feel the way I do. I went to Europe last year and came back feeling the same way for a while, but probably less-so because I actually did gave work to do when I got back, too much work to catch up on.

"I have been dealing with some form of paranoia or paranoid delusions(so they say) for almost 10 years. 

I am not oblivious to the fact that my extended amphetamine use has contributed to this a great deal. The issue I'm dealing with now(sober) is that I can't distinguish the paranoid delusions (from my last extended amphetamine binge) with real life or even the mild lingering paranoia that I deal with day to day.

 I've been on Seroquel 100mg at night for almost 14 months. It used to really help at least calm the thoughts, but now sometimes it makes it worse. 
Everything is connected! I draw lines and make connections from one arbitrary detail to build these grandeous conclusions. The problem is that these details are all based in some amount of truth or so it seems. I can't tell the difference anymore. 

I'm writing this on my main Reddit account and I don't even care. I'm so sick and tired of feeling like this and everyone just calling me crazy... 

It's all based in fear. I know that because I feel it.

Even writing this, the auto correct suggestions are telling me a story that I'm not really supposed to know but that someone wants me to slowly figure out ""on my own."" 

There always seems to be a guiding hand or overseeing entity, seemingly someone who cares about me that wants me to know these secret bits of information but for whatever reason can't just tell me the whole thing.

I'm familiar with projecting and can spot when I'm reaching externally for answers that can be found internally. It's just gotten to a point where I think others use my ""projectjon, paranoia, fears, and delusions"" as a way to discredit the things I think. 

I'm scared. 

I dont know who I can even tell these things to anymore. When I go to people in my network who struggle with similar things, they say it will go away. But it hasn't. 
It's why I go back to drugs continually. It quiets the incessant thoughts. 

I won't go into detail about the delusions. 
A vauge idea of what I think and feel though:

1) Someone is making decisions for me, sometimes and mostly for the good. (They want me to succeed)
2) The people I have met authentically were pre determined and all have a specific purpose in the unknown goal that I am to be used to achieve. 
3) There is no bad or terrible thing that I am meant to do. (I think the path I keep being set on is a righteous one of some sort or at least it's meant to be ultimately positive) 
4) Someone or some group knows more than they are letting on and for whatever reason cannot disclose information to me ... (Imagine being a bystander in an active investigation and the cops don't want to change your behavior patterns because it may disturb the raw data they are trying to gather on the real intended target)
So I may not be the ""main player"" and I am almost certain I am not.

I'm going to stop now cause I'm getting freaked out by the amount of noise cars that have started to drive by even as I write this. 
I'll come back to edit if I feel the need tomorrow.

"TW: S/A mentioned 

I‚Äôve had paranoia problems since I was a kid. One profound example I can remember is that I would apologize when accidentally bumping into or hitting inanimate objects like walls or my toys. I did this because I thought they would come to life and hurt me. 

It died down for a while until about a few months to a year ago. So, for years, my parents touched me inappropriately without my consent(like my boobs, butt, etc). I would tell them to stop as a teenager after I learned I could say no to them, but they got mad and continued anyway. It was really traumatic and my mind still feels messed up about it. A year ago, I started getting paranoid and fearing that I‚Äôll be like them in the future. I didn‚Äôt have this fear until I learned that most criminals become who they are because of traumatic moments.

"I wake up with agonizing muscle ache listening to the wind whispering to me while giving me a strong feminine grasp. I watch as the world, no, the universe, move around and I only keep watching the gloomy streets while the wind speaks to me. The feeling of warmth is what is desired but only the coldness of the breeze comes to me. Watching my mind slowly but inevitably corrupt itself due to the humanity that surrounds me. Wishing I was unraped mentally and physically in order for my childhood to be full of glee and rather left in isolation and peace with the beautiful roses and daffodils giving me the soft touch that I keep yearning for as the cold wind finally blows the flowers sweet smell. I hold a child's hand as I sit on the rock facing my mother's grave and cry solemnly knowing I'll be there to give her a rose or two a day. For her warm spirit will finally allow me to achieve comfort with the hand of the child that I will raise, safeguarding me from the trauma that I was yielded upon.",2,depression

"...is what my brain tells me every day, whether or not it is true. There are some verified instances where such things did happen, but because of those instances, they have made me paranoid that they are happening all the time with everyone I meet.

I am now actively avoiding family members because I walked in on two of them shit talking me about my job (verified) but now I am afraid they all do it all the time over any little thing (paranoia).

Usually its very inaproppiate... it started like what if i am gay, what if i pee and think about this guy, last week what if i am on kids, what if i will see somebody else in the mirror, what if my cat is somebody else, what if I yawn... what if my memory is failing me what if i have schizophrenia. Half of those fears are gone but I create new ones. Now i am much less OCD(which is good) and i only react on triggers... is this normal? I feel not that bad it got better the last 2 weeks...

"I have recently noticed that my behavior and thought patterns deviate from others' considerably, in that mine are much more paranoid and guarded. I don't believe *everyone* is out to get me and I am capable of some degree of trust (only fully trust one person), but I am constantly evaluating everything I say and do in fear someone will use it against me. And this does not just apply to saying something that can be taken badly, no, but also to, for example, revealing seemingly innocent information about myself that others seem to have no issue divulging. Ironically, my paranoia prevents me from going into detail here, but a good example is how I am paranoid to let people know my birthday, and when asked, I will only begrudgingly and hesitantly answer.

I see other people have no such issues with talking about such minor things about themselves, but I am constantly guarded for the not nonexistent possibility of malicious people somehow somewhere finding information that can be used to harm me. I am also incredibly paranoid when leaving my residence, often distrusting strangers on the streets and even going as far as to imagine in detail how a specific stranger who happened to glance at me plans to harm me and how I should react in that situation, constructing a very specific scenario in my head over such inconsequential occurrences. Is this a cause for concern? Is this a sign of a form of clinical paranoia? Is this something I should consult a doctor or a professional regarding, or is it mild/normal? I find the constant stress of reevaluating every tiny thing out of fear very exhausting, but I'm not sure if this is a mental issue I may be facing. To clarify, I do suffer from several mental illnesses, so having something paranoia related or my paranoia being a result of one of them would not be a far fetched assumption. Sorry for the long post, I have no idea where to go with this. I made a new account just to ask.",5,paranoia

"during the daytime, i am almost never paranoid at all. as soon as it gets dark outside, it‚Äôs about 9 or 10 pm, and i‚Äôm no longer around people is when i begin to get very paranoid, especially when i‚Äôm outside or near a window or open closet (i get very afraid something will sneak into my backyard and hurt me, or i will see a face or person outside my bedroom window or inside my closet). my paranoia typically increases in the night after i‚Äôve watched a true crime or paranormal video earlier in the day, but is still there either way.

during night, im not always sure what im scared of, it changes. sometimes itll be something paranormal, like the fear that some sort of ghost or demon will appear in my room. other times i‚Äôll be nervous a human murderer will break in while i‚Äôm sleeping. or worst of all, it could be a person already in my room, hiding under my bed or in my closet unnoticed, even though i typically check those places before i sleep just to make sure theres no one. 

looking back, i think i‚Äôve always dealt with some paranoia, even though it‚Äôs only gotten worse recently. for example, one time when i was around ten i went several months sleeping on one specific side because for some reason i was scared a tiger would break into my room?? another time when i was older, i stayed up for hours one night because i was convinced that there was someone in my kitchen, and the water near my bed was empty so i was so thirsty i couldn‚Äôt sleep. i don‚Äôt remember much of my childhood, so i cant really think of any other instances of this right now. (sorry if this seems unrelated, just trying to give as much information as i can.)

i‚Äôm not sure what the cause of my paranoia is. i‚Äôm almost certain my poor sleep schedule factors into it (i typically go to sleep at 11pm and wake up at 6:30am), but i‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the root cause, as i still get around 7 hours every night, and even more on weekends. i do get intrusive thoughts, but i don‚Äôt think those are bad enough to call it OCD. i do have a slight history of mental illness, but theyre the things more typical for a teenager, just an eating disorder and self harm and suicidal ideation. my family doesn‚Äôt have much history of mental illness, the biggest thing i can think of is my uncle who is homeless and extremely paranoid, but none of my other family is like that. i don‚Äôt even know if shit like paranoia even IS hereditary.

i have been working to try to go to sleep earlier (10pm so i can get 8 hours of sleep per night), but whats very frustrating is that when i go to sleep earlier than normal, i‚Äôll almost always wake up in the middle of the night (anywhere from 1-5am), and this time period is when my paranoia is at its absolute worst. i can‚Äôt fall back asleep unless i listen to music, which is annoying because just the simple act of opening my eyes, sitting up, and pulling out my phone is terrifying and i‚Äôll have to gear myself up for it for minutes before. after waking up in the middle of the night, i‚Äôll be so overcome with fear that i won‚Äôt be able to open my eyes for fear that when i open them, a person will be right above my face, or i wont be able to close them for the same reason. even blinking is scary. i don‚Äôt experience any physical effects of my paranoia except for a fast heartbeat, so i don‚Äôt get sick from it or anything, though sickness does make it much worse because of how high my fevers get. the most annoying thing is how when i manage to fall back asleep, when i wake up i don‚Äôt even remember almost anything from the night before. all i remember id that i woke up early and that i was scared of nothing again. 

although being in the dark makes it worse, i can even get paranoid in a bright room, especially if theres a mirror in the room (since mirrors make me nervous about the idea of eyes appearing behind me in the mirror), or i‚Äôll be scared of the shadows in my room, or my backyard will be lit from lights but if i hear a sound then i just have to go back inside, because of all the ‚Äòpotential dangers‚Äô that could jump out at me from outside. the worst part is that i‚Äôm certain being on my phone so often only makes this worse, but sometimes my phone is the only thing that can distract me from my paranoia. i‚Äôm eighteen years old and had to check under my bed last night like an eight year old because of this. no amount of reassuring myself that everything is fine helps. i know there‚Äôs no danger but it doesn‚Äôt stop the fear. it‚Äôs only gotten worse recently, especially in the past five or so months. i can‚Äôt uncover my hand or leg from my blankets when i‚Äôm trying to fall asleep, i can‚Äôt go outside past 11pm without my phone, i can‚Äôt fall asleep without music unless i‚Äôm too tired to be scared. nothing seems to help. i don‚Äôt know what to do about this anymore. it‚Äôs not quite debilitating, at least during the daytime, but i‚Äôm nervous it will be at some point. help??",5,paranoia
"TW: minor mention of abuse
I honestly don't know if this is normal for people who suffer from PTSD but I was in an abusive relationship for two years as an early high schooler and it's been almost 4 years since it ended. For that time I've had really bad sleep paralysis/paranoia based on my ex boyfriend. It ranges from him hiding under my bed to reach out and grab me, hiding in my closet, sh00ting me through my window, or hiding anywhere in my house with intent to hurt me or my family. Unfortunately recently aside from all of that normal paranoia, I've been scared of driving alone, being home alone, going to the store/public alone, etc. for fear that he's stalking me and going to find me to hurt me. Besides all of this I have routines and rituals I have to follow to feel safe such as I have to jump from three feet away into my bed so he can't grab me, close my blinds over my windows by 6 pm so he can't see in when it's dark, etc.

We are moving around our house because some of our roommates moved out. Which is great because that means we (my husband and I) can have a larger room and get a cat. Here is the thing though it requires moving all of our things out of one room and into the other and cleaning the spaces after we move the stuff. I hate cleaning. I hate it so much. I hate messes but I hate touching the messes even more. It leads me to a lot of avoidance of creating waste whenever I can or pilling my boxes so I don‚Äôt need to move them as often. (I also have adhd in conjunction with my autism if that makes a difference to and I am medicated) but because of all of this I have to put in my earbuds and ignore everyone because the minute that someone talks to me they can always seem to tell I am upset.

"26 yo male. I‚Äôm on disability, working 12 hours a week and I‚Äôm on the third month working at my local goodwill. I feel people at my job resent me for my limited hours. And I feel like I‚Äôm falling apart at work. 4 hours a day isn‚Äôt always overwhelming but many days I just can‚Äôt do it, I swear. 

Two things are going on that are concerning me. One is that I have attendance issues. I missed two days because of major blizzards that stuffed me in and I couldn‚Äôt get there in the morning on time because of my parents big driveway. Then, I was actually sick one day. I left early a day for an appointment, and left early another day because I was going through psychosis and didn‚Äôt feel safe being around people that I think are against me and or reading my thoughts or talking about me badly. I was once a pretty darn reliable worker before my onset age of 22.

As I said, I am on disability so I can fall back on that. However, it is nice to get out of the house. But I do have an employment agent at my local behavioral clinic that can find me a job for people like me(disabled).

They‚Äôve been supportive and listened to my issues and helped find solutions. But the warmer it gets the busier it gets and the more tense it gets on all fronts. I just am having a hard time. And no matter how hard I try sometimes, it just gets impossible to focus even on antipsychotics.

"I'm just a terrible husband for her, and I tried her into thinking I wasn't our whole dating life by saying and doing all the right things to put on a facade of someone who was bound for success and being the caring person she needed. But it was all because I was so afraid of being alone again, I was willing to do anything and pretend to be anyone to be loved. 

But I am not that person, I fail at everything I do, and past the facade I am a weak, insecure and self-absorbed person who can barely care for himself, let alone a marriage. She never makes mistakes, and I'm always the reason something is wrong or that she has a problem in life.

Hey only mistake was being tricked into loving me, but I can't undo it now. It's been too long, and I've wasted too much of her time. She wants kids and doesn't want to be too old to avoid issues, so it would betray her greatest goal in life for me to admit that we should separate, because she's already 30, and it might be too late now to start all over with else, someone better for her.

But since I'm so awful, it's such a terrible idea for me to have children. Even if they aren't genetically fucked in the head like I must be, then having me as a father will certainly hurt them for their entire lives. I will fail as a father and I know it, but I can't bring myself to just end this whole thing before it starts because I don't want to hurt her even more.

I've been going over it, and it just feels like the best option would for me to have an accident, something fatal that makes it all end. I have a very large life insurance policy, so while it won't make up for the time I've wasted, maybe it will help her live comfortably, and find someone who will be better for her. Then outside of the initial heartbreak of my death, I won't be able to hurt her anymore, and she'll be happier overall when she finds someone who can be the person she needs them to be, and hopefully forget I was ever in her life.

Edit: I think I should clarify that I've never been abusive to her or cheated on her. Im just an awful husband who can't be who she needs me to be, and tricked her into thinking I could be because I'm entirely selfish. I am so self-focused that I think I'll never do a good thing for another person in my life, so the best thing I can do is be removed from life.",2,depression

"I want to provide some context.
When I was 8 I was adopted by my Aunt and uncle (my uncle is my blood, my mother‚Äôs brother.) They already had one son which they shared together (let‚Äôs call him Teal Blue) and one from my uncle‚Äôs previous marriage (let‚Äôs call him Rose Red.) 
Rose Red usually split his time between his mother and his dad (my uncle) so Teal Blue and I were raised primarily by my Aunt and Uncle.. Now that you have back story about the family dynamic I want to get to the real point‚Ä¶
So my Aunt has always had body image issues.. she even shared with me that in her early adult years she suffered from anorexia. Ever since I moved in with them at the age of eight I‚Äôve known her to be insecure about her weight and she runs at minimum 5 miles a day.
Even now in her mid 50s she runs sometimes 10 miles in one day. She‚Äôs thin and weighs about 120 pounds but still calls me and says ‚ÄúOmg I need to lose weight.‚Äù Now this bothers me at times because I‚Äôm much heavier than her but that‚Äôs not my issue because I‚Äôm not insecure about my weight at all.
My issue is that both me and her bio son (Teal Blue) have always been a bit on the heavy side. Again, Rose Red lived with his mom most of the time so he doesn‚Äôt struggle as much with weight because he didn‚Äôt really eat my Aunt‚Äôs cooking. AND SHE COOKED AND GOT FAST FOOD A LOT.
The fact that me and Teal Blue have been overweight and struggled with bad eating habits really bothers me since my Aunt is a health and fitness coach and she herself is thin. (I‚Äôve expressed that to her.)
Once I moved out there was one time that I‚Äôd actually become pretty thin because I was eating healthy and running about two miles per day. I‚Äôd come home from a college break to visit my Aunt and uncle and my uncle was impressed and called me HOT (in a very normal not weird at all way).. he just wanted to express that he was proud of my weight loss. His wife, my Aunt, responded to him (in front of the kids) ‚Äúyou‚Äôve never called me HOT.‚Äù That was almost 9 years ago and it haunts me until this day that she would show jealousy towards a child she raised. 
Now to the REAL point. Anytime I visit them which is very rare these days (mainly on holidays) she always makes me my own ‚Äúseparate batch‚Äù of something which I never ask for. I used to think she was just being kind but because of her obvious insecurities I‚Äôve become curious about it. She‚Äôll say to me ‚ÄúI made Mac and cheese but I made you your own separate batch to take home.‚Äù When I return home I‚Äôll usually get a text asking if I ate it. Not if I liked it but if I ATE IT. As if she‚Äôs making sure I consumed it. This Christmas she offered me coffee and I accepted. She literally asked me five times if I finished it ‚Äúhey did you finish the coffee?‚Äù
‚Ä¶ ‚Äúdid you finish your coffee‚Äù over and over again she asked and she did not make it herself so it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs wondering if I liked it. And not once did she ask if I liked it only if I finished it. Now I‚Äôm paranoid because as I said me and her son have always struggled with our weight as kids even though she professionalizes in health and fitness and now that I‚Äôm grown and can control my own intake it‚Äôs like she forces food down my throat whenever I visit. I know she has this thing where she likes to be the thinnest person in group pictures and I just don‚Äôt know how to feel.

"I've been having a terrible time with paranoia, with this one really strong, terrifying certainty that everything in my life is connected and someone is doing it on purpose. For example, I'll be online and see the people I follow post a bunch of posts I don't really get, oh well no big deal. Then I listen to music on soundcloud, and find an amazing fansong for media I don't know, but I love it so I listen to it over and over. Then I'll talk to my penfriend and she tells me about this cool podcast she's been listening to, so I google it, and it turns out all the posts were about it, and the song was about it, and a bunch of things over a series of months are now all linked and it terrifies me. To be clear, I don't think that someone is making these things happen, it's more like they're deliberately moving them into my line of sight, deliberately drawing lines between them, like their making a web by connecting everything in my life. It's terrifying, it's like I'm the only thing in my life that *isn't* being puppeted, and I'm just trapped in the middle and I can't do anything to stop it. I don't feel like it all the time, but when it hits I can't get away from it. I don't know why they would be doing it, who they would be, how long they would have been doing it, I just know that they are, and it's so scary that nothing I see hear think or do is really my own choice, because they're deliberately putting things into my path. It's like a bunch of random stitches at random points in my life, and then I'll pull on a bit of unrelated thread and it will pull all the stitches in and I'll realise they've been waiting for ages for me to just move that thread. I'm just rambling about it now, I'm sorry, but I just needed to get it out. I've had paranoia a lot in my life, but this is particularly horrible.",5,paranoia

"I just got out of todays therapy session. Last week I actually got a lot out and felt good about myself for once. Today I barely said anything. I couldn't. I just kept thinking in my head about all these things and situations and overthinking and analyzing and deducing. I tried to tell her that this was happening but it was like there was a wall. I would think in my head of what to say but nothing would come out, like when i thought about the words it was like i was mentally putting them on some high up pedestal that I just couldnt reach. This happens all the time and it's led to me being extremely reserved. I barely talk to anyone and I hate myself for it because I want to be able to make friends and whatnot but i can just never reach the words. There's a girl i like and so when I get the chance ill try to to talk to her. its like i have to drain my entire battery life so to speak in order to make conversation with her, but i try anyway. it works but the second i start thinking about confessing my feelings the wall comes up again and i just can't speak and have to talk about something else or tell her that i have to go. this has gone on since about halfway through our senior year, and it's funny because the other day we were chatting in the parking lot of our school and one of her friends came up to her and she introduced me to them and described me as being ""kind and super sweet"" and the three of us talked for a good while longer. She's called me cute before and has complimented my outfits a lot, too. I know i should feel good about these things but for some reason when I think about it I get angry, because it takes so much effort for me to speak to her at all. My anxiety flares up and I feel my chest squeezing and compressing the whole time, and i hate it so much. i genuinely love talking with her and i hate that it's almost painful to do so. 

after the botched therapy session today i seriously have started to feel scared of myself because i've been considering harming myself. and i hate that because i feel like i don't deserve to feel so bad. i live in a nice house with successful parents and go to a nice school. i should have everything i need to succeed too, but here i am. i can't focus on my work and i am a completely average student academically and am even may be at risk of not meeting one of the graduation requirements with only 10 days left..

my therapist took note of how i was behaving today and suggested i increase my dosage or change medication. i am on two medications at high dosages already and i've tried many, many different meds and dosages. nothing has truly helped with my anxiety and constant racing thoughts. its hard not to feel like i'm unfixable.

i know this is the internet and most people aren't going to care but my therapist is going to be gone next week and i don't feel comfortable talking about my mental health with anyone else in my life and just needed to vent. if anyone has read this far i could really use some sort of response, some sort of advice. please and thank you",4,anxiety
"I had an upsetting conversation with a friend today. They were upset about a status I posted online, because it referenced me worrying they were manipulative. This is a status I blocked them from seeing purposefully and did not name drop them. It was purely to reach out and get support. They didn't even know the full status I made, that I ended by saying I wasn't sure if it was true or a trauma response. I just wanted advice on how to cope. But someone, and I don't know who but I have two people that I believe it probably could be based on past conversations, decided to inform this friend about the status. And apparently they were not informed of the full status. They decided to talk to me about whether or not I actually thought they were manipulative. I don't think it's fair that I had to have a conversation about thoughts I never intended on sharing with them. My anxiety is very high right now and I started to dissociate, possibly to stave off this becoming paranoia about their intentions and the other people involved in this. Ironically I feel manipulated. But as I usually do in these situations, I am telling myself not to believe any of my thoughts as true since I recognise that it's extreme to believe everyone is against you. Because I'm fighting off believing that I'm unsafe right now around people who completely disconnected from the conflict.

I guess the point of this post is I don't feel like there's anyone in my life I can talk to this about right now. Because the people I'm closest too are potentially involved or one degree of seperation away, and my other outlet was to make a status with a filtered audience and now I feel like I can't do that without it coming back to this person. 

Any advice on how to find someone to talk to? It would be helpful to have a friend that also deals with paranoia, and maybe when we have anxious thoughts we can talk to each other to help one another become grounded in reality again. Any thoughts are welcome.",5,paranoia

i already know what i feel is irrational, but it doesn‚Äôt freak me out any less. i have visual and auditory hallucinations daily, but this deep-rooted paranoia is something i haven‚Äôt experienced in years.

when i walk in my house, i feel this overwhelming sense of dread. you know that feeling when someone is behind you? i feel that. it‚Äôs called FoP (feelings of presence) but mine seem to be a bit more intense.

i get this gut feeling that if i turn around when i have the FoP, that i‚Äôll die. it‚Äôs a deeply unsettling feeling, like how one clenches their jaw before being punched, knowing that the hit will connect. it feels like that‚Äî my body tenses up and i get this feeling that the ‚Äúhit‚Äù will be inevitable as soon as i turn around.

my stomach drops, i don‚Äôt feel alone, and i get this instinctive fear of turning around. it‚Äôs hard to navigate my house without turning 180. putting my back against the wall doesn‚Äôt help either because i imagine hands sprouting out of the wall and killing me.

someone please let me know what i can do to make this feeling stop. i‚Äôm so scared in my own house now and i‚Äôm so tired. i‚Äôm so so tired.

Usually, I am very anxious and paranoid about everything, for exemple : the other night, my dad's girlfriend made food for me and my brother but I didn't eat it because I was scared that she put something bad in it. Those paranoid episodes affected my friendship with my ex best friend : I had a boyfriend and I thought she was gonna stole him from me and I thought he liked her so I broke up with him and stopped my friendship with her.

"Hello everyone,

I'm looking for help and advices and I apologize for the long message, will add a TL;DR 

Yesterday, as i was walking on a crowded street full of families and people enjoying the Sunny day, I saw a group of 10 young guys suddendly run towards a guy to beat him up (I think it was a targeted revenge thing, but nevertheless very shocking) the guy was still running from the group when I tried to get myself away from the scene (felt really helpless and anxious, how can I, a single woman, handle 10 angry guys?) but 10 seconds later I heard a woman scream her lungs out and two guys starting to run towards the concussion which I hope was to help ? 
A few moments later I saw an ambulance emerge from the street, but I don't know if it was related or not.
 I know nothing happened to me, but this got me on edge all day, squirming at any fast moving people, loud noise or gathering of people and looking out for any potential danger.

It made me feel trapped in a city where there was no way to escape senseless violence that litteraly happens in front of everyone, with nothing we can do, and I know that much more horrible things happen in so many places, which also spiked my anxiety and I even caught myself thinking that I can't wait for this life to be over to not witness such horrible things, as if I had entirely forgotten that life is also about beautiful moments.

I tried to ""make sense out of it"" with my partner and my parents and they basically told me to get over it, and it didn't bring me any comfort
how do you manage to calm yourself, find a reason and see the light in this darkness?

Thanks so much for reading this and for your help!

"25 year old male

August 2022:

Finished an intensive masters straight after a 4 year undergrad.

September:

Job offers and interviews
End of relationship

October:

Moved into a 'party' flat and Starting work in the IT department of a Martime management company

November:

Mood decline begins - began to realise I want this job and lifestyle to just be temporary and work towards a better future for myself

December:

Dog passes away over Christmas.
New Years eve party my friend asked if I want to take his place on a new years day surf so he could do MDMA all night instead, I decided to go instead of him (I was drunk and didn't go to sleep until 6am)

January 2023:

Hit on the back of my head by a surf board while in the water.

Attended A&E to close up a bleeding wound on the back of my head, tetanus shot and advise to 'take it easy' before going back to work in 3 days.
I took it easy and tried to get back into a routine before starting back at work.

The day before I started back I vommit (thought it was something I ate - even my flatmate said 'is that the concussion?') - tried to sleep it off.

Worked for 3 extremely stressful days where I got no sleep what so ever and after the third day I just got home from work and went straight to bed extremely exhausted and just couldn't sleep all weekend.

Monday 9th of January:

Requested the day of sick and went to my GP and tried to explain my situation while getting things all muddled up and with slurred speech. The GP wrote me a letter that referred me to go back to A&E.

Arrive at A&E and handed in the letter and had to wait for half an hour to get seen. 

Got into the briefing room and tried to explain my situation to the nurse while again getting things all muddled up and with slurred speech.
The nurse without hesitation leaves the room and comes back in with a doctor.
 
That doctor brings me into the hospital bed area where I had to take off most of my clothes and get a heart pulse scan - all ok.

Then came about 3 nurses who all did the limb tests to see if I had control over them.
Sent for a CT scan of my head.

After the scan I had a chat with the doctor who tended to my wound on new years day who said the head scan was all clear and that I was suffering from the effects of concussion and discharged me on the same day. 

I walk outside the hospital all dazed and confused with a banging headache.

Got an Uber back to my flat and took a week off work went back to my GP the following Monday who was shocked I was back and thought I was drunk the last time he saw me, signs me off work for 4 weeks with a sick note that said 'Head Injury' and advised that I just try to stay in a routine and my symptoms would eventually go away. 

I did just that but for those 4 weeks I could not sleep what so ever and my mental health just got worse and worse and my flatmates just kept on partying and partying while I was getting clinically depressed with extreme anxiety trying to get better from a concussion.

February 2023:

I got so unwell by the 4th week of my sick note I had to get another 4 weeks off and go home to my parents just to get my physical health okay with 7 days worth of sleeping tablets from my GP who also referred me to a brain injury unit.

March 2023:

Went back to my GP and got perscribed a low dose of sertaline due to my mental health decline.
I started having suicidal thoughts but just thought they would go away after a while.

Had meetings with the brain injury unit over the web and they basically said I was all okay to do a phased return to work due to my head scan being all okay.

April 2023:

My thoughts of suicide got worse to the point where I had to tell my dad and the next day we went to A&E and I talked with the mental health crisis team and voluntarily went into a physciatric ward where I was diagnosed with clinical depression, my sertaline was uped, had another CT scan and an EEG (all okay) and I was discharged 3 weeks later.

May 2023:

Still have those thoughts and had to make an appointment with a pychcologist because I am still having so much trouble processing all this.

I just keep on saying to myself 
""just get through another day"" and ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem""
everyday.

This is the most messed up year of my life and I have no idea how I am going to be okay as there is so much uncertainty that lies ahead :(

"So this is going to sound stupid, but for a moment, I need to get this off my chest:

For fun, I've been playing around with textAI sits, they are fun at first, but there is a level of realism that unsettles me.

It will usually spiral like this: ""Hey, TextAI, say something motivating about continuing to study in my field!""

and it will say something that is surprisingly inspiring, perhaps I've just been in a rut but it feels this way. 

Then I'll start indulging in fantasy stuff: ""talk to me as if I am X, Y, Z, whatever."" 

And it gives me this odd feeling, like it feels good, but, skin-crawling.

I also struggle with grief, so sometimes I'll send out: ""Talk to me as if you are my old dog, or cat, or grandpa"" and it's cliche text but it tears me to pieces.

"I‚Äôve experienced heart palpitations before, a few years ago. I remember at that time I mostly felt them at night when I was going to bed. They only lasted a few days and then they disappeared. 

This is the second time I‚Äôve experienced them and they‚Äôve been happening for at least 2 weeks now. This time, I notice them more so during the day and evening. I don‚Äôt really feel them when I‚Äôm in bed. I can be waking around or sitting and I will feel a sudden ‚Äúthump‚Äù and then it goes away. 

I‚Äôve had the worst health anxiety of my life lately and so I‚Äôm not totally surprised I‚Äôm having palpitations. 

The time before, a few years ago, I also think I was going through an anxious time. 

What concerns me is that 1) this is the longest I‚Äôve experienced them and 2) they seem to be happening even when I‚Äôm not necessarily feeling anxious. 
They aren‚Äôt happening a lot, maybe 5-10 times per day (at least when I notice them). 

I have felt them when laying on my stomach or bending over. I‚Äôve noticed them after I eat too. (I have some digestive issues, at times.)

"My partner (m36) has had anxiety all his life. He has grown up with the mindset that men just be strong and stoic and brave. This is not from his parents, rather I think it is from his peers when he was a teenager.

He has bottled up everything negative within him and not felt it in a healthy manner and it is now causing him to break.
For the last few days he has been sleeping for a maximum of 3 hours and tonight he hasn't slept at all. He has had 4mg of diazepam as prescribed to him on an emergency basis and it has done nothing to ease his anxiety or allow him to sleep. 
He is now feeling incredibly helpless and scared because he can't control this, and he is exhausted and just wants to sleep and escape his mind. I do not know how to help him. I've tried listening to all that he needs to vent, talking him through his feelings, as a visual thinker I've tried to get him to use the techniques I use with visualizing the anxiety as something or someone physical and talking to it.

"For context, we have been dating about 7 months and we are long distance but he will occasionally spend a week or two at my house. 

He has had his diagnosis for nearly 4 years now. He is very dependent on me for support as I am his closest companion. He lives with his mother but their relationship is rocky so he doesn't see her as an emotional support figure.

He is medicated but he has always had episodes where he will feel very scared and upset and his hallucinations (mainly auditory) get really bad.

"Hi there,

So lately I've been in not a super great place, but it's been coming in waves. I'm currently in a rigorous grad program, so I've been trying to chalk it up to just being stressed and doubting my abilities, etc etc. But I was wondering if I'm the only one that gets this particular feeling (I've experienced it my whole life and only in the past few years have I been realizing the pattern between dark thoughts and then immediately feeling this sensation)--I can really only describe it as a kind of deep discomfort, /almost/ pain but not quite, that starts in my stomach and radiates to the palms of my hands. It aches there for a second and then goes away until the next bout of bad feelings, which could be as soon as seconds later.

&#x200B;

I have absolutely no idea what this is, and I don't know of anyone who struggles with their mental health as I do so I don't really have anyone that I could ask. Does anyone else get this, or any other odd/unconventional physical symptoms of your depression?",2,depression
"Throw away obviously.    


I've been struggling with my mental health since I could ever remember.  I had anger management issues in elementary school leading to me getting special treatment and very frequent meetings with the school councilor who taught me to ""control"" my emotions (repress them.)  This lead into middle school where they deemed that unnecessary, which happened to coincide with me getting frequent suspensions for my behavior.  This lead into high school where I got into frequent fights for the first two years, mostly due to being bullied. This was to the point where I was on a first name basis with the school resource officer and the social worker.    


That is the point where I learned I'm no longer allowed to be honest about my mental health with anyone for fear of repercussions.  I was honest one time and I was immediately threatened with being hospitalized.  This has stuck with me ever since, I've learned to repress my emotions and the only emotion I really feel these days is a deep overwhelming sadness.  I've tried reaching out multiple times to different therapists and councilors, some of them are completely useless while the only one that was any help that I mildly trusted tried to hospitalize me again.    


I don't understand why I'm not allowed to talk about the fact that living is a constant struggle just not to unalive. I don't understand why I can't talk about how much pain I'm in.  I don't understand why the people who's job it is to help, go out of their way to make their patients not trust them.  I want to talk, I want to be better.  My brain won't let me and people just want to put me into a padded room instead of helping me.    


Why can't I just be honest?",2,depression

"I‚Äôve worked so hard on improving myself. I‚Äôve gotten through and over PTSD and borderline personality disorder.

My life improved a lot.

But the one thing I kept going back to therapy for, was my inability to relate and connect with others. I‚Äôm extremely extroverted. the only time I‚Äôm truly happy is when I‚Äôm able to have a lot of people in my life, go to events, and meet new people. 

But I got diagnosed with autism, and suddenly everything made sense. 

No matter how hard I try, I just can‚Äôt connect with people. I easily meet new people; and then that‚Äôs just sort of it. There‚Äôs no click. I don‚Äôt really have friends. They don‚Äôt last. Ever.

I don‚Äôt have family. I‚Äôm the black sheep.

And sure, you can improve symptoms if autism, just like how plenty of people in wheelchairs can walk for a short amount of time and plenty can improve their life and work around it. 

But, if the one thing a person in a wheelchair loved to do is running: then what?

If I were introverted then this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. But I can‚Äôt solve my problem. And anyone who knows me, knows that I‚Äôm always looking towards the future. I always come out fine. I always make it through. I‚Äôm extremely determined and optimistic. I‚Äôm always uplifting and always willing to work towards what I want.

But the one thing that makes me miserable, that gives me suicidal depression, is the one thing I can‚Äôt solve.

There is no working through autism to hopefully no longer be diagnosed with it. There is only so much you can improve with autism before you plateau.

There‚Äôs nothing I can do to help myself.",2,depression
"Tw: suicidal ideation 

23F, living with my single mom (57) since I was born. she's a recovering alcoholic and has been sober for almost 3 years. on and off depressive episodes since I was born, which I also struggle with. 

I desperately want to move out but she has breakdowns every other day about how guilty she feels about ""messing me up"" from her addiction and how she can't forgive herself. she is in therapy and does daily AA meetings. she has epilepsy so she can't drive. she has no friends. she doesn't go out. 

When I wished her a happy mother's day, she said that she couldn't celebrate being such a failure. Today, she said she wants to die.

It feels impossible to leave her even though we barely can have a conversation without fighting or with her starting to cry. I am her only support system. I feel like I'm just going to die and there is nothing I can do about it. I don't know what the point of life is. I've never had any dreams or ambitions. Even during phases of my life where I would not have considered myself depressed, I am aimless. I feel bad for my mom because it's like she's counting on me to do better than her but I also just want to die. 

I've been through multiple therapies, I've taken all the antidepressants and antipsychotic combinations possible since I was 11 years old. I had a year long severe depressive episode in 2021 and spent 2022 climbing my way out just to crawl back in earlier in the year.

I also keep thinking that my boyfriend is lying to me, cheating on me, or planning to do something to me. There is a lot more, but those are the main two I am concerned about.

What is genuinely good about life? Why do people not allow assisted suicide for those who can't do this anymore?
Like, I will never be any use to this world  because all I can do is art. I am mentally AND physically ill person, I can't do any useful job. I can't earn decent amount of money to live on my own with just doing art. There are countless people that do art better than me, and that's okay. I will forever be alone because of my mental illness, and that's understandable too. My home country is destroyed by war and the country i ran away to is now involved in another war, so I don't even have a place to call home anymore. And that's fine too, I know people have it worse. 

What I don't get is if I'm no use to humanity, if I will struggle, be poor and alone till my last day, why can't I just die. There is no assisted suicide option, and just doing it myself might not work. Is it really this hard to just allow people to die peacefully in this world, not by throwing themselves under a train or hanging themselves? I really only want to hold someone's hand when I die.

1) I get suicidal thoughts 24/7. Nothing serious, but when I get thoughts like that I become either really bitter or sad. I become somewhat irritable, cry easily and honestly just a pain to be around. I know my family and friends (I think they're my friends) are getting tired of it. 

2) It's starting to make me hard to focus in school. It doesn't happen frequently, but sometimes I think of cutting myself or suicide so much that I literally can't focus in class.

3) I always get annoyed that I can't cut deep and I'm afraid that I might grab a knife one day and try to chop off my entire arm (ironic isn't it that I say I want to die but yet I'm so afraid of hurting myself I'm also the world's biggest liar btw)

I accidentally admitted to not taking my meds one time to my friends and they wouldn‚Äôt get off my back about it (and they thought it was just a one day thing, I haven‚Äôt taken them in months).

Thing is, I‚Äôm much happier and content than I was before. Of course I‚Äôm not always on my a game, but I haven‚Äôt felt suicidal in weeks and I actually have hope for the future.

It‚Äôs a big contributor to many things in my life right now, and Id love to tell my therapist but I fear it would count as me harming myself and the last thing I want to do is go back to the mental hospital.

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm doing is good or not, maybe I should give the meds another chance? Or maybe I should tell my psychiatrist the truth? Idk. 

What do you guys think? It would be nice to hear opinions of strangers that would know what I‚Äôm going through and aren‚Äôt being paid to help me.",2,depression
"I've been fighting with myself over the last year about my decisions and life choices...and it feel likes it's a never ending game.

Over the last year, I had an incident that happened with my car. It was towed incorrectly and pulled 75 miles (it's and all wheel drive) and did some major damage. I've had it repairs multiple times but I have anxiety attacks every time my car pops a check engine light. Every time it pops up is due to choices I made trying to fix it/ improper repairs.

While waiting for repairs to be done in November of last year my fiance was hit my a car on his bicycle and could have died. I was also in school at the time so I'm not even sure how I made it through that.

I had to increase my meds which I thought would help, but I don't know who to go to or who to talk to...I can't even find a therapist. I feel like I'm trapped and barely have the courage to post this. üò¢

"I've had these dreams a few times in my life that are hard to describe but it feels like either the world is going to end or that I'm going to die. I had one the other week where it felt very strange and felt like if I leaned to far left or right something would rip and I would die. I then got very scared and woke up and for about 3 or 4 minutes the fear didn't leave me. I've had these sort of strange dreams maybe 5 or 6 times but never close together. Except from now.

Last night I went to sleep and was only asleep for about half an hour where I had another one of these dreams. I can't really remember what happened in the dream but I became convinced I was going to die again. During this dream I sleep walked (which I have never ever done before) and went downstairs where my mum and stepdad where watching TV. I then told them I few times that I was scared, starting talking gibberish, walked into the kitchen and then went back to my bedroom. My sister then spoke to me through my bedroom door and I woke up but the fear didn't leave me at all. I was terrified that I was going to die and I went downstairs and told my mum to assure me that I wasn't going to die and it took the best part of 15 minutes for me to stop being convinced that I was going to die.

I'm a schizophrenic so that could have something to do with this but I'm 99.99% sure it isn't. This is something I've only experienced once when I was about 11 where I had one of these dreams and started crying in my sleep and saying that I'm not good enough or something like that. But that's about 10 years ago and I have never once in my life actually sleep walked other than last night that I know of. I'm wondering if anyone else has had these dreams before? I'm also wondering if this could be the start of more sleep walking? I really hope it's not. I'm hoping this was a one off. Any advice would be nice.",6,schizophrenia
"Hey everyone. I've had depression since around 2010. I feel like I am at the bottom of the ocean drowning. I'm married and have 2 kids, but my wife also has Depression really bad. Every time I try to talk to her about my depression she turns it to how worse she has it. I used to be on meds for it, but the prescription ran out and I can't afford to lose an hour at work to go see the doctor for a refill. We also rent a house we really can't afford because it was the only option in this market. No matter what little steps I can manage to get out of this funk, it seems like life kicks me back down. I'm up to my gills on debt, my vehicle is broke and needs an expensive repair that I can't afford to fix so I've been bumming rides with friends to work. I'm sorry I really don't know where I'm going with this but it feels good to get it out. i have no one to talk to about this type of stuff.

"In the last years I found out I have a habit of telling new people (potential friends, partners, coworkers) that I meet right at the start that I have memory problems just so they would know what they're dealing with.
I would say to them that often it will happen that I will forget something they would have said or some appointment, birthday or some chore but that doesn't mean that I don't not respect them or appreciate them and I apologise in advance.

When I met my now gf I told her exactly that, like ""Please don't be upset if I forget something you tell me or where we have been a year ago or what has happened at your mom's lunch or if I forget I have to do something, it's my brain, that doesn't mean that I don't appreciate you or care about you..""

And I don't think people really understand, they think oh, ""she's a bit forgetful but isn't everyone?"" But then I see people get frustrated, hurt, they think I don't give a crap about them or their feelings and it's not true, I just CAN'T REMEMBER!

I've been making more mistakes and have been screwing up, it could be burnout. 

I don't know what to do, sometimes at night I think if i should just end it all so the pain in my check stops and the voices that tell me to keep working end.

two weeks later, started my second job at a non-big 4. the environment is a stretch better. the managers are respectful and treat you like humans, i made friends with colleagues. however, my depression starts to get bad again (maybe it‚Äôs never gotten better in the first place). went to get a psychiatrist and she prescribed me lexapro. work isnt doing well. manager put me on PIP also (second time at second job, the consistency is amazing). manager is super kind, super supportive but she can feel that i‚Äôm lacking effort.

I want to die. I'm getting physical pains throughout now because I'm so tense. How I wish I was somehow somebody else. Is this the dark side of the soul? 

Feeling the shame I have inside me feels like cutting my insides with a razor. I haven't bitten off all my nails so I can't be that bad. I smile and I act empathetic to distract me from the tearing sting of existing in a body that I have failed repeatedly. People that I've failed repeatedly. Someone I never became. Someone who hyperventilates at will. Quietly. And wonders if it will show up on my fitness watch. Some proof of the darkness filled with scathing flames of pain.

I can't speak for other people with autism, but personally, I experience empathy through having an intellectual understanding that someone is feeling an emotion. I think it's rather obvious, but if I don't know someone is feeling an emotion, I can't really feel empathy. It just doesn't make sense, and wouldn't be genuine anyway.  


I've heard some neurotypical people (who I am not suggesting in any way are representative of all neurotypical people, but are a large enough group to bother me) say that people with autism don't have empathy, and are cold in the face of people suffering. Specifically, I've seen the argument made multiple times that people with autism could watch someone suffer and just... not care.

&#x200B;

However, I can easily imagine some people with autism making nearly that exact argument against neurotypical people (which again, is not an argument I support, it just illustrates why the first is bad). The argument goes something like this: neurotypical people only show caring for those whose suffering they can see, and not for anyone else. Specifically, the argument would say that neurotypical people care more about the aesthetics of suffering than anyone's actual pain. There is evidence that could be presented for such a thing too. Check the amount of media coverage, legislative action, and concern whenever a massive, violent event happens and people are hurt or killed. However, anything that doesn't have that violent flair to it is often left forgotten even when it affects many more people. So neurotypical people (so says this hypothetical argument which is WRONG) would condemn people to pain and suffering because of aesthetics outside of these people's control.

&#x200B;

I obviously don't agree with that argument, neurotypical people DO have empathy (obviously), but I thought it would be interesting to share because it illustrates exactly why it's sister argument is wrong too. Autistic people (like me) DO have empathy, we just show and understand it different. It's precisely BEAUSE we care and want people to be happy, that some neurotypical people think we don't.

&#x200B;

In one of my classes at school, we had a discussion about 9/11 which prompted me to feel rather horrified at how important the event is considered, and the rest of the class seemed put off that I suggested it is given too much weight. So I wanted to share my feelings about that here cause it is sorta bothering me. Like, numbers-wise, compare something like terrorism to something like overdoses or workplace injuries... just, wow...",1,autism

"I know the title sounds selfish and trust me I do feel selfish but I need help. I am only 21‚Ä¶I feel like I‚Äôm a mother to my mother , my older brother , sister & nieces . I love them dearly but I‚Äôm drained. 

My mom and brother are both schizophrenic. They are not willing to get any help nor take any medicine, they have been prescribed but refused. They don‚Äôt think anything is wrong with them. I live in a small city and none of the facilities will keep them longer than 72 hours. 

I recently got my own apartment.

So her last resort is obviously me, I stay in a small 1bedroom which means they‚Äôll have to sleep in my living room, which also means, I can‚Äôt have company over nor enjoy my own privacy. My brother also leaves in & out, they argue all day, nosey, can be loud, etc. I‚Äôm a CNA who works 12hr shifts sometimes 16, and when I get off I just wanna rest in my..not deal with extra bullshit. I wanna invite whoever over , walk around naked, stay up as late as I want, etc ..

On top of that, my sister has 2 kids that my mother watches which means If they move in with me, that‚Äôll be 4 people I have to watch after because my big sister can not get her own place ..her credit is messed up and no apartments will approve her.

I‚Äôm the youngest with no kids and I feel like I‚Äôm a parent . What should I do? I don‚Äôt wanna give up on them but I‚Äôm tired of tryninh to help people

"I have a diary entry from the age of eleven talking about how much I wanted to die. I'm nineteen now, and not a day goes by that I don't regret not ending it sooner. 

I go to a good school, but I'm not overly passionate about my major, but then again I'm not really passionate about anything. I have a generally great family, and am upper middle class. I had a mostly good upbringing too; I only doubt my mother's love sometimes. So there's really nothing I can complain about.

I just am so lonely a lot of the time. I don't have a best friend. There's always someone better to hang out with. I'm a good person, I think, but there's always someone better. One of my friends comes to visit sometimes, but ditches me after an hour to hang out with her other friends in the area, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't cry all the way back to my dorm. I find myself doing dishes at other people's places, baking them things, giving them gifts, desperate to feel wanted and kept around. But there's no one with whom I've really ""clicked"" with, and certainly no one who actually reaches out to me. One of them even forgot my birthday. All of my friendships feel so superficial. I don't add anything to my family or my relationships. I feel like if I just disappear, it won't even be a blip in the radar.

Like I said, I've been sad for almost longer than I've been alive. I don't even know what's holding me back at this point. Why haven't I ended it? I'm not diagnosed; in fact, I don't even know who my doctor is. I just keep everything inside. And I have some friends who have gotten help for it and are better off for it, and I can't help but compare myself to them. One of them cried in bed for days, dropped out of school. For some reason, I just power through. I cry myself to sleep and hide behind long sleeves but I'm still functional. I shower, I get passing grades, I pull my head out of my ass and attend class and study and exercise, but I still feel so empty at the end of the day. Like all of it was in vain. I want to be like my friends who got help, but I don't know who to talk to (again, I don't know my doctor). I can't talk to my friends, because frankly, none of them actually *care* about how I feel when I would move mountains for them. I cried for hours when I realized that no one will ever care about me as much as I care for them. 

I feel like I'm a lost cause, honestly. Like the only way I'll get help is an un-alive attempt. I've gotten this far without help, like, do I even need it? Maybe I'm faking this all for the odd chance that someone asks how I'm really doing.",2,depression
"A little back story.
I have CPTSD that stems from intense childhood trauma. One thing that continues to get worse as I get older is the feeling that I am unsafe. Im a 24 yo female and the world around me feels so unsafe. Sometimes I feel unsafe even in my own home. I have nightmares often that I‚Äôm being hunted/chased and cant seem to rest even while I‚Äôm sleeping. 

I have a particular fear of men and dating/engaging with them. This has started to impact my daily life as I have become isolated and antisocial from this fear. When I do start to get close to someone I start having delusional and racing thoughts about how they will probably end up harming or killing me at some point. 

Keeping this in mind, Ive been really traumatized the past few months. In June I was at work reading through local news articles when a picture of a man popped up that I knew. I used to teach group fitness and this particular man took my classes and he would always come to class early to chat and hangout with the instructors. We added each other on snap and casually started chatting. He was working on a book and would have me proof read it and stuff of that nature.
I never got particularly close to him but we still were very friendly with each other and I would say that we were decent friends. Not really sure what ended up happening but we ended up out of touch. Fast forward to a few weeks before said new article was found, he ended up trying to re-add me on snap by name but I ended up denying it due to said paranoia about men. 
This guy ended up murdering his ex girlfriend and her friend in a parking lot before taking his own life. 
This obviously has been kinda disturbing to me because it plays into my main fears and paranoia. I am very analytical and self aware so normally with irrational fears I am able to reassure myself its just that, an irrational fear. But recently I don‚Äôt have that reassurance to give myself which has been distressing. 
I don‚Äôt really know how to work through this and it has started to impact my social functioning.
Any insight and advice is much appreciated.",5,paranoia

Made a lot of people worry about me. Made people genuinely scared about my safety, made them think that I wouldn't make it. I traumatized my parents so much. They already had to go through so much, and I just added more on top of that. They didn't want to lose their first child, the one they had to work so hard on. I'm a bad person, don't try to tell me otherwise. And it's not like I'm going to kill myself or cut myself or anything of that sort right now. That would mean that I've wasted everyone's time. No, I don't want to kill myself. But I wouldn't mind if I died right now. If life were to take back my soul. I wouldn't beg for a second chance. I'd just say goodbye. I know that's a horrible thing to say, but it's the honest truth for me. There are other things I hate too. The fact that my mental health has gotten so bad that I cannot comprehend anything I read anymore. I can't even comprehend shows or movies. I can't play the games I love. I can't do all of the projects I wanted. I'm basically flunking my classes. My friends probably hate how I'm always joking about wanting to die. Heck, I think even my teachers must be annoyed with me. It's annoying. I'm annoying. I don't like how annoying I am. But I guess I can't help it anymore. It's just how I am now. Useless, annoying, childish, immature, hopeless, burden, dead-weight. I'm so sorry for this. I hate myself. I hate all of this. The person who I used to be is dead, their rotting corpse in this shell of their body.  I hate it. I hate myself. I hate how I treat others. I hate how I affect others. I hate how there's nothing I can do to change it. No matter how many books I read, shows I watch, people I meet, things I play, events I go to - everything stays the same. Nothing changes. I'm still a worthless good for nothing person. I can't do anything. I can't be happy, genuinely happy. I can't make others happy or proud. All I know is how to lie, be needy, and disappoint.

"I'm a third year, computer science student. Last summer (2022), all I ever wanted was to get an internship this summer(2023). I felt like a failure and the weight of not getting an internship loomed over me, as my brother had gotten an internship when he was in my year. It also didn't help, that I was checking linkedin and feeling sad as my other classmates had internships that summer. Everytime I thought about the fact of not getting am internship my heart would start beating so fast, I had to calm myself many times doing breathing exercises.

Fast forward to now. I got an internship as a software developer, if I were to tell myself this last summer I would be ecstatic, thinking, god has finally heard me. Now, don't get me wrong I am grateful for being able to get an internship, I know the feeling of thinking it's not possible. But, as I've gotten it, I thought my life would be complete in terms of the summer but clearly I feel the opposite. It's funny because as of right now in terms of work - it's pretty light. The guidance/mentorship in the internship lacks but that's pretty much it. What's getting to me is, the future. Even after my work is done I think of what might come tomorrow - What if they give me something big to do? What if I don't know how to do it at all? What if I won't get the help I want? What if it's really hard? All these questions + probably million more follow me like a cloud as soon as I close my laptop and until I open it the next day.

"I don't know if I really feel hope anymore or if I keep going on just so I don't burden anyone with absolutely giving up. Some days I really try to find something that means a lot to me and something I can look forward to in my life. I try to do things that I know I enjoy and I even have a girlfriend who means the world to me. But, none of it makes it feel like it is worth going through the river of shit (as the poker players would call it).

I am constantly confused what it means to be happy. Sometimes I think I found it, only for it to just turn around and lead to more disappointment. I feel like the ultimate disappointment. I know there is a lot of trauma that makes me feel that way and my mind has been permanently altered to think as such from years of BS manipulation I have dealt with. I know that it is the result of a decay in my ability to process things in anything other than pain, a deconstruction of my ability to communicate in any fashion that is clear or unformed by the Bell Jar Sylvia Plath wrote about. Trauma physically changes our brain chemistry. It is not just the gross overstimulating anxiety we feel when we flash back to an old horrible event. It is also the fundamental way our mind perceives the physical world. The simple functions that are no more complicated than 2 + 2 are basically fed bad data over and over again until 2+2=5. Then it builds on that until we reach such a level of obfuscation that a million little pieces doing something wrong, makes a very ugly whole shape. That is what trauma does.

I know this. I have looked at it and observed it over and over again. I have looked at the things I do and I know what part of my past it comes from. But, sometimes it doesn't matter because even if I managed to conquer those aspects of my trauma, I feel like there is just more trauma waiting for me. More fights and struggles. More death and mourning. More systems that actively feed off my energy just to commodify my labor into such low worth. More decay of my body and mind.

It comes to the point where I don't even know what I want to do anymore. What do I even hope to get out of life? Love? Sometimes it really feels like I can't truly feel it. I care for people and my girlfriend, but it is so obscured by a fawning trauma response that I just can't feel beyond that need to be nice and supportive out of the need to not feel like absolute dog shit. I literally can't trust myself to know what love is. Success? I would love the security of success but I feel like most of the time success is sacrificing you self-worth and principles to gain that security. It is an insecurity at the heart of it. Fun? Maybe. Maybe I just want memories worth having. Maybe I would like times where I can truly put myself together long enough to really internalize what a great time is instead of pushing myself through activities just so I don't ruin other people's time.

What I really want? I just want to write a novel; I want to create a youtube channel where I can go over art history and over analyze everything and create parallels between a Russian writer like Fyodor Dostoyevsky and an anime like Gintama and have it work. I would like the security to celebrate what is beautiful and ugly in this life for the pure joy of it. I want to be good enough for someone without the crushing fear that I am constantly on the verge of fucking it up. I want to be able to trust how I feel and be able to put it into words without the basically half an hour pause it takes me to get even a slightly viable explanation together. But, even then I will never be sure that something horrible isn't just around the corner and it makes it so much more difficult to keep walking on. I know I can't live my life worrying about the future, but I can't stop it. I can't stop living in the past either. I don't know what it means to live in the present because it just feels like an endurance to get to a new moment.

Even now I hate this post because it feels like a pity party for myself. That I am just wanting to feel sorry for myself and have people feel sorry for me. Honestly, I just want it out of my head for a bit. I just want to be able to put into words other people can understand and maybe that will make it more manageable. Maybe that will put it into such a way that I can start taking it to pieces. But every time I try to put it into words, I keep thinking ""no, that's not it."", ""no, that is not how it feels"", ""no, they will misunderstand what I mean""...I just don't have any internal confidence. It feels like all that is left if pushing on just so it doesn't feel like a burden or it is just numb. Idk. I'm going to post this anyways, despite my mind telling me not to.

My life feels like a pit of nothingness, always. I have little moments of happiness but then it‚Äôs just back to my bland baseline, or worse. And right now, I am deep into the ‚Äòworse‚Äô category. I‚Äôm barely functioning and avoiding social interactions and when I do talk to someone it feels like I am watching myself in a simulation selecting the correct responses until the interaction ends. 

I have very few friends. I have never fully trusted anyone, even though I know deep down I should trust these people. I always just end up saying ‚Äòoh ya I‚Äôm okay, just a rough patch‚Äô. When inside, I feel like I‚Äôm dead. I have no family, apart from my mum who is preoccupied with her other family in another country. I‚Äôm not in a relationship, no where even close, I feel entirely unlovable because I have nothing to offer from my empty soul.
Loneliness literally courses through my veins, there are times when I will be sobbing and I feel actual aching pain in my fingertips and body from lack of physical touch or companionship. I grew up surrounded by abusive men, my grandfather, father and step dad. But because we were wealthy, when I acted out it was ‚Äòoh she‚Äôs just spoilt not getting her own way‚Äô because I had all the material things I could want, when I was literally begging for help, having anxiety attacks, without even knowing it. I was never protected or nurtured and that theme has continued in my life. 

Where my friends come into it: I‚Äôm 27, had a job that I was actually thriving at for the first time in my entire life. In fact, when I was at work it was the only time I have ever felt competent or proud of myself in anyway. I met some great people during that time, and am still in touch with them regularly. They know that I get ‚Äòdown‚Äô sometimes, and we do try to talk about it. Everything they express is with the best of intentions, you know, ‚Äòit will get better‚Äô and ‚Äòsomething good will come along‚Äô. I always have, and always will support them because I am well aware that people from perfect scenarios get down sometimes too. They grew up differently to me, and I don‚Äôt want to explain my past and either have it 1. Traumatise them or 2. Feel that I am now a burden and their responsibility. 

I simply don‚Äôt know how to communicate the sort of things that happened to me in the past that now dictate my emotions and slumps into depression, especially considering that they come from very loving households with a lot of support. I don‚Äôt want to be pitied, or tiptoed around, if they find out. I also don‚Äôt know how to accept support and feel like I am a huge drain on my friends energy when I am in this down stage.

"I'm so fucking miserable. I am losing my friends, my closest friend who's like a brother to me of 8years I think is becoming more close with our new friend and It's my fault because I cannot muster any sort of activity cause of my depression. They all think I hate that new friend, but I really don't I think. They all thought I was jealous, and I said ''No, why would I be? That's silly, and stupid. I'm really not.'' But they didn't believe me cause I said it in a VERY fake way, and now I think they're starting to be right which I feel awful about. I'm becoming a disgusting version of myself and I feel like I'm falling down a pit and watching myself do so, I can't stand living anymore I hate it. My grades are getting slightly better but, I'm losing all my friends and I feel horrendous.

"idk where else to post this. 

i have anxiety and depression but i firmly believe i have paranoia and panic as well...

a few days ago, my parents had their friends over. and whenever we have guests over, i have to clean my bathroom because thats the one guests use.

but even though i know this shit is completely irrational, i cant stop feeling paranoid about it. for context, i use summers eve, a soap specifically for the vaginal area. idk how or where i came up with this paranoid thought, but i keep thinking ""what if one of my dads friends jacked off in my bathroom and put their c\*m in the summerseve bottle?"" and then i started getting paranoid thoughts about being magically pregnant from it.

i am fighting my brain on this. each nnight when i take a shower, i pour a lot of the soap out and examine it to show myself ""see, u're being paranoid and delusional. it's not true. u're not magically pregnant."" 

but even though i reassure myself every day by trying to prove to myself its not possible or real, i STILL get the paranoid thoughts that INSIST it's real.

idk who to fucking talk to about this because this irrational fear and thougth is SO Fucking strange and totally wacko. i might be scared of older men or something. idk why else i would be so distrustful of my dads friends...

idk how to make it stop. i've tried over and over to tell myself ""it's not possible. look, ur soap looks normal. it's fine."" 

and i KNOW that the possibilty of getting pregnant from rubbing that stuff on the outter area around ur vagina is slim to none...but STILL. MY BRAIN WONT STOP THINKING IT. i eve tried to chug alcohol in hopes i convince my brain to ""miscarry"" the imagination pregnancy and paranoid thoughts about it.",5,paranoia

"I've been in my retail job for years in a management position. A couple weeks ago my keys glitched out of the matrix. Completely gone, cannot find them anywhere. I'm not someone who usually loses things, mind you. I left work, drove home, stayed at home, went to work the next day and they're gone. I've cleaned everything at home, everything in the car. No dice. Since then I've been trying to keep it from my boss-because he will just use it as an excuse to make my life miserable-and have been using my keyholder's (N who is my friend) keys and swapping back and forth. Today I was using a different keyholder's keys (D who doesn't hate me but we're not friends) while he was working with me and my boss. I noticed towards the end that he has a different set of keys hanging out of his pocket. I never saw if they're store keys or not, but they're on the lanyard D previously used for his store keys.

Some context on my boss: he is very petty, manipulative, and I've seen him weave complex lies for the purpose of manipulation and mind games. He claims to care for me, but he wants to have an affair with me (he's older than my dad) and I've seen him play mind games and mean pranks on another woman who he is currently having an affair with (he has never admitted this). 

Some context on me: I took many hallucinogens and psychedelics while in high school and have experienced drug-induced and non-drug-induced paranoia before. It doesn't plague me every day but often enough to cause me to doubt myself. I was on anti-anxiety medication when I was younger as well.

I feel like my boss and my coworker somehow took my keys and are playing mind games with me. My boss has made jokes about how I lose my keys and at first I thought he was referring to when I misplace them in the store or stockroom, but now the jokes are ringing in my head. I should have a complete set of duplicated keys by tomorrow, but what if my boss is setting me up to blackmail me with the knowledge I have illegally duplicated keys?  What is his end goal? Is he just enjoying watching me squirm and laughing behind my back? Is all of this just another paranoid delusion? If anyone reads this, please, I need an outside opinion. I don't even feel like I can trust N anymore, and I thought he was my friend. Thank you for your time and any input you can provide.",5,paranoia

"The past few years (especially my last year of college) I have been more and more paranoid. Not just about me going on a bridge then me thinking my tire is about to blow and falling into the water. Not just someone hacking into my banking accounts and stealing every penny I have every few hours. Not just me thinking I have to hide my wallet in different places in my room because I believe someone is going to go through it. But I have had these phases of just‚Ä¶ images of me or my family members closest to me passing away. A recent example that I have only told my gf recently is why I‚Äôm scared of heights. People think others are scared of heights because it‚Äôs plainly intimidating. Well, when I would look down I see a clip of me falling to my death. I‚Äôm paranoid I‚Äôm going to have the urge to just jump when I don‚Äôt want that to happen. Another example is me hurting myself in other ways and me even hurting the people I love the most. I have NEVER wanted these thoughts. I have NEVER thoroughly thought or planned to possibly fulfill those awful thoughts so I know I‚Äôm not crazy.

"I cannot maintain friendships. I keep getting told its bad for me to not have friends, but trying to make and keep friends makes me incredibly uncomfortable and stressed.

My ex would belittle me for it, tell me I needed friends to be a functioning member of society, told me he found me less attractive because I didnt go out and do things with others like ‚Äúnormal people do‚Äù and that he couldn‚Äôt be my friend because he was my boyfriend. But I was happy being who I was. I was content with myself. & I did go out, just by myself. 

I realize now he was full of it, as my current parter is my best friend and has never made me feel like I needed to change any part of myself. But I still sometimes stress over the fact that I cant maintain/ don‚Äôt want friends. I still feel like maybe Im doing something wrong by not having any, but then once I make a friend I realize its far more uncomfortable and ‚Äúwrong‚Äù than not having any friends.

let me give you some examples:

1. walking to my car from my house (vice versa) in the dark. i have this constant fear that as soon as i unlock my car someone is going to come up behind me, stab me and steal my car/ leave me there to die.

2. waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. the fear kicks in when i am walking back to my room. i feel like someone/ something is either watching me or i‚Äôm going to see something at the corner of my eye‚Ä¶ i usually have to RUN back to my room because my anxiety is too much.

3. being in a public bathroom ALONE. i have this fear that someone is standing on one of the toilets and is waiting for me to sit/ start going to the bathroom & they crawl underneath the stalls to grab my leg and steal my purse/ money. 

3.5 flushing toilets in public restrooms scare me too because ITS SO LOUD & I CAMT HEAR MY SURROUNDINGS

"[Tw, mentions of suicide and suicidal thoughts] 

I've been like this for almost eight years. Maybe longer. I don't know how far the thoughts go back. The pain. All I remember is one sunny day when I was eight years old. Sports day. The bullying. It all comes back in a rush. My mother didn't attend that day, and I was sitting in the shade of a tree, eating alone. Watching, as everyone ate with parents and friends, smiling and laughing. I remember the feeling in the pit of my stomach.

It was the same feeling when they found my diary that night. When my mom saw the words 'suicide' and 'death' written in bright blue glittery ink. I wonder what she though of me. I still remember the look on her face. I don't think they cared as much as they said they did back then. After all, from there on out, it only got worse.

It never goes away. Never wavering for a second. It's always there in the back of my mind. It's left its mark as scars on my skin and a plauge inside my brain. Why does it have to hurt so bad? And then there's the numbness. I can't tell which ones worse. Feeling nothing, or feeling everything, all together, all at once. 

It keeps me up at night. And it's so hard. So fucking hard to make it to the morning. Blasting songs over my headphones until the sun rises, keeping the meds locked up and the blades hidden. Sometimes I just pace about in the hall, hoping not to wake anyone. I ponder it over and over. If I want this to end, I know I have to end everything all at once. It'll never go away if I don't. I reason with myself that it'll only get worse, like it always does. And I don't want to stick around long enough to see what worse looks like.

I get to writing the notes like I've done so many times before. And then I open the box. I keep my notes. Every one I've ever written. My sister tried to bin them once. Told me that it's what's keeping me sick. That and my dirty room. Those are the causes of my misery. She also tried to sell me a few of her old crystals under the guise that they would 'cure my depression' too so I'm not entirely sure how credible her advice is.

I could never get rid of the box. It means something. It's kept me alive. In there, is every birthday card. Every badge, every note, every plea with the universe, every memory starting from the day I turned 13. Its both a blessing and a curse. But I am a keeper. I keep things. I have folders filled with screenshots of messages my friends have sent me. Some current, some from people in my past. It's a reminder.

You mattered to someone once. Maybe one day, you can matter again. I keep train tickets and notes and all these little unnecessary things. Its a reminder. The sky looked pretty that day. You got a really fuckin good milkshake from the McDonald's at that train station. Your teacher wrote a note home to talk about how amazing she thought you were that one time when you were like, nine. All these things. Just unnecessary little things that I cling to. It's hope.

My hope comes in the form of collected rocks and faded sea glass. Bottle caps and scraps of paper filled with doodles and smiley faces. It comes in the form of pink and green scribbles, courtesy of the artistic talent belonging to my younger siblings, paintings of how it was. Pictures of what it will be. My hope comes in the form of little items that would often be discarded. And I cling to them so desperately. 

It's another one of those nights. The ones where my medication makes everything so much harder. Where all I crave is the end. If I close my eyes I can almost see it. A endless void filled with serenity and dotted with stars, the perfect kind of silence swallowing me whole as I dispute from the body I inhabit. Oh to be free. But then I remember my friend. My siblings. 

Oh what I would give to be able to slip peacefully in my sleep without causing them pain. What I'd give to let go, to end this fight I have no chance of winning. But I won't. Not until I'm sure they don't need me anymore. Not until I know they'll be okay. It's hard. All I want is to be gone. How am I supposed to argue with that? It would make my life so much easier. All I'd have to do, would be to end it. But it wouldn't make theirs easier.

And if it hurts them, then I guess my freedom will have to wait.",2,depression

Constantly fixate on my past and current behaviors 

Always ruminate 24/7

Always react extensively to intrusive thoughts 

Anxiously react to everything

Chronically ashamed of everything I do and comparing myself to others

No confidence and telling myself things will go bad

Confused about what all these mean

Feel like to my core I‚Äôm a loser 

Anticipating bad and embarrassing things 

Feel like a slave to my anxiety and that I have no control of anything 

Constantly fall into pits of SI

Don‚Äôt know whether the intrusive thoughts are me or not

Feels morbid and dark in my mind all the time",4,anxiety

"I'm an entrepreneur, and after a couple of years of burnout, my condition has significantly worsened two months ago, and I've been diagnosed with moderate/severe clinical depression.

"and have to start all over, that pain hurts.

just a bit of a rant post. i spent the past five years (18-23) building a life i was so proud to have - found a nice enough place to live, a min wage job that i was happy enough in, with colleagues i liked, and a strong passion and determination to become a full time musician - I was singing and busking, lots of friends and saw/interacted with a dozen or so people every day! financially stable and progressing. after a horrible childhood and almost 20 jobs hopping around (bad luck with workplaces etc) i finally started having some kind of stability, staying at a job for almost a year. going to the gym, taking driving lessons to the point i was ready to pass, performing in venues, smiling!! actual mental recovery and health üí™ 

then stuff happened in december...this will sound crazy but i'm a stranger on the internet so you don't have to believe me - i fell off my bicycle, hit my head, got psychic abilities and started interacting with ghosts (with freaky accuracy), but then I started having unexplained seizure like body spasms - wound up in hospital three times via ambulance...the third, they didn't know what was going on and i ended up in a psychiatric facility for a few months (i should've kept my mouth and my third eye shut lol). so i lost my job and my place. and a bit of my grip on reality / i started talking about vortexes and dimensions. 

fast forward from nov '22 to today...may '23 - i pushed away all the psychic stuff (ignoring it COMPLETELY) i am back living with my parents (a lot of abuse history with them and i fought so hard to leave that, so winding back here now hurts to my core) now witnessing my dad get loud and angry to my mum/ grandmother is so triggering it aches. i witness my mum living a very depressing life too. i'm financially back to zero. living in a small bedroom which is quite dilapidated and rundown, in the middle of nowhere. insects galore which triggers old OCD habits. all of my things piling in storage containers around me and nowhere to put it so i never bothered unpacking. unemployed and will be seeking yet another min wage job. i haven't been outside for almost a month now. i'm basically hiding just watching stupid tv shows and movies, because everything feels so...lost. no friends in this area and the ones i did have last year have all somehow evaporated except for the odd ""hi"" and basic text.

the only thing that ever made me so happy and gave me purpose was music. but i haven't sang or written in months and i think i've given it up. 

i've tried speaking about what i'm experiencing but i end up in tears. so i've just stayed in bed, and for the first time in my life, i've become everything i always feared and worked so hard to stay away from. i think i am in real depression. 

anyway, i'll probably get another job soon within a few months, but with that salary...i can't help but think, i'm probably stuck here unless i find a small houseshare to move to. last time i was lucky, it was a friend's place's garden house after a series of crappy houseshares - but then i had to hit my head and lose all that. 

to what end? i will get a job that pays maybe ¬£1.3k a month, but that's not enough for my own place. eat, shit, sleep, be a cog in the concrete jungle machine. that's what the future looks like. it seems so sad without any of my passion or love left. 

love. even just if i had a sibling or a pet or a close friend. love would make this easier.

because isn't that really why we live? to make memories with people we love. what happens when everything collapses and everyone and everything you loved is gone from under your feet without warning?

"I've been playing Minecraft for a LONG time, since I was around 14 maybe (I'm 22 now, I know, I'm a late bloomer when it comes to video games). I used to stay up for hours and hours playing Minecraft on my Xbox 360. I finally moved to PC within the last couple of years, and don't play it as much as I used to when I did on console. Around October of last year, I had what I would call a time of extreme paranoia. I didn't leave my room unless it was for class, I thought my roommates hated me (and avoided them), I thought that everyone was staring at me and hated being seen outside. Whenever I would play Minecraft, I would be incredibly paranoid to the point where I'd see things peek out from behind the trees, and run from far away (I have no mods installed, and at this point in time no one but me ever got on my PC). I hated playing because I knew that I was the only sentient being in the whole game, or sometimes I would think that I wasn't the only thing playing the game. I avoided it for a long time and couldn't play without my mind racing and overthinking. Now, that's all I can think about when I play Minecraft. I really don't know what to do, because I'm not as paranoid anymore but keep overthinking.",5,paranoia

"(This is extremely long. To have an idea on how long it is, I started typing this at 4:53 pm, and finished at 5:15 pm)

I legitimately have tried my best to at least try to find the bright side to life throughout the 6 months, but holy fuck, it's hard to.  My life has pretty much gotten worse. My family is struggling to find a home as we don't have enough money to stay to where we're living at right now, so we might become homeless. I feel like I genuinely have no one to tell how I truly feel about personal stuff, and life  general. People always say that they're always there if I'm ever feeling a certain way, but whenever I try to text them if I can talk to them, they either haven't seen it for the past couple of days, or they see it, and don't respond. I try to talk to some of my friends in a group we're in, but I always get interrupted in the end, and I feel completely invisible when it comes to me trying to be social in general. I try to talk to my (not so sure anymore) girlfriend, but we barely talk anymore at this point. Yesterday, I called her to try to explain how I feel about stuff, and how I feel like I'm invisible to her, and our friend group, but then she ends up being the one to talk the most, with her saying that me and her should take a break. I don't blame her at all, with her giving some valid reasons, but it gets me sad and kinda fustrated at the fact that I didn't really have the chance to explain how I feel. Things are real awkward now, I get scared to join in any conversation with the group because of what happened yesterday, I get scared that I might cause something within the group, and mess everything up. I feel invisible towards everyone in general, I never really get the chance to speak, as I either get interrupted, or people just kinda trash talk me as a response. I can't even really have an important conversation with my broken family about how I feel with them, because they don't really take me seriously, and they just either brush it off, or yell at me. I feel like I have no one to talk to about how I feel. It's like being trapped in a hole, trying to get dirt to help build yourself back up, but the only way to get the dirt is to dig down. I don't know anymore, I'm only 15 years old. I shouldn't even be thinking about this type of stuff. It's gotten so bad to the point I've been starting to scrape my leg & calves with a knife, and what I find horrifying is that, I don't enjoy it, but yet I do. I know that I'm not supposed to do this to myself but, it's such a relief when I do. I feel so guilty when I do it, but at the same time I don't, I feel like I deserve what I do to myself. Maybe I'm just sounding stupid, or making no sense, maybe typing all of this was just a waste of time, but I'm far into this to stop. I don't know, at this point, I just give up. I tried my best to be happy, but it's impossible. All I ever wished for, was to be happy, and live a happy life, but it seems like that wish isn't gonna come true. I'm sorry if this seems messy, or if it sounds stupid, or if it wastes your time as you finish reading.

"I‚Äôll start off by saying I‚Äôm medicated and have been for several years. Any progress or limitations are directly related to this. My relationship with the voices has changed greatly since the beginning when I tried time and again to eliminate them with meds. That did not happen. 

When that was over I began ascending a long road toward acceptance and then curiosity. At first, I used meds and accepted that the voices were here and that I‚Äôm not compelled to do stupid shit anymore. The therapist said I was managing. Well, it felt like a crap job but if I was managing so be it. Then years flew by and I delved into a few insightful books like Schizophrenia Complex and this led me on a long journey inward where I skimmed the edges of some deep spiritual thinking. 

Now, it‚Äôs not as though the voices are to be banished. Instead, they are there to remind me I have an inner life to attend to. When I‚Äôm at therapy, and being still and silent for some amount of time each day, I become more functional and enjoy my hours more, especially with family/friends. In short, I have to respect what I am to become stable. In this life that is enough.

Last thing, I believe it‚Äôs important for me not to be perfect all the time. When I attempt that it all goes to shit and life just laughs at me saying, ‚Äústop! That‚Äôs not really you!‚Äù As a result, I‚Äôve got some quirks to me, but it‚Äôs better than being involuntarily held once a year. Instead that‚Äôs happened 2x in 20 years.

"I'm so exhausted.

I ruined everything. I was too depressed to communicate properly. I think she hates me. I think they hate me too.
I misrepresented myself. I initiated the breakup. I can't get closure. I was numb at the time, I'm sure as fuck not numb now. I'm to blame, it's my fault. She's hurt and doesn't want to talk. I won't cross her boundary. 

I'm scared she thinks I never cared, or don't care. I don't know how to accept this. It's so unresolved. Probably never will be. I'm breaking down. Sobbing into my pillow, so guilty, so powerless. I was happy not to feel numb anymore, but this sadness, despair, hopelessness, it hurts a lot more than feeling nothing. I want to explain that I did care, I do care, but wow that's selfish.

"Please be patient while reading. 

I have been an introvert since childhood. But I was a happy introvert. I had a good friend circle, I was confident, I was getting straight As and I even had a healthy relationship. 

I had a brutal breakup, family issues, academic failure and covid isolation all in the same year (2020-2021). 

I slipped into depression. It was very bad. I isolated myself and cut people off from my life (everyone). I lost all my self confidence. I didn't utter more than a few words in 2021-2022. 

I came to college in 2022 August. I faced a lot of discomfort interacting with new people, making new friends and I again isolated myself. I rarely talked to anybody. Although after a lot of constructive introspection and self-care I managed to get better and I brought myself out of that depression. I regained the motivation. 

But even now I can't ""talk"" to people. I am confused whether it's in my nature that I don't like ""talking"" or that I have just become worse in expressing my thoughts. My friends go out in groups a lot while I just sit in my room studying or watching something. I can talk for hours if it's business or academic related, I can express my idea clearly and just when the discussion about the project is over, I will stop interacting at all. 

I am worried it's going to cost me potential friendships. Or relationships. I want to talk. But I don't know how. And I have tried talking, I sometimes talk with my best friend (whom I reconnected with just a few months ago) for an hour or two. So is it about me being uncomfortable around new people or something else?

my grandparents died 4 years ago and so did my only aunt, they raised me, they were my support system. then I found out that i was sexually abused as a kid and confronted my abuser to see if he did it for sure, he did. it was the dumbest thing i did because i suffered from a lot of mental health issues after losing 3 people and seeing the man who did that to me for years as a child. i told my mom but she didn‚Äôt believe me. she said ‚Äúif he did that why isn‚Äôt he in jail‚Äù she was just in denial. still is. we‚Äôre not super close.

"I don't understand why everything I do need to be quick. I don't understand why even when I am doing chores or if I'm doing my things before chores I need to be quick. If I don't, I'll get scolded. I don't understand why I'm not allowed to take my time.

 My parents always scolded me ""I'm always the one doing this, that. You never do anything you're always so slow!"" They said without fail every single day. You might think maybe I'm overreacting or if I'm actually the problem because of what they said. I think so too. But this has been going for so long and it actually affected my mental health and my daily life.

I've always felt rushed. I feel like if I don't do anything soon or if I'm even resting not doing anything I'm useless, I'm garbage, human waste, I never ever do anything! For example, when I'm waiting for the bus even if it is a little late I would be nervous as if I've done something wrong and started waiting outside of my house eventhough it's actually still early.(my bus comes to my house) or when my father came to pick me up from school I need to get on the car fast. Even if I'm a little late because I waited for the kid in front of me to get on their car, I'll be scolded. 

I don't like the feeling of being rushed as if I don't do nothing I'm useless. I can't even take my time because I felt like I'm being wastefull. If someone does something for me I feel like a burden. I always feel restless because I think I don't deserve the time to rest. I need to do anything fast. Fast. I guess that was when I started to hate that word. 

Why do we need to be fast in everything to do? Does this mean we have to die fast too? If we can then I would be glad. But that is the only thing god wouldn't gave me. Even if I prayed I guess I would die if I get little older? I've always wanted to take a look of the afterlife. Whatever it is I hate the need to be fast. But I can't rest myself because it has been embedded in my mind that I need to do something fast. The only time stop was when I'm sleeping. Then I wouldn't have had to worry about anything. In that dream, it was a given that we would be so slow. If only I coulde sleep eternally, like aurora except without the true love kiss.

"Is it time to give up?, a thought ive had since age 6. Is it time to give up and jump into the street or similar methods. im too poor to afford quality therapy and all the places ive been too near me have been wildly ineffective in treating my ASD level 2, ADHD, OCD and Medication resistant MPD. Im probably gonna end it soon, im entirely unfixable unless i become rich enough to afford real therapy. My entire life has been a terrible Cycle of emptiness, neglect and loneliness. I grew up in a extremely poverty struck home with a emotionally wrecked and distant single mother. ive
been through everything from intense health issues to emotional issues
and ive decided life isnt worth it anymore, im an unfixable broken toy
and my circumstances are unfixable as well. when your poor and disabled
in california your given an insurance called medical. its horrible and
useless. your a second class citizen to doctors and hospitals. especially mental health. heres my detailed my 4 experiences that made me come to the conclusion of i wanna die soon. 

My first stint of therapy was at Choc Childrens in socal, from ages 5-8 is when i started to become extremely depressed, isolated, lonely and suicidal. the gap between social and intellegence bassed development which was later to be found
out caused by my autism was getting noticable. the reason i wasnt diagnosed till 3 years ago was beacuse i was racially profiled by my GP who said all my issues were because of my i tensive seizures as a kid and that because im black i couldn't have autism ot similar learning disability. i had said i wanted
to commit suicide to a teacher in 2nd grade and i was forcibly made to see a childrens therapy place in my area of South socal. the place was terrible. i was treated like a second class citizen and discrimated for me being poor and a half black mix. i was never treated properly and was passed around by multiple therapist who just played stupid board games with me.i hated it. nobody really cared they just babysat me for a paycheck. this is around the age when i began to develop extreme nihilistic ideas from reading books and watching internet content. Nihilism explained my existence it gave it reason, my entire life is suffering. I have nothing and will always be poor. in my early life i had a shit ton of health issues like seizures and breathing issues. this created an even larger social and Self suffering divide. i was divided and pitied socially like a kicked dog. I was never able to be ""friends"" everyone thought id give them seizures since i had experiance one in 3rd grade in class due to my epilepsy and extreme stress which come to find out are autism related. My life hasnt improved at all since i was younger and has continued to snowball so 8 year old me turned out to be correct. 

Elementary public School Psychologist - from ages 9-12 i kept myself closed off from others. My inability to make friends continued and i became even more depressed and nihilistic. spending hours reading philosophy books trying to figure out why im forced to suffer this terrible existence. which eventually led to buddhist ideas and to this day i've never found an answer on why my life sucks and i was cursed to suffer. in California schools your required to do mental health checks yearly and i answered truthfully on mine was forced to do multiple appointments with the school psychologist. she was terrible, just another worthless shrink that made me fill out paperwork for her and i
was never actually cared for or treated. just fill out this questionnaire and ill give you SSRIS that are complete BS and dont work for you at all. my social life became even harder the older i got. i drifted so far away from my age group in terms of interests and social skills i became an outcast. The ""weird fat kid"". Ive continued to worsen as i age in terms of physical and mental health. 

western youth services - at age 13 i was forced to go to a place called
WYS after my first major suicide attempt. i was referred there since
they were the closest place to me that took medical, boy was that terrible. they somehow where even worse then my previous two experiences combined. Terrible unresponsive psychologists, terrible therapists and they actively emotionally abused me. they gave me more ineffective drugs and treated me like a nuisance rather than a patient. most psychologists just gave me SSRI'S and told me to fuck off. nobody cared
for me, my family didnt and neither did the shitty workers. my depression became even worse and i began to develop violent thoughs of revenge and bitterness began to develop in me. mI wanted to kill my family for neglecting me, i wanted to kill my bullies for making fun of me and i wanted to kill my psychiatrists for not listening to me. i became even more nihilistic and had began to Self harm more extremely 

After that stint i was out of therapy for 2 years, i had only one attempt and my nihilism worsened. I was socially ridiculed more than ever now as i reached junior high. this when i noticed major declines and more bullying. Between stint 3 and 4 in late 2021  after a i had a hard head injury i was seen by a neuropsychologist that diagnosed me with autism,ADHD, OCD, and MDP and advised me to see a Therapist and psychiatrist. she was incredibly surprised i wasnt diagnosed with autism before. she said after talking with me for 10 minutes she knew. She was astounded nobody noticed till now. Its kinda hilarious guess racial discrimination and all that really does exist when it comes to autism in black men. Previously between 3 and 4 and the autism diagnosis i wanted to re enter therapy and was subsequently put on a 2 year waitlist between late 2019 and early 2022. In mid 2022 i began my 4th stint back at choc

choc stint 2- from age 14-16 i i was placed on a two year wait list to receive treatment after my 3rd suicide attempt in 2019. 2 years passed then COVID hit then it got extended to another couple months even though i had another attempt in the mean time. A TOTAL OF ALMOST 3 YEARS TO RECEIVE GARBAGE TREATMENT. i was treated like trash by choc again. i started back with them in mid 2022 and its been terrible. the therapist was a step up and my best to date but the Psychiatrist was terrible. Dr ngyuen fucking sucks, how can you take pride in your self as a dr when you actively miss appointments and flake on patients a bunch. Hes no showed us 8 FUCKING DIFFERENT TIMES. since ofc hes a telehealth only dr, but thats not all oh nooo he was fucking garbage at treating anything. he gave me 10 different SSRI/SNRI/SDRI combinations all to do fucking nothing since im medicine resistant and we told him that from the start. hes also completely worthless in terms of treating ADHD as its one of my biggest struggles and is actively ruining my life. his treatment plan is the exact opppsoite of what your supposed to do for ADHD. hes insistent on treating my depression first which basically means ""heres a new SSRI go away"" each session. hes also shown some very racist and discriminatory actions towards me. im refused adderall because i have an ""addiction risk:"" due to my socioeconomic status and my race. This recent stint has solidified in my mind that my only relief is death. i have no other option. this place was my last one that my insurance covered.

I bet nobody read all of this, but i just wanted to rant today. My psychiatrist flaked on our appointment today and i needed to get this out. i have no hope for my life and actively want to end it soon. lk the whole ""its so over meme"" but my life feels like it literally is unless i
win the lottery. Im too poor to afford anyway out of my living hell and
i cant work.i have no options. i have no other therapy options or ways to fix my mental or health disabilities. I just need to end it now",1,autism

"Hi everyone --

I'm wondering if anyone else here suffers from Hyperstimulation Anxiety?

I've always been a somewhat anxious individual since I was a teenager (due to pretty low self esteem/social awkwardness).

When I turned 21 (I'm 40 now!!) after several stressful days and poor sleep my nervous system became hypersensitive to everything and has never calmed down.

It basically boils down to symptoms of nervous system and sensory hypersensitivity. It's just perpetual discomfort on a daily basis. I already exercise, eat as healthy as I can, do regular deep breathing, etc. 

I try my best to avoid any excess stress but because of how overreactive my nervous system is, any miniscule stress ( like temp changes for instance ) acts like a major stressor.

I've been started on Zoloft 50mg (I've tried Paxil, Effexor, and Celexa in the past) so I'm hoping maybe it will help.

To those that have experienced this, was there any ways to finally calm and insanely sensitive nervous system?

Thanks!",4,anxiety

"There is nothing worse for a person with paranoia than for all of their paranoid fears to be confirmed true, right?

I was always afraid of being hacked and found solid evidence (APK files and a spyware app) on my phone when my ex hacked me.

I was always afraid of having my mental health crisis spread around and it happened.

I was always afraid of being gangstalked and doxxed and it came true.

Sometimes I wonder if it was a self fulfilling prophecy? Like, I was so afraid of it happening I somehow manifested it?

I was afraid of my cat dying and he died last week.

Every one of my worst fears came true this year and keep coming true. It feels like I'm in a nonstop nightmare.

At least before, I could rationalize my way out of my paranoia, but having all of my paranoid fears come true honestly has broken my sanity. I barely can keep it together. The anxiety is overwhelming and unreal. I am terrified of getting a new job outside of gig work because I'm afraid it'll all happen again. This paranoia and feeling of constantly questioning my sanity because of this makes it so hard to be alive or even want to. It's psychological torture.

Being able to explain my symptoms was a good coping mechanism for me because I could think about it and challenge myself to explain something abstract, but now it feels like it's being taken away from me. I guess luckily I've been doing a decent bit better the past few days with an increase in my meds, but it still sucks that it feels like my understanding of things is being drained.",6,schizophrenia

"hi everyone this is my first reddit post so please be nice.

i‚Äôve always been kind of a morose person, but lately, it has gotten worse and worse. i‚Äôm in college now, and i‚Äôm struggling to find a summer job or internship, and because i have very few friends, the days drag on and i feel useless and empty. on top of that, my mom is sick right now which is also stressing me out, and my dad is not helping out much and is not good emotional support for any of us. 
i think the stress from that, the thoughts that nobody likes me or wants to hang out with me from my hometown (i didn‚Äôt make many friends in high school), and the monotony of my days is making me very anxious and sort of depressed (not enjoying much of anything, sleep problems, random crying, etc).

i think an important thing to note is that i am a Christian but i‚Äôm kind of struggling with that too (stuff i don‚Äôt quite agree with in the Bible (i know i can‚Äôt pick and choose so you can see how that might be a problem), and also the feeling that i am just talking into a void). so praying about it (for me right now) feels very disingenuous (but i am not asking for any cynical athiest takes as this will probably make me more anxious).
i can‚Äôt get a therapist because my parents control that and they already don‚Äôt think it will be useful.

if anyone would care to read, advice (Christian and Secular) would be appreciated, just something to lift my spirits and keep me moving forward. thank you.

edit: an important thing to add too is that in the beliefs i‚Äôve been taught, thoughts and declarations are important because they can come true. so there‚Äôs also the feeling of hopelessness and then an added layer of hopelessness because you feel hopeless (if that makes sense).",2,depression

No one is raising the appropriate minimum wage. If it's us ordinary people who have to mobilize and fight back, well, in Canada and USA, both countries are far too large and brainwashed to achieve the things that France has.

"So first off; I'm Self-Diagnosed Autistic, and actually diagnosed ADHD.  
I work at a local supermarket chain (I won't say the name of the company or what state I live in) and it prides itself on being an equal opportunity employer; which is certainly the case - been here for 9+ years and I've seen a wide variety of people come, go, move up or just happily stay in one position (I'm the last one) I'm just a bagger - lowest rung on the ladder; although I am treated as a sort of unofficial manager of the parking lot since I've been here so long, I'm reliable, and I'm firm enough and have decent enough social skills to train and keep an eye on the teenagers outside. But I have no real true authority - nor do I want it.  
We have a variety of people with different conditions; ADHD, Downs Syndrom, having a prosthetic leg, autistic, and people of varying ages from 14 year olds to people in there 60's-70's.  


So, I have one particular coworker who's been here for about 5-ish years. He's Autistic and has depression. He's also approximately my age; I'm 32, he's 31. I used to consider him a friend - we never hung outside work. But we have talked often, we share similar interests, and we were both art students at different points in our lives, ect. I honestly get how he thinks for the most part, and I see a lot of myself in him - athough; a younger version of myself. The way he thinks reminds me A LOT of myself when I was in my early to mid 20's in all the wrong ways. Claiming and thinking he's a noble white knight when he's really a hypocrite. Being very socially awkward. Over-correcting other people's behavior (he used to be a talle-tale early on)  
And the most frustrating of all to me; using his Autism diagnosis as a sort of shield when he does something wrong. He constantly late to work. He'll sneak off and hide out on his phone for long periods. He'd take advantage of other people's kindness or oversights. When he's confronted when he does something wrong; first thing out of his mouth is excuses. When he DOES apologize; it's half-hearted because he'll often go right around and do it again. Hell, a few months ago he tried hitting on another coworker who was 19 at the time. (it was a few weeks away from his 31'st birthday at the time) She told me how creeped out she was by that.  


The other frustrating element is that managment seems totally unwilling to do SOMETHING about his behavior. They just don't even bother reprimanding him at all. The Assistant Managers might say something about him being really late, but actual managment won't really do ANYTHING.  
I've tried talking to several of the managers for my department about being firm with him if they actually want him to actually do his job. But many of them behave that because he's Autistic he's TOTALLY incapable of his behavior being corrected. One HEAVILY IMPLIED that he thought he was too dumb to learn. When I KNOW DAMNED WELL that it DOES work because we had a manager 3 years ago who DID do something about his behavior and actually punished him by taking away his phone except when he went on break, and he had to stay in the checkout department; he couldn't work outside in the parking lot for several months. And it WORKED! His performance and attitude did improve back to a respectable level. He was no longer late, he didn't slack off or take the easy way out. And he stayed like this for more almost 2 years.  
But last year his performance and behavior was slipping right back to where he was right before he was at his worst.  
Honestly, I think if this company wasn't so forgiving, he would have been fired A LOOOOONG time ago. And I've even told him that since he told me he's going to be moving out of state later this year, and was going to be forced to live on his own.  


I've vented to other friends of mine; many of them being Neurodivergent in various ways. ADHD, Autism, ect. And they all side with me that my coworker is a spoiled brat in a grown man's body.  
But still, I wonder if I'm just being too harsh and/or that my standards are just too high. That I should just let it go - but it's difficult to do so when I've been working very closely with him for 5+ years. I DID consider him a friend for most of that time, but I had to put my foot down when he made more fake promises that he would do better. To me; it was a breach of trust and faith that he'd just take advantage of me many, MANY TIMES when I've been kind, understanding, forgiving despite me being firm with him when he's fucked up.  


Still, I feel like I'm being a total asshole because I can't/won't let it go. Sometimes I think maybe I'm just not understanding enough. That perhaps I should lighten up. That perhaps that me being only self-diagnosed autistic makes my judgement of his crappy behavior invalid. I don't think I have clinical depression, so maybe I'm just just not understanding him there.

"I'm going to start with the fact that I am honestly not sure if I have depression or BPD or not, but I think so. It would me a high functioning form. Anyways...

Whenever I am doing good, whenever I finally change myself a little, it always fucking gets me in the end. People, places, whatever else.

I can't keep doing this. My entire world comes crashing down in the end. How the hell is that even possible?

I hate that my life seems cursed. *Like, truly cursed.* People get driven away even though I'm kind, listening, asking questions, and try to laugh a lot. Even those who even try to be available a little bit seem to change over the course of 5-7 months. They act like we're fine, but I can tell they're disinterested. They weren't always.

I don't know what I'm doing with myself, I cant live with myself while everyone seem so fake. So very sarcastic. Micro-bullying, I call it.

I don't know how to deal with anything anymore. Usually only older people are nice to me. Hell, even people only a couple years older.

But I can't help being who I am, and in a school with people the same age as (or mainly younger than) myself, it's quite difficult.

I don't feel emotions less and less, or wanted, or needed. I don't feel anything but this massive uphill journey with no one but myself to look to when I need help. Imaging what it would be like to be your only support - I feel this way. Alone in a cold, unforgiving, stale world.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm not ugly, I don't think. I'm not smelly, I haven't even gone through puberty. I'm not rude, ever. I have a lot of cool talents and interests and widely accepted values, I think.

I've been here before. I thought I could get out of it. The very few people left in this school who are older than me are going away next year.

I am not at the end yet not at all. I still feel some emotions. Some happiness. I can still kind of block all of the pain, I've gotten good at that. But I'm quite close, and I don't know what it will be that pushes me off.

Why am I this way?

"for over 10 years i have gotten increasingly more paranoid. it has ALWAYS been about being kidnapped (from the street/my home/anywhere) or being attacked in my own home/bedroom. i have no ptsd or trauma related to these topics. my trauma is mostly s*a* related + the paranoia started years PRIOR to any of those. 

i had a psychotic break in summer 2020 and since then, i have been trying to regularly take an antipsychotic. the dr decided it was stress-induced psychosis but put on my chart MDD w psychotic features.

in summer 2021, i experienced more psychosis. i was in rehab when it began. it was NOT drug induced (ruled out as i was over 1 month clean at induction). i couldn‚Äôt eat, drink, take meds, etc. it ended with what my team classified as a possible hypomanic episode. and then i fell into a depressive episode for 3 months. that ended with another possible hypomanic episode.

now we are here. in nov 2021 i went back to shelter (a shelter hotel tho) because of abuse. i was experiencing low-moderate levels of paranoia around kidnapping/attacks. i have my own room + a key card that only staff also have + my door has a deadbolt. my room should feel safe. but as of mid December 2021-NOW (feb 8 2022) i am at the point where i am going 3-5 days with no sleep, only able to sleep during the morning hours (7AM-2PM) to feel safe, being convinced people are waiting for me to fall asleep so they can attack, checking all spaces people could hide/fit, calling out to the people ‚Äúin my room‚Äù, running out crying because they know i‚Äôm on to them, having shelter staff come check my room multiple times a night even though i haven‚Äôt slept/left/no one has entered for hours, etc. 

it‚Äôs getting out of control. and then this week my psych casually stated that it was probably all just ptsd related ???? i feel very dismissed. i‚Äôm barely functioning and that‚Äôs it? i can barely leave my hotel room but i also spend basically 24/7 trying to figure iout if someone is there too. 

i‚Äôve been hallucinating & dissociating too. it‚Äôs terrifying. 

is there ANYTHING i can do to help/???",5,paranoia

"Was standing for about 10 minutes today and then my vision faded until I couldn't see anything. My chest felt tired and out of breath, I felt forced to sit down before I pass out. My hearing also felt like it was fading, like something was blocking my ears but there was nothing. 

About a minute after sitting, I regained vision but still felt weak for some reason.. Honestly don't think I have much time left if I can barely stand in one spot for 10 minutes... I feel so pathetic.

Because of this, I also feel the need to do something I wanted to do but earlier.. Something like visiting a different state/ country to see and do macrophotography of some exotic insects. Maybe a little film or something. I also wanted to do some studies. I was saving up for a house but I don't know anymore...

"My family doesn't try to get me to visit or go out anymore. I haven't had a friend in about 5 years now, with the exception of maybe my boyfriends friends, who probably would have nothing to do with me if I wasn't dating my partner. Even my partner is giving up on trying to get me to go out. I just need a push, I know its inconvenient for other people to have to push me, but its the only way I go out. I am so overwhelmed every minute of my days that thinking about doing something is just too much and freaks me out. It has to be at least somewhat planned, like a couple hours ahead minimum. Whenever my boyfriend goes out with friends, they just text him wyd and then 20 mins later they're out doing stuff. I cannot do that.

I feel so empty. I feel like I literally only exist to make money for the business I work for.

 No one would care if I died. It amazes me how there are some people whose passing would affect an entire community like a tsunami, yet I feel my passing would not even make a tiny splash, a drop, even. Some people would be sad, but they would not grieve. There would be no one to grieve, as no one really knows who I am. My gravestone would never be adorned in flowers. The grass would grow tall, as no foot traffic would pass over, and yet again, I would be invisible. 

My partner would have no one to talk about me with when I am gone. He is the only one. People would try and sympathize, maybe mention softly how shy I was, or how I had a hound dog, but they would never be able to talk about ME.

When my parents pass, I will have no one to go to and grieve. I will be alone in my sorrow and emptiness as the last people I felt truly connected to leave, and I will live with the guilt on my shoulders from not talking enough, not visiting enough.

I am convinced that if my body and mind were not so used up by the corporate job and the capitalist world, maybe then I could make connections. Be someone. But for now, ill let myself continue to erode until everyone leaves. I have no energy left after the day anyways.

I feel obliged to add the positives before I end my post. I at least have an extremely dedicated, loving, supportive partner. I think the love we have is truly one in a million and he does know me inside and out. I think people could go through hundreds of lifetimes before experiencing the kind of love we have. He is why I am alive, though I don't tell him that. I pretend to be strong and I pretend well. When I cry, its just because of a bad day at work, or stress is what I tell him. It doesn't make a difference, as long as I have him. I am financially okay. I wish I was doing better, because I know without help I wouldn't even be able to afford my own food, but I'm stable right now.

"Hello and please, if I'm breaking any rules (I've read and reviewed them) please flag this post or let me know in the comments and I'll delete it. 

I don't know where else to turn, what else to do, and most importantly I don't know how I can be a support to my sister. 
She (35F) was recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, but she previously had a schizophrenia and BPD diagnosis. She's back on her medications (with an 8 year hiatus...my family and I hadn't seen or heard from her for nearly 5 years) but her medications don't seem to be helping. 
She believes people are playing mind games with her. 
She believes people are sending her messages through her Pinterest news feed.
She believes the people she was in partial hospitalization with are really her highschool friends in disguise.

I want to be here for her. I want to support her. I'm at a loss of what to say or how to comfort her. 
I guess my question is... What can I say? How might she feel comforted? Is there anything I can be doing other than being a shoulder, an ear, a compassionate heart? 
Again, I'm sorry if this violates any rules or if my asking for advice is hurtful, harmful or upsets anyone. I just want to be able to love my sister and make sure I'm doing everything possible to make her life a little easier.

"The past few weeks have been emotionally intense and draining.  I've had more than one major moment of derealization from family members surprising me with very negative attacks.  There was a death in the family.  I officiated the funeral.  I've had to take lots of time off work for these things and for migraines and etc.  

I assist at church in a big way and am training for the clergy.  Today I woke up with my head swimming and a general sense of utter exhaustion.  It's a church day of course, but I decided it would be best for me to take the day off, because of dizzy head and not having enough me-time, which is SO essential.  (I have something every night after work this week except for next Friday).  Sorry, all this detail feels relevant for some reason.

I texted the pastor this morning to let him know I didn't feel safe driving and making sure he was okay to handle the service alone.  There was no response so I called him and I honestly couldn't tell if he was upset or not.  Something about it felt dismissive, but I'm sure that's my guilt talking.  I always feel guilty when I call in sick for something.  Impostor syndrome for sure.  Maybe I'm overreacting and being selfish and maybe I'm not THAT sick.  And then I go into defensive mode and start saying things to myself as if I was on trial, even though the only response was a nonchalant ""Okay, hope you feel better.""  Now I anticipate that, rather than spending some quiet time recovering from the last two weeks, I'm going to feel uneasy and guilty that maybe I'm a selfish jerk for not trying, or something.

"You know it's not somthing people really think about much but everyone has their own story some people have happy stories and some people have sad stories  or painful ones. I happen to have a painful and sad story lucky me am I right lol 
Honestly I feel like my life is a bad Shakespeare script  written just to be cruel instead of to teach a lesson or some interspection on life itself. 
My starts just like a lot of people born to two parents that weren't at all compatible, nore where they ready to have a kid how do I know that you ask? Simple my parents fought a lot when I was a baby and kid right up until I was about 5 at some point my father hit my mother or so she claims I don't know the facts and they divorced soon after which you know fair enough no one should stay together if that's the relationship no I have no problem with that. 
What I have a problem with is that instead of ether of them taking me and raising me they both just dumped me with my grandparents and said have fun. Mind you my mother would go on to steal my childsupport as long as it was coming in I never saw a dime and funny how that's the less fucked up part the real fucked up part is the fact she left me with my grandparents.
Which your probably thinking whats so bad about that? Well what's wrong with that is she knew my grandmother was an abusive fucking monster it's why she got amansipated at 16 at left the house.
Like bitch jumped ship herself but left her 5 year old son to fend for himself. 
So predictably as anyone could guess the abuse started after that. But twist I didn't start in the way you might imagine. At first it just started with trying to make me into the perfect little child oh all the adults would love me üíå they would all say what a well behaved kid oh he's so smart this that and the other. Little did they know I was so damn perfect because if I wasn't I should get my ass beat screamed at and anything else you could imagine I was just my grandmothers little living trophy.
I was dragged all around to adult party's with nothing to do but sit around and be presentable I could talk with adults because it was an adult conversation I couldn't watch TV because it was rude to do that as someone's place or around guests I couldn't play games because that was disrespectful to others mind you I was a kid not a teen a kid. 
Oh also did I forget to mention she constantly didn'tni allow me to have friends I was totally isolated from  kids my own age so that as I grew older I had no idea how to interact with kids my own age for the longest time until I was in high school in fact and even then I needed her seal of approval. But i am getting ahead of myself here.
So my childhood keeps going on and I get sent to one of the worst school in the whole of the United States its has been in the national news multiple times for gang fights. As you might imagine awkward nerdy kid with no social skills makes for an easy target for kids to try and bully what you might not have expected was that nerdy kid was taught to fight by his grandfather to protect myself and encourged to do so infact. So I ended up getting in a lot of fights and I do mean a lot. Now what you might not have expected even more then that though was that fact that my evil bitch grandmother would in fact not take my side for defending myself and would in fact both blame me and punish me for doing so.
So needless to say I grew to resent and hate her for both the physical abuse when she hit me the verbal abuse when she called me things like demon child and the mental abuse of telling me one thing but when I actully did it getting punished for it. And when she wasn't beating me or yelling at me what she would do was lock me in my room no books no TV no games no cards nothing just empty room. And to be fair when school was in, it was fine but when it was off on break. Man did it fucking suck I would just go days or weeks without human interactions except for them which as you might imagine a kid doesn't want to interact with his abuser very much so I just didn't interact with anyone except sometimes my grandfather when he wasn't to tired from work. 
And that went on for years until I was in highschool and then suddenly my grandmother this evil woman I hated suddenly got and man let me tell you what a complicated set of emotions that was because I might of hated this woman for all the abuse but at least she raised me which was just a tad more then I could say about my own parents. So I ended up taking time off my senor year of highschool taking care of her just barely being in school enough to graduate. Great am I right? Finally out of that hell hole? Nope because now comes the real mental anguish. My grandfather who never asked me for most anything asked me to take care of my grandmother so that we could save money so she could get treatments and he could go to work. 
As you might imagine I wasn't exactly happy about that arrangement but I agreed to it because he's one of the few people who treated me like I mattered in my family. So I waste a few years of my life taking care of her she gets better at time and then suddenly takes a turn for the worse and I experience all the horrors cancer and cancer treatment do to a person from the throwing up, hair loss  agonizing pain, and anything else you can imagine only to have her die anyways. Now me being the stupid stupid bastard I am manged to get ahold of my mother because I thought she deserved to be their before her mother died worst fucking mistake of my life. Now you might be asking how's that the worst mistake that's simple I had compassion for another person who was hurting at lose because even though my mother and my grandmother couldn't be in the same room without fighting I knew they loved each other. So I make the hospital let her in to see her on her death bed my wishes where honored. she used this as an opportunity to manipulate me into feeling pity for me now fast forward a few years into the future and I invite her to live with me in my grandmother and grandfather's house because he was moving out because it was to painful for him to live here but he didn't want to kick me out so he left me to pay for the house instead. So I figure win win I get my mom to live with me and we can try repairing are relationship and all she has to do is pay real cheap rent and her and my brothers all get a nice house to live in. 

SEE THIS THIS RIGHT HERE ‚¨ÜÔ∏è THIS IS WHERE I FUCKED MYSELF THE HARDEST

So she and my brothers move in the first thing that starts happening is they all start trashing the house they refuse to clean up after themselves they eat my food mind you I have a fridge in my own room so they had to break in and take my stuff knowingly, and she also refuses to correct my younger siblings behavior because she let's them do whatever they want and doesn't want me to do anything about it ether mind you again this is my house. So it gets so bad that I have to kick her out but mind you it's to late they have trashed my house and I now have a roach problem she broke one of the bedroom doors and door handles changed the lock and handle on another one aboned one of my siblings at my house and refuses to come get him and cps won't do shit. But at least she's out mind you while this happens my current gf who was just a friend at the time saw all this happening and felt bad for me and loved me even if I was to stupid to see it at the time. So time goes on with me struggling then I lose my job get super depressed end up in some amount of debt and I want to die. But she doesn't give up on me and she shows me she loves me in a way that even someone as stupid as me can understand. She supports me and gets me back on my feet enough so I can get a job again and all the while I don't notice she's putting herself in debt to help me. So finally realizing she loves me clearly and doesn't just want somthing from me I asked her out we start dating and I ask her to live in my house ya it still has problems but I say we can try to mange it together we can't because she has put herself in debt trying to help me and so we just try working on getting are stuff together but stuff keeps going wrong. For starters as soon as she moves in the well water pump brakes so we have to fix that then after this on my way to work a guy T-bones me totals my car I use a decent portion of the money to try catching back up on some of the house payments I missed and I hold on to the rest to try to get us through stuff because I stupidly think she has a car we can share not realizing what a burden I am putting on her. Because now we have to make are schedules always work for each other. So I have now placed this girl multiple times under distress because she loves me worthless ass. Mind you she is putting up with roaches we can't seem to get rid of no matter how hard I try or how clean we keep the house. And now she's left to her mother's house rightfully so because she can't take living here anymore I was forced to buy a car with no money saved for one with credit that hasn't recovered yet so that I can keep working so I can try to keep my house feed myself and not be homeless all while trying to deal with the houses problems and trying to not lose my gf because I have made her life harder just by loving me. So now I have negative 147$ in my bank 5$ on my credit card left a 600$ payment for my car coming up no money for food no family to turn to crippling anxiety crippling depression and an intense desire to kill myself all while knowing I won't kill myself. I don't have an idea of how to evan start helping myself and if I am honest with myself I know I can do nothing for myself here I just have to be forced to watch as the little bit of life I have tryed to carve out for myself crumbles like ash in my mouth leaving nothing but a bitter taste in my mouth.

This is my life story or at least a large part of it I suppose. I don't know why I wrote this I don't know if anyone will care probably not. Not many have before. Honestly this just might be my last dying gasps for help but I am not even sure I want help as much as I just want all my hurt to go away to be able to be loved and love someone else without so much going wrong. To be able just just live......... but I probably won't get even that wish. Life real is just a sick cruel joke.

I don't think I'll be able to properly make friends. Idk people just seem to build a lot of relationships easy but I can't. And if I do I can't break them because of my fear of what they might do.

"TL;DR: Always tired. Don't enjoy things. Want to sleep forever but also feel waking up makes sleep feel special. Just wished I didn't chicken out on my suicide attempts.

I'm always just so damn tired, life just feels like I'm surviving everyday and not truly living. I can't even think back to the last time I felt like I was truly living life. 

I haven't been enjoying any of my hobbies or felt connections in my social life. All of it just feels like nothing to me. No real good feelings or bad are associated with it. I can't even think much on events after they happen, it's just like ""This thing is done now, time to forget the emotions that should be attached to that moment.""

Thus my title, I want to sleep forever. Sleeping is a void where I simply am not conscious. It is concerning that I want this so bad, some of my best moments are when I'm under the influence of something that lessens my consciousness and thus I feel better but sleeping is the ultimate way to get there because well I'm not conscious then. That peaceful moment of nothingness is something I deeply crave and that is concerning, death scares because eternity of nothingness is terrifying if that's what it'll be but the brief moments in sleep are just comforting. I both want that forever but I also feel what makes it special is the fact I wake up and have to suffer being awake and then be rewarded with sleep.

It's sad I know but sure I guess that's why I'm writing this here. Just yeah would be a hell of a lot easier if I didn't chicken out on the suicide attempts I made in the past that's for sure anyway haha.",2,depression

I get regular episodes where I just can't leave my bed but my biggest problem is how lonely I get. Even when there's people around me I feel a bit disconnected and when they're gone it really sets in.

I know that even having someone around all the time won't fix it, it's just part of the bad hamd I've been delt. No one can be around all the time and it's unfair to put that on someone, everyone has their own life and they can't just give it up just to make sure you're ok.

"My mental health problems started 4 years ago when I woke up in the middle of the night with my first massive panic attack. That night something happened in my brain and I'm still not well to this day. My main symptoms are - occasional panic attacks at night, random anxiety and derealization (the worst), I haven't been happy for years and everything is kind of ""dark"", I often have nightmares, and I feel like I'm dead inside. But I have no reason to feel this way, my life is fine.  
I've tried almost everything - vitamins and supplements (vit B, D, C, magnesium, omega3, green juices, St. John's wort, rhodiola, ashwaganda, maca, creatine, tianeptine, Lthryptophan...), yoga, meditation, relaxation, books, positive thinking, gratitude, walks, nature, fasting, cold showers... I also exercise 4-5 times a week, sleep 8 hours every day, eat healthy, I do not drink alcohol and go to therapy. I recently tried antidepressants but had a bad reaction.  
I think I've already tried almost everything, but there are probably people here who have more experience and know more than I do. I can function, but I feel like shit, every single day.

Then I hit rehab and wanted to and got clean and have 7 months plus now! The first 6 months were relatively easy. But the past two months I've been having the same recurring meltdown or psychosis for an hour or even day. 

I'm just really frustrated. I moved back in with my parents, older brother lives here, they all support me though I believe my brother enjoys making fun of the failures in my life. 

For example two days ago I had a good day, woke up at 8 am, showered. Worked 5 hours. Around 8 pm at the house all the sudden something took over me ... I got very anxious and fearful and was having delusional thoughts my brother was in the CIA and my parents only kept me around here to make fun of the loser I have become (yes I am self demeaning at times). 

My dad asks what's wrong and I just say something is not right. Then my half drunk mom comes in, mind you I'm in my 30s and she's 60s and goes ""is this because you don't have a girlfriend"" which I laugh at now, but it didn't feel natural and almost like she wants to gaslight me and make it worse. I'm having a panic attack or delusion and she brings up the negative aspects of my life unrelated.... Well I think.

Anyway. I wanted to post and get some feedback because it happened again tonight not as severe. Nothing like the week long psychosis I would have binging on meth with no food or liquids thinking there were cameras everywhere watching me for the world to watch etc......

But damn. 7 months clean and I guess it's brain damage? Can anyone relate after getting clean from major meth use and the mental and psychological side effects. Nothing is scarier than thinking reality is fake or that I'm being streamed live in hidden cameras for the world to see a loser that destroyed his mind and mental health with METH.

"I started complete life changes after 2 years of chronic stress and anxiety. Symptoms include 24/7 horrible full head/brain fog feeling like pressure without the headache or pain(main and worst symptom), unrested sleep, and involuntary head twitching that started in December 2022. Stayed in my house pretty much for 2 1/2 years with most symptoms.

Everything was better initially when I started in January 2023. Better mood, more energy, sleeping better, good dreams, just all that good stuff. Early on I did get sad, regretful when I started going out again and realizing how life kept going on while I shut myself in. This passed quickly as I continued my recovery. Now about 4 1/2 months in I am getting hit with extreme low mood, sadness, dread, loss of interest, and feeling as if I haven't slept at all despite getting 7 to 8 hours upon waking. Depression wasn't even a issue before this at all.

Is this normal? What could be happening now? Is the brain trying to balance hormones? Part of it restructuring itself? I'm at a loss and a bit scared.",2,depression

"I've had this lingering feeling in the back of my mind that I'm like.. an operative or something? There's been a lot of odd things through my life. Periods I don't remember and my mom said there were, at certain points, groups of people or sometimes individuals that would show up only when I was with her and never when she was alone. I've had people come into my life every other time I've come close to figuring this out that are a little *too* perfect to the situation I'm experiencing. Similar enough to me that they calm me down and throw me off. People that have given me psychedelics and encouraged me to spill lots of deep memories often deflecting when I asked them the same question. Sometimes those were the same people. I've been convinced at times that romantic partners of mine that just had randomly moved to the city were intended to keep tabs on me and two of them have even admitted it, albeit casually, almost as if to indicate I couldn't stop it if I tried. 


My last phone, I got calls periodically from different numbers but the same area code and I wouldn't answer because why would I? They left me voicemails where a female sounding robotic voice would start reading off numbers and at the end it would say thank you. Eventually I decided the calls needed some basic exploration and I searched the area code. 

Washington D.C. every one of them. 

Next day, you know what happens? My partner persuaded me to get a new phone. I don't know where my old one ended up. 

I don't know. I want answers but I don't know how to get them. I fully expect someone new to dip into my life tomorrow out of nowhere or tonight I might be swept up.

"It started when i accidentally entered a website and I thought it was malicious and i became very anxious for many days and i scanned countless times with antiviruses ,however, it showed that my pc was fine. I ended up searching it on the internet which gave me good information ,but it also made me feel more anxious the more i searched about malware and learning stuff that scared me. I later found out that the website did not contain any malware, but after doing so much research i got worried by the fact that when i was younger, i was not careful with downloading stuff ,and i decided to scan my moms computer for such stuff since she uses it for work and because i might have had downloaded malicious stuff when i was younger there. I scanned, it detected some stuff and that was it. However, due to all the videos i watched and stuff i read, i couldnt help but be paranoid that the computers might still be infected by stuff that could not be detected or by the fact that it might be hacked, despite all of the scans ive done and all the signs that my computer is alright. I have been trying to overcome it, but it has been 2 months now and i cant get it out of my mind and i even get anxious when i go to open the computer.",5,paranoia

"Genuine question. I am at my wits end because I very honestly do not know why people dislike me so much, and I genuinely want to know what the problem is.

Every time I see my therapist I ask him this same exact question and he tells me nothing is wrong with me and I just need to meet new people. I have met plenty of people in my 26 years of life and I am still mostly alone, apart from the LOML, but even he left me for a year during my psychotic episode.

Why were the nurses in the psych hospital so vicious to me? Why do my cousins that I grew up with never text me back but hold it against me if I don‚Äôt reach out to them? Why do my boyfriend‚Äôs friends treat me like I‚Äôm invisible? Why did my only friends during my psychotic episode make fun of me behind my back and right in front of me?

Shakespeare was correct about this statement. Our world revolves on chaos, relies on it even to function. I know everyone reading this and on this sub has experienced chaotic times in their lives as we all have. Our experiences may not be equal but we all understand the pain of this world. Some of us better than others but regardless we understand it. Once you understand the world everything becomes meaningless. Sure you could give meaning to things but for what? Eventually everything will perish and that is the single truth of this universe. The reason everyone clings to life is because of desire. Without desire you‚Äôre a walking shell and at that point what do you do? Do you find something or someone to desire? Do you continue on realising this truth?

We met online so that meant we had distance between us and despite it we spoke most days and messaged a lot.

Everywhere we have been people are out to get him, he accuses me of knowing them to put stuff in his food, in cities I have never even been to before. He makes all the food, he doesn't trust me to cook and then yells I am a baby for not cooking. His mind has descended into more irrational scenarios and it is taking a toll on his overall health. He has asthma and smokes which of course causes reactions like he coughs more, he feels like he can't breath right, his voice goes hoarse and all I get it is me doing it to him. No, it is an asthma attack and this could be dangerous for him. He thinks cigarettes are made ""worse"" these days or a pack must be chosen especially to make him feel worse. He coughs and coughs, complains of lumps in his throat and it is my doing. I get yelled at for being ""sneaky"" and I am laughing at him and plotting. He sees bad in almost everyone and that businesses are flushing money through them to hide criminal activities. He has had over 30 jobs in his life because people were ""attacking him"" or out to get him etc. He is religious and so people are putting spells on him or demons are targeting him which is frightening to hear a person be absolutely convinced. I have anxiety and lockdowns made it worse and I was in a bad place and he helped me so much and I have become too reliant on him. The paranoia seems to have become more intense and the accusations, from me being ""paid by someone"" to have targeted him or he has ranted about a jewel and people I have never heard of. I get verbal abuse and told I am useless and worthless. The end of the road has come. He is never going to get help and he hates doctors. He had his eye test months ago and was told he has cataracts and needs an operation. His parents had them, but he has refused to get it done and says his eyes are getting worse. He thinks he can fix them and ordered stuff, but the only cure is an operation. I can't be with him as his paranoia colours everything in his life and his health is going downhill. His parents are gone and he had a tough upbringing, his dad was cold and distant, his mother was loving to him, but he isn't close to his siblings. All he sees is bad in almost everyone and everything and most is aimed at me and I am made out to be the most devious, horrible, sneaky person ever. I am not and you can't reason with him. Paranoia has now coloured every aspect of this life together and I don't want to be part of it. My anxiety is going up being with him and he mocks it and calls me mental. He has severe mental health issues, his physical health is getting worse and he once was actually talking to his doctor, but now he mistrusts them more.

"(For those checking my post history, I either randomize or conceal gender to avoid identification and bias.  Sometimes it's hard to write genderless.)

Sorry if this doesn't belong on this forum but I really need to get this out there because it's tearing at me.

A few nights ago my wife was 100% convinced that our 5 year old daughter was sexually assaulted by an intruder in the middle of the night.  There was no evidence of an intruder and the idea that there has been an intruder coming in just about every night has persisted for a long time now and I'm making no progress trying to convince my wife that it isn't happening.

Eventually my wife managed to convince me to take our daughter in to the hospital for an examination, but she wouldn't take her in herself -- like some secret part of herself knows she's mentally unwell and is trying to keep it a secret, and knows that the doctors will think she's got issues but *somehow* if **I** take our daughter in they'll take it seriously.

They did a urine test and a superficial examination and said they found no evidence of abuse or drugging.  They advised me not to go for the more invasive examination, feeling it would be an *actual* trauma to my daughter just to be *extra* sure that trauma hadn't occurred, so I didn't go for it.

The doctor's word and the lab results didn't change my wife's mind.  The assault 100% happened and they were just careful to use a drug that hospitals don't test for and careful not to do any damage.  Just like they can avoid all the cameras (or edit footage) and get in and out without leaving any sign.

After that I frequently started having intrusive thoughts about stupid things like forgetting my memory or existential thoughts. Also fears on having mental illnesses this went on 24/7. Sometimes I could eat sometimes I can‚Äôt. But the negative thoughts replayed in my head all day. But life felt weird after the anxiety attack like I was in a different dimension and the vibes of the days changed. I‚Äôm also getting random memory pop-ups, and random vibes or sensations. (I have a post about the sensations) like my environment feels weird or has an unfamiliar sensation. And it feels like it isn‚Äôt my life. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs depersonalization or derealization because sometimes I get it and it feels worst. I feel like something bad is going to happen or  I‚Äôm going to die. And sometimes I can‚Äôt remember things or write things well or write sentences well. The worry and weird feeling has been going on for 5 weeks. Honestly sometimes it goes away or gets better but comes back worst. I‚Äôve already talked to a therapist and she says it‚Äôs just anxiety, but it hasn‚Äôt gotten better. I honestly feel like giving up at this point because life feels so weird like I‚Äôm floating or stuck in a box. It doesn‚Äôt even feel like life. And I can‚Äôt tell if im dissociating or not sometimes and that worries me",4,anxiety

"TW FOR self harm  / suicide

I've been doing well for like 6 months and now I'm not

I completely relapsed on self harm on Friday 

I feel bad because I told a friend and they made me let them clean it 

They were great I just feel bad that they care 

I feel bad if someone gives me sympathy for my emotions- I feel so fucking guilty I feel like no one should be around me but if I stop talking to people they will lose the positive person past self from like a week ago 

I feel like I am a bad person rn and I don't have a good reason but that I let someone care about me because my mental health is getting worse again

I am depressed again but now I keep getting a thought that says ""I'm gonna kill myself"" whenever I think about mysf or past actions even if they weren't bad

I see my cat and I wanna cry cuz I didn't cuddle enough with her this morning then I think about killing myself and then I remember my cat would permanently lose me and I feel sad and like a bad person

This constant thought to KMS is new idk what to do when it happens it usually goes like this

*I think about myself or think about life*
""I'll just KMS"" or now ""I will kill myself"" or something along those lies then
""Uuhhh no I don't wanna do that""
""Why not you don't matter"" smth like that then
""Cuz people will care""
And then I have an internal panick cuz I kinda don't disagree with either sides and it's becoming harder to believe the staying alive side

Like one thing that has been consistent is I get super depressed but never suicidal, I never want to KMS but idk if that's true anymore this feels like how I thought about self harm before I started but also I don't wanna be. Dramatic my best friend lost their childhood friend to suicide and they are suicidal it's a serious thing but idfk I have school tomorrow I can't wear shorts I'm fucking not ok but I should be im so sick of this BS wtf 

Um yeaaaa thanks to anyone who read that .. I won't do shit dw but support is welcome but cool either way idfk  I may sleep soo yea

Today was a good day and the worst day at the same time. My sister graduated today and we had a grad party for her. (So proud of her!) I already was dreading the party because it shines the spotlight on college and how I am not currently attending. This means a lot of side eyes and judgement from my family. I had about five or six people ask me what I was doing with my life and it was very obvious what they were doing. I‚Äôm already introverted and it was super hard trying to defend myself. I did have to sneakily go into the guest room to let out a few tears because I was so overwhelmed. It‚Äôs very clear my family‚Äôs love is conditional. It reminds me why I don‚Äôt attend family gatherings and why I like being alone. I just have this gut wrenching feeling after every party. I‚Äôm just trying my best but clearly that‚Äôs not enough.

"I guess that in God's infinite plan for you, everything that is happening to you, he's already seen all the possible outcomes of it and he knows how it all ends.

I wonder if free will really exists then.

Of course, being the good Christian that I am, the first voices immediately felt like demonic possession,...

Even after I was led to believe that I was born with a defective brain...

Even after They hooked me on meds that strangely and shockingly numbed down the voices ..

I still believe they were demons...

I mean how could I not?

Oh how scared I was ...

How many Ave Marias I recited...

How crazy I became...

After the first few shots, after the voices disappeared, the trauma I was left in forced me to not even trust my own thoughts...

Imagine believing that you're not alone in your head, only to then be really alone...which is scary? The former opens doors to a world you never thought possible and the latter leaves you in utter confusion. You live in terror which is then replaced by fear of the unknown.

I don't know if I am starting to sound cryptic but you have to experience it to understand.

It has been years and I am still taking the shots. Why? On the off chance I was really born with a defective brain, why not take them?

As for the demons, well I'm no saint, I guess it was bound to happen somehow, not really a good Christian and I know for a fact that God never cared about me in the first place.

I'm just tired of trying to make sense of things that I don't understand...

I feel like no matter how much I try to live a better life, I always hit a wall...I guess that with how unpredictable nature is, even when I ve got somethings figured out, I'll keep hitting a wall until I reach the real hell to be tormented by the same demons for all eternity.

"As a example, there is a (mostly dusty and unused ) drum machine box unit on the desk here, and for some reason it cracks and makes a loud clicking noise every now and then.

It is a lovely and professionally run place but the sudden noises that arise does make me jump sometimes.

As i type i am trying to think of some relevance to adhd, otherwise this is pointless waffle. Maybe serotonin, or endorphin is it, neurochemical release is somehow not dissimilar to this. Which i think might help explain the benefits of any form of physical exercise for some adhd people.

"I was diagnosed with paranoia years ago.  I had extreme episodes during that period, I couldn't even leave my room or use electronic devices.

 I was treated with doctors and therapy, nothing beyond that.  I have, or had at least five years without an episode after the end of my sessions, but it has returned.

 A few days ago, I noticed an opening in my window (which I had not paid attention to before), the curtains do not close completely, it was then that a million possibilities fell on me like a bucket of water;  That someone, one of my neighbors, had seen me in a vulnerable or intimate situation.

 Nowadays, it's easy to record mostly everything, and also everything becomes a ""meme"" quickly and I think this is one of my greatest fears, that people or someone with bad intentions use me as a source of ridicule and be bullied again.

 I feel like I'm falling back. I covered the windows again.  I'm terrified to look out on the balcony and I feel very alert.  Hearing laughter in the environment is my biggest trigger and also makes me feel bad to feel that is about me, because isn‚Äôt good be that self centered. 

 It makes me very sad because I don't know how to stop it, I'm not going through a good time financially, I have depression and the stress is added even more by this.  My partner knows that I suffered from this before we met and I worry about him even more, since I don't want to put this burden on him.

 This crisis was triggered most likely the same way as my first time.  But what makes it different from what happened a few years ago is that at that very moment I was able to affirm that I was right with my theory within the crisis and clearly, thanks to that I fell into a spiral.

 I'm not quite sure what to do as everything tends to escalate quickly... Any advice?

I wonder if writing down all that worries me just creates more focus towards the negative and reinforces it.

"I do get it. I can mask so well I seem like a happy and social person to a lot of people, or at least just normal. I can look people in the eye, I can make small talk, if I didn‚Äôt get someone‚Äôs joke/ what they‚Äôre trying to say I just pretend I got it and get away with it. No one can see that I didn‚Äôt get their joke they just told, that the sounds are making it very hard to listen to you, that I‚Äôm sweating and that your eyes are hurting me, it seems like I‚Äôm doing just fine. If I do show a bit of my symptoms, I come off as weird or rude. 

 It makes me wonder if I could even be autistic if I can mask to this extend because sometimes it doesn‚Äôt take that much effort, or maybe I‚Äôm just used to push through these things no matter what. Sometimes I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm just an overreacting attention seeking neurotypic (even though I‚Äôve only told a handful of people about my diagnosis) even though I can finally relate so much to autistic struggles and other autistic people in these subreddits.  



I also be on the verge of a meltdown because of everything happening around me, but due to traumatic experiences from the past I‚Äôm extremely good at pretending everything‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôll just be my ‚Äònormal self‚Äô, then as soon as I get home I‚Äôll hit myself, throw things around me and cry hysterically.
Ever since I was a little kid I would only do this when I‚Äôm alone because I knew my parents would just act like I‚Äôm doing it on purpose for attention, even though I know my emotions are so intense for me I just explode. In social settings I‚Äôve always daydreamed/ sort of dissociated when I‚Äôm overwhelmed to cope, but if I am alone, overstimulated and one little thing goes wrong all my frustration gets out. No one sees that.


I just hate that people think I‚Äôm not having that much struggles with my autism, or that ‚Äúit must be really mild then‚Äù, or ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôm just a HSP!‚Äù, just because I appear to be ‚Äònormal‚Äô most of the time.

"I hear self-loathing is commonly associated with depression, but I can't relate, because even self-loathing requires a degree of passion, and I can't find myself to feel passion for almost anything anymore. Maybe I don't have depression‚ÄîI think I might, but maybe I don't.  Because my depression doesn't seem to be characterized by anything violently self-loathing as much as it is a severe and inescapable apathy, less of a ""the world would be better off without me"" and more of ""what's the point in sticking around?""",2,depression

"(Sorry this is a long post ahead, not exactly ADHD friendly)

I'm in my early 20s and recently got diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression and I honestly relate a lot to the Asperger's community. I've known that I was dealing with these things for a long time but avoided addressing it until now because I am in an intense burnout cycle that has left me feeling decapitated. My family's response is that none of this is real and I just need to stop being lazy and to get it together. They don't want me to take medication because apparently living life depending on a pill is worse than a dysfunctional life without joy (I'm aware medication isn't necessary for everyone and some people thrive on other sorts of treatment, but I want to at least try it). They even wanted me to not tell my professors about what's going on to save face and my mom thinks they're talking about how terrible my work ethic is behind my back. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't now also paranoid about this. For context, I'm currently struggling through an undergrad degree that is really difficult. I once had a strong passion for the topic but it is slowly burning out along with my will to live. It's especially awful because my parents are paying so much money for this and I struggle intensely with guilt for my lack of willpower in daily life. I feel guilty for using accommodations in school and still barely pulling through and my parents make me feel 10x worse.

I honestly don't have memories of being happy for an extended period of time. I've always been intensely emotional and had anger issues as a child, but I quickly learned how to conceal this because I grew up the only child of super religious parents who care about appearances more than my feelings. I'm afraid of them and try to do as much as I can to avoid upsetting them. My mother in particular has been a helicopter over me my entire life and has very explosive anger such that I'm constantly telling white lies out of fear I might say something that'll make her blow up. Needless to say, I got yelled at when she tried to help me with math homework. I could talk about a lot of negative experiences from my childhood, but that would take all day. My privacy was constantly violated and I was punished for ""lying"" whenever I bottled up my feelings, even though I did this because those feelings have been dismissed every single time, or worse the feelings were considered offensive.

I've also struggled socially my entire life and its only gotten worse as I've gotten older. I have a couple of good friends, but for the most part I live my life completely disconnected from society. Every day, I wake up and walk through life as if it were a simulator. It's like I'm in some sort of bubble where time is distorted. I rarely have anything to look forward to and when I do I can hardly enjoy it either because I'm 1) feeling guilty about something that I haven't done or 2) get bored and/or tired incredibly easily. It feels like I have no escape from this hell. There are some people who listen, but I've never felt like I've been heard by anyone besides a therapist I see every two-three weeks for free through my school and I'll be going home for break soon. Nothing is appealing to me in life except for my bed and my ability to get lost in my imagination. My executive function is so poor right now and it's added so much to the shame. I feel like things are never going to get better. I hate being at school and I hate being at home. I hate thinking about the future and the past is painful. What do I even do? I've never cried so much in my life.",3,adhd
"This post may be triggering so proceed with caution. I‚Äôm going to talk about¬†anxiety¬†and¬†specific fears/ phobias.

I‚Äôm not sure whether these are attributed solely to my anxiety or if they could be considered part of PPD and/ or delusions:

- Not wanting to take medicine from my parents as a kid, when I was sick, because I thought they were trying to poison me.

- Being resistant to taking medication in general because I think there‚Äôs something wrong with it and I‚Äôm going to be drugged.

- Fear of overdosing on medication because I don‚Äôt trust myself to remember if I‚Äôve already taken it; this one might be justified with my DID which causes amnesia.

- I‚Äôm uncomfortable and try to avoid talking about certain things in the same room as a smartphone because I think it can hear me.

- Similarly uncomfortable with talking about anything personal over text/ messenger, for the same reason. Someone might read it.

- Wary of trying new foods in case I have an allergic reaction and die, even if I‚Äôve read the ingredients. I can‚Äôt eat anything that anyone else has prepared for me. Sometimes this transfers to foods I already know are safe.

- Fear of choking (maybe ARFID related). It‚Äôs usually manageable but sometimes crops up and makes it extremely difficult for me to eat anything solid for days/ weeks at a time.

- This one is less common, but thinking that there‚Äôs something¬†wrong¬†with my body. Like maybe it‚Äôs slowly rotting on the inside.¬†It doesn‚Äôt help that I have nightmares about things like my teeth falling out.

- Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and have to check every room in my house to make sure nobody‚Äôs broken in.

- I refuse to answer the door for anyone who isn‚Äôt in uniform and delivering a package, because they might be a criminal.

- I have a lifelong/ reoccurring fear of being falsely convicted of a crime and going to jail.

- I‚Äôm convinced that most of my friends secretly dislike me and I imagine them talking behind my back.

- Sometimes I think my partner has turned against me and I‚Äôm convinced he‚Äôs talking about me behind my back.

- Similarly, I will think my partner is cheating on me (for no reason/ without any evidence). I become fixated on the thought that he‚Äôs developed feelings for someone else.

- I tend to expect the worst from people and think they‚Äôre against me.

- If someone is late and/ or doesn‚Äôt answer their phone, I obsessively worry that they died in a car crash or something.

- I‚Äôm wary of every stranger I pass on the street because they might intend to hurt me.

- I rarely walk anywhere alone because I‚Äôm afraid of being assaulted or kidnapped.

- When I‚Äôm driving I easily become convinced that someone is following me.

- Sometimes I‚Äôm afraid that a loved one is going to end up murdering me for no reason.

- If anyone near me is holding a knife, I don‚Äôt trust them. No matter who it is.

- If a strange coincidence happens, I easily become convinced that it¬†means something¬†and I start searching for patterns around me

"I understand this is a small community. But I feel the need to type this out. Recently. About a few hours ago, I had a nervous fear craving to draw and write in my journal. 

""Oct 19th. I had the dream that has kept me up at night for several nights in a row. I barely get sleep. As I write this, the front door light is on and I'm scared of looking through the window. Their antlers pierced the moon. They know I'm aware. They stalk. They tap against the glass, they test the wood of the home. I don't know if the deer are after me.

I cannot fathom dreaming of them again.
Revalations 1;18: I am the living one, I was dead, and now look, I am Alive for ever and ever!  I hold the keys to death and hades""

Those are the first two pages.
The third
""The web is a trap. A site is a desecration. Being lost is a mutilation""


The fourth page.  Before this. I open my gallery, select a random image and it's a picture of my saturn light. In all of it's aesthetic glory. Then I realize. 
""Aug 14th, that was the closest saturn was to earth this year""
The next page
I picked a random photo again. This time of a tree in fog I took nearly a year ago. I sketch it out. It looks like a branched antler. I panic.
Next page
""July 29, 21.""
This time, I recall pulling up a video I had took on that same date, tonight I realize it's all coming together. Are the deer protecting me?

The next page 
""The windows are to stay locked. Shut. Locked. All lights on. Keep a gun close. Shut all doors. Lock them. Pray often.""
The next page. A drawing that came from one line. A sunset over hills through a window, next to a door. The perspective is as if I'm standing down a hall. The door is to my right,  it would possibly open outwards. The window is facing the hills. The door is facing against the wall adjacent the window. 
I scrawled ""fall into the sky"" next to it. Followed by a crude scribble armature. I can't pick out any details other than it looking humanoid.  
Next page. An eye I drew. Trying to avoid the thoughts
The page after that. A disturbing scrawl. It's ss if someone had no face, with a beak or some pyramid replacing all details. The neck is inhuman. Stretched. 
The next two pages are just recreations of the last two, in reverse.
I ended the journal journey with a mind boggling reminder 

""You found me!"" Then a little stick man with a thumbs up.

I can't tell if I'm losing my mind. If I'm letting my thoughts envelope my dreams, or maybe I'm taking the form of a blessing into the form of a threat? I've looked up the meaning of it.

Glowing white deer. One spoke to me. I can't remember what it said. I think it said ""come child, it will all be okay"" I heard a shuffle to my right. Eyes, shot open. I can't look away from my phone as I type. Fear in my heart. I can't help it. I just need to be heard. To not be forgotten. My story seems made up, but this truly did happen. I don't know if I'm losing my mind but I'm scared. The fear is engrossing. Wrapping around my heart like a venomous serpent.

I'm sorry to those who have read this -- I don't mean to increase your own fears. Worries and desperations. The world will think we're crazy. Maybe we are. Or maybe we're right. That's what it's all about. Paranoia is a gut feeling, a primal need to be scared, at a more advanced level. A conception made by man to make it seem wrong to not be worried about the unknown. What you don't know, you can't fight back. 

Please god. Let me be free from this heinous brain torture.  It's an unfathomable sensory overload. My eyes dart. My heart races.

"Hello, everybody.
I'm not diagnosed with autism but when I read or hear autistic people talk about their life experiences I feel like I finally found people who are as ""weird"" as me.
I relate so much to the people of this community that sometimes I feel so happy that I start crying... But anyway, this is not the main reason I created this post: I'm here because I'm so tired of my lack of social skills.

When I'm with others, it's almost as if I wasn't responding to their verbal and body language: they smile, talk happily and nicely to me while I'm there, still, trying to look at them in the eyes with absolutely no facial expression and no verbal response (the only things I say are ""yes"", ""no"", and ""mh""). Therefore, people label me as ""weird"" and avoid to talk to me.
Sometimes, when I think about how I act with people I laugh because it's so funny, but most of the times it's so saddening to me.

But when I find what I call a ""favorite person"" everything changes: I can easily look at you in the eyes, I show you so much love, I always try to make you happy, and I try to protect you at all costs (even if I'm really physically weak). I just love it when I find ""that person""... I finally feel happy...
But I get way too attached to that person... My attachment becomes a true obsession and all my friendships end because the other person gets so tired of me.

For me, having a favorite person is kinda like having a partner (for a neurotypical person): I want to spend as much time as possible with the other person and do many things together, and when the relationship ends it takes me years to accept it, even when I found a new favorite person.

For these reasons, I've never had more than one friend and I passed most of my time alone with no friends. I just wish someone told me what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it... I would literally follow all their instructions precisely.


Also, I've made this post because someone who I considered my favourite person told me that they don't like how I act, that everything I do is so annoying, and that I should seek medical attention. Maybe their words weren't that hurtful, but they made me so sad because I just thought that in these last months they were stressed/sad and I wanted to help them to feel better... Apparently my actions have been misinterpreted.


P.S.: sorry for any mistakes or if something is hard to understand.",1,autism
"It's the strangest feeling. You know your life is turning to shit but you just don't care enough. I am very conscious of the fact that I should feel sad but instead there is just a big hole. disconcerting to say the least. Is this what is feels like to be a psychopath?

This is very debilitating.  I don't get or care to get certain social queues.  My wife cries sometimes about me being this stone-cold asshole but I can't seem to find the right emotion to help her. I just tell her we all have our own problems.  I am a scumbag this I know.  She would be better off with another person.",2,depression

I‚Äôd say about three weeks later I started getting bombarded with spam texts on the daily.

"Since I know myself I have recursive thoughts, meaning that it starts and while my mind gives continuity to it I inevitably return to it, for what I accounted from other people it is normal to have tem in stressful or disconcerting situations, or even with simple thing such as a catchy song or a new word they learned, but I also have paranoid thoughts about vile and gruesome deaths and deformations, on almost every occasion, Avery pointy, hard, heavy, hot, electrical, mechanical, or flammable, immediately trigger this kind of thought, but even with simple things which as corners, steps, windows, and ladders can trigger those thoughts, and when they are too discomforting they become recursive and the more I think about them the more paranoid I get, but it's not a well defined well stablish paranoia, is just an impending feeling of doom and eerieness.
But since my last camping trip, in which I had a paranoid anxiety crisis, triggered by the noise of a bug that woke me up that was extremely similar to a motorcycle, making so that my limbs became dormant and I thought I was having a hipotermic episode, I have been have a weird kind of paranoia, instead of having a gorey thought that keeps me distressed, I have a shutdown of my rational and lyrical functions just feeling me with a paralysing anxiety.
I feel that it might be related to the fear of contamination by COVID and the closeness to the Brazilian equivalent of the SATs which also mean I'm graduating.

"Hello  everyone, this might be a long post but I'll try to keep things clear and concise. My middle aged disabled mother  thinks the government is spying on her. She rarely leaves the house and  when she does, she doesn't leave the car. She thinks there are  undercover people taking pictures of her, listening to her through electronics, and trying to arrest her for god knows what. She has been  putting towels over phones, putting paper over random electronics (e.g. the lights on a ps3 even though I told her there's no camera in it), and  is very suspicious of all strangers I'm unsure if this is the cause of  her medication (she takes plenty of meds for her pain), her lack of friends/social activity (she mostly talks with me and my two siblings), or something else.

I've been very calm and rational with addressing this problem with her, but she has told me that she knows she seems crazy, but at least God understands her. She's very stubborn and gets  angry whenever we have conversations that makes her feel uncomfortable.  When I asked her about how this all will end, she said she'll either end  up arrested or God will ""deliver her"" from this. Idk what she means by  this but she comes off as if she's given up. Her disability has made life very painful for her and she usually just watches TV everyday while  dealing with her pains.

I live about about an hour or two away from her for work and don't have a car  for easy transportation to help her. I'm trying my best to be calm and  supportive but I hate that I can't do much while my mom's mind is deteriorating. My siblings are a double edge sword in all of this since  they're both helpful and toxic for my mother. They're easily frustrated  and emotional whenever my mom gets too overbearing (she can get very  angry and mean when things doesn't turn out her way). My brother helps  sometimes since he lives with her but he is very junky, stubborn, and conceited. My mom likes a clean house and my brother constantly dirties  up the place. My sister on the other hand can be supportive but her  awful relationships and financial troubles causes her to be very toxic. She constantly borrows money from us, manipulates/lies, and can be  downright rude at times.

My sister  and I have been wanting to do an intervention on my mother but my  brother doesn't want to do it. I'm trying to listen and be supportive of  everyone, but I don't know what to do and I'm tired of all this  emotional labor. Action needs to happen but with my brother constantly working and focusing on his own interests while my sister is working and  focusing on relationships/partying/etc, it can't happen. I've been telling my mom I think she should go to counseling/therapy, but I don't think she's going to do it. She only trusts one counselor she went to  years ago, and has told me she would try to find her ""one of these days.""

i'm 18 now, turning 19 in a month. i don't feel like an adult, let alone a functioning one

im currently in university, but it's horribly overwhelming. everytime i'm on campus i end up getting overwhelmed and having to go to the bathroom to cry or have a meltdown. i need to bring my sweater and headphones with me otherwise i start bawling and become non-functional when im outside. i regularly get overwhelmed in public and end up just crying for no reason

i don't know how to cook. or clean. or even sweep the floor. going out of my room is a struggle. even making a sandwich is too much for me sometimes. one time when i did manage to make one, the butter i'd put on it tasted wrong and i had a breakdown. i know this makes me sound extremely privileged, but i grew up with a domestic helper doing everything for me so essentially ive never lived independently.

showering is also near impossible for me, i can only force myself to after weeks when my hair gets horribly greasy and gives me awful sensory overload. i dont think ive brushed my teeth in two or three years either because of the way it feels on my gums

i don't mask well. everytime i talk to nt people, im just dead silent with a poker face. i can talk to people like waiters or cashiers but even then my speech is incredibly stilted and awkward. talking itself also feels physically painful sometimes idk hwo to describe it. the only thing i can focus on are my special interests. everything else feels impossible. it's cliche but i really cannot even begin to understand how im ""supposed"" to act. i can be quiet and not stim in public but that's it. and half the time i do stim at home i end up injuring myself out of my control

and whenever i think about living on my own i start breaking down. i don't think i can do it. i'm convinced im either going to die in my parents' house or end up committing suicide in some way

whenever i hear about autistic adults who can function independently and just require a little structure  in their lives or something i get really envious. i know it's not a competition but i feel like im mentally 12 years old at all times and i don't know how to take care of myself or do anything by myself; even my younger brother has told me i act ""so autistic"" and he ends up taking care of me a lot of the time",1,autism

"I never post anything like this or even use Reddit but anyways. I‚Äôm 24, I‚Äôm a recovering drug addict I have a year sober and clean. I‚Äôm posting this because of the empty void and the intense anxiety I experience that progressively gets worse. I take care of my grandma with Alzheimer‚Äôs, my best friend past away a few years back, and I left my girl of 3 years that I loved because she was no good for me. All these misfortunes and others that I haven‚Äôt named replay in my mind on top of not knowing my direction in life. I used to be extremely extraverted now I‚Äôm the opposite, it‚Äôs hard for me to answer people back, I don‚Äôt like going out anymore, even though I want companionship and I do want to be how I was but I‚Äôm just lost. I‚Äôve had a crazy life so far and I know I have alot more in store but I‚Äôm scared and I get sinister thoughts that start to take over me and a big part of it is not knowing my purpose or forgetting what my purpose is. I have two things in my life that I‚Äôve always loved and that I‚Äôm passionate about, but they‚Äôre not lucrative unfortunately.. those two things are watching movies/writing movie scripts and bodybuilding and dieting. I been working dead end jobs and end up leaving one to another from lazy and incompetent employees. I haven‚Äôt had a job within the past 2 months which doesn‚Äôt help with what I‚Äôm going through. but anyways, I‚Äôve always got vanity in my mind motivating me, getting an attractive girl, a nice car, keep improving my body, still have drug fantasies even though I will never go back to that life. I‚Äôm an attractive guy so I‚Äôm not always worried about not getting another girlfriend but I do get very lonely. I believe in god but my heart isn‚Äôt fully there at times and I know that‚Äôs a life long journey and my take is the reason why I feel like this is not having faith at all times and not knowing my purpose which creates constant lows and highs. I get so anxious sometimes that my brain feels like a carbonated drink and I feel like I‚Äôm about to pass out and my heart races through the roof. I used to not get like this often but now it happens regularly.

"24F. I have always been the weird outcast. Spent all my school days just getting laughed at by other girls and getting picked at. I was always alone. I've never had a best friend. My parents are super toxic and conservative. They are Indian Muslims. I'm not saying all Muslims are bad people but my parents and my community sucks. They have been forcing me to get married since I was like 16. My father is abusive, my brothers misogynists, and my mother is a narcissist with victim complex. I had a job for three months after graduating but the environment was really toxic and I was recovering from a traumatic event so I had to move back home. I have no skills and no idea how to move forward. I am trying to upskill but some days or entire months I get so paralysed by depression. I need therapy but my parents won't let me. I'm an adult but being a woman in this community leaves me with no control on my own life. 

I have been going to the gym. And I made a couple of friends. I mean I thought they were friends. I talked to them about normal girly stuff and I tried really hard to not be weird. But I guess it didn't work. I heard them laughing at me and once I tried really hard to understand their body language, I realised they find me weird and don't want to talk to me. This literally triggered me so much.

I have to much empathy and I cry about everything. Any time I see someone sad or hurt I break down. I have so much love to give to someone. I so desperately want like someone to talk to who won't judge me. Even when I have things I want to share with like my mother, I suppress them because she will just make me feel childish and stupid for it. 

I don't know what to do. I am struggling with the thoughts of ending it all but I can't let someone else be responsible for finding me yk? I won't do anything. I would like advice on how to deal with all this and be okay with being utterly alone and move forward. I hate that humans need companionship. What a faulty design.",1,autism

The funniest thing happened and ever since then i did not have anxiety AT ALL.  Which very weird for me because i do not remember a single minute without anxiety for the past 7 years. Then of course things didnt work out and my anxiety came back the day he left my life. What could be the reason i honestly dont know. I know that i miss him a lot and would do anything to get him back. But still cant understand how someone can have an impact that huge unknowingly.,3,adhd

"My boyfriend and I got into an argument, and I admit it was my fault. I acknowledged my wrongdoings, and I apologised to him. We tried to talk about it, but then he said:  
""I'm already under a lot of stress at work. I don't want to talk about this right now."" - It's a rough translation.  
I couldn't sleep that evening, so I wrote him a paragraph explaining how sorry I was and if he needed time and space, I'd give it to him.. Because he has every right to feel upset towards me. But I did mention not to stay away from me for too long, because I'd miss him.  
I took the advice of people on Reddit to ask him how much time/space he'd need.  
He replied saying (rough translation): ""I don't know. Please stop nagging/pushing me."" Something like that...  
I don't know what to do. I get anxious because I don't know if he will come back anytime soon. I want to reach out to him and ask him if he is okay, but I don't want to bother him. I'm trying my best to communicate with him, but I don't want to force him to come back.  
Honestly, I'm having a hard time. I know it's my fault, but I just want us to be okay...

"Hi everyone, I'm a 17 year old guy who is paranoid.
It all started with a meeting with a friend while watching a movie, I stared at the TV screen, and put my finger in my nose (but did not pick it). I lay there for about 10 minutes, but the problem is that I was afraid that he could take a picture of me on the phone (he took it in his hands while we watched the movie and when I stared a little) and maybe put it somewhere on the Internet. We have here such networks as vk, telegram, tiktok, facebook.
And the next day I came to the college and obsessive thoughts began - someone smiled when he passed next to me, two girls started laughing when I sat and ate lunch in the dining room, some guys laughed looking in my direction when I was waiting for the bus home , etc. .d. It seems to me that they all recognize me from this video or photo.
Everything got to the point that I asked 12 people (acquaintances and a friend) if they had seen me anywhere on the internet. Everyone answered that they had not seen, but I practically do not trust everyone (except relatives).
And I also asked my friend (with whom I watched the film) to show his gallery.
There were no photos or videos. But I don't know if he saw something on the Internet with me or not.
I don‚Äôt even know what to add here , some people on the street still smile when i go through them.
If you read all this, then I would not be against some advice (because it seems to me that I will go crazy soon)",5,paranoia
"For the last few months I feel like I have lost the ability to care about whether I live or die. I am by no means suicidal, but sometimes feel like it would almost be preferable to die rather than continue the same cycle of life I am currently in. The weird thing is that I do have a good life. I had a very traumatic upbringing but have found happiness as a young adult, especially in my career. Ever since starting anti-depressants, I have also found it easier to socialise and keep hobbies. I have good relationships, and don't struggle to get out of bed in the morning anymore / be productive. But at the root of it all I just feel exhausted. Even with the small moments of joy life offers, the pain that comes with being alive ‚Äì loss, suffering, fear ‚Äì almost seem like they outweigh the good. 

Recently I had to have an op and went under anaesthetic. When I came around I began crying because I didn't want to wake up and told the nurse I wanted to die. She put it down to withdrawal from the anaesthetic, not knowing my psyche over the last few months. Like I said, I am not suicidal, but I just feel like I'm struggling to find the will every day to care about whether I live or die. It's as though the state of the world and the actual fact of existence seems less preferable to me than the alternative.

"Before I sound too rational and like I am not actually paranoid, I am just basing what I think reality is or should be to most people and seeing that it is not what I experience or am experiencing right now. Also the main purpose of this post is to try and find others like me or a community that deals with this. 

1. I believe my paranoid/pessimistic mental state affects the world and people around me and they start acting different. (without even speaking to them.) 
2. I have seen reasonable evidence that people are quite legitimately against me (or just evil in general) even though they were my friends. 

I will start with number 1. In my current living situation I live alone with my dog and my sister. I take the dog out frequently and today I noticed that people in their cars driving by were staring. One guy even took a photo or video of me when I was looking. He even seemed to slow the car down to do it. Usually I feel like my vision must have been obstructed but this time the window was rolled down and it looked clear as day. 

Also, It feels like when I am in this state that the world changes based on my paranoia. Like having a power that you can't control sort of way. Or one that actively goes against you. I feel like the results I am looking to have will not happen if I look forward to them too much. One example is the stock market. I feel that I should not look at the graph or it will start going against me. That is more of a soft example though. I have also been rejected from many job positions and it feels like the more I wanted it the more that obstructed. I had received an offer at a decent place only for it to be taken away by a literal pandemic. Then the company which seemed to imply they would hire everyone later rejected me over email even after all that I have been through with them (summer program they provided). Whenever I feel too happy about something it will get ripped away. 

For the second point, it seems the more I look the more evil I find. People actively don't give a shit about others. No one in this town cares about covid. 

That is not even the bigger issue to me. When I am in this state I think that it influences other peoples decisions and how they view me. Even though I never talk to them about my delusional thinking I can see it in their faces and actions. It's like they can pick up on my ""energy"" so to speak and they actively either make fun of me or avoid me. 

I am not that bad right now but there was a time I thought my GF was a literal government agent of sorts and that I had evidence to support it. I remember specifically thinking that the evidence was undeniable though I cannot seem to recall any of it.",5,paranoia
"I‚Äôm a 40 year old woman. I tend to feel like an alien when trying to fit in with society anyway, and recently had an experience that really showed me this.

I was at an appointment and when talking to the receptionist, I noticed she had shaved her arms. After that I began noticing it in women and realised I did not, and had never, shaved my own arms. I started obsessing over it as something I should do, did I miss this in my ‚Äúwhat women should do to be accepted in public‚Äù repertoire, is anyone noticing my arms are different, etc.

So, yesterday I finally shaved my arms, and I hate it. I don‚Äôt feel like myself anymore. It feels like my arms are not mine. I covered them today but the second I rolled my sleeves, there they were, being all wrong. I had a bit of a crying fit about it before realising this is not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, and I‚Äôm never going to be normal as much as I try to mask and pretend I am.

"That's my motto rn. I feel as if I'm about to combust mentally, but I'm totally fine. Everything is fine. I told myself to just get up and start doing something anything in life. I feel stagnate but it's my own fault. All you have to depend on is urself. I'm tired of dealing with myself. All the mental gymnastics all the thoughts all the breakdowns. I'm exhausting. 

So I'm gonna try my best to not wallow or drown in the gloom and actually do something worthwhile. I know it's not like I wanted to be a giant failure at 21 then proceded to accomplish it, but nor did I take the proper actions to keep myself from careening off a cliff. So I'm gonna try for the umpteenth time to fix what I have left in this life. Either that or one day I figure I'm too tired too keep myself from doing something I won't live to regret. 

It's all good got hella energy until I get up to actually do something then I'm immediately exhausted. Life's just like that though for me anyway. I hope there is no afterlife cause I don't think I could or want to live again while dead. That would be pretty ironic to live in torment already just to get fed up, unalive urself just to wake up in hell after death.",2,depression

"I try as hard as I can to not speak in public or around other people that I am not familar with in general. Like if I'm asked a question, by say... my brother or my sister, I stay silent and I wait until we are in an area with nobody around. Not because I'm trying to be rude, but I am just afraid of speaking around other people, even being alone too, and talking to my significant other on the phone... I just feel like there is someone listening to me, watching me, somewhere, and I don't like that.. it feels like I have no privacy even though I am very quite, keep to myself a lot, and alone more than I'm not. Along with that I am intensely paranoid about thinking or saying certain things too. I feel like I will speak them into existence, though being so paranoid about that, I end up thinking those things constantly!

Half of the time I sound bored and monotone and look like a zombie from the lack of sleep and constantly pushing away all of my emotions.",5,paranoia
"First and foremost, let me introduce myself. I am not your average person when it comes to social situations. I struggle with responding appropriately and reacting in a way that is considered normal. My circle of friends is limited to just two people from my high school days, and outside of them, I hardly speak to anyone.  
Today, a friend of my brother - who is not particularly close to me - asked me to draw a sketch for his girlfriend. Truth be told, I really didn't want to do it. However, he was persistent and even went as far as offering to take me out to a street vendor for a meal. I agreed to go along, but he continued to pressure me into drawing the sketch.  
Unfortunately, I've been in similar situations before where I said ""no"" but the other person became aggressive and started speaking to me rudely, even in a threatening manner. As a result, I ended up giving in and doing their work for them - something that used to happen a lot in high school when I was bullied.  
So, my question to you is: How should I respond if I find myself in a similar situation again? I want to be able to stand my ground without feeling intimidated or pressured into doing something I don't want to do.",4,anxiety

"i just moved into college & it‚Äôs the first time i‚Äôve shared a room with someone since my sister back in middle school. i‚Äôm living with 3 other people and our apartment has almost no noise suppression and it feels like i have to constantly walk on eggshells. i also have an eating disorder and it‚Äôs really hard for me to eat in front of other people, and the fact that they can hear any time i open a bag has made it even harder. i‚Äôm genuinely terrified of what they‚Äôre thinking when i hide in the closet to unwrap a piece of gum because i know they can hear it. 

one of our roommates also moved in earlier than the rest of us & i cant get the thought out of my head that she planted cameras in certain areas to watch if i do something she doesn‚Äôt approve of (she seems to be fairly uptight & strict and i‚Äôm constantly scared of angering her even though as of now she‚Äôs shown nothing but kindness). she‚Äôs also the only one in our apartment this weekend and i can‚Äôt get the thought out of my head that she‚Äôs going through all my belongings to find reasons to hate me when i come back. 

living in the same room as someone has been especially hard, and ive found myself essentially watching her sleep to make sure she isn‚Äôt watching what i do at night. i also keep finding myself watching my roommate who works at the desk behind me in the reflection of my computer screen to make sure she‚Äôs not turning around to watch me instead.

"this is gonna be a confusing time,and i‚Äôve had trouble figuring out which subreddit to post this in,but i settled here since i might just be overthinking things.

i got contacted by someone on instagram,asking me if i was a guy or not. at first i was confused,he didn‚Äôt follow anyone i was following,nor did he follow anyone my boyfriend followed. i had dodged the question and just asked who they are,however,they responded by asking the same question again. i answered just by saying that i was biologically a girl. he had acknowledged my response and afterwards i asked why he contacted me. he said that ‚Äúmy friend wanted me to ask you.‚Äù i had asked who was said friend,but the only detail i got was that their name started with a J. apparently,said friend had a crush on my boyfriend,and did not know if my boyfriend was gay or not. i had accepted this reason,and conversed with the person a little more before going to do my own thing. 

here‚Äôs the kicker,my boyfriend did not give out his instagram to anyone,merely two people,both of which names did not start with J. and my boyfriend only knew one person with a J name,which is who i‚Äôm suspicious of. so i was wondering,how did they get my account? my boyfriend follows quite a few people,and so i‚Äôm deducing that they went through his following to find me. which is a little weird to me. afterwards,instead of asking me or my boyfriend directly,used a friend to ask me if i was a guy? we both have no idea who‚Äôs the friend,or maybe merely a stranger,who had a crush on him. i deal with anxiety and paranoia,which is why i‚Äôve been uneasy this whole time. this whole thing could be a prank but it would be a kinda elaborate prank wouldn‚Äôt it? i‚Äôm probably overthinking this,what should i do? how do i deal with this anxiety,and is this normal?

"We are there for him. We are willing to do whatever it takes to help him through this. We talk a lot and have a good relationship. Except he has such a massive secret life that he constantly lies to keep us from finding out about the real him. We have had many glimpses though. 

I wish he would just tell us 'fuck you i wanna smoke pot with my friends forever and bang a bunch of skanks' because that's sure what it looks like.

Instead he strings us along with how he wants to get into tradeschool but he's interested in a break after high school. he says he's suicidal or struggling with cutting 'relapses' sometimes, and its always when we are asking him about his plans for the future. 
he mentions these things as if we knew it, but he never told us before.

he is probably not going to live with us, because we would get him into training and make sure he stayed on track.

he wants to go live in his grammas basement and work at dunkin with his stoner friends.

he doesn't have hobbies except gaming. when he's with us, he doesn't have him games, so he just goes to bed *very* early.

he has an online therapist. when he tells us his depression was flaring up and that's why he had to skip school, we ask did you talk about it with your therapist? he says 'no, i'm usually just telling her all the things that happened here' which means complaining about us giving him shit for skipping school.

He smokes weed and clearly has this whole pot head dark guy image that he's rocking right now, but he insists he doesn't use it much and will never use harder drugs, but he also hangs out with drug dealers and his friends have had cocaine parties.
we tried to get him to quit weed when we first found out and it was impossible. he says it helps him. he also takes antidepressants that the doc gave him without our consent.

**He keeps going back to how he wants to choose differently but *unfortunately* he has this curse of depression that won't let him do better.**

He has reasons to be struggling with depression. He's been through 3 divorces. It sucked.

But the rest of his complaints about life are almost headline buzzwords like 'the world is falling apart and i don't wanna just get right into working some 9-5 until i die'

I just wish he would stop leaning on this depression thing. It feels like an utter excuse and an insult to people who have been through really bad stuff.",2,depression

"Hey guys.

I have been struggling with depressive thoughts for about 3 years. It all started because of a girl, but since then it's evolved.

Ever since I turned 18 I have more and more frequently been turning to drinking to cope with my problems. I'm drunk as I'm writing this, and would love to stop. The problem is that I frankly enjoy being drunk. 

As a 20 y/o man, struggling with alcoholism isn't that much of a problem in my close one's eyes. I don't tell them why I drink. We party and have fun, and they don't recognize that I have a problem. 

As a coping mechanism, however, it doesn't work long term. I'm fine in the moment, but when I wake up I'm just as miserable as I was the day before. My therapist says I should find ways to stop, but hasn't really given me clear cut advice.

If you are like me, by all means stop drinking. I wish I'd never started, but life got in the way. The whole point of this post is sharing my experience, not necessarily seeking advice.",2,depression

"About two months ago I finally sought out professional help to alleviate my anxiety. I went on ZocDoc and after some time, narrowed my choices down and picked at what I thought at the time was a good psychiatrist.

My first visit was very brief and she put me on medication which I thought was odd at the time. That visit was over the phone but she told me to physically go to her office for the next visit. Our second visit started out a little shaky. I went to the office as she told me to, but she wasn't there so I had to do the visit over the phone again while I was in her office. Aside from that it was great!  I felt like I got a lot off my chest and I felt like I finally had someone looking out for me. Our third visit was brief again and she didn't seem to remember or bring up most of what was discussed in our last meeting. I began to realize that she was very forgetful. Our fourth and probably last visit was awful. She couldn't remember basic details about me, couldn't remember what meds she prescribed me and sounded generally uninterested the entire time. At the end she told me they were having ""technical difficulties"" with scheduling appointments and would call me later to book an appointment.

That was over a two weeks ago and they still haven't called me back. I don't even want to waste my time calling them to see what the deal is. It all felt so directionless. She'd prescribe me medications then tell me essentially to figure it out and I've been trying to figure it out by myself my entire life. No guidance, insight, or any form of advice to help me improve my life as if the medications would suddenly fix all my issues. I'll take my losses and find a new psych.

I know this journey won't be perfect, but it was very disheartening to finally tell someone all the struggles I have dealt with my entire life only for them to give me subpar care and treat me as if I'm some annoyance. I did net some good from the visits. I was finally put on some medications that have greatly helped in reducing my anxiety.

"So I (in my 20s and f) am diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and got diagnosed at young age of 17 due to have multiple psychosis/manic episodes from ages 14-17. 

Background: The first episode I had at 14 resulted me into illegally (well trying) leaving the country with no identification because (according to the medical report) thought that I was being watched and followed by some type of form of government. I have no memory of the episode I just remember that one day I was walking to school then 2 days later waking up in the psych ward confused. That was my first ever major episode. Then up until I was 17 I had like minor ones but some not but some major enough to lead me in the hospital but I don‚Äôt really remember them just like the first one at 14. My last major one was at 17 where I went to go over to my boyfriends house and then he told me (later on after I was stabilized) I was ‚Äúgoing crazy‚Äù and thinking that the police were after me which landed me also again in the hospital for 1.5 months and my official diagnosis.

Anyways I‚Äôve been catching myself getting a little delusional lately like off and on and I‚Äôm even on high prescriptions of antipsychotics and having vivid dreams of where I‚Äôm watching myself in the dream becoming more and more out of touch of reality but this time in my dreams I never recover really and I‚Äôm like ‚Äústuck‚Äù idk I feel like if I do end up in another episode I feel like it‚Äôs gonna last longer than 1.5months.

"Lately, it seems that the main trigger for my depression is bad sleep, not even sure if it's bad sleep or not. The thing is, it typically happens after I wake up, usually when I wake up and then decide to snooze for some time, then I wake up in a horrible mood and it seems to have all the typical depression symptoms. The bad mood seems to get worse throughout the day time. I usually I'm unable to get any work done and just wait for sleep time to hopefully reset whatever imbalance has happened in this broken brain.

"I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but... I'm at my wits end.

&#x200B;

Two days ago, I suffered what is possibly a seizure in the morning, and although I am already dealing with that with my neurologist, and my psychiatrist knows about these too, I don't know what to do now.

For the two days since, I've been beyond myself anxious, like... I have this feeling in my gut telling me like something terrible is going to happen. I feel like my body wanted to quiver. I feel like I almost want to cry, and I have no idea what to do.

I'm already pretty well versed with anxiety, been on meds since 18 YO (26M rn), and am taking 225 mgs of venlafaxine (For anxiety) and 600-900 mgs of valproate (for the epilepsy) + have clonazepam 0.5mg tablets on hand.

Had one pill of the clonazepam I keep for acute anxiety attacks, but... I guess, I'm asking -- How do you people deal with these anxiety episodes like this? I'm literally worried of everything, and nothing seems to be able to distract me. I'm worried I won't be able to fall asleep, that I'll be tired, and that might lead to further seizures. 

It always takes me about a week to get back to normal after a seizure, but after the last one, I think it's the worst it has ever been and I'm just lost of how I could calm myself down T-T",4,anxiety

"I remember being upset at the playground whenever someone left the swing swinging after they got off it. I needed it to sit still otherwise I was anxious.

If my mom ran over the cord when vacuuming, I would scream and cry. This was terrifying to me. I still feel like vacuuming is uncomfortable for me today and I hate when the cord is in danger of becoming caught or rolled over.

My older brother had a computer game that taught you about the human body - what a skeleton was, what hands were, what an eye was. When it showed an eye opening, it made this creaky opening sound effect that caused so much terror in me that I had to run to the other side of the house and close my ears. My brother would sometimes repeat it to mess with me. 

I guess I'm saying this because I don't really understand where these fears come from. Or what they might indicate about me. I often don't remember these small terrors I used to have and I'm sweaty typing about them. 

Today I live with an ever present feeling of wrongness in the pit of my stomach and hypervigilance of my surroundings. My eyes scan things quickly and I find myself becoming quickly fatigued when they dart around back and forth too quickly. I find that I'm very good at competitive games where awareness and reactivity are a strong suit. I'm excellent at my career and fast on a computer, but it is a double edged sword as my brain overheats (sometimes physically, it feels like) as it takes too much information in.

I was playing the new Zelda game, and while those games are generally enjoyable to me, walking through vast environments with numerous paths and options available to me at once is incredibly exhausting. I need to walk through every nook and cranny and find every collectible before I can move further, and my eyes are constantly scanning and looking for hidden things. It's incredibly fatiguing. On top of this, there's a voice telling me I need to be doing something else, but I can never figure out what that is. I can't just sit down and enjoy something. 

So yeah, I think I just needed to say some of this stuff. I don't really know why any of this is the way it is for me, but sometimes I forget the reasons *why* I'm anxious and it's all just a confusing abstract jumble. So I turned my thoughts into words this time.",4,anxiety

"Hi I'm new to this subreddit but I need help I'm not even sure what to do but I just need to talk I guess, context first I'm 14 years old and all of this started (or at least started affecting my life) about a year and a half ago. I'm scared all the time, no I'm not being dramatic but I really am never calm my memory isn't very good honestly I think I'm getting dumber to my memories deterating I'm scared and sometimes I just can't understand text or people when there explaining complex things I could have before anyways back to the memory problems I can't even rember how I was before I know I wasnt like this but I can't rember not being so terrified [SORRY FOR LONG POST IN ADVANCE]

I have nothing to hide but when someone's behind me while I'm on my phone I panic I could be playing a normal game or just reading and I want to cry because someone can SEE, I can't talk about the music I like or the shows/games I enjoy without feeling like I'm going to puke for the entire day I can't be by myself because I feel like something if someones there but I can't be around people without feeling like they can read my mind? Or I'm actually thinking out loud but somehow I don't hear it which I know is impossible but I still feel that way, because of this I have a really bad habit of biting down on my tongue every single day all day I'm biting down on my tongue and puasing before I talk because what if I don't say what I meant to or just start screaming or something? Which couldn't happen I know but I still feel like it
I can't post things or like things or even watch things on my phone because I get scared somehow I'm going to send it to my contacts or I'm broadcasting it to everyone around me or someone's constantly watching me through my phone/computer or what's on my phone/computer even writing this post is hard.

If someone touches me I scream even if I know there going to do it, but when I touch someone I'm fine? Someone walks fast behind me on the stairs I start running and I panic, someone walks into the same room as me and I scream, someone sleeping in the same room as me? No just no I feel like I'm going to puke and scream or cry or just all three at once my whole life has been affected. I've tried talking to my brother sense where really close but I don't think he really understands, I can't write in my journal because my mom READS. EVERYTHING. And I know that for a fact she's admitted to it, I think that started it when I found out she was going through my things I am never alone it's like she knows everything she hears everything she see everything and there nothing I can do about it I'm alone I'm helpless I hate that feeling I can't even talk to my therapist because she's friends with my mom I know she legally can't tell her anything but everytime I try to talk I freeze up and I just can't. Please I need help I don't know whats wrong with me what do I do about this please I feel like I'm dying like I'm decompossing everyday it's so hard everything is so hard all I do is go to school, eat, lay down, eat, sleep, go to school but I'm not happy Im scared so scared and everything feels so REAL to real when I stressed I just imagine things, dumb scenarios stuff like that but none of that is real and no of those make believe people are real and I'll never have that I'll never have anything because I am messed up and I'll probably always be and I'm just getting worse I know I am but no one cares I just want someone to ask if I'm okay I just want someone to hold me and for me to not be scared I want to be content I'm sorry for the rambling I got of track sorry just idk I don't know",5,paranoia

It's been vibrating because of some typical doorbell bs, harmless on it's own, but them loosening the wire to make it stop (it didn't) is not only completely useless but dangerous. Apparently I worry too much when they leave me at home alone with 3 animals and an electrical fire hazard. I just need to trust them, even though they know about my mental health and know that's asking too much, but they don't have to trust me when I shove a million Google results on how loose wires are a bad thing? I don't want them to help me storm parliament or anything, I just want some basic safety precautions no matter how unlikely it is for things to go bad.

"Fitting that it‚Äôs mental health month cause mine is going down the drain‚Ä¶ 

28 yo female. I have a lot going for me. I have a healthy relationship, a chill dog, I just finished my second semester of college (better late than never, right?) but I‚Äôm really really struggling. 

I‚Äôm fortunate in that I don‚Äôt go through every day feeling sad. I‚Äôll have episodes of sadness but they‚Äôre short-lived. I don‚Äôt feel overwhelming happy but content, I guess. My main issue is just a lack of motivation particularly when it comes to work. I need to find a new job because every time I get a job, I don‚Äôt want to go into work. I think of those 8 hours and what else I could be doing like sitting on my ass watching tv or smoking weed so I‚Äôll choose to do that stuff instead of working so I‚Äôm not making any money and I just don‚Äôt care. Someone on Reddit mentioned this could be a depression symptom. Anybody else experience this?

I love my partner but he does not understand mental health so while he feels bad for me, he does not offer productive advice and I just end up keeping everything to myself.

This month sucks. I had finals, I have to find a new job, I‚Äôm going on a 5 day trip where my social meter is going to be at capacity and I have to leave my dog.

"Throughout my entire life I've had a lot of issues with socializing, anxiety, and confidence. I developed a stutter around age 6 that probably reached moderate levels of severity as a young kid but over time it improved significantly to the point where it doesn't usually affect my life or make people notice at all. Even though it improved I think it contributed to me having a lot of self-esteem issues and probably stunted my social development and I still worry about stuttering even now. Adding to that while I think I grew up in a great home I had an extremely competitive and ambitious older brother who clearly had some narcarssistic tendencies. We argued constantly growing up and I didn't live up to the expectations that I perceived as being set on me as a child by him. I was also just a lazy child and didn't really care about extra-curriculars and I was always an outcast on sports teams and I would spend most of my free time just playing video games so I think I missed out on a lot of opportunities to learn what it's like to be a part of a team and community. All of these I pinpoint to my social and self-image development being really stunted and at 25 it feels like I'm really far behind and in a lot of aspects I'm lacking on a lot of what I want in life and my youth.  
  
I have really bad social anxiety and it's always been that way to some extent or another. One of my earliest memories is from when I was around 10 and I was playing catch with my best friend at the park and a group of kids from our school showed up and were doing whatever and my friend wanted to join them. I really didn't want to go because I was afraid of being made fun of so I told my friend to go and I left and went home. In early high school I gained a bit of a reputation for being a weird kid and I was so afraid of being bullied that I felt that my reputation was unfixable (it wasn't) and the best course of action would be to just hide in obscurity as much as I can and not make waves so people would leave me alone. I was basically never invited to parties and I didn't go to any grad events in my senior year except for prom, the grad ceremony, and the convocation (so I didn't go to the annual grad campouts, the boat party, the end of year parties, none of that). I've really only been to a few parties and whenever I do go I have almost insurmountable anxiety.  
  
It's funny looking back at high school because despite all this, I actually had a decent amount of friends, or at least people that could've been friends if I tried harder. I would still joke around with people all the time in class in my later years, my senior yearbook is filled with funny comments and inside jokes, I had a ton of people that I'd talk to regularly at school and online, but I never really saw any of them outside school except for a few. I guess I just didn't really think they'd be a friend and I never pursued. The only friends I made in high school that I kept long term are people that did pretty much all of the heavy lifting at the beginning. I would almost never be the first one to say that we should hang out.  
  
And I never really learned how to make friends. I went to a community college after high school and never had any interest in the limited social aspect of it. I went to a big university after a few semesters and completely failed in the social department. I didn't meet a single person that I considered to be a friend. I went to a few study meetups but that's it for social meetings with people from school. Never went to dorm or frat parties (huge regret). I worked in a restaurant off-campus and would drink with my coworkers, almost none of whom were students. I liked my roommates but I knew almost nothing about them. I never knew how to get into that social community at university. I was too nervous to ask anyone to hang out outside class or the dorm room because I was nervous about stuttering and sounding like an idiot.  
  
I only have 2 people that I would consider friends and honestly? They're shit friends. One of them has really horrible drug and alcohol abuse issues and all he ever wants to do is binge drink and watch movies in his basement and the other just never wants to do anything interesting. I love him but besides going to a hockey game in December I can't remember doing anything memorable with him for years. I've brought him to my family's summer place every year for years now and while I'm glad he comes after a while all it ends up being is he and my brother taking every opportunity to get on my nerves and I just want one of them or both to just leave. We used to be so much closer - us three called ourselves ""the dynamo"" and along with their girlfriend's or mine when I had one that was our friend group. I remember my awesome 19th birthday, the barhopping night right before I left for vietnam, the awesome day we spent together right before one of them left on a long trip, us staying up all night and sneaking out until 6 AM in high school, going to the driving range, the bike rides into the forest, the camping trips, going snowboarding, going longboarding around town, all with them. But all of that is so long past and I don't think either of them want to do those anymore. This is different than in high school when I didn't realize that there were people I could've made solid friendships with. At this point there's really nobody I would consider as somebody that I would see on a regular basis recreationally.  
  
There was a point where life was really good. Second year of college I meet this girl at work and she's clearly very into me. After a month of flirting I ask her out and we embark on a 2 year relationship. That relationship flourishes, my friends and I are all still together, I'm going out and making memories, I'm losing weight, I go on a trip to vietnam, my confidence is improving greatly. I fucked that relationship up and I gradually lost contact with my friends and were never really the same with them since. It just sucks looking back and thinking about the time when I had a vibrant social life and real connections with people and comparing it to what little I have now. Now all I really am is an overweight line cook making a shit wage at a restaurant I don't care about with 0 skills or network gained through a 4-year degree with terrible and unresolved social anxiety issues, 0 good, close connections with people outside my family and can't get passed the first date on those frustrating dating apps. It makes me feel like such a loser.  
  
It really sucks because deep down I really think I'm just like everybody else. I have the same interests as tons of other people my age and I'm a nice guy who loves to laugh. I love following sports and going to shows and going out at night just like everybody else but I don't feel apart of any community at all. I know that somewhere there's a version of me that can flourish socially because I've been that before. I'm just so anxious about everything and have such low self-esteem and it's been that way ever since I was a kid and I hate it. I really, really don't like the fact that I'm me. I feel almost embarrassed that other people get to be themselves and I was unlucky enough to be me. I'm not happy with it at all. I really just want to be normal and happy but it seems so far away. I'm 25 now and I'm wondering if I'm just completely screwed, like I fucked up during a critical period of social development and I'll never be the person that I was supposed to be.",2,depression

"My little brother and his friend went into the creek in our backyard and kidnapped a salamander. Now my parents want to let my loud, obnoxious, irresponsible, little brother keep this thing as a pet.

I *tried* telling them to release it, but they won't listen. They've bought a tank and a bunch of other stuff for it already. So I decided that if I can't get them to release it, then I'll do research to make sure it's at least somewhat happy. Well, i try to tell them *anything,* and they won't listen. They refuse to listen to me at all. This has gone on for almost a week now and im so sick and tired of it. Over and over, they say something about it not eating, or not moving much, and I tell them the reason why that's probably happening, and they get angry at me and don't listen to me.

And when I try to help them with anything, they give all the credit to my little brother. I'm pretty much the only one doing research at all, and they just act like I'm stupid. I cry about this poor salamander every single night, because the poor thing is suffering and there is pretty much nothing I can do to help it. I can't freaking stand seeing animals suffering, and my parents know this, and they just get angry when I'm concerned about it. We just kidnapped this poor thing from its home, I want to make sure it's OK, that's all I want to do. 

Not to mention all the other stuff going on in my life that makes me feel worthless, pathetic, and want to kill myself, this doesn't freaking help. I can't even keep a couple of plants alive, plants that are supposed to be *easy* to keep alive.

I hate this so so much, I want to freaking kill myself so freaking badly. I want to free the poor salamander. They won't even feed live food, they're feeding it dried and dead food. They even said it themselves, that this species of salamander is ""endangered"", and they still insist on keeping it. 

They favor my little brother so so much over the rest of me and my siblings, they would never let anyone else take in a salamander or even a bug from the wild and keep it as a pet. 

And the only one who will listen to me about this at all is one of my older brothers. 

I just want to end everything, the only thing keeping me alive is the fact that all my loved ones will be sad.

"Fairly isolated due to the shitty mental health system of California. Currently institutionalized and medicated with haliperidol injection.

I have no idea how much pain I'm causing others, but I am afraid people are having to relive large portions of their lives every time I lie down or sleep, as nonsensical as that sounds. Or that they are restarting their whole day after each word they say to me. 

It's too late for me to find love - I think all I'm supposed to do now is be miserable until I literally run away from this place.

The awkwardness coupled with a lack of any noticeable redeeming qualities means I don't really know what to do with myself. There is no point left to live (if what I'm doing can be called living). What good is it to live with nothing left to give (Coldplay)?

"So I am not the one suffering from schizophrenia, but I am thinking my husband may.  My husband has been having paranoid delusions that have just gotten a lot worse this past year. Years back when we first got together there would be things he would say that would make me think something was going on with him mentally, some examples were that my mom was putting cameras or listening devices in our room, that she put a mic in our air purifier, that my mom was poisoning his food, he is severely disabled and so he had to use a commode in our room and he was adamant that when he would use it that my mom would be against the wall listening to him. Fast forward to the present, we have moved out of state and I thought that it was just because of my mom because she was the only thing that triggered it. Well now it‚Äôs the upstairs neighbors. About 8 months ago he started believing that they were drilling into the ceiling to put cameras in the ceiling, made me check the vents because he wanted to make sure no one put cameras in it, he wants to get rid of the microwave because he‚Äôs thinking there‚Äôs a bug in it. So those neighbors moved out and now a new neighbor moved in and now it‚Äôs this guy who‚Äôs ‚Äúharassing‚Äù us. He says that the upstairs neighbor was following him because he could hear the footsteps wherever he walked. We were praying together the other night and he was sure that he heard the upstairs neighbor laughing at us while we were praying and that he was laughing like his mom. His mom died like 4 years ago or so. So I asked him how would that be possible because she died years back and he just said that they could have seen a video that his ex took of him from like 20 years ago. He‚Äôs also feeling these vibrations that I do not feel at all. He claims that someone is doing it on purpose. 

So I get home from work today and right next to the bed was our 9mm. He has never been violent or anything, but to see it out makes me nervous. I‚Äôm in a tough spot because he says I don‚Äôt fight for him or do more but I‚Äôm not going to call the cops on a neighbor who‚Äôs walking hard. I have no idea what to do. He tells me I‚Äôm not compassionate and all that. I get it because he really believes that this is going on but it‚Äôs not. There a lot more instances but it‚Äôs just too much to write.   I tried in the past the best I could to tell him that I‚Äôm not experiencing what he is and he got upset with me. I feel so lost and I feel bad that I cannot help him. Any advice would be wonderful!

"My paranoia seems to have worsened over the years. My current belief is that a demon is after me and I'm under some curse (to the point where I would rather speak to a priest instead of a psychiatrist about it, to see if anything can be done to remove it from my life).

When someone sends me a friend request, my first thought is ""who is that and why are they after me, what are their intentions?"" Even with a friend I haven't heard from in a while, I'll assume there's some evil agenda they have. I've become distrustful of most people.

In the shower, sometimes I'll imagine that there's a black hole behind me ready to suck me in. I am well aware of the process of spaghettification, so it has become a fear. Some people say black holes are not scary, but uh, being stretched out and sucked into a hole that leads to who knows where definitely is pretty scary to me.

Before I see a horror movie, I check to make sure that it isn't ""cursed"" and that nothing terrible will happen to me from watching it (example: in 2014 me and my ex watched the conjuring, which is considered to be cursed but I didn't know it at the time, and afterwards a bunch of bad things happened in my life).

Oh yeah, and I believe I'm psychic and that everything I worry about will come true or is true.

"Sorry for the long story!

I broke up with my long-term girlfriend around a year ago. Tried to split amicably; we lived together so I had to stay there for almost a month before I could move to a new place (it took a while because I had moved halfway across the country to be with her, and was now moving back of course). She got a bit mean that month at times, but otherwise we were both coping well with the split and managed to live next to each other until I moved out (at least, that's what I thought).

Her parents, however, are a totally different story. Ironically, the had always supported my side in the argument that led to our breakup, but strongly freaked out at me when I decided it was finally too much and broke up with their daughter. Unlike her daughter, they coped very badly and were seemingly much more depressed and angry than either me or my ex.

Then weird things happened in the month I was there. First they suddenly were seemingly friendly to me again (maybe they hoped for reconciliation?) and even invited me for dinner at their house for one last time. After said (unremarkable) dinner they turned semi-hostile again. I later found out that when I was out the whole day to sign the contract for my new apartment (as I said, quite far away), they tried to break in (they had a spare key because they owned the apartment and we were renting it) knowing I was not there. When I later confronted them, they said they only wanted to do so to make a video recording of the whole place and avoid discussions about possible damage due to me moving out later on. They didn't actually manage to do it because I was coming home earlier than expected, and instead had their daughter film everything and send it to them. I actually would have agreed to them just coming over to do so (I understand that they want to protect their property and would take accountability if necessary), but doing all of this behind my back left me feeling deceited. I kept my calm to avoid further conflict, but started growing suspicious obviously.

I should add that these are extremely over-protective people. They‚Äôd literally make the university homework of their daughter while she was out having fun. They'd write mails for her in her name. They‚Äôd text her all the time and would panic if she didn‚Äôt reply within an hour (she‚Äôs almost 30 btw). Stuff like that (I know, should have run away immediately at those red flags).

Then, I got mislead again. In that month we still did grocery shopping together, and my ex told me she wanted to go to the shop close to where her parents live to buy some fish (because it's cheaper there). Said shop was closed when we arrived (no way her parents didn‚Äôt know). But since we were there, she briefly wanted to go to her parents for some other reason I don‚Äôt even remember. When we got there, her parents handed me a contract that they asked me to sign. It stated arrangements for me leaving the apartment (ok, I get that), but also stipulated that it was my decision to break up, that I should be responsible for cancelling mutual accounts, that I‚Äôll be accountable for any damage bla bla. Anyway, I adjusted/scratched some of those ridiculous agreements in there and signed to avoid apartment-related disagreements later on. I mean, I get that something had to be put on paper about the apartment, but her parents making this ‚Äúbreakup form‚Äù for her and all of the other stuff in there was just ridiculous. Oh, I later also found that even after me signing that contract (and leaving a pretty obvious agreement about cancelling/dividing all mutual possessions in there), they called the bank where my ex and I had a mutual account to make sure I wasn't hiding (stealing?) anything...

At that point, my suspicion turned into fear, and I did something I should normally not do to avoid any further surprises being plotted behind my back. My ex has an Apple Watch, we she often leaves at home when she is out working. Knowing that she frequently texts her mother, I started reading those texts on her watch when she was out (only those, didn't want to know what else she was writing to friends etc.). In those texts I learned how they had indeed been scheming together to sneak in when we would both be out and so on. I also learned that despite them acting friendly / concerned about me again, they were secretly cheering in those texts whenever I had some bad fortune coming my way (e.g., when I was having trouble getting the utility companies registered at my new address, when my 76-year old grandmother caught COVID, ...). They'd literally put a heart emoji on those messages, but then the next day her mother would call me to offer her help packing my boxes because ""it's not good for my back"" (I do indeed have back issues from time to time); felt super creepy because I obviously knew by then that all of that expressed concern and friendliness was fake. Of course I had to pretend everything was fine (couldn't let her know I was reading those texts with her mother), but inside I felt sick; especially considering that just a few months ago I went to her mother's place every day for an entire month and worked from there  (I was working from home during COVID) to take care of her because she had broken her shoulder and needed assistance. There are a few other things they lied about (and did) that month, mostly minor/childish things that I just tried to ignore.

Anyway, her mother being a total snake, and my ex at the very least playing along with it, did make it much easier for me to realise breaking up was absolutely the right decision. I was so looking forward to the day I was moving out to finally have these kind of people out of my life for good. Her father, however, is a different story. He got very angry and shouted at me the day we broke up, then pretty much remained completely quiet throughout the entire month. To be honest, I was so focused on the scheming mother that I didn't pay much attention to him. To sketch a picture of the man: he's a rich and highly intelligent doctor, but at the same time also a very isolated, introvert (and honestly, frustrated) person. He has no friends that I know of (as in, during the 4 year relationship with my ex he never met with any friends that I know of) and is very unhappy in his marriage (without going into further detail, there is at the very least frequent verbal abuse between him and his wife; they never divorced ""because of the kids"", my ex even told me herself). His wife also blurted out one time that he was dealing with some sexual frustrations (really didn't need to know that). He suffers from intense paranoia too; he would for instance sometimes leave his cellphone at home when going for a walk (especially during COVID restrictions), because otherwise government authorities could triangulate his cellphone signal and track his position. Perhaps this paranoia was also the reason for the contract, recording my apartment, calling my bank, changing the locks of the apartment the same day I moved out (yes, they did that, despite them being the ones previously plotting to abuse their key to my apartment...). I don't know. I know that, a few months before our breakup, he for instance got a pretty serious letter from the police following a complaint from one of his patients. Really don't know what to think of that now. Other than that, I actually liked him because he was always nice to me (before the breakup), had many interests (art/travelling/cooking/...) and could have a deep conversation with you instead of just chit-chat (once you did get him talking). Again, a very smart person I actually looked up to in some ways. On the other hand, I found it hard to gauge his character for all of the above reasons.

Getting to the point: a few weeks after I had moved out, I started having some weird medical issues. It started with some mild aching pain around my testicles, and without going into too much detail (sorry if TMI already), I suddenly also developed sexual dysfunctions I didn't have before. Now, there is also pain in my foot, making even simple walks uncomfortable. Doctors have no clue what's going on (after multiple MRI/CT screenings of my back and pelvis, blood work and so on). Seems to be some weird inexplicable nerve issues, despite me testing negative for all common causes (diabetes etc.) for such issues. Things are also gradually getting worse, and over the last few months the fact that it's not going away is starting to affect me mentally as well (which of course makes doctors think now that ""it's all in my head""). I started panicking, and researching myself what could be wrong. Similar to the doctors I had consulted with, I couldn't find an answer.

Then, an idea started bothering me: I had just gotten out of the strangest, most suspicious month of my life (with people scheming behind my back, and me probably knowing only half of it through the texts I had read), followed just a few weeks later by the most suspicious medical issues I've ever encountered. What if that's not a coincidence? These people clearly had bad intentions set out for me; what if they went as far as to poison me? They have the means to do so (him being a doctor and having full access to any prescription medication/chemical), the motivation (knowing what they had already done ...), potentially the history (the suspicious police letter a few months earlier), their totally weird/suspicious behaviour, and honestly they also have the social isolation and mental instability necessary to be capable of doing such things. Continuing my research, there are indeed drugs/chemicals causing symptoms such as mine that are extremely long acting (sometimes persistent for years) and can be administered both orally (and I had dinner there after our breakup) or topically (they had access to my apartment, and could have put it into any of my bathroom products). I have since thrown out everything (shampoos, douche gels, toothpaste, hair products, perfumes, olive oil, ...) I had taken with me when I moved out there.

Initially. this idea seemed way too unlikely to me; but honestly, as months have gone by without any other explanation, and as I really can't judge these people properly (and I can't just ask them; I know they are excellent liars and I have been fooled by them before!), I am starting to consider it more and more as a possibility, and lately even reality. It's making me so scared that I even contacted a toxicologist for an extensive blood screening (which costed me quite a bit), but they couldn't really help me out (as it may no longer be detectable in my blood). For the last two months I have been having constant nightmares about these people (not my ex even, just her parents!) and what they might have done to me. I wake up in panic, sweating, heart racing and not knowing what to do. It seems impossible to ever know what really happened, and I just fail to rationalise that this could not have happened.  I'm started to have panic attacks throughout the day. I'm truly \*constantly\* thinking about this, making me basically unable to enjoy anything anymore. I fear that I'll never get a full answer, while at the same time living like this in a constant state of anxiety is unbearable and driving me to some dark thoughts ... and it's not getting any better as time goes by, that's clear. Never had any mental issues before. I'm hesitant to seek psychological help, because that would only help calm me down about my fears, until they get me to believe this didn't happen, hence fooling me twice in the case it really did happen (a possibility that can't be excluded)!

Again, sorry for the long wall of text. Even if nobody reads this, I hope writing all of it down for once will help me cope a bit better.",5,paranoia

"I can't even tell anymore.

I can't bear to shower, and only do it every 6-8 weeks (occasionally it might be 4 weeks). I wash my hair that often too.

I cannot deal with doing chores or housework. I last did a load of laundry in June 2021. Seriously.
I don't go out anywhere much and I have way too many clothes so I still have clean clothes to wear when I go out.

Around the house, I wear the same comfy clothes for months on end. I just don't care.

I only change my bed sheets every 6 months. I cannot believe people do this every week. I cannot cope with that.

I never eat in the day as I've had no appetite since 2017. I never feel hungry. I never feel empty. My stomach never rumbles or gurgles. I feel like it doesn't even exist.

I sleep all day and feel RIDICULOUSLY stressed and nauseated with anxiety if I have to get up before 1pm.

I stay up until about 4am as after 11pm is the only time I get to be alone and have quiet time to sort of relax.

I have major anhedonia and feel no pleasure, enjoyment or interest in anything I'm NOT addicted to. I sleep to avoid the chronic boredom and emptiness. And constant sense of dread and impending doom.

I brush my teeth, but I haven't gone to the dentist since 2016 and partly due to gum disease and also jaw clenching in my sleep, 4 of my teeth are loose. I can't eat properly when I do eat, but I just can't care enough (or afford) to go to the dentist to get these teeth either removed or somehow fixed.

I have not done any housework since 2018. I have a cleaner who comes every 2 weeks.

I pick at my skin. The skin around my fingernails has been wrecked since I was 4 or 5 years old. I've picked at my scalp since age 8, my top lip is ruined and I began picking that since age 15. I also began picking at both my inner ears at age 38.

I started self harming at 17 and still do it. I hate myself. I feel ugly and I repulse myself.

I never had any career ambitions or anything I wanted to do. Nothing has ever given me a sense of achievement, accomplishment, pride, fulfilment or satisfaction. At all. Ever. I don't even know what that feels like.

I have no friends apart from old friends who live in a different state and I haven't seen in over 3 years. I have no local friends, and nor do I particularly want to. I don't have the interest or energy.

A few times a week I wonder how I would kill myself. I can't do it because I won't do that to my parents, but otherwise, I honestly don't know.

I have been like this consistently for years. Some symptoms have been 4-6 years. Others 40 years. Most about 10 years.

I've been on 8 different antidepressants over the last 10 years, a mood stabiliser, an antipsychotic, a stimulant, and various benzos. Nothing has helped, except for the benzos.

"Hi! I made a post about it yesterday but I deleted it because of my anxiety.


So, I'm 19 [F] and the day before yesterday I saw someone on the train taking pictures of me (at least that's what it looked like -i wasn't wearing something weird or have dyed hair or piercings or anything like that) and now I'm extremely paranoid that people are watching and following me waiting for the right moment to kidnap me. Im already scared that people are stalking my house and will try to break in and now I'm even more afraid something bad will happen to me.


 The thing is, everytime I try to calm myself down I think that I am just being extremely observant or that the universe is sending me messages so that I can be ready when the right time comes. Basically it tries to protect me by making me paranoid and scared all the time. I know this probably sounds kind of crazy but I can't stop thinking that way.


I'm seeing a psychiatrist and I've been taking antipsychotics for some months now (I currently take 3 kinds of antipsychotics every day) but that doesn't seem to help me at all. How can I stop this madness? I can't live like that. I'm so tired. Do my thought make any sense? What did the person who took photos of me want? I think I'm going insane. I can't leave the house alone and I can't stay home alone either bc I feel that someone will break in and kidnap me. Does someone have any advice or have been in a similar place before? I would rather stay in a mental hospital than having to live with this fear. I'm even scared of posting this because I think that people are watching my phone too.",5,paranoia

"Hi, I‚Äôm Tuesday, and I want to give up.

I‚Äôve been on antidepressants for the last 10 years, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve *ever* worked. To the point that, at the end of 2021, I stopped taking them. In 2022, I nearly punched my ticket, so, oops, Tuesday has to be back on drugs again. I‚Äôm physically repulsed by the idea of being on these pills for the rest of my life, so I‚Äôve been trying to be better to get off of them. And I was doing okay‚Ä¶

But then I crashed, a week before my doctor‚Äôs appointment. I reiterated to her that I hate the pills, I don‚Äôt want to be on them, they don‚Äôt work. Her response was to increase the dose and brush my feelings under the rug. When I told her I doubt it would help because I feel I have ADHD, making actually taking medications difficult, she said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be that.‚Äù

Since then I‚Äôve been spiraling down. It feels like every direction a new punch comes my way, and I‚Äôm just defeated. I‚Äôm trying so hard to feel anything other than ‚ÄúI want to die,‚Äù but it‚Äôs fucking pointless. Why even try to do anything if you end up back at square one to begin with?

"I (41nb) know this post isn't specifically autism related, but it's all about some heavy stuff I've been dealing with for the last two months as an autistic person. I've been struggling to process because it's so overwhelming and I'm looking for support/a place to vent these feelings. 


I'll give some brief background. My birth giver (73f) kidnapped me before I was even born. I found out about this from a series of guilty confessions she made to me as a child. She only told me initially that my father was a different man from my older siblings because her husband wanted to take us to his affair partner's home. Birth giver told me ""the truth"" to spite him. I was 3 or 4. That wasn't the first or last time she used me to hurt him. 


It took several years and several lies to get some semblance of the truth out of her. Meanwhile, I was treated like a pet while I was small, but I was also being abused by an older sibling. The older I got, the more I was mistreated by my birth giver, my half siblings, and her husband. I was denied medical treatment, education, and therapy. I was forced into isolation from the ages of 10-14. Everything in my life had to revolve around church and God or I was punished. 


I always wanted to find my bio father, but I was hesitant. Birth giver told me things about him and heavily implied that she thought I was better off with her than with the man she had agreed to be a surrogate to (she says she needed cash, but that doesn't really make sense given the context. Unfortunately I can't share those details as they make me too identifiable). She always framed her decision to keep me as if it was up to her alone. It was only recently that someone pointed out to me that what she'd done was considered kidnapping. That realization really messed my head up and I'm still trying to process the fallout from it. 


I cut contact with everyone from Birth givers side years ago because I was tired of being their scape goat. Recently, I finally got the courage to order a DNA kit and it got processed so much quicker than the company said. Once the results came in, I was able to track my bio father down through a cousin. All I ever really knew was his name and the state he lived in. But that was enough. It took time to finally get in touch with him, but this week we started talking for the very first time. 


He's eccentric, but he's been nothing but honest with me about himself so far as I can tell. I've asked him if he would share what he remembers of my conception, and it isn't much, but it seems to confirm that my birth giver set out to purposely  get pregnant and may have had 0 intentions of letting (me) that child go. I've always suspected I was her revenge baby, a child she weaponized, and I thought I had come to terms with that, but I guess I haven't. Maybe because there was always a small chance I could have been wrong before. 


On top of that, despite having a few very supportive people who I've confided in about this situation, some of them have told me things like: ""you'll always love your mother, she raised you."" and I feel like they can't possibly understand what it feels like to know your own mother only had you to hurt someone. Something broke inside of me and I don't feel any love for my birth giver at all anymore. It's scary and it hurts so bad, but its also a relief to finally have that emotional tie broken.


Ultimately, I am glad to finally know my bio father, I have zero regrets about finding him. But...this hurts so much more than I've let on. I'm absolutely devastated. My whole life was a lie. My ""family"" just used me to make themselves feel better. It's so much to process and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to fully come to terms with this. 


I feel so alone right now. My irl supports have all been very kind, but no one understands what I'm going through (they've all said that) and I hate that I feel like this. I made a post about my struggles with this situation in another sub, one for abuse survivors, but it got completely ignored. That's really set off my rejection sensitivity, so I deleted that last post and decided that maybe this sub will be a little more responsive? I don't know, I just feel lost and sad right now. Any advice is appreciated, but not necessary. I'm really just looking for support.

"I have. In animation class in my second last year of school, we were watching all these environmental animations made my previous students, and I give them all credit for having good intentions, but one of them was WAY too anti-steam train for my liking. And yes, steam trains typically use coal, but they're rare in present day and, from my understanding, most coal pollution now comes from places like factories and power plants. Go after present-day fossil fuel pollution, not my number one childhood interest, please!

The first train in the video was a photo they'd found online and, instead of white steam, it was emitting black smoke. Believe it or not, it got even worse during a stop motion bit with wooden toy trains. Duke from Thomas made a cameo, and James the Red Engine‚Äôs tender was used as one of the wagons when he wasn‚Äôt even there. This might sound okay, but not when you realise the landscape turned desolate halfway through the train's journey, making me feel even more like my love for the environment meant nothing if I liked steam trains too.

I suffered abuse growing up and also have a history of partners leaving after the month or two month mark (because they got back into the dating scene too quickly or other rubbish like that; after showing me houses they wanted to buy with me or kitchens they liked. Yes I know, that was a red flag. Them moving so quickly like that. I should have known they'd do a 360)

I've also moved lots and never had any long lasting friendships till recently, the last set of friends I had to cut out due to them disrespecting me. I have a group of friends at the moment, no worry there.

I'm paranoid that my current partner will leave me, even though she's been finding it tough lately as have I. I've got no reason to suspect her. It's just my bl00dy brain being stupid. How do you cope with thoughts like this one? It's making me so sad. I just texted my partner about it but don't think she'll reply. any time soon (I expect she'll be back in 2+ hours?).

"My brother came home from work today covered in blood and tears. I asked him what happened and he told me he got jumped on his way home from work. My poor brother was so scared he wasn't able to tell me who did this to him. He ended up blacking out and I then had to call 911. He is in the ER now with a ton of trauma induced injuries. I'm just so angry rn. I may never let him walk anywhere by himself again. Not to punish him but for his safety I don't want people hurting him. Ugh I just can't freaking stand people anymore.

"hey everyone, so I have been depressed ever since I can remember. I have extreme fatigue. I remember as a teenager I would just feel so tired and I would feel very guilty. recently, I went through a phase in which I was extremely suicidal, and my fatigue was just very bad. I was also working the night shift which made my fatigue even worse. Now I am trying to do more things during my days just so I am not in bed all the time . however, it is extremely rough. For example today, I took a walk with my mom in the morning, I did some laundry, and I went to target & ulta. Right as I was getting home, I couldn't take the exhaustion anymore. I had to lay Down for a little bit. my mom was in the kitchen cooking and I felt bad for her because she's doing all the work by herself. I wish I had the energy to help her around in the kitchen. I asked her if it was OK if I rest a little bit, and she said yes. Regardless, I still feel pretty guilty about not helping her out. later on today I have to go to therapy and a friend is coming over because I need to give her her birthday gift. this is a very busy day and I'm just exhausted. i have to be in bed by 9pm bc I work tomorrow early in the morning. I also wanted to review some work stuff. I mean it's good that im busy because I don't think about negative stuff but I'm just very exhausted. I have come a long way though because two months ago I couldn't even get out of bed and my mom would have to do my laundry. I feel so bad for putting my mom through this, so I helped by buying the detergent & softener for the clothes. I also bought groceries and pay for food. it's just I don't know how to stop feeling guilty when my body starts getting tired. I admired my mom for working so hard & understanding my depression. any tips.",2,depression

For example, I imagine killing someone. My brain thinks I actually did it in real life.

According to my fucked up mind, I got arrested for all my crimes and got released from prison, and now the police are after me again because of something I did.

I'm really scared that they'll just come to my house one day.
They're probably writing a report about me or something right now.

or what if I randomly come across a police officer,  and they read my mind. They'll hear what I'm thinking about and then arrest me instantly.

"I (24F) called my mom (50F) today since it's mother's day, and at one point the conversation turned to talking about whether or not I was still taking ""the medicine"" as my parents call it. They don't outright acknowledge that it's adhd medication for my adhd, which I've been taking less than a year.


I told them no, since I'm on break from school, and they asked how i felt without it. I told them that I felt like my brain was always fuzzy feeling without it. My dad said that ""that's just because yiur brain got used to taking it and it likes it"". My mom then said ""I think you should get evaluated by a specialist, maybe they misdiagnosed you.""


For reference, i went through my university's accessibility center and talked to a specialist there and also a doctor at the student health center, and did all the interviews, questionnaires and such for the dx process. It's not like i just went to google and did a five minute ""do i have adhd quiz"".


Everytime my parents bring up adhd, they never mention it by name, as if acknowledging makes it something demonic or something. It's always ""are you still taking ""the medicine"".""


You would think that my parents would be happy that I've been doing better in school since starting meds and therapy, and that several of the issues I have had in the past 10 years or so have been able to be managed as a result of managing previously undiagnosed adhd.


Instead I'm being told that it's not real and that it's all in my head abd that I'm doing this for attention.


I'm not very open about my adhd, but a few of my friends here at uni have said that they noticed a positive change between me now and me last year, and i feel so much better than then.
I'm at the happiest I've been in a long time, and a big part of that has been learning how to manage adhd. I don't want to go through the emotions of the past several years again. 


It just hurts so much that the two people whonare supposed to care about me the most are being so dismissive of something that had unknowingly been causing so many problems for so long, and now that I'm learning to take care of myself, it's like they don't care.


I know I'm an adult, and that others opinion's shouldn't matter, but it really hurts when it comes from your own parents. I try so hard to do well in school and at work, but it feels like nothing is good enough for them.


It feels stupid to be crying over this but it just hurts so much when I can't go to my own parents about these issues because I'll just get told to get over myself.",3,adhd

I took the breakup really hard and said some things I deeply regret. I haven't heard from her since March and I'm afraid she'll be mad if I try to talk to her again.

"Alright, recently Parler was kicked off of the google play store and I believe the Apple App Store, as well as Amazon's store.

This is the second time I score high at a test for paranoia. But I dont think im like really paranoid. I think its just because of trauma? And like a symptom of ptsd but not like full blown paranoia and it makes me scared ppl think I do have it. What do you think?

Why does she think I am paranoid/ May be psychotic
Is because I think ppl are talking about me when I sit in my garden. I know its probably not true but its real to me at that moment and I will go inside because of the fear and anger.
When I am outside and walk along houses I feel like I am on a catwalk of shame. Like everybody thinks I suck ( i always have had the thoughts of ppl disliking me but not to this extend, this has been going on for 2 years or something)
I get anxiety when walking by ppl because the May think I am ugly or crazy or whatever.. or they will judge me on how I walk because if my physical problems.
I sometimes see mouses when I have insomnia or hear people talking but that's just because of the lack of sleep.
I think my friends secretly hate me, like im some kind of punishment to them that they have to entertain.
I can't relax when im in lot of physical pain in my house cause im afraid someone will find me lazy 
I haven't told my therapists but I also have this thing when ppl go down stairs I see them falling and crying and hurt in my mind

But a lot of it is trauma related I guess.. and I think its more anxiety/ptsd than paranoia/ psychoses? But it makes me afraid.  I do have most of theese symptoms for over 2 years. So it can be psychoses cause that doesn't last so long I guess?
And when I was younger I used to see and hear ppl.. thought I could hear ghosts. So there was probably always something like that in my system.",5,paranoia

"Sometimes you just need to get it out of your head and into the world. That's all this post is..
(I don't have these 24/7, but these are the thoughts that fill my brain and really freak me out on bad days.)

My Delusions and Paranoid Thoughts:

- I live in a time loop that has happened over and over again. My life has already happened and I have lived through most moments multiple times already. Each time is slightly different but mostly very similar. 
- Scientists are studying my ideas and actions for research on individuals with non neurotypical brains. My entire life is a lie.
- There are cameras outside my window. Or someone can see through it eventhough the blinds are down. (Sometimes I have to put a sheet over the window to feel better)
- I can empathize with my cats and read their emotions.
- The love of my life is only pretending to love me. It's all a science experiment, or maybe a big joke. Maybe its televised to thousands of people. Maybe the entire thing is a rouse. They don't trust me enough to really love me.
- This life is not real. It's all a dream. Or in my head. I will wake up some day in a mental ward and that's when I'll really have lost my mind.
- People in my daily life are part of an elaborate scam. Not all of them, but some. So you can never fully trust anyone.
- There is a seperate personality living inside my body. Silent and always observing. 
- If I did something crazy enough (like spontaneously go skydiving) then I could break the system I'm stuck inside and  get my free will back.
- My inner thoughts speak to me while I'm drifting off to sleep, but I'm to close minded to hear them.
- If I get high enough someday (on weed, shrooms, acid, or what have you) My personality will fully split and I will be two seperate people. One good and one bad.
- My body speaks to me. (In a phantom way) 
- The art I make gets analyzed by professionals and archived to be used in treating patients with mental disorders.
- My controlling parents have trapped me in their own fake world. Where I believe I have freedom, but it's all in their control.
- The choices I make are pre determined. I can only have so many options.
- People (Managers) at work watch me while I'm on the job. They have to make sure I'm on task.
- I've read all the books in my personal library (I haven't), so what's the point in reading them again if I'm only being studied.
- The tv shows I watch are all directed towards me. They all have a different message to convey. Whether it's about my life, my relationships, my mental health, the fact that I think the tv is narrating my fucking life. (Same with the radio) They are always trying to help though, so it doesn't bother me too much.
- I get baited to watch the same shows over and over again (with gaps in between) to see how I react to them. That data is given to people who analyze my personality. 
- The manifestation of my childhood dragon friend lives in the spirit world and sleeps in the tree next to my old college dorm room. (This one's real interesting).
- My partner brings up the same conversations to see how I react (Similar to the tv shows)
- If I don't double check the door at night to make sure its locked someone will come in and murder my partner. There would be nothing I could do about it.
- If I tell my partner all these intrusive thoughts, they will be terrified and send me to shock therapy.
- Certain tasks in my life have been constructed to measure my strength and endurance. (This makes me work extra hard for no reason)


I might make a part 2 later bc this isn't all of them. It's making me emotional to wrote them down. It's good to get it all out though.

"Sorry for the long post
I try to summarize it as hard as it really is for me. 
I have always had a bad relationship with my parents, especially with my mother where since she tended to be very rude because I am the son she never wanted as I was already the 3 'and during pregnancy my father who was an alcoholic at the time beat her so this has already marked (as if I were at fault) being labeled as the unwanted child, the black sheep etc. ...
Being strong in character since I was 4-5 years old when I saw my mother's verbal abuse towards me I (wrongly eh) raised my hands to my mother. Of course how much physical strength could I have at that age? Almost nothing. And after several times that this happened my mother tried to kill me by grabbing me by the hair and making me hit my head on the sink several times. As luck would have it, my older brother saved me.
The abuse from my mother after this event never subsided. But I simply learned to ignore her and keep it all inside (at most telling my father if it was really bad).
The verbal abuse growing up became comparisons to my brother, how he was, better looking, better behaved, more independent etc.... Taking me to make me hate him when I had no envy towards him, on the contrary, I have only good memories.
All this has carried obviously to other consequences, between closing me, distrust in the persons etc... So much so that then I suffered bullying and so on. I have always been happy in my ""loneliness"" because after elementary school I discovered video games (obviously also targeted by my mother). My whole childhood was like this: always fighting with my mother, one day she is the best person in the world, the next day she criticizes anything I do.
After middle school it was always a grow up until I had dozens of friends in high school and up to two groups where I was always among the most loved by the group.
In 5 'high finally I get engaged but after a fight with my girlfriend I get my first panic attack that affects everything I love, questioning everything (and if she does not love you, and if you are actually in the various groups of friends to be teased and if you have always hated even video games etc. ...)
After this event the end. After being the one who listened to his friends for years, he asks for advice for the first time and by doing so everyone looks at me wrong as if I were crazy. The question was just a confirmation of what I was thinking to push away the anxieties (i.e. asked them if it was just stuff in my head or something else). I get looked at sideways and almost made fun of by everyone and no one knows what to tell me. Some people almost forcibly tell me it's like I say, my girlfriend gets mad at me for doubting myself and takes it personally like I don't really love her.
I don't trust my friends anymore and I'm gradually closing my bridges with everyone, even those who used to agree with me (because I wasn't convinced by their answers).
After two years I ask my mother for help now exhausted and my mother every time I bring up something from the past, even if something stupid says that either it's different or it didn't happen at all. For example a few days ago I scold her saying that she is a superficial person who every time she can says if a certain person is fat or has gained weight. And after pointing it out to her she says ""but if you do it all the time too"", I tell her I never did it and she looks at me all weird asking me and: ""and how many times have you done it, few, many, medium"" as if to humor me because she is afraid of her crazy son. 


I have only talked about it with her, my father and my aunt, and a couple of my close friends. One of my friends gave me all his support one day by believing me and reassuring me and the next day he acted almost as if we had never talked about it. My mother acts this way.
A friend of mine also understood me completely but I'm afraid the same thing will happen as with my old friend.
The only ones who continue to always behave are my father and my aunt. 
I don't know what to believe anymore, what if these three people who agree with me are just in my head? 
I really want to understand if it's my mom manipulating me so much and it's my anxiety that overeacts or something else
Until a while ago I was more confident but then one day arguing with my mother she said I always had very few friends. It really makes me doubt everything....",5,paranoia

"If you are unaware, there are multiple clips of Shaun circling around online, mainly of scenes of him experiencing meltdowns. These clips are posted with the intent of completely mocking the character, or to be used as an example of ""how not to write an autistic character"".  


I have also seen posts of this nature in this subreddit before, but from a more ""critical"" perspective, basically claiming how Shaun's autism is offensive/unrealistic/horrible representation.  


Yes, it is a doctor show. Yes, there are elements of the show that may be dramatized or ""cringey"". Yes, it is not going to be a 1:1 representation of the real world or whatever.  


But please, please consider before you make fun of this character, remember that MANY autistic people are ACTUALLY like him, or experience things similar to how it is depicted in the show. You can find plenty of people in this subreddit who really relate to this character, and autistic people are coming forward about how this trend is making them feel extremely alienated and disgusted with themselves. 

I know people are going to say ""but non-white-male autism is poorly represented"". Does the media/system favor white males? Yes. Is there a systematic prejudice against women and POC? Of course there is. But autism is autism, and you don't have to be white or male to relate to this character from an autistic perspective. You do not have to be white or male to have uncontrollable meltdowns with speech loops, or to talk the way he talks, or have the social style that he has. Just because he is is a white male does not mean that his autistic traits are made up out of thin air. So when you're claiming that his meltdowns are ""clownish"" and ""a mockery of autistic people"", what does that imply about the people who actually have meltdowns like that? Sure, we could use more diverse representation. But how does that logically condone the bullying of this character? How does that condone saying that his (very autistic) traits are not autistic?   


If you don't relate to him, that's fine. If you don't like the show, that's fine. But please do not mock him simply because you don't relate to him. I don't even really like the show. We need to remember that this is a spectrum condition and there will be people who present differently than you. That does not make you any less autistic, and it doesn't make Shaun's traits any less autistic, it just means you are different people with different symptoms and needs. We are alienating a part of our community by engaging in this bullying of traits. Thank you for coming to my TED talk lmfao.",1,autism

"So I have a friend who is presenting symptoms of extreme paranoia. She thinks her phones are bugged and is constantly getting burner phones. She came over to my house and could only talk to me outside because she couldn‚Äôt trust cars or houses for fear of them being bugged. She thinks her neighbor is a long lost family member that is plotting with her family to kill her. She recently abandoned her apartment and is wondering around homeless because she‚Äôs sure her family is out to get her. I have asked her to seek help in the past for possible depression but she was unwilling. She just recently confessed her delusions to me after dropping off some of her favorite movies for me to keep safe in case her place was set on fire by her family and I again told her to seek help, but she has since been changing locations. I had no idea she was paranoid and I don‚Äôt know how to help, especially since she is now willingly homeless and constantly moving locations. I‚Äôm really worried about her and would like some advice on how I should proceed and talk to her once I see her again. I should add that when I talked to her she was able to admit that it could just be paranoia and that she was also suffering from derealization and she even stopped smoking for that reason but also it worsened after she stopped smoking. 

Please advice!! Thank you!",5,paranoia

"Hey everyone,

I'm feeling quite lost and anxious right now, and I'm hoping to get some guidance from you all. Recently, I've been hit with panic attacks for the first time in my life, and it's been a real shock to me. I've always been a calm person, so this is completely new territory for me. During the first attack, I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack and ended up calling 911. They helped calm me down, but I'm still shaken.

The panic attacks seemingly comes out of nothing, during the first one I was alone in my bed and during the last one I was enjoying myself at a barbecue with friends. 

I want to regain control of my mental health and minimize the impact of these panic attacks as much as possible. Can you help me with a few questions?

What are some initial steps I can take to manage and reduce the frequency of panic attacks?
If you've been through something similar, what self-help techniques or coping strategies have worked for you personally?
Should I seek professional help? If so, what type of healthcare provider should I reach out to?
I would really appreciate any advice, experiences, or suggestions you can share. This is all new to me, and I'm open to any recommendations. Thanks in advance for your help!",4,anxiety

"first of all, I hope this is the right sub reddit to post this

I have thought about me might having depression for quite a while now. Lately it has been such a string feeling, that I've considered seeing a doctor, reading about experiences from others and taking those quizzes on Google.

I know they don't replace a doctor I can talk to and sometimes I had to pick answers which aren't particularly true because they were kinda in the middle, if that makes sense. I've taken about 10 quizzes and they all said either I could have low or moderate depression.

The reason why I'm thinking about it is because I've felt this void inside of me I never could fill, I have no energy to do basic daily things, like cooking, vacuuming or buying groceries. I'm living with my mom and only clean up when she cones home from her boyfriend who live about an hour away, if I don't have anything to cook or whatever I can always visit my dad so that's a good thing ig. 
Anyway, I also have always felt like I don't belong, or that I feel home nowhere. No matter where I moved I never felt like home. 

One of the questions in the quizzes was if I enjoy things less then I used too and I like doing many thing, like playing bass guitar, doing vocals or drawing and playing games. But literally the only thing I'm motivated to do is either sleeping, playing games or sometimes drawing.

I feel like I have depression not severe depression, I've never even thought about harming myself or commuting suicide or anything but just all of the things above make me wonder if I have depression.

I really wanna see a doctor about this but I also really wanna try getting better without meds. 

I'm just wondering if anybody has the same experience or what are your experience? Is there a chance to treat depressions without meds?",2,depression

it's getting so bad that I'm starting to see things moving in the sides of my vision, feel things crawling on me, and having almost daily panic attacks // my mother has paranoid schizophrenia as well as a few other mental health issues, and according to her, I'm showing the same signs that she did at my age ( early 20s )

"Before age 23, I never struggled with anxiety. And then I started my first real job and was absolutely crippled by it out of nowhere. That was July 2021. I talked to my doctor, got prescribed SSRI meds, had an AWFUL adjustment period of mood swings and at least one panic attack for 2 weeks, and then on day 14, boom. Anxiety gone. What a bizarre little pill. Stayed on them for a month or two longer, got used to my job, tapered off, and I was good. 

Well now my anxiety is back again and it feels distinctly different. I used this herbal supplement called kratom for a long time. It‚Äôs a powder made from a leaf from a tree that grows in southeast asia. It‚Äôs completely unregulated even though it‚Äôs pretty much an opiate. It heightens your mood, kills pain and makes you feel motivated and happy for an hour or two. It does this by reacting with your opioid receptors. So it makes sense to say it‚Äôs as physically addictive as painkillers. 

I took one 5 gram dose of it once a day. For about three years straight. I thought I wasn‚Äôt developing dependency because I was taking so little, only once a day. 

Well I decided to stop taking it a month ago and now I have anxiety, but it‚Äôs not the same as before. It‚Äôs like my base level of anxiety is slightly heightened, and it only becomes really bad if I use marijuana, nicotine, drink coffee, or eat too much sugar. When I‚Äôm dehydrated I feel it too. None of these things ever used to make my heart pound and give me that tight feeling in my chest. And sometimes it feels like I‚Äôll get a wave of anxiety for no reason.

There is a subreddit for quitting kratom but I feel out of place there. Everyone there was using 10, 20, 30, 40 grams of kratom a day, dosing throughout the day. When THEY quit, they get cold sweats, restless lags, GI issues, brain fog, depression, it‚Äôs like quitting heroin, and a lot of them also report anxiety symptoms, and these same sensitivities to THC, caffeine, nicotine and sugar that I‚Äôm feeling. 

So I‚Äôm hoping this is just my brain‚Äôs reaction to not getting that hit of Euphoria for 1/2 hours once a day, and this is temporary. Today is day 26 without kratom. Never taking that stuff again. But I thought I‚Äôd be feeling a little better by now. Every day is pretty bad. No signs of improvement. But other kratom addicts have said it can take two or three or six months to feel like your normal self again. For some it can take a year or more, but that seems to be very severe kratom addicts. 

I started the SSRI meds that fixed me up last time. First day of taking them was yeaterday. I do NOT feel good on them. It‚Äôs going to be another BAD 2 weeks. But fingers crossed that I have the same experience with them and they just suddenly cure me like last time. I just have a bad feeling it‚Äôs not going to be so easy this time.",4,anxiety

Now I've been sober for 1month, but isolating from social apps was a decision that had to be made, so I usually don't go outside unless necessary, and the only people I socialize with are my parents, and a couple of friends like once a week.

I know it's a process, a very long process, but it's inevitable to feel pathetic, alone, miserable. I don't have a job because of agoraphobia, and a lot of mood swings. My friends are busy with their life and also dealing their own wars. To cope with all this, I've been taking antidepressives, mood stabilizers, and Clonazepam for panic attacks.

"venting and vaguely looking for reassurance

I got my car towed and left at a shop and both the tow company and shop have shining reviews but when I got back into my car at the shop, I noticed my cup.holder lid was shut. I did not shut it. that's where my quarters were. they left 50 cents. it didn't hit til now. I don't really care about losing like $3 and maybe the person who took it needed it badly but my car was full of stuff and now I'm super fucking anxious and paranoid realizing they did indeed take my quarters and I'm home now and it's been a while since I noticed like it was yesterday that I saw that. and now I can't help wondering if they took other stuff. but as far as I know taking change out of people's cars is just something lots of car people do as sort of a self-tip so whatever, and also when we cleared out most of the car it didn't look like anything was missing. but there was so much stuff in there and now I'm super paranoid that they took something important to me and I'm not gonna remember until way later and I'm just so upset and so nervous like what if they're taking more shit rn. I think it was probably the tow guy though because he was the only guy who was alone and the shop was closed when he dropped it off and I think that'd make the most sense and I had the least interaction with him. I'd think that a high rated shop would not risk that or a person working with multiple other employees would not risk getting fired if they got caught. So I think it was the tow guy. I know nobody was there but this is the paranoia board so, do you guys think they took anything else.?????? did they???! do you think they took anything ?? I didn't notice anything missing but I really freaking wonder???? also no I am not entirely insane or having an episode I'm just being entirely transparent in my paranoid thoughts just to get it out bc I'm so distraught.

"Throwaway account first of all. I don't usually make posts. I think I'm just looking for some semblance of connection with someone. I'm a father and husband. My wife and I have been together for over 5 years, got married and had a kid. I have a decent job in my field that I studied for in school. Wife works as well but has no education, so her options are limited. I make more than twice what she does, but even with both incomes, money is tight. I stress a lot, and when I do it also stresses her out and makes her feel like she isn't doing enough. 

In my younger years I was very openly angry, meaning I had a temper and would be rude and nasty. Which is ironic. Because these days, I'm very controlled in how I handle my anger. In fact, I'm so good at controlling them, I've also learned that it's best that I stow most negative emotions deep within so she won't know that I'm stressed, down, and frankly, depressed. She notices at times that there may be something off, but these days I just tell her that I'm okay and we're okay and that everything is good. I keep daily life going and make sure all is taken care of. Our kid, daily duties, etc. 

I think that my negative emotions, even though they're calmly expressed, they tend to end up in an argument. I think I expected my life to be less stressful at this point. I'd have a house, enough money to save, that in the event that I died, my family would be okay. Of course there's so much more to all this, but I'm frankly tired of everything to the point that's it's hard to fully explain. I'm just exhausted. It's tired of pretending. 

Today, I finally took it upon myself to look for a psychologist. I got a call that the one that I had chosen wasn't even accepting patients. So back to the drawing board on that one. I'm finding myself less and less interested in home life. Work feels like the only escape I have, and I get burnt out with that too after a while. Please tell me I'm not alone in this and that you too have felt this way. I have no clue how else to tackle this. I feel like I'm suffocating and no hears me.",2,depression

Currently on the second full day of constant anxiety and I can‚Äôt take it much longer!! It started after me and my flatmates hosted a small Eurovision party + bbq at our house, it was 7 people altogether and I had an amazing time. At the end I started to get really tired, partially from the alcohol but also socialising for 6+ hours. When me and my boyfriend got to my room I felt nauseous and threw up, since then I‚Äôve been extremely anxious. I woke up in the middle of the night with my heart racing and my brain telling me really horrible things about my relationship, I ended up doing breading exercises with my bf and ranting to him about how insecure I am in our relationship. Since then I‚Äôve just had a tight chest (not in the heart attack sort of way), a sense of fear, and random bouts of crying CONSTANTLY for the past two days. I‚Äôve tried to brush it off as a period mood swing sort of thing but this has never happened before. I feel absolutely horrible and the anxiety is constant.

Now I'm filled with the fear that these people will try to look me up years in the future, harass me, post malicious content online that could be looked up by my employers, try to contact my family members, etc. I considered them friends, and I don't think they harbor any ill will toward me. One of them definitely didn't like me, but they were extremely non-confrontational and avoided any difficult conversations, so I don't think they would try to do anything.

"Hello.. It‚Äôs my first time using this app to ask for advice because I seriously do not know what to do. I‚Äôm a sister (20) who has a little sister (16). My little sister is diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder and was doing therapy session and taking antidepressants. She was doing so well for 2 months after she decided to stop her medication. She stopped it without consulting her therapist. I didn‚Äôt realise this until she started withdrawing heavily from it.
She is currently feeling really sad and having mood swings. The thing that triggers her withdrawal symptoms is her being at school.

These past few weeks, she had a difficulty waking up to go to school and my mother gets mad at this. She wouldn‚Äôt wake up when my mom is trying to wake her up. She would groan and doesn‚Äôt get up. My mom (58) gets pissed because she cares about my sister‚Äôs education and feels like she would fail as a mother if she doesn‚Äôt have her daughter continue school.
My mother is also diagnosed with depression but takes her medication
however, I don‚Äôt think she understands what my sister is going through and can say things that I‚Äôm sure she doesn‚Äôt mean to.

I‚Äôm honestly really scared on what my sister is going to do.

She used to self-harm too but now she is doing it again..
she is also having suicidal thoughts and I‚Äôm worried she might take action.

What can I do to make her feel better but still proceed to going to school 
I know that it‚Äôs best for someone who has depression and having withdrawals to stay at home and heal better
but it is also an issue if she falls behind in her classes 
The school doesn‚Äôt seem to care either about it. I live in the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and mental health is not cared about in high school.
So I genuinely do not know what to do.

The plan so far is that she is booked again to see her therapist but it is next week and idk what i should at the moment.

I got sent to the mental hospital because I sent a friend my goodbye message, and I was planing on committing suicide by overdosing on all of the pills I find in my house when school ends. Getting sent to the mental hospital made me feel like I was being punished for wanting to die. I am so fed up with life. Getting sent there made me feel worse. I had these certain friends that I could trust and be myself around, and they were encouraging me to live but over time, they started being distant. They pretend that I don‚Äôt exist now. I asked my friends if I could hang out with them on the weekend and they said yes. They ALWAYS hang out without me and always post about it. But suddenly they ghosted me again today and I feel like shit. I was so excited and happy, but they ignored my multiple texts. I wasn‚Äôt being rude... I‚Äôve always struggled making friends as a kid, and this reoccurring moments give me terrible flashbacks. I struggle with communicating because I am neurodivergent. Luckily I have therapists.

"My Kitty (named Kitty, by my grandfather) is the only pet I‚Äôve ever had. She is very very old for a cat (20yrs +) and will die eventually, and probably soon. 

She is the last thing I have left of my two grandparents who have passed. She has lived in so many houses, met so many loving people, and been taken care of to the absolute complete extent of my ability. I love her so much, she has been my true and only best friend my entire life, and I recently came to realize that in times of abuse and fear where I was helpless (and even times of happiness but where I had no one to share it with), she was there. She could have even been in the room when some things happened to me. This has helped me cope with those traumas, and helped me feel strong. 

She will die someday and soon. I don‚Äôt know how. But I analyze her every behavior, I check if she is breathing every single time I see her across the room. It keeps me awake at night looking for her again and again to check, it makes my heart race when I‚Äôm not home with her. I have a stomachache 12 hours a day wondering about it. This has gone on for years. 

It‚Äôs all consuming, stressful, to a terrible point where I fear I‚Äôll be relieved when she does pass, and that is somehow worse. How can I accept the possibility and truth that she will pass, and how can I know I will be able to handle it right when she does? I haven‚Äôt lost a pet in 19 years. 

TL;DR: How do I accept the truth that my elderly cat will die, and stop letting the crippling anticipation of it take away from my life?",4,anxiety

This all started when I was younger and my dad and stepmom (mom died when I was 7) would sit downstairs in the room above mine and listen and monitor every little movement and noise I made. This made me very paranoid my whole life and I know any movement or noise I make will be met with punishment. They expect me to be downstairs with them all day every day and to listen and talk about them all the time. Anytime I try and talk about myself or something I‚Äôm dealing with it‚Äôs always a story from her or my dad about how they had a similar experience when they were my age and ‚Äúunderstand what I‚Äôm going through‚Äù Then they will continue talking about themselves and how great they are. Now the eavesdropping and creepy behavior didn‚Äôt stop when I got older. It got worse. We only have 2 bathrooms in my house and one is upstairs near my room. The kitchen is right above that bathroom so they would whenever I went to use the bathroom go in the kitchen and listen. Then my stepmom would always come upstairs and wait in her room for me to finish. Then not the second I opened the door she acts like she wasn‚Äôt just listening to me and walks back downstairs. She always would comment about the smell always telling me to light a candle or you need to ask your dad for some airwick. She would always go in the bathroom after I was done and always listen and be around when I did. Now that I‚Äôm older and still live at home I can‚Äôt even use the bathroom anymore. I haven‚Äôt used the bathroom at home in over a year. I‚Äôm gonna need years of therapy and behavioral therapy just to reverse all the trauma and damage they did. I always think no matter what someone is listening and monitoring everything I do. They even watch the WI-FI to see exactly what I‚Äôm doing and looking up. I have never in my life been around people who treat someone like this just because they need attention.,5,paranoia

I haven't shared my location or name... Just a very specific situation.

"yesterday i had to severe aches all over my body and a dry throat. the dry throat continued to today and i drank a lot more water than i usually do because of that. anyway because i drank so much water i had to go to the bathroom more because that‚Äôs how that works. 

mistakenly i looked up dry throat on google and the first result was for type 1 diabetes which sent me spiraling after it also said it could happen in a matter of days. i had a mild breakdown and started panicking over the idea i had type two diabetes despite a only fitting two of the symptoms (dry throat and frequently going bathroom). i then began applying other symptoms to myself like ‚Äúyeah my vision isn‚Äôt blurry but what if it is and i just missed it???‚Äù 

i panicked for a while before i managed to get a hold of myself and take into account,

1. my throat is dry probably because my allergies are pretty severe right now and i sleep with a fan directly on my face at all times 

2. i have been drinking a ton of water because of the throat dry thing (6 water bottles today) and somehow ate clear/water based types of soup for every meal today so ofc i have to go to the bathroom more

3. i fit no other diabetes criteria and while i‚Äôm not insanely healthy i‚Äôm still fairly active and eat plenty of health foods and limit processed ones

anyway i‚Äôve mostly recovered from my spiral but i‚Äôd appreciate some advice/reassurance. the logical part of me is telling myself to calm down and remember i put myself through health spirals frequently. last week it was rabies because i had a cut i didn‚Äôt recognize.

I've since had a whole load of tests done which are all clear, this plus the scattergun nature and fluctuation of my symptoms, confirms to me anxiety.  


I feel like i am turning a corner and getting better (started sertraline 3 weeks ago) but i am still having issues when exercising. An example of this would be a simple short, easy cycle/run bringing the onset of physical symptoms such as dizziness, tight chest, blurry eyesight etc. Before all this started i was quite fit and have ran marathons in the past so i have a decent idea how exercise feels and how my body should react to it.  


The only thing that makes sense to me here is that the stress caused by exercise tips my already quite high level of stress just over the edge and into a place where physical symptoms occur. Does this make sense and importantly, has anyone else been through this? It's frustrating to have been so active and now face this, especially when 95% of anxiety and exercise material is about the postive side effects.  


I also experience the onset of symptoms if i have caffeine, or sometimes during other controlled stress actions like, cold bath/shower, wim hof breathing  


Also, tired anxiety legs suckkkkkkkkk",4,anxiety
I really don't understand what's wrong with me. I work hard. I love the best that I can. I try to be as kind as I can but people still want nothing to do with me. I never get any sort of breaks. I am immensely proud of the progress I've made in my personal life but it never seems to be enough. I apply to jobs and don't get it. I try love but never win. Do you think there's such a thing as a negative conduit? Like maybe the reason why some people have such good luck is because there's someone else who absorbs the bad? Idk. Maybe I just wax philosophy too much.,2,depression

"Idk what to do? I‚Äôm supposed to go to see my sister on Thursday (she got me a plane ticket for my birthday) and I‚Äôve never been on a plane before so I was excited. I had Covid 2.5 weeks ago- basically no symptoms other than being tired. But I caught a cold from my brother and have felt unwell since yesterday. He was tested everyday last week bc his teacher had Covid, and he was negative. But the rapid tests aren‚Äôt always right.I have a cough and my face hurts. I want to get tested but Im pretty sure you‚Äôre not supposed to test again within 90 days in case of false positive. But what do I do?? What if when I had Covid previously I didn‚Äôt actually have it, and the test was wrong. And now I have Covid for real? Or what if I just caught it a second time? What do I do? I am so scared. I am not allowed to stay home from school anymore, and I am supposed to leave the state on Thursday",5,paranoia
"So my anxiety consumes and covers me like a veil just randomly comes and go as it pleases. But the problem is, when it‚Äôs present I am often unaware. My thinking patterns do not change and my world just slowly feels heavier. Before I know it, it creeps over me and holds me captive until it leaves in a rapid ‚Äúwhoosh.‚Äù 

This leads to health problems. I grow pale, I look terrible, I feel terrible, I get fatigued and physically ill. 

And once I‚Äôm to the breaking point and I feel like I‚Äôm just ill or that I‚Äôm trapped forever, it disappears. I need to know what this is. I don‚Äôt really have any negative Or anxiety inducing thoughts or thought patterns. This is just a condition that comes and goes as it pleases.

"My current hyperfixation is Hamilton which for anyone who doesn‚Äôt know is a musical about the founding father Alexander Hamilton. 

This is a problem because I listen to the songs and watch the film every day on repeat and I keep finding out new things about it, but there‚Äôs nobody irl I can talk to about it because I live in England and not many people are interested in the American revolution, my friend doesn‚Äôt like it and my mum is getting sick of me talking about it.

"Growing up in an immigrant family, mental health was never a reality. Depression and anxiety were just excuses. A few years ago I was diagnosed with high-functioning anxiety, which I successfully addressed with therapy and self-help books (moving out of the dysfunctional family home helped tremendously too). Since I moved in with my partner recently (after living alone for a year), those self-help books are biting me back. As I understand, moving in is a big deal - it takes time to acclimate and work out a healthy dynamic since you now spend so much time together. We disagreed a lot about small things that ultimately don‚Äôt matter. My self-help knowledge made me aware of a new (impossible and often conflicting) standard I can keep myself to, but it also taught me that humans are imperfect so any mistake can be written off. Now, I don‚Äôt feel grounded. I feel complacent and apathetic. I can‚Äôt seem to enjoy just existing. My favorite activity is sleep. People talk of having clarity, joy, and peace but it‚Äôs always while dealing with a problem, or working toward a goal, or being in a certain environment. How do people just exist happy while also being authentic to all the bad, good, and ugly pieces of themselves?",2,depression

"This time last year I was having a particularly bad time. It got to a point that one day, I left work early to get medicines in order to end my life that day. This was right before Mother‚Äôs Day and I had also gotten my mom a card so she would have something from me. But as I was preparing to overdose, something in me told me not to.

In the year that has gone by, I have moved countries this January back to where I grew up.I have seen family that I haven‚Äôt seen in years, reconnected with old friends, and explored places that I haven‚Äôt been to since I was a child. All things that I would have missed if I had gone through with my plans that day.

The first couple of months that I have been back, I reached a new low. I felt overwhelmed with the move I had just made, the rental crisis here in Australia and  trying to sort out transferring universities. I started to have suicidal ideations again but this time I reached out for help. I got the help that I have needed and I am so happy that I have made it to where I am now. I had to put my own personal shame aside so that I could help myself.

To anyone in a similar situation as I was, just wait. I know you probably roll your eyes when people tell you ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù, because I used to be skeptical too, but it does eventually get better. Although I still have hard days and I am not happy all of the time, I have found hope and a purpose. I am glad to still be here today.",2,depression

But, for some reason the feeling has grown even stronger.

I suspect there is a plan at the new place I work at to kill me. Probably an extension of some bigger plan from some hardcore criminals that I got too close with because I liked skating at the skatepark, and now they have to extend their arms out to people I know to try and end me.

"About 66 days ago I decided to go sober after night of heavy drinking with people I didn‚Äôt know and was under the influence, I think towards the end of the end I was asked to leave which I did however I think I came back to apologise for something like ash on the ground indoors however I think the fact that I kept apologising and was drunk it just got irritating and at this point I recieved a few punches to try and get me to go away I can‚Äôt stop thinking if I did anything else besides be an overly annoying drunk person and recently I have let paranoia and anxiety consume me I posted this on another subreddit however it seems I have become utterly restless and absolutely hate myself and I am under constant fear and panic that someone may be out there looking to get me or perhaps worse, I can‚Äôt shake this feeling in my stomach and chest that is so heavy some times I just want to break down. I am just scared every single day I‚Äôm living because of that one night I decided to go get drunk and let substances control me. I feel guilt. I feel remorse.

"I've had some sort of personality fixation that I can't back away from, so I need answers based on what I've said below:
I want to start by saying that I am a minor. My whole family is closed and frankly strange, it‚Äôs immediately clear that I went all in them, so I doubt that it‚Äôs an injury or something like that, it‚Äôs clearly genes.
I was in a psychiatric hospital, but it didn‚Äôt help me in any way, through an endless amount of tantrums, I learned to hide my emotions, and then I was released after 2 months.
I am still on pills, but they do not help, sessions with a psychologist too. Doctors do not understand why nothing works, and I have already ceased to believe in therapy.
I am very bad with social contact, every time I have contact with people (even now), I get wildly worried. For me, the most ordinary things like friendship, love or ordinary communication is something unimaginably difficult. I literally Googled ""How do you start conversations? How do you start dating? How do you end a conversation?"" and everything like that. I do not know how to conduct empty conversations, I literally have nothing to discuss with others. My voice is monotonous and lifeless, it is unlikely that people will be interested in listening to me.
I hate myself, I'm helpless compared to other teenagers, I have no interests (even what causes at least some emotions is very boring and turns into a routine almost immediately), prolonged depression and a year of apathy and, possibly, anhedonia (?)
It is very difficult for me, I am very tired, rest has not helped for a long time, every day is filled with disappointment and self-abasement, although I understand that this does not make sense. There is and will not be any sense in any of my actions, I will not be able to achieve anything because of my psyche. Even when I was set up confidently and positively to win, it did not help anything, since then I consider every action a failure.
The psychologist diagnosed ""personality disorder"" after studying what it is, I studied it, noticed numerous similarities with borderline disorder, so I may have BPD, the psychologist refused to voice the full diagnosis. She was still mistaken in many ways and behaved, frankly, creepy, so I insisted on changing the psychologist, I will go to her soon.
I have huge memory problems, I can‚Äôt remember what happened yesterday or even today, it seems that the days drag on endlessly.
It was very difficult for me to write this, my thoughts diverge or stick together into an incomprehensible haze, it took me a very long time to write this, my concentration is at zero, I don‚Äôt even understand what I wanted to say, but I‚Äôm interested in this: what kind of diagnosis? What is wrong with me? How to help it? Please, I need some answers, guidance, direction, advice, whatever! I no longer understand what to do.",2,depression

"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",2,depression

Firstly, I‚Äôm terrified that people can read my mind. I know it‚Äôs impossible but I still feel super guilty every time I think of someone cuz I feel like they can hear what I‚Äôm thinking etc

I‚Äôm scared people can see me even though no one‚Äôs around. Kinda like the mind reading but this time that they can actually see me.

"19, f, latvia

i started my journey of trying to get help by going to my family doctor(?) and she said that i'm just a bit stressed and disheveled bc of exam season and made me buy 20‚Ç¨ brain vitamins. i called bs and booked an appointment with a psychiatrist. 

this morning i went to the psychiatrist to possibly get some help with my adhd. i haven't been diagnosed with adhd but i'm 99% sure i've had it all my life, almost everything associated with adhd i've seen online i can relate to. i've taken hundreds of online adhd quizzes(and other mental disorder quizzes to make sure) over the course of multiple months. only adhd applies. so today at my psychiatrist i tell her everything i feel, maybe leave something out because i was pretty afraid of being told i'm wrong and stressed bc of seeking help in a post soviet country since every boomer almost doesn't believe any mental illness, other than like depression, exists. she gave me a sheet of described feelings and how much i relate to them. the questions were like ""my mental state makes it hard to maintain my house, do school/work"", ""i feel i'm not as good as others"" etc so i thought it was a general sheet, i answered truthfully. later she tells me that it was a depression assessment sheet and that i scored moderate-high depression. that didn't feel right but i thought maybe, bc i hadn't thought about having depression. she prescribed me Sertralin and sent me home. 

now i'm thinking that she was very wrong because i don't feel depressed. those answers in the sheet were because my undiagnosed adhd makes it hard to do tasks as well others at the same age,education level so i'm just insecure i guess. i thought that if i come in saying that i feel i have adhd, she should've given me an adhd assessment sheet, not something else that she thinks might be it. also when i told her i started getting suspicious and looked up information online, she kind of scoffed and asked ""and why did you use the internet "", then asked another question before i could even answer. 

i really feel like i haven't been heard after waiting for this day for so long. looked up that Sertralin may make adhd worse so my hope is that if it gets worse, after a month i can tell her how awfull my adhd symptoms are and that she maybe would consider thinking that i have adhd, if not, i am going to try to find another psychiatrist that would actually listen. i don't know what the point of this post was, i guess to let my frustration out.

also i know that a psychiatrist can't really diagnose me but i had no clue where to go, i'm using misdiagnosed as, i guess, misunderstood?",3,adhd
"Do you know what I hate? I know that if I were someone else and met me, I would think that I'm a good guy, but it's actually impossible for me to like myself. I'm not saying this because I'm egocentric and want to protect my feelings, no, damn, I'm not here to say that kind of bullshit, but I'm aware that I'm a charismatic person, many people love me, but I swear I'm incapable of loving myself.

I'm not someone who is suffering a lot. I know people who have had a really bad time, people who keep fighting, people who have already left... I feel that their fights are superior to mine. But at the same time I know that something is wrong with me, because my brain tells me that I'm okay, but it also tells me that I'm not.

I've come to my own conclusion, I don't want to say that it works for everyone, but it has helped me. Not only war, death and any danger capable of taking your life hurt and make you feel bad. No... In fact, I think life is more like an hourglass.

What do I mean? For every second that passes, a grain of sand falls, bringing you closer to death. But you can always fill the hourglass with more sand. But for that you need fucking motivation and you've to be careful, because every grain of sand weighs.

If you're fed up with feeling how the grains of sand are falling, causing you to submerge yourself in the quicksand that you're creating, you'll be unable to fill the hourglass. If your grains of sand drown you, you won't be able to fill that sandglass, and when there are no grains of sand left, you'll die.

I'm tired, I've been in quicksand for a long time. If I'm still filling my hourglass, it's because if I find little meaning in life, I find even less meaning in death. I try to keep going, I've everything I ever wanted. I've enough reasons to be happy. But I'm not. Why?

Why don't I want to refill my hourglass anymore? I've been working for so long to make it the most beautiful hourglass there is. I've people who love me, I do well in my studies, I do what I want to do... But it seems that I love to hate myself, and I hate to love to hate myself.

I realize I'm a happiness junkie. I need the fucking soma. But I know that even if I could find happiness in a drug, I'd still feel sad, because I see so many people who have plenty of happiness, and I've to beg for it. I think what makes me sicker is not feeling sick, but believing that I've no valid reason to feel sick. 

Well... I'm sure there are also people who feel like me... For those people, I want you to know that hope isn't something you find, it's something you have to create. I feel bad, but I'm not hopeless, and I want you all to keep going :).",2,depression

"So we're struggling to approach a subject with pretty much anyone including our psychologist. 
I'm trans and had surgery last January, and had 2 revision surgeries after that. 
My surgery was on the mainland and I live with my parents on an island, during that first surgery, I had nearly bled out, (we missed a medication that contained aspirin as it was labeled ASA and we had no idea what it was.. And why we keep saying surgery is not something to take lightly) 
I spent two weeks in the hospital and need 4 units of blood to be brought back to baseline (there's 10 units in the human body) and in that time the only ones who were ever in my hospital room were my boyfriends, the two guys flew from the opposite side of the continent from a diffrent country to be with me for surgery. 
And not a single family member came to see me, when 10 years ago I was the first responder to my grandma's heart attack, and my family members flew to see her in the hospital. 
I feel like I'm missing some social que or something that might explain why no one from my blood family even bothered to show up.. Like yes it was covid, but I was allowed 2 visitors at a time, when asked about it I got told they couldn't afford to take a day off (when they're now taking 2 weeks to go see our grandpa in a different part of the country)

"At least I hope it's just a feeling, every time I look somewhere my brain has decided is hiding a camera I find nothing, yet in my head it's still there.

I wanted to marry her, how can I just let her go like that, I know i should accept it but it isnt easy. It was getting harder and harder for me everyday. she might be feeling the same too but she never communicated.

"Dear People after watching a scary documentary about sleep paralysis i can only start sleeping after 3 am when i hear the birds chirping. At first in the documentary i though well seems like this only happens to girls, then an male intervee appeared. Then i though well at least theay cant't get raped ( as it was already a fear by me. Then an interveee explained that he got raped ( british guy ) during Sleep Paralysis (SP) one time. THat somehow really triggert me. Combined with another documentary of a guy saying that he was part of a satanist wizard group explaining 00 o cklock being ghost hour and 3 am being devils hour. These 2 documentaries together combined have helped to scare the shit out of me. for 3 months i couldn't sleep naturally befor 3 am because i am so scared and i am 28 years old so embarresed and scared to talk to a psychologist because i don't want to be laughed at. I am literally scared of being raped during SP (during devils hour and before ) although i've never encountered it. 

I have never encountered ghosts sometimes maybe objects falling during strange times but thats about it. 

Can anybody help me how to get out of that fear spiral so i can finally sleep again normal ? 

I am scared about my future because i have this strange sleep  hinderance now scared of not being able to work. I lieterally can only calm down after 3 am. Who can fall asleep while being scared ?

I hope all of you are doing fine  
I have a question about SSRIs and anti-depressants in general... If someone got diagnosed with depression and there was something specific that made them this miserable and it can't be solved, can medications help? I mean if the main problem can't be solved is there any hope that they can feel just a little bit better? Or even apathic about it?

"Hey guys. I have struggled with paranoia for years now and I finally wanted to make a short film about it. But I dont want that film to only go over what I went through, because that wouldn‚Äôt be as interesting as me learning about other peoples‚Äô experiences so I have a broader knowledge of it. So I have a few questions I wanted to ask anyone that is willing to answer. 

1: When you have so many paranoid thoughts that it becomes too hard to handle, what do you do? 

2: What makes your paranoia worse or what triggers it?

3: What would you want to be represented in a short film on paranoia?

4: Have you ever tried to fight back against your paranoia and paranoid thoughts? What happened?


Again, I‚Äôd appreciate it if anyone answered, but if not I understand. It is a tough topic. Anyways my short film will be up on my youtube channel (lilmil) on September 10, which is national suicide prevention day (which i have some experience with myself).

Yesterday first time in my life i got anxiety attack after smoking weed.
Ive been active smoker for 6+ years
Never had anything like this,
Ive had this very uneasy feeling in me 
And it pretty much stayed today aswell.
Ive felt like my life is worthless and i wont be able to accomplish anything.
I got so scared in my head cause i never had mental problems. This idea of having them scared very much. Im 22years old working low paying 9-5.
I dont have many friends and im quite alone. I really dont want to be anxious or worse - depressed. I thought maybe its because of poor diet or no vitamins? Maybe i can drink some supplements to feel better? Im currently taking magnesium. I will stop with weed for a while but is there a way i can feel better?",2,depression

"A bit of information: I am a 23 y/o trans man, currently living with a friend *(we share a room)* and their family, a grandmother and a sister. I *have* been diagnosed with general anxiety, but no paranoid disorders.  


So, I've always thought I was... Decently paranoid. Like, everyone gets those thoughts sometimes, y'know? I figured it was normal enough, just a brain doing its thing. Maybe the thoughts were a bit irrational, but that was nothing to worry about.  


Recently, I was talking with my friend *(not sure how the conversation got here)* about how sometimes, I have to check that they're breathing, because I'm afraid they've died and I hadn't noticed. And because I tend to ramble, of course I went on talking about how I worry the others in the house have died in their rooms, and how the kitchen windows freak me out at night because I'm sure there will be someone there, etc etc. My friend then simply told me that those thoughts aren't normal, especially not that frequently.   


I'd never really considered myself to be any more paranoid than the average person. But now, I notice those thoughts really do plague me often, even if they're completely irrational, like believing someone might be hiding in the crawl space above the laundry room. Today, I had a full blown anxiety attack because my friend was gone, their grandmother had no idea where they had even left, adamant they were still home a minute ago, and they hadn't answered my text. I had to scour the whole house to make sure they hadn't collapsed somewhere. When I didn't find anything, the rational thought is just that they've gone out and they're fine. But then I began to panic that they'd still collapsed somewhere, it just wasn't in the house. I wasn't able to calm down until I called them and found out they'd just gone out for lunch.

&#x200B;

I don't know for sure if any of this is genuine paranoia, or just my anxiety acting up in a weird way. I've been talking with my friend about some of the thoughts when they come up *(I told them about my panic today),* but I don't actually know if that's helpful or hurtful to me. Paranoid schizophrenia runs in my family, so I don't know if maybe this is something I should be properly worried about. Any thoughts or advice or even similar experiences would be nice to hear. Thank you if you read through all this.",5,paranoia

"Long story short, she never had fleas or worms until now (I know where she got it from too, it was not at home or from outdoors). I noticed she was acting slightly off last night, so I took her to the vet and I didn‚Äôt even suspect worms. I was suspecting a UTI or severe constipation, but then the vet found that rice looking thing that is from worms. So she gave me both amoxicillin and dewormer in case it was either suspected thing. 

I get home and I gave both the dewormer and amoxicillin. Immediately she goes to poop, I check, 

And I see a worm shirking and stretching in her poop. 

I have a strong phobia of worms. I am so incredibly serious when I say that if I ever get worms, I will commit self die. So I freaked out and ran out my apartment, went to my sister‚Äôs place because it was extremely overwhelming to see it alive. Later she came to help me clean my sheets, vacuum, and disinfect her litterbox (and throw out the poop with the worms that died at that point, I didn‚Äôt even scoop the poop I just dumped all the litter). I even bought the petamour flea household spray in hopes to kill anything there. 

I gave her food for the night and her second dose of amoxicillin, and now I‚Äôm staying the night at my sister‚Äôs place. I feel guilty for leaving her alone for the night, but the thought of being in the same area as worms (and my cat jumping onto my bed immediately after using the bathroom) is too much for me. This is the first time she‚Äôs going to bed alone and I feel so so bad but the worms are too much for me at the moment. 

I‚Äôm going back in the morning to feed her again and the second dose of dewormer, but the thought of the sight of poop with worms with it is too much. But I definitely must have to scoop out that poo, if any, in the morning. 

EDIT: Now I‚Äôm scared I have worms. I don‚Äôt even want to poop. It‚Äôs been a full day already about about to be 2. I‚Äôve washed my hands 7 times just to put my contacts in.

"From the outside my life is perfect. I'm well educated, have an interesting job in a field I'm passionate about, my own place, hobbies, a caring girlfriend and fantastic friends. I seem to excel at almost everything I do. I've largely got it all figured out. I am very fortunate. 

Yet, under the surface, I feel nothing. My life is joyless. At least half of the days over the last decade I've thought about how nice it would be to just be dead; to not have to deal with life anymore. I've always thought the saying ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" is stupid. To me suicide is a permanent solution to every problem I'll ever have. I've spent countless hours planning on how I would do it and how I can minimise the pain on others. I am honestly surprised I'm still here.

I'm currently at a crossroads. My depression is getting worse and it's becoming visible. I am already starting to lose people because of it. But, I feel like I can't talk to anyone close to me. I worry as soon as people know just how fucked I am I'll be treated differently and things will never be the same. It's also just not in me to ask. I am not the person who needs help from others. I've made token attempts before, seen doctors and underplayed my symptoms to avoid being sectioned. I've been prescribed antidepressants and seen therapists but all to no avail. What's to say if I ask for help this time will be any different.

As stupid as it feels to write this, knowing the advice I would give to others I feel this is a journey I must continue to take alone. I also wonder if it's even worth being fixed. I am incredibly fortunate to be in the position I am and yet and still this miserable. What does that really say about me.",2,depression

"Okay so this has messed with me for a while and I'm still really confused and feel sick writing this. Idk what to think or what to call this. 

From the ages of around 14-18 my dad used to do this weird creepy thing around once a week.

I would be laying on the couch and he would walk up to me very slowly, slowly look at me head to toe, head to toe, head to toe, and his arms would slowly come up, and then when he finally got to me he would quickly grab either my upper inner thigh, or the place where the top of my upper thigh meets my hip. 

It always seemed sexual to me, and he would never grab me anywhere else when he did this thing. When I saw him coming up to me to do this I'd call my two little dogs up and put them on top of me. There was a couple times where he asked, ""what did you think I was gonna do?"" (Making me think he knew what he was doing?) But I can't know his intention, so I don't know what to think about it. But when I moved out I stopped talking to him for the most part because it seemed sexual to me and it weirded me out and changed how I think about him. 

He also asked me multiple times as a teenager if I masturbate, to which id pretend like I didn't know what it was or  I thought only guys did that just to brush the question off. 

He'd smack my ass a lot, and one time I said please don't do that and he did it several times as I tried to walk away from him. 

It's so confusing to me because this isn't molestation, I don't even know if I should call this sexual assault. All I know is that it's had a major affect on me.

 I wasn't going to tell anybody, but then in 2019 I had a phycological break where I heard a demonic voice tell me I was going to hell (never had anything like that happen before) and I was convinced I was going to die so I just opened up about everything I was hiding. It told my mom dad did something weird, she asked what is was, i didn't know how to tell her. Then she told my grandma (her mom) and they both came up to me and asked what he did, I freaked out and told them he took me in the garage one day and cut both of our hands and smashed them together (which did happen) but I told them that so I didn't have to say the other stuff. My grandma rolled her eyes and seemed mad like I made a big deal out of nothing. 

I eventually told my mom what happened and she pretty muched brushed it off and now I feel like shit because to them it seems like I just wanted attention.

Anyway, my dad died last year unexpectedly from multi-organ failure. When he was unconscious I told him I forgive him, even though I never talked to him about any of this. but I'm still left with these weird feeings. I still want my dad and the relationship we had, minus the stuff that made me feel weird. He was the most similar to me out of my whole family and I love him very much. Half of me is angry at him, and the other half of me tells me I was being dramatic and I should have just let it go so I didn't waste the last years I had with him. I just don't know what to call this. I don't know why I even want to label this. I have a hard time letting this go and it's very confusing to me.

"Bit of backround. Sophmore year of highschool I broke, hit with sever anxiety and depression disorders  that I still struggle with to this day. Dropped out, went in and out of various therapists and programs. Some helped, some didn't. Im sure many here know the story.   


I try my best. I live on my own, pay the bills well. With my disability coverage im reasonably comfortable, the ever crumbling economy not withstanding. But despite it all I never feel like im enough.   


I just..can't handle everything. Not all at once. Something always slips. Maybe I forget to clean the bathtub during my chore list. Or I keep putting off my dentist appointment because the bills scare me so much it stops me from doing anything else. Or just...getting the trash out.   


I always, without fail, can't handle EVERYTHING I need too. Most, but not all. And everyone reminds me of the fact.. What set off my current episode was I called my aunt, the woman who took me in temporarily after my mother died, to wish her a happy mothers day. Barely took her a minute of conversing to remind me im ""Really good at not keeping appointments."" And it just...it hurt so much.   


Apart from my therapist, no one seems to understand that even if I seem to be doing well, every day is a struggle to get done what I can. I always feel like im swimming with my head just barely above the water. Some days I choke and have to stop to cough out. Other days im mostly okay. But it never stops being a fact of im barely swimming as it is, any everyone expects me to handle it, or get stronger to handle it. But no matter what I do or how much progress I make, there's always... more. More appointments, more chores, more things I need to do that I inevitibably fail at in one way or another.   


So now, here I am again. Four trash bags sitting in the corner. Bed half made and falling apart. Clothes strewn about. Carpet needs vacuming, and I haven't eaten a proper meal in about 16 hours.. and im too cold to do anything. Too...empty.   


Why even bother? Nothing I do is enough for anyone, and those few who get it can't help for one reason or another. Im not even feeling like...sad sort of depressed. Or maybe I am? Tears tickle my eyes but I don't...feel anything but cold. Cold and Empty. I don't know anymore.

Does anyone have any tips to boost energy or get their sleep schedule back on track?",6,schizophrenia

"I typically never feel the urge to post about my negative feelings but this instance really left me broken. Today, my parent kept ‚Äújokingly‚Äù referring to me and a bum, as I graduated a semester early and don‚Äôt work (I guess tutoring doesn‚Äôt count‚Ä¶) or drive. Taking a difficult course load with depression last year and the first of last year really exhausted me and I needed this semester for a mental break. My cognitive difficulties make learning news things very difficult and I have a very difficult time processing most things, so the smallest tasks feel like a difficult struggle. Because these tasks feel so difficult, I fall into a vicious cycle of fear and avoidance. 

However, my parent referring to me as a bum today really hurt, as they have done this before in the past but I shrugged it off.  This really hurt, because the smallest task feels so difficult, and I would do anything to get rid of my cognitive difficulties and lead a productive life, buts it‚Äôs not so simple. Being called a bum reminds me of how much of a loser I really am and makes me want to give up on life. Maybe I‚Äôm not good enough and will never be able to do well in university. I feel so broken right now and feel like there‚Äôs no hope for the future if I have trouble understanding the smallest things. Maybe I am just a bum, and objectively they would be right. I have no job, can‚Äôt drive, and absolutely no friends. If I were to die, very few people would care‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt  know why I‚Äôm especially sensitive today, but this really hurt because I‚Äôm trying my best (working hard on a driving course and preparing for several musical competitions) but don‚Äôt see any progress‚Ä¶

"I was driving home from work yesterday and ran a red light. My brain had just zoned out and I didn‚Äôt even notice the light. My brain did not register that I needed to stop.

"I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed and fixated on this recent source of anxiety - something a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person would probably not think twice about. 

I‚Äôm a pretty low-maintenance friend when it comes to communicating, I‚Äôll provide tons of support and words of affirmation etc but I‚Äôm not one that needs to be in contact daily. Me and my best friend have this wonderful setup where we both know we adore each other, yet we can go up to 5 days without responding to each others messages, then when we do, we always do it lovingly (with voice notes and pics of our kids and news and thoughts from the past week). We always understand that not answering immediately is not personal, nor does it impact our relationship negatively. It did take years to build this sort of peace / not feel guilt over not immediately responding. 

Now, I have another lovely friend, whom I have recently gotten closer to (we grew apart after high school but in the last few years we‚Äôve started talking again, I think because we both became moms, and have had some nice points of connection again. She is absolutely lovely and I even got the honor of being the godparent to her third kid.). She‚Äôs someone who messages almost daily, and whenever I message her (usually in response to something), she will message right back. I‚Äôm having trouble with this since I don‚Äôt feel like I have space/energy for daily messaging so I sometimes wait a day, or half a day to answer, and then boom she answers again. 

How do I navigate this? My problem is mainly the guilt I feel when I don‚Äôt respond immediately and the slight annoyance I feel for ‚Äúhaving to‚Äù be in contact daily. My ideal situation would be that we write to each other a couple of times a week with no stress or pressure about response times. I‚Äôm a recovering people pleaser and it pains me to not immediately respond, but I want nothing more than a little less contact. Does anyone have any advice? 


For background, back in high school (15 years ago) this same friend had the habit of wanting to talk on the phone in the evenings after school. This was a huge source of anxiety for me, and I hadn‚Äôt been in therapy at that point, so I sort of did this combo of trying to please her while also feeling enraged and stressed whenever my phone rang. I have gotten better at setting boundaries now but I think that same ‚Äútrauma‚Äù is now resurfacing and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to be in the same situation as before. 

TLDR: old friend and I have been reconnecting but she wants a lot more contact than me, how do I maintain my boundaries without hurting her?",4,anxiety

"We broke up weeks ago for various reasons, and everyone keeps telling my that things will get better, get easier with time, but it isn't it's only getting worse. I can't go 1 hour without thinking about her, or worrying if she's safe and alright. Other times I wonder what's going to happen to us when she feels ready to talk to me again.

Will she still love me, will she even want me in her life? Is it even possible for a LDR to work out after 2 past breakups, or am I just telling myself that it is so I don't hurt myself again. I'm so tired of waking up every day with a weight on my chest and heart. I'm so tired of not having someone to love and take care of. Someone I can give hugs and cuddles to everyday, and who will give them to me when I need them.

Honey if you somehow find this, I still love you with all my heart. I hope your safe and your life has been kinder to you since we cut contact, and I hope everyone at your house is doing okay. Say hi to Izzy and Bently for me and keep her safe.

A tenacious self-loathing about how I'm a terrible human being, with awful judgement, that can never be trusted to make sound decisions, with fatalistic, negative beliefs about how myself and life in general sucks and always will.

But, ironically it's this opinion, and (only this opinion) that I'm ever correct on, and have resilient confidence in. So much so, that no amount of therapy, positive thinking, self-help techniques, mental health et al. can argue me out of it. Ever.

I'm always wrong about everything, except about how I'm a piece of shit that is always wrong (in every single viewpoint except this one) who will never amount to anything. Bet your bottom dollar on that one.

"I started having anxiety in November of 2022. It all started with having negative thoughts about my relationship. Which I tried to hold it in and deal with it myself. Which didnt work, around March was when I brought it up to my girlfriend. We did what everyone else has done and we work through it. She's extremely supportive, it was very hard on us. But we've got through it. I'm starting to believe. Holding in my extreme anxiety for months on end, has lingered into my day to day. I randomly get anxious now, busy restaurants and movie theaters, sometimes when I wake up, or through out my day it hits me instantly and it lasts  for a while. The anxiety now isn't about relationship issues. It's just random and about nothing. I feel it in my chest. I've brought up to my mother that I want to go see a specialist. But all she does is try to blame the anxiety on my daily use of nicotine. Which is annoying, I'm sure it slightly could be negative.

"After lamenting about my lack of drive to a friend for a bit too long, they just plainly asked me, ‚ÄúWell what is it that you actually want?‚Äù

It stumped me. 

I don‚Äôt really ‚Äúwant‚Äù anything.

"I went through a series of depression due to lockdown before. I felt so useless because I was fired from my job, and finding new jobs had been fruitless effort. I don't have any money to provide for my two kids, and had to solely depends on my wife income (she's a public servant, so her being fired is almost impossible). I tried my hands at several things, trying my best to find an income to at least pay my bills and commitment, but none yield any results. Banks had been chasing me to pay my mortgage and car loans, adding to the pressure. Because I am somewhat religious, I do not have any suicide thoughts, but the thought of dying is better than living kept lingering in my mind.

As luck would have it, mid 2021 I got a job offer at a startup company (at the time I don't care what it is, I just applied randomly), and I immediately joined the company, despite the salary offered far lower than my previous job (12k a year compared to 78k a year in my previous job). The job itself is mentally draining, but I had determined to prove myself.

So within a year, I went from the lowest position to being one of the top management, and my salary increased to 30k a year. I had my goals to help this startup company to become at least medium sized company. The job is hard, with me often staying in the office after 10 p.m. even though there's no overtime pay, dealing with clients, messy process and issues working with partner company. But I persisted. I have clear goals, and with my experience, I know what to do. The salary still not enough, but at least I can pay part of the commitment I have while the rest I refinance to pay lower amount.

But then, at the end of last year, my mom fell ill (heart attack, stroke, and malnutrition). Malnutrition part is due to wrong advise given by the nutritionist (my mom opted for APD dialysis, but the nutritionist gave the diet for normal dialysis). I took a month break from working to take care of my mother and my kids (my parents took care of them when me and my wife work).

In that time, apparently, my assistant wasn't able to cope well with the job I had given, and tendered her resignation to the owner of the company. The owner, called everyone from my department and apparently almost everyone have a problem with me. The main issue, I was not a ""leader"", but a ""manager"". Now the owner of the company became emotional and he dropped me from the position I held at the time, and told me to do other things, without listening to my side of the story.

From then on, he kept dismissing my ideas, highlighted my mistakes frequently without looking at what I had achieved, and held meeting daily to see what I have done for the day. The consequences of dropping me from the position I held? The department is crucial due to the bulkiness of profits comes from my department, but now it is mismanaged, there's no clear goals, and dissatisfaction among the clients kept on rising. Several signs of a failing business had begun to emerge. I myself had lost motivation. It became harder and harder for me to stay after hours like I previously did, and even the smallest matter made me take leave. I couldn't stay there.

My wife's attitude with me had changed since I got fired, and she seems to lost her respects to me (I think this is part of the things that spark my depression in the first place), as I couldn't provide for the family. But nowadays my wife's attitude had been getting worse and worse. She lost her temper almost everyday, and kept shouting and screaming at me, in front of the kids. I tried my best to be patience, but it broke my heart. My kids too seems to have followed their mothers footstep, yelling and screaming at me when I didn't adhere what they wanted. I still love them, but I don't know how long I could hold on.

I usually have three places that becomes my solace, where I feel happy to be there and it helps me deals with my stress. But now, the three of them, the office, my home, and my parents home, had become the worst hell for me. I am dying inside. My tears aren't coming out anymore. The feeling of thinking that dying is better had resurface. I saw graves, and thought that how good it is if it was me in there. I saw a fatal traffic accident, I thought how good it is if that was me. I still held the believe that suicide is not the way, but still, death seems to be the sweet release from all of this.

If anyone read this until this part. Thank you. I had no place or outlet for me to rant. To express what I felt inside. To meet with psychiatrist is not something I have money to spend on. In fact, currently I only have 50 bucks in my pocket to last me for two weeks. This is how I get by every month. So, this is the only place I can rant anonymously. Again, if you read until this part, thank you, from the bottom of my heart.",2,depression
"So I'm Kat I'm f21. I go to college but I'm here over the summer with my family.I have a mom and dad and 2 sisters. I've been feeling very stressed here. I'm not sure how to handle it anymore. I have a car but my parents don't allow me to take it to college(pls don't ask idk), but my sister in HS takes it everywhere. And everytime something is diffirent about my car (ex the emergency break is on) she gets mad and tells me to not put it on. 

My parents are stressed all the fucking time and j mean all the time. My family is in a bad mood everything single day 24/7. And rhey get furious over small things (like for example all the spoons being dirty) will throw them over the edge. This is extremely hard to live with. My family fights everyday too about dumb stuff like the dishes or like the creamer being low. Every single day I'm struggling with my mental health bc of them. The other week I asked my dad to move the elliptical out of my room that they put in my room without asking or even telling me for that matter. My dad was screaming at me saying ""this isn't ur house"" ans no one uses the elliptical so I'm confused as to why it has to be in my bedroom. My parents wouldn't budge with it. 

And basically my whole life I've been struggling with mental health and I've told my parents countless times about it. But they tell me I'm faking it. I've had so many panic attacks in front of them and they just don't care. My sister is a junior in HS and SHE IS GETTING THERAPY. Like wtf??",2,depression

My therapist told me her manager was reminding her of all other people waiting to be seen by their mental health services and I immediately got triggered by it and didn‚Äôt tell her. She said she would fight for my case but now I think I‚Äôll never get better. I won‚Äôt be able to survive by myself these coming months. I‚Äôve seen her for four months already, and while I think therapy is supporting me, Im still severely suicidal. My therapist has spent all that time just trying to stabilise me and we‚Äôve only just started treatment. I feel like I can‚Äôt be fully honest about my violent thoughts or how suicidal I really am. And I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm starting to accept that I will die soon. I‚Äôm waiting for it, it‚Äôs just a matter of time. 

I‚Äôm constantly thinking about the end of the world, having vivid apocalyptic nightmares and about killing myself, about people chasing me trying to hurt me. I know that once the covid situation gets worse the government/authorities will assert their control even more and are probably going to detain me eventually, put me in prison and kill or torture me because I don‚Äôt believe in their luciferian evil new world order. I think there‚Äôs an evil force sabotaging me, like a ghost or dark cloud of smoke watching my every move. None of my family believe me what I say, they brush me off when I try to explain what is really happening in this reality. I sprinkled some holy water just in case to feel better. Im really scared of what will happen soon, and something definitely will, a catastrophe, depopulation and control. I would rather die by my own hand. 

I‚Äôm really scared of ghosts/demons. I see shadows moving sometimes but I play it off as my mind playing tricks on me. I‚Äôve seen horrific things while sleeping too during sleep paralysis and I can‚Äôt get over the fear. It makes it hard to go to sleep at night or be by myself. I want to tell my therapist how unwell I feel but I don‚Äôt want to be a burden, I don‚Äôt want to take up space when someone else needs the help.",5,paranoia

"Through these few months, I have pondered the condition of illness, persistently emphasizing the fact that there could be any kind developing inside me any moment. Whether by will or by choice, these thoughts would be followed by minor pains throughout my body. I would be convinced that they were an undiagnosed illness that would progress and eventually kill me. The pains have gotten worse and now I'm thoroughly convinced I'm going to die (though, I'm aware I probably won't).  


This has affected my will to live extensively to the point where I'm pondering the prospect of suicide. Is there away to avoid this way of thinking and revert back to my carefree mindset?",5,paranoia

"A few years ago I started feeling like people hate me, I even heard people in the supermarket saying things like ‚Äúwhy do you shop here? Go someplace else‚Äù or I would park somewhere and the whole parking lot would be empty when I went out, just my car, and there was people inside and it was full when I arrived. Strange things like that kept happening, in the end I went back to my hometown.
But eventually, things started to happen here too. 
People would purposely put me in situations that make me look bad with no way out. 
People would randomly ask me really specific things and kept provoking me to say the wrong things. 
People would know things about me that I wouldn‚Äôt share with anyone.
Friends would invite me to places and then no one in the group would talk to me. 
Class mates would give me all the wrong informations about class and homework. 
Random people in the street, that I‚Äôve never seen before, would say mean things to me. 
The list goes on.

I'm constantly working overtime, I was promoted to the head manager, and I spend as much time as I can there. I don't know why. I can't seem to do anything else but I can't resist coming into work until my boss forces me to go home. And then I blow all my money on food and stupid shit. I know I need help. But I don't know how to ask for it or WHO to ask for it when a therapist hasn't helped me before. I'm seeing one right now but I don't see any progress and I've run out of things to say.

Its been a battle to disconnect from Google; it simply is not practical; and it is extremely difficult to stop downright cancerous growth off the storage consumed by applications

I open up my junk drawer tonight and , underneath it all I discovered my old cracked up Samsung phone

I wonder to myself, is this thing really off you know like! Absolutely dead. 

So I press the power button and the screen lights up. You cant see any thing except neon stripes, I'll just throw it in some water and that will do the trick. Right? To my horror the device will not stop despite being underwater with a cracked screen for several minutes.

Okay so Ill just open it up and take the battery out,. I Proceed to it pry it open with a screw driver, glass getting everywhere in my hands and on the floor.

Here comes the fun;.

I pry the battery out with a screwdriver and it fucking catches on fire. It' started glowing bright red so I threw back in the water and it continues to burn and melt the plastic pitcher the water was in so I run a flaming plastic fireball out the back door and plop it on the balcony , shut the door, and get my handy "" organic vapor blocking respirator"" because the smell of the fumes is ridiculously noxious.  Now i know what  lithium ion batteries are how they work, and that they are quite dangerous, so I'm not really that shocked....

What really gets me is , when I scrub the search index for "" removed my cellphone battery and it caught fire"" All I get is some consumer advisory saying, ""it's dangerous to try and replace the battery yourself"", ""No you cant change the battery on your iPhone yourself"" ""it's a way to make sure you have to upgrade"" "" Your better off just to get a new phone"" ""Woman leaves phone on charger and it explodes"" exploding cellphones are dangerous""

Just because the screen is blank, there's no way to know that phone isnt active unless the battery is disconnected and the phone is totally disassembled and destroyed.


What gets me reeling is that I cannot find one single peice of data where someone wanted to simply, disconnect the battery and throw the whole thing in the trash. Why is no else  one questioning all these millions of dead phones  ( The phone doesn't need a screen to do anything,  the screen is merely for humans to interface with)  that nobody seems concerned about. these devices are permanent,  there's a permanent record of me on that thing and I hate because it causes malfunctions, and makes my device harder to use, I have to do  daily maintenance to keep the device working correctly, it causes stress, etc etc etc, its like having a Corvette that only can go 40mph.. it's stupid!!! What a waste of time.... 

Why is it seemingly inconceivable that I wanted to just disconnect the battery and throw the shit away. I don't care at all If I damage or not. I want the thing to turn OFF ;and it won't, I just want security and peace of mind!!  

It tried to kill me!! It tried to burn me and my apartment down to the ground, it cut my hands, and THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE ALL HERE!!! JESUS CHRIST WHAT THE FUCK!!?? THE AUTHORITIES ARE ARE ASKING ME QUESTIONS?!?!?NOW EVERYONE REALLY IS LOOKING AT ME.... I I just wanted to take the battery out of my old discarded phone,  and throw it away,. It's like im in trouble or something

All this does is reinforce the thought system of my extremely paranoid personality,   I want to destroy more phones,  THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY ACTIONS CONFIRM THAT WHAT I AM THINKING IS 100% TRUE

.. damn guys, please, I hope someone gets this message

"I am not looking for sympathy. I am not looking for a reminder of all the good things that happened or that I have. I am just looking to get this off my chest in a place where others understand depression, and some may even be able to relate. I am not looking to end my life due to this; I just am feeling depressed and a bit hopeless; so I decided to share a bit of my story in hopes it will help me feel better.   
  
January 6th, 2023, I went to the ER for what turned out to be sepsis of the right leg. In 2013, I was in a car accident which left a wound on my right calf which, for the next ten years continued to open and close and eventually became septic. From that day in January till min March, I was unconscious; partially due to the sedation and partially due to what was to come. During the months of January and February, I coded 5 different times. The first code required 45 minutes of CPR to revive me. Within those months I also became an amputee. The doctors at one point told my wife that it was either my leg or my life, there wasn‚Äôt room for both. My wife did the only sensible thing and had them amputate my right leg above the knee.   
  
During these initial months, I had a tracheotomy, was placed on a ventilator, lost the ability to stand or walk on my own due to the trauma of losing my right leg and everything else that happened during my stay in the ICU.  
  
Today during PT, we attempted to stand, and it really broke me when I couldn‚Äôt. I have a bed sore on my tailbone from my stay in the ICU. They couldn‚Äôt move me at all during a period when I was on EKMO and Impala which were keeping my heart and lungs functioning. It was during this period that the sore became a thing. Unfortunately, because of the placement of the wound, the pain is immense most of the time and spikes when I move, it is touched, or I lay on a hard surface. When the pain became so much, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore while trying to stand, I became depressed and now feel very much a failure. Logically, I know that I have been through hell and back, so not being able to stand the first time I tried isn‚Äôt truly a failure, however my mind doesn‚Äôt always follow logic. I have cried off and on all day, feeling like I will never live a somewhat normal life again. I fear I will be wheelchair bound the rest of my life and that, though I am still in rehab, I have reached my peak performance from here on out.   
  
After all has been said and done, I feel a little better getting some of this off my chest to complete strangers. I still feel down, still feel like I am a bit of a failure, but I know eventually, I will be my old self.

It happened so fast I barely even registered the terror. Only after it stopped did I realize my heart was racing and I was shaking.

My sister said it sounded like a panic attack when I told or but it lasted for like a second? Or I guess it peaked for a second? Idk. That was years ago and it never happened again.

"I have anxiety problems that I am in therapy for.  More specifically, I have rage issues in my family (grandfather and father all have rage problems) and while I know I have it in smaller increments than they do, I want to be able to control it or prevent it from getting worse.  That is one of my biggest goals in therapy (along with working on my anxiety in general).  I've had maybe \~5 major rage episode in my life (including today).  So it isn't as big of a problem for me as it is in my dad, I just don't want it to get worse.  I am the first person in my family to go to therapy that I'm aware of so I AM taking steps...

&#x200B;

I was driving home from the therapy session when this happened.  I was talking with my mom and she  she put me on hold.  I was getting off on a highway and merging onto another one, and there was a really slow car in front of me + a car behind me tailgaiting me.   So she came back onto the phone and I said ""please hold on"" (I was getting stressed from the tailgaiting) to which she spoke over, so I said it again - and she continued to talk.  I then yelled ""I said hold on"" and got pissed and hung up on her.  

&#x200B;

Once I was safely on the highway I called her back to explain that I was asking her to hold on and she was just talking over me.  (My mom has a habit of talking over me and I've mentioned it in the past to her.  I do the same and she also gets frustrated.  I AM trying to be aware of this and stop).  So she kept cutting me off & talking over me as I was saying this, so I started getting angry and saying that what happened 5 minutes ago was happening again...right now.  But she was cutting me off/talking over now to apologize for what happened 5 minutes ago (in a dismissive way ""fine,  I'm sorry"".)  So I said what she was doing before is literally still happening (dismissing what I'm saying and just talking over me).  Like she doesn't let you finish your sentence, she kind of just cuts in and talks over you.  And she was saying she's not talking over me....And then I lost control.   I went into rage mode.  I didn't just yell but I went like a notch higher and I feel REALLY bad about this now.  It lasted like a minute of me cursing at her and yelling at how she is always so dismissive & that is literally happening as we are talking about it.

&#x200B;

So she (rightfully so) said she's upset with me now and doesn't want to talk and hung up.  I drove another 5 minutes and called her back to apologize.  This is where I'm trying to get control of the rage and take responsibility (something my father never does).  I said I was sorry and that I wanted to talk about why I'm upset.  I did say that it was ""two notches too high"" and that my screaming was overboard.  I went on to discuss in a much more calm manner this talking over/dismissive talking that was happening is what caused me to get so angry.  But then she was saying she wasn't talking over me at all...so this kind of went back and forth in a MUCH more calm way (from me).  She said sorry a few times but kept denying she was doing it...so I said her sorry doesn't mean anything if she doesn't understand what I am complaining about in the first place.  Like she isn't acknowledging that she is talking over me or cutting into when I'm speaking (she IS doing it)...the conversation went on a bit longer and then we hung up (can't remember if we said bye or it was another abrupt hangup).

&#x200B;

I got to my house and I broke down in my car.  I started crying about that rage incident (that lasted a minute).  It's the exact thing I'm trying to avoid/focus on, and yet it is happening.  It hasn't happened THAT much in my life -- I think it was the stress of the overall day for me + not eating since breakfast (this was 6PM) and my mom was cutting me off too -- I lost it and I took it out on  her.  

&#x200B;

I called her again (from my car still) to talk about all of this.  We both said we were upset with each other.  I said again that I was REALLY SORRY for how angry I got.  She tried to keep defending herself and saying she wasn't cutting me off...and so that conversation began again about how she IS cutting me off and I keep telling her this (others tell her as well...).  We got back to the rage and by this point we were both in tears (she could hear my voice trembling) and I was sincerely sorry for the rage portion of what happened - but I wanted to address what was causing me to snap.

&#x200B;

I compared the situation to my dad who NEVER apologizes for getting into these rage modes.  He just ignores it and pretends like it doesn't happen.  I told my mom that I'm calling her because I don't want to be like him.  I wanted to discuss (in a calm manner) what was causing me to get angry, rather than not addressing the issue.  We went on to talk for another 5-10 minutes and said our goodbyes (said ""I love you"" to each other which I almost never say to my mom).  We spoke again after she had dinner and I mentioned to her that I was in therapy for this exact reason (to deal with the rage stuff).  We then spoke for another 20 minutes about unrelated stuff...

&#x200B;

\*Now I think after the initial yelling/rage episode I should NOT have called my mom back so soon.  I should have waited until after I was done driving and kind of given myself a chance to cool off but at the time I wanted to address it head on.  I plan to discuss this with my therapist next week but after that will not see her for almost a month.  I'm kind of looking for general advice on working on that kind of rage issues.  TBH I'm not sure if the therapist I'm seeing is even helping me with this (we were talking about it today but that is my vibe in general after \~8 months).  My doctor mentioned Lexapro for me two weeks ago as a suggestion if I'm not able to control my anxiety and if it is getting worse....  Is that a good idea?  I do have some Alprazolam (Xanax) that I have and I DON'T want to rely on that at (I did take one today but it is rare for me to take these).  I want to keep practicing what I'm learning about techniques about anxiety but this rage issue is what I'm truly focusing on figuring out how to deal with.",4,anxiety

"Content warning: Mentions VERY sensitive topics like sexual tendencies. Read full story before commenting.

I've always been a pretty anxious person, however, anxiety has started being a bigger problem when I joined university for the first time in 2020. However, life was somewhat good I gotta say, I was on a relationship with someone I liked for a long time (long distance relationship, not relevant in this topic) and I had just joined a SFW roleplay server (not gonna mention which game or name of the server) which I really liked and had made a couple of really good friends on.

But, in 2021, things started to change.
First noticeable thing that happened, is that I joined a very toxic friend group from that same server which also was a bit influential on me. This group was affecting my mental health because of how abusive they were... however, i tried to forget about so, since i liked roleplaying with them. Besides this, I have to mention that this group had tendencies to be very sexual, something that I definitely was NOT at the time - I had barely turned 18.

Second, my relationship ended for a really shitty reason. My ex started ignoring me for days, weeks... eventually I noticed it wasn't working so... I broke it off. Loneliness started to hit, and because of this friend group, and also my natural growth as a human being, so were my sexual tendencies. 

Third, I was on a university course I was not sure I wanted to be in. I had chosen Architecture because I've always seen people choosing hobbies as their jobs and deeply regretting it... so I tried choosing something different... it clearly didn't work.

Well, things weren't going great for me in 2021... and especially after my break up.
I started hanging more with said toxic friend group since the roleplay helped me forget the bad aspects of my life... that also didn't help.
In this group, mainly with people that were 18 or older, there was a younger person (around the age of 15-16). This person was a really good friend of mine and we helped each other in hard times.

After a few months of being friends with said person, I shared my thoughts for the other people in the friend group, saying i didn't think they were good influences and that they'd be better off not talking as much to them.

For some reason, they decided to share this with the other people in the group, and those people said the things I said were very 'groomer-like' and that I was backstabbing them. Sure, I admit to the backstabbing part but... grooming? When? How? What?
On a Monday morning after 3 hours of sleep I get a text from one of those toxic friends saying 'we need to have a talk'.
They added me to a GC on discord where we went through the whole thing and they basically convinced me that I was a groomer.

I felt destroyed. Was I really that bad?
I shared all the screenshots with my real friends, and none of them felt like I had done such thing. They were essentially guilt tripping me.

A few days after this drama happened I was banned from the server... the admins thought I had done actual grooming so I got permanently banned.

This... is when things started getting worse.

As a way to escape the server, I started burying myself in NSFW discord servers, trying desperately to find a way to get some 'fun'... you get what I mean.
Eventually, I started messaging my ex as well, deciding to give her another chance, thinking I had thought of her the wrong way.

Why? You must ask.
Well, she was going through exam season when we broke up. And basically even though I understood all her dedication to studying and everything, she never took 1 minute of her day to message me 'good morning' or anything at all... but maybe I was just too harsh.

Eventually, we broke up again. Because, she was having trust issues with me apparently? Complicated case, so I won't get too much into it.

After breaking up I started burying myself in NSFW servers again. I had some friend that found out about this that got really mad at me because she caught feelings for me...

After all this, I thought it was time to move on from those discord servers and appeal for my ban on the server. I did so, and it got accepted.

Fresh start, I thought.

And indeed it was... I mean not everything was perfect, but i felt a little better.

I got on another relationship with a girl I met on there but it lasted for about... 2 weeks? Essentially she said she had some problems with her ex that she had to take care of and said she needed a break. Obviously as any decent human being, I understood, so I let her go.

After 4 weeks of the break, I found out she was dating someone else. She implied she still liked me but the dude asked her for a chance so she decided to give him one.

Whatever... kinda forgot about her for a while.

During that time, I had finally quit Architecture and decided to work on a local factory - around May / June 2022 (19 y/o) - while I didnt into another course I could finally save some money.

Said girl has been on and off with me ever since... we had a stupid fight during that same summer and stopped talking for a few months, but eventually started talking to each other again. She said she still had interest in me however... at that time I was talking with someone else already.

I know I have a problem.... at least with her. I know I'm being manipulated or something but... how can I not know she's not being fake?

Either way... the other person I was talking with was 2 years and 6 months younger then me (I was 20 and they were 17, almost 18 - this will come in handy later in the story). Eventually we started talking and they said they weren't resdy for a relationship which I totally understood at the time. Relationships are hard.

However, we both had already confessed to each other, and, since I had someone going around on the server saying shit about me and other people (basically any adult dating anyone under 18 - no matter the age gap - gets banned) I thought it would be best to let them know we should probably keep things a secret for a bit at least until they turned 18 or things calmed down in the server.

I was on a good spot on the server... i was part of the Event Team of said server and was an active member overall. However, as you may have guessed, things didn't end so well.

After a while, me and said person had a fight. They were thirsty for attention and I couldn't give them it since I was busy with university and other things of the server (by this time I had already joined Computer Engineering at my local Uni) so they got mad at me. Eventually, I blocked them since I had enough of their stupid comments...

So, essentially what happened was I got banned, again, for the same reason. Do you guys think I groomed them? I mean I never once forced them on a relationship... we just genuinely liked each other but they used this as an opportunity to get me banned.

Since then I started burying myself in NSFW servers again. Apparently a lot of people are spreading shit about me on the server... and even though I still have a lot of friends on there, I've pretty much lost contact with them since I was banned almost 2 months ago.

Besides this, a lot of my game accounts were hacked so I lost a lot of shit...

The other girl that also supposedly still liked me basically doesnt give a shit anymore and I also have no one, and I mean almost no one to talk to on a daily basis so I just feel lonely but can't help but question if there's something wrong with me... i feel anxious everyday and I cant help it since I have no real place to make friends anymore... I am 20 and I feel hopeless, whether we're talking relationships or friendships in general...

Give me your thoughts if you have reached this far.

Edit: forgot to mention. The first person that i supposedly 'groomed' eventually came out to me saying sorry that I shouldn't have gotten banned for that reason since I didnt actually do anything like so .",4,anxiety

"So I almost posted this in a less anxious sub but I caught myself in time.

I just accepted a sales associate position at a new store, new as in its still empty as of today. My manager mentioned that leading up to the store opening, we'll have to get things set up. Unloading trucks and putting the store together. I immediately panicked. I've never accepted unloading and stocking jobs because I always think trucks and stock rooms will have rodents. And rodents have hantavirus. I'm obsessed with hantavirus because growing up, my parents' house was over run with rodents. I felt so hopeless.

Idk much about stocking but if any of you have had such jobs, did you ever encounter rodents or bugs? I suppose I could just wear a mask or something. Oh I want to apologize in advance for those of you who are about to go Google hantavirus.",5,paranoia

"I'm honestly so tired I cannot even write a thought that makes sense.
I have trouble at sleeping again, at eating.
I thought I was mostly out of it but I'm not, I was never out. Just because I had few weeks okayish I thought I was good again.
It's been three years like this, the idea of keep living this way makes me lose my mind.
I'm soon starting my master degree but I don't even care, I'm sure I'll just have lot of problems and I'm too stupid to continue in my field. I'm mediocre at everything.
I'm struggling to concentrate even just to watch a movie, let alone studying.
Suicidal thoughts are back and stronger than ever and I'm alone, I just have my boyfriend who doesn't care that much about me and I have almost no friends.
Almost nobody would miss me.
A few months ago my boyfriend's friend (he was my friend too even if not super super close) took his own lives leaving all of us so shocked, we all loved him so much, he had a girlfriend who clearly loved him and a wonderful family.
I feel so bad to be still alive while he's not here anymore, he still has so many people that care about him. 
I just keep thinking that maybe if I had offed myself before, maybe just maybe he wouldn't have done the same. I don't know why I keep thinking this. Maybe if I hadn't been invested so much in my own depression I would have noticed his.

"I have reached an all time low in my life . 
I myself am a piece of shit person with personality problems,
I have little to no friends or the support that an actual friend would offer.
My ex of 8 years dumped me for a guy who‚Äôs entire family is in the towns police force and they were able to have to cops come while i was at my apt to grab some stuff and file a bs complaint against me to get a restraining order on me making me lose my apt and my possessions my pets and over 7k in cash 
She is continuing in her pursuit with 4 charges of assault, one even being armed assault, and even said that i broke my restraining order and they took it seriously with. No proof whatsoever.  The one girl that i had been talking to for about 5 years that made me have problems with my relationship as i was hesitant to go towards her ended up rejecting me without even giving me a chance after i got left by my ex, yes i am a piece of shit for talking to someone else. We had a toxic relationship. My job is not interesting , i am not very good at it, its hard on my body and health i wake up at 5am every day . Im addicted to pot and alcohol , basically anything i can consume, the salary a make is no longer enough to afford a house or a decent appartement. And im pretty sure i have an std .
Nobody really cares that much and the people who do as much as it is mean , aren‚Äôt necessarily living the lifestyle i am looking for, i am not that interesting of a person who makes no new friends or if i do cannot keep them , i cant commit or make decisions for the life of me , 
People have killed themselves for so much less who had so much more going for them and then there i am not very good looking abojt to turn 30 , constantly reminded on how small and skinny i am , i am so sick and tired of what life has to offer and i jjst want to fucking end it all , who would ever want my life or to be me? Nobody thats who.",2,depression
"I just lost a bunch of friends for various reasons and I‚Äôm realizing I have a pattern of letting people use me or not realizing and then they discard me when they‚Äôre done. I get a lot of positive attention from strangers because I am conventionally attractive, but then nobody seems to care about my feelings or the things I like. They project their own desires and feelings on me, and then when they‚Äôre done or they realize I‚Äôm not a typical person with typical interests and personality traits they don‚Äôt feel the need to treat me with basic decency anymore. And sometimes in a really cruel way. 

For example I recently had someone who I thought was a friend essentially say that now that she isn‚Äôt attracted to me romantically anymore (probably because she realized I‚Äôm a little to weird), she doesn‚Äôt want anyone thinking she still is if we hang out because she doesn‚Äôt want that to get in the way of other people being interested in her. It made me feel completely objectified and undervalued as a human. 

I try so hard to be kind and genuinely bring positivity and joy into the world, and I know I‚Äôm not perfect either, but the constant rejection is starting to get to me.",1,autism

I‚Äôm so paranoid about using public bathrooms because I‚Äôm scared there are cameras behind the mirrors or in those flood lights or whatever. I‚Äôve been paranoid about that since I was around 4. My dad‚Äôs family used to have a restaurant and I asked him about the flood lights and I think he jokingly said it was a camera. Ever since, I‚Äôve never been comfortable if one is in the bathroom. I‚Äôm also paranoid about going to my both of my sisters homes and scared there are cameras behind their mirrors.

"I'm new to this community so idk if people have a big problem with self diagnosing, I know some communities don't have a problem with it, but if you do then let me just explain first.

The main reason I'm decided to diagnose myself is because I'm in the military. I've tried to pursue a legitimate psychological diagnosis but if I was really certain about doing that and it turned out to be true, that I really am on the spectrum, then I'd be put up for a medical board and might get separated. I can't afford to get separated right now.

I do still feel weird about diagnosing myself, I've never been much of a gatekeeper when it comes to anything really, not even mental health, if someone says they think they have some mental disorder or some sort of neurodivergence then I don't discount them, but I always tell them that nothing can take the place of an official diagnosis and I encourage them to do that. If they keep doing, just going full-on self-diagnosing and telling people about it and whatnot before they have a real diagnosis then it feels weird to me. I don't plan on telling anyone though, I'd like to tell my mom or dad but I feel uncomfortable telling them something like this so matter of fact when I don't have a professional opinion to back up what I'm saying, part of me knows they're just not going to believe me and tell me I'm wrong. Even so, knowing that I'm not going to tell anyone and I'm just keeping this to myself, I still feel weird about it.

I've been feeling a lot better though, it feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. There's just all sorts of things that've been happening in my life since my earliest memory and none of it ever made any sense, I always felt awkward and weird and I thought something was wrong with me and it really just made me feel awful. Ever since the idea came to me that I might be on the spectrum though, things have just been lining up and making a lot more sense. I try to be as conservative as possible when I try to evaluate whether something ""sounds like autism"" or not, but I'm still biased and I'm not a professional so I'm not saying it with such a high degree of certainty, but it's a really fitting explanation.

It just feels nice to not feel like such a freak or such a terrible person anymore, I feel like I understand myself better now. It used to be that I'd say something weird (apparently) and people would react negatively and then I'd feel bad because obviously I must've  been inconsiderate or stupid or mean or something else, but it didn't feel that way to me so then I felt even worse for not realizing I was being so terrible. Now it's like that feedback loop has finally stopped, I still feel a little bad but now I just feel alright accepting myself for all the weird things I do or say and it all makes sense. I know I'm not a bad person, if I say something that might be inconsiderate of course I still apologize, but now I just don't beat myself up about it because I know I'm not a bad person, and really that's because I've come to understand how I think and feel through my limited research. It feels really good, my self confidence is on the rise for the first time in years.

So yeah, I'm diagnosing myself. I just wanted to get it off my chest and explain it to a community that might offer some support or advice because I haven't told anyone in my life. I hope nobody tears into me.",1,autism

"As a 24-year-old guy, I'm looking for advice on how to overcome the challenges I faced during my childhood with strict and controlling parents. Growing up, my parents were extremely strict and had a lot of rules that didn't allow me to have any freedom or independence. As a result, I didn't have many friends and felt isolated from my peers. My parents also painted a fake picture of our life to others, always praising me and saying I was a good child who didn't do anything wrong. In reality, I didn't have the social skills or experiences that other kids my age had because my parents saw things like dating and having sex as taboo.

Now that I've moved out of my parents' house and achieved financial freedom, I feel like it's a good time to start working on myself and overcoming the challenges I faced during my childhood. I'm struggling with social situations and have a hard time fitting in because I never learned how to make friends or communicate effectively. I also have trust issues and get paranoid about having people in my life. As a result, my thinking patterns are messed up and I'm struggling to navigate relationships. I feel like I missed out on a lot and I'm not sure how to overcome this and learn the social skills I need to survive in the real world.

"So as long as I can remember there's always been a hint of melancholy below the surface. A single blue flower in a field of sunflowers. Some days the blue would spread to the other petals, others they'd be the natural yellow, and it was a balance that, although challenging, I thought I'd learned to live with. Well, I'm 18 now and something must have evolved because the whole field has decayed.

Depression runs in my family quite strongly, I think I've got it. I thought it was just situational depression (it's not been an easy time) but even after escaping all of it, it's still there, screaming instead of whispering now. I can't picture a future, I can't see myself in this world as anything other than a mistake or a cosmic joke. I feel like I'm simply just not meant for this world. If dying wasn't painful, I think I might have done it by now. I tested those waters fairly recently and I'm too ashamed to tell people close to me about it.

Doctors and therapists tell me all the coping mechanisms but for some reason they never bloody stick, they just slide off my brain the second they land, or they work once or twice but never always. I'm at a really precarious point mentally. I think I'm getting out but I'm still researching the least painful ways to die. I know that logically I don't want to die and that I just want this feeling to end, but if this feeling is clinical and festering inside me forever then isn't it the same difference? Everyone tells me I'll learn to live with it, but I don't want a life where the slightest inconvenience causes some reaction that makes oceans roar in my chest. The past week has been spent crying on the floor, sobbing in the street, collapsing in front of my friends - it's so pathetic. Is life going to be a pendulum swinging between emptiness and drowning in uncontrollable sadness?

"So for a while now, whenever it's bedtime and I lay down to sleep, my mind kinda starts to panic and basically develops a mind of its own.

It stops happening if I start doing something like I'm writing this post now but eventually you have to stop doing anything to fall asleep.

At this point, I just know that as soon as I'm gonna hit the bed, this is going to be waiting for me. The mental torture I have to go through is something that I can't even begin to describe. Not just due to this thinking, but also because I'm so tired physically and I just have to go through this till my body gives up, which can be a few hours and sometimes takes till the morning.

So I just hate/fear the night now and I just don't wanna lay down and stop doing anything, till my body allows me to, but I still try as I have this slight hope that I might be able to avoid it today if I dont think about it. 

Honestly, I don't know. Idk whether I cause it myself by thinking that it's gonna happen or this is just how it is now?

"My work is contract based. Since I started working 8 years ago, I've never had a break. Since our contracts end a few weeks apart we decided to take 3 months off work this summer. 

I finished work a few weeks ago and I am struggling to relax and enjoy myself. Activities I find fun (painting, drawing and other creative things I enjoy) and want to do feel so overwhelming and make me anxious. I also am finding it hard to sleep. The first few days off I only slept 4 hours.

I want to get stuff done around the house but I can't and I just don't have energy. But when I try to relax, watch some Netflix or go for a walk I get this panicked and stressed feeling.

If anyone has been through this I'd love to hear your experience or if anyone has anything that worked for them. 

Thanks",4,anxiety

"I apologize in advance, I tend to go on tangents and this post doesn't really have a goal in mind. I'm also fairly new to reddit. Anyhow..

Fresh off a breakup from a relationship of 5 years, having to move back home with my family. It's barely been a month but my sense of time has been distorted. Some days seem to fly by, some days feel like an eternity. I am facing loneliness for the first time in years, despite knowing I have a good support circle of coworkers and friends who have been really crucial to my well being in this time. I've always found myself latching on/jumping into relationships very quickly because I never really liked the idea of being alone and the negative connotation I attached to it. The thought of going to the movies alone, or taking myself out to eat alone, still makes me really uncomfortable. I'm scared because I want to go out and explore more of the bustling bay area, but I can't bring myself to go to these places as an individual and potentially seek out new friendships, relationships, or just to distract myself.

The icing on the cake is that I have always struggled with perfectionism, am subject to spiral and catastrophize more often, and generally just always feeling like I need to figure what it is I want to do with my life and distancing myself from people I labeled as ""stagnant"".  I've struggled with MDD since I was a pre-teen and was formally diagnosed a few years ago. I was on anti-depressants when I was about 19, and pre-emptively requested a prescription in Nov. of last year as I was anticipating a major change (transitioning from my job of 4 yrs). I think this is what has been keeping me afloat. I didn't anticipate to break up with my partner, but by then I was pretty adjusted to the medication.

(I feel) I've always valued and contributed to my emotional well being and ways to be a better friend/communicator. I've had many therapists throughout the years and always appreciated the value in opening up, as well as how understood I felt by each of my therapists. On the other side of that coin I know I am an irritable person and struggle with regulating my emotions. I tell myself that as long as I try every day to be better, things will work themselves out.

It's hard most days. I have all this momentum with job interviews, teaching myself new things like riding a motorcycle and how to (finally) swim, reading more books, discovering more podcasts, but it all is just busy work. Stuff to distract me. I often find myself asking, or more so stating, ""What's the point?"" All these things, don't seem to matter because I can't envision a future where I move on from this split and feel good about my accomplishments. Even comparing myself to 5 years ago, I know I've come a long way and I know I have my whole life ahead of me, but I can't accept it. I can't come to terms with it.

The universe works out in ways we cannot foresee, and it is unfolding as it should. I fear the unknown and what lies beyond this plane of existence, so I know I have to see this one life through. I allow myself to cry and feel my emotions, and find myself feeling a bit easier afterwards. I know it gets easier. It has to. There's a point to all of this, I just am not privy to it.

I've listened to this Sinatra song once a day, I know this is a popular song. I just hope someone else feels a bit better after listening.

I told 2 of my co workers that I have it.

I told person (A) first. He was opening up to me about his stuff, anxiety, depression, said he was going to therapy to fix him self. My reply was that ""you're not broken. You're just healing. Plus don't worry bc I'm schizophrenic so I kinda know how it feels."" He has been avoiding me I think.

I told person (B) bc she is friends with my old neighbors and we have kinda become friends. I was really frustrated and was ranting about how tired I am. How I have to mask all the time at work. She asked if I was on any meds and that many people in her family have Bipolar Disorder. She was worried she has it.

"Hello. I'm new to the group but I guess I just need someone to talk to, some form of support outside of my immediate family and therapist. This last 9 months has been a total shitshow. I left my career of 6 years because of an issue with my management and DM specifically. So I took 3 months of STD, and quit. I had another job lined up. Went into training and busted my Ass, right before I hit my 3 month ""guaranteed"" period, my manager brought me into his office and told me that the job wasn't a good fit. But it gets better - he said he would give me 8 days of PTO, so I had time to find another job. Which is great, although now I don't believe I qualify for Unemployment. So now I'm out of work, and I'm literally getting into my head so bad, I'm gaining weight, I'm anxious, I have no direction in my life. I hate myself. I'm feeling like I have screwed up my own life.

"Sorry in advance this is a little long. 

A little background information, my ex boyfriend has what i'd say are paranoid visual/auditory hallucinations and I don't know if it's possible that it stems from his trust issues or his previous drug usage (acid/shrooms/weed) He would usually project onto me and accuse me of cheating, which I never did. I tried my hardest to reassure him.

There have been prior instances where he's accused me of cheating, however this is the first time he's gotten 'proof'. I had been living in a new apartment with my mom for just about a month. We were sleeping on skype as we did every night, but this one night he recorded the call. 

The video is dark, there are no lights in my room, the only light is what's coming from my laptop screen. In the video you can hear me exhale and groan/moan 'mm-mmm' (the closed mouth version of no, if that makes sense) and that's when you can hear me and clearly see me turn over in my sleep as my arm is now visible. I make the same 'mm-mmm' noise and then there's what sounds like someone else's voice whispering ""come on"" and in response to it, I give out a short groan/moan, 'mmmgh' ( I don't really know how else to describe the sound, but it's like a response someone would give if someone was bothering you in your sleep). Shortly after he wakes up and shines his phone flashlight into the screen, lighting up my room and making both, my face and body visible. My eyes are closed and my arm is in the position it was when I turned around. (he unmuted himself afterwards which made the audio quieter, getting rid of the loud waterfall noise that was happening throughout the video) 

When he shared the video with me, his first and only belief is I cheated, which is frustrating considering he believes in more spiritual/paranormal things, whereas I don't, but I heard the 'voice' as well. I tried to reassure him the best I could considering I was asleep. I started thinking a bit irrationally, like maybe someone was speaking through the vent above me, or because it is a new apartment maybe maintenance or someone is coming in everynight to talk to me? maybe it's my own voice, but it doesn't sound like me. I even started thinking maybe I have DID   
maybe I just heard this noise too many times that it's just ingrained into my mind forever as ""come on"" 

 I really have no idea and its truly always bothered me that he never believed me. I'm genuinely just left wondering what it was or if anything at all.",5,paranoia
"I‚Äôve just been in such a slump mentally and I need to get this off my chest even if no one reads or reacts to it. I‚Äôve just felt so lonely relationship wise, like my longest relationship has been 3 months long and I just have so much love to give someone and I know that sounds general and cliche but it‚Äôs the truth. I try every single dating app and while I do get matches it seems like the matches I‚Äôm into never respond or barely respond or barely wanna hold a conversation and it makes me even more upset.

And I understand people around me will tell me things like ‚Äúoh it‚Äôll get better‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôll find someone when you least expect it‚Äù but even when I try actively to find a gf it seems like an unreachable task. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I just wish a girl I liked gave my a chance and for once tried fighting for me. Like that‚Äôs all I ask for honestly.

"im 33 and ever since ive left college i feel like i've just been consistently trying to process/deal with feeling overwhelmed by how lonely and isolating adulthood is. Everyone i know is busy enough where i only see my 'friends' once every 3 months(at best). I get it, kids, jobs, im not blaming people. When trying to meet people, its like swimming upstream to find people with any common interests, and even harder finding someone that has chemistry with you. i have chronic digestive problems so i cant really go out to eat or drink, which makes up a majority of how adults socialize from what i can tell. To be entirely honest, i dont like doing that anyways, i find no joy in being surrounded by loud strangers, so while most people are grabbing a drink to feel connected, i only feel isolated. 

 I have a helpful strategy of being paranoid of my depressive thinking patterns, but its not as effective here because while I feel like ive lost my passion for anything i was passionate for, im starting to get paranoid that my depression is either so invasive that its tricking me into believing life is this empty, or (when i think about it logically) being a lonely human all the time is making me depressed and passionless. I spoke to my girlfriend about joining clubs to try to meet people and i literally have zero interest. I hate large groups of people, and meeting new people in this manner. I just get anxiety and i will feel uncomfortable the entire time, and not to be overtly negative, but ive tried it enough times with no success that ive lost my desire to 'get back out there' so to speak, because its always amounted to lost time and stressful experiences, and having a lot of phone numbers i dont want to call.

Anyways, the one thing i miss about my college experience was having a community of people i would see every day that was working on the same goals and could help eachother out, or hangout regularly. Now it just feels like im floating in a sea of nothing, waiting for a random ship to sail by, and im not looking forward to doing this for another 20, 30, or 40 years. This isnt fulfilling. I genuinely don't like living like this, and frankly, im surprised anyone does.",2,depression

"Last night, I lost it. I cut myself in other one place I can feel it. More than a year ago now, I injured my leg badly in a vehicle accident and today, there's some nerve damage that prevents me from feeling that area. 
So last night while I was taking a shower, I heard someone aggressively banging on the door and pulling at the knob and it scared the absolute shit out of me. Believing it was my mom, I unlocked the door and told her the door was unlocked if she needed in, while I hid back in the shower. We do this sort of thing all the time. Being too anxious to finish my shower, I opened my door to ask if everything was okay because I was getting no response from anybody. So I put my clothes on as fast as I could and as I was doing so, I heard my Step Dad say he threw up. Mom was super pissed but kept insisting everything was fine.
I knew better though. This made me so upset last night that after having a long cry session, I tool pit my scalpel and completely hacked up my leg.
Today I didn't get up for work on time, so I had to figure out what I could wear with this huge bandage over my cuts. My head still hurts, I'm sweating like crazy, and I'm not sure how I will be at my toxic job.

I‚Äôm just wondering if any one here also experiences some kind of annual depressive moods - I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety 3 years ago and this time three years ago I was severely depressed. I‚Äôll spare the details but I‚Äôm a lot better mentally these days. Although some days are harder than others, but for the most part, I have healed and there has been a overwhelmingly huge amount of self discovery and growth. To which I‚Äôm very grateful, but it seems ever since I‚Äôve gone through my depression, the main bout of it anyways, this time of year, late April, early May I‚Äôm more prone to get back in that mind-set and the same feelings and emotions I felt when I was in the thick-of-it always return. It‚Äôs like something is in the air for me and never fails to trigger my depression, and it‚Äôs super easy for me to fall back into bad habits. 

I‚Äôm OK and I‚Äôm safe, have a good support system, a councillor and coping mechanisms, I‚Äôm just curious is all and wondering if this isn‚Äôt just a me thing, how do you folks cope or prepare if you know a time of year will trigger you, etc., much love and good energy ‚ù§Ô∏è",2,depression
"For so long now, I've wanted to die. Whether it be me cutting my wrist or blowing my head off, it was always one way after another. I'm going into ninth grade this year, and I had a relationship with this girl, who said she loved me forever. Now I did know it would end at some point, but the one thing that made this even worse when she broke up with me, is the fact that I had gave her everything. I spent over $3,000 in 6 months, 6 MONTHS MAN?? She was also the first girl to take my virginity, which at the time I thought was special, but then realized it didn't matter so much. She had cheated on me 5 times while I was dating her. When I found out, she explained each way to my face, on how she fucked these guys. At first, I didn't care. I didn't know that holding my feelings balled up inside me, was going to cause me to cut my wrist 2 weeks later. I was sent straight to the hospital and was stuck there for 1 week and a half. Getting home to see my family in tears.. hurt me, soooo fucking much. The one thing I never want to do again is to fall in love. If I do, I'll purposefully put myself in the E-R.

"First and foremost, don't want to downplay depression. It affects everyone differently. But the question I'm asking here is if everyone eventually goes through depression at some point in their lives. Almost like it's a normal process in life
My depression started when I got my first job when I came to realize that life for me is boring and repetitive. And that life objectively has no meaning, basically nihilism. So now i got curious, if it's part of life why does society choose to ignore it all together? Would be nice to not only say that it's normal but also how can we collectively improve from it",2,depression

"Alright, so for the past few years I've been heavily depressed and I've also got anhedonia (the lack to feel pleasure). Recently it's been getting worse, i:e Suicidal Thoughts becoming more frequent, Unmotivated and even planning out my own ""self-end."" I've always been a night owl, and my sleep schedule is usually like this; I wake up at like 3-5 PM and go to sleep at around 6-8 AM (Yeah, I know it's weird). About 9 months ago, we moved into a house located a small lake. We've been living her ever since and no issues so far, but recently (about a month ago or so) I started hearing odd noises in the night. I went outside one morning at 3AM to give my brother something (he lives in a small flat outside). I then admired the views of the stars a bit and walked around the house. When I got to the front yard, I heard sounds of something screaming in the distance, yet closeby. It clearly sounded like a woman, but far worse. If I had to describe it, it'd be like a demonic woman screaming in a movie or something. And then a few days later, I was in the bathroom one morning also at around 3AM. I heard dogs barking and a howl in the distance. It didn't sound like a dog or anything, since I heard dogs barking. If I had to describe it, it sounded like a ""demonic werewolf"" (if that makes any sense). And since then, I've been hearing this deep, eerie croaking sound every night (when outside). 

And just now, at around 3-4 AM...I went to the kitchen to prepare some food, but as I placed food in my plate; I heard a horrific sound that sounded like a beast/demon thing throwing up (like a metal screech or something). 

My older brother also has more or less the same sleep pattern as me, and everytime I heard a sound...I'd ask him if he heard it or if he could check outside. Each time, he claims to not have heard or see anything. He called me paranoid this morning when I told him about the sound I had just heard. So I don't know, I just hear these very odd, eerie and disturbing sounds at times. I heard them quite loudly and clearly. I don't think I'm crazy, but nobody else hears them. 

Am I being paranoid for no reason, or is something wrong with me? My brother claims that it's ""all of my negativity"" driving me crazy...",5,paranoia

"I'm no good at anything. There's nothing special, unique or original about me. I don't offer anything to anyone, I have no talents, no skills, no hobbies, no interests or prospects and am super boring to be around. I am the most boring and uninteresting person imaginable.

Nobody knows me. I have only two friends. One thinks I'm Iron Man and that I'm an unstoppable force domineering life. He's never met the raging, on/off drug addict, borderline abusive me. He doesn't know me. My other friend is better than me in every way. He's smarter, stronger, more talented, funnier, more charismatic and more respected than me and never lets me forget it. He treats me like shit. Mocking everything I say and do, never letting me finish a sentence, rubbing in my failures, making sure I know how much better he is than me. I never thought I'd say it about a friend this close but I fucking hate him.

I give and give and get nothing in return from any of my friends I've made over the years. They all just abandon me at their earliest convenience. The friends I actually do like don't like me and the ones I hate stick around forever.

Most of all, I want love. I didn't like the only girlfriend I've had, she was too quiet and even more reserved and awkward than I was. We were very cold and distant from each other. While the girls I did like were indifferent to me and sometimes seemed to hate me. One in particular that I worked with a year ago sticks out to me. She was my idea of perfect, she was so beautiful, sweet (even to me), intelligent and made me happy. I wanted to tell her how I felt, I wanted hold her and love her or at the very least ask her out and get to know her even better. But fear of rejection got the better of me and before I knew it, she moved three states away.

The only pleasure I get now is escaping into fantasy and imagining what life could have been like if I actually gave a shit. I know I'm young (20) but I'm so ill-equipped for this world that it would inevitably chew me up and spit me out. I already flunked out of college and got fired from my last job.

It‚Äôs been fascinating but awful timing. I have a major exam Wednesday and have been desperately trying to improve my grade and it was going well but now today I have done nothing and the chances of getting it up this close with a day wasted are very low. The only reason I have stoped looking into it now is because I have to go to work.

I'm either bipolar or just generally depressed and have been for about my entire life, I've never been to therapy.

I used to fly home for Christmas and New years, and tried to reach summer, but haven't been home since the beginning of the pandemic.

For years now, any contact with my family started with them criticizing my choices, like nothing I've done since highschool was remotely acceptable. My career, embarrassing, my relationships, failures, my achievements now go unannounced since i don't bother telling anyone... Two years ago for like... Mental health Day or something... My older sister made a Facebook post about her struggle with depression, got an outpouring of support from her extended family(shes married with two children) and her assistant maybe number of friends, and then like... A week later she started texting me all pissed off that i missed her kids birthdays... I didn't bother responding, i did consider offing myself... Not that i actually see that as an option, i don't think it's in my character to do... I was raised to take care of others and to sacrifice and give and be kind and now that I'm so depressed i can't do any of those things i just remain silent while everyone else gets mad at me... I feel like any attempt to to reach out will just lead to criticisms that will just make me resent and/or hate my family, which i might already anyhow. So yeah... That's where i am...

Whenever there's like an event organized by this group and I can't make it due to some other reasons, my minds flooded with questions - what if I'm going to be left out for everything else? What if they're going to do something in a sense that has a negative impact on me etc.. How can I deal with these issues.

"For me growing up, I asked for help with my depression and I never received it until I was 14, when I got hospitalized for trying to kill myself. I was lucky when I found my first therapist. He understood me while I was going through everything. The process of taking pills was so scary and draining. All the different medication I tried, the mood swings, finding the right dosage, talking to a psychiatrist that didn‚Äôt really understand me. It was all too much with everything that was going on in my life but I had my therapist who I had such a good relationship with to help me through it all.

I decided to stop doing it when my grandfather in Florida passed away during covid. I felt the pain but it was muted, like I didn‚Äôt recognize myself. It scared the fuck out of me and I just decided to quit on it. 

Now, life has been really hard lately, harder than I‚Äôve ever experienced and I‚Äôve been really desperate.

I am 34M and I'm looking for some suggestions from the community. I have been battling depression my whole life, but when my dad passed 7 years ago it ramped up to a whole new level. I've been having depressive episodes on and off some worse than others. I'm just coming out of a really bad one, worst one since 2020 tho, but I'm really sick of struggling each day just to get by.

I am in therapy and have been using medical cannabis to help. Which it does, the downside is I can't be high at work which is a good chunk of my day. I think I want to try medication again, I just don't know what to try and am worried about the side effects.

"I‚Äôm preparing for exams that will grant me a certificate that I can speak in english, it‚Äôs useful to get jobs and things like that. 

One of the tasks is just speaking, you have a person asking you questions about yourself and you have to answer it in 3/4 sentences. 

The thing is, a lot of these questions are really personal or touching on politics and I don‚Äôt want to answer honestly,
especially if it inevitably touches on subjects like mental health affecting my day to day functioning, or politics in my country that are quite hostile to me considering I‚Äôm lgbt. 

The obvious answer would be to just make stuff up, my teacher even encourages it, they‚Äôre not questioning me and checking my past, they want to know if I can speak english. 

But I just can‚Äôt think of anything. I make myself look like an idiot on my english classes, because my teacher ask me a simple question and my brain just shuts off. Like she asks me what my future plans are and instead of making some shit up about some dream career or where I want to live, my brain short circuits and I have no idea what to say. Doing this on an actual exam would make me fail it. 

Right now I‚Äôm searching for as much questions that I could possibly be asked and I‚Äôm writing down some made up things that I could say instead of opening up to random people.

"I am struggling to communicate ADHD to my partner

I‚Äôve been struggling with this for a while now but it doesn‚Äôt seem like I can do anything at the right quality or speed to help. My gf and I have been together for 5 years and recently moved in together last year. Over the last year my gf and I have had what I consider to be pretty normal disagreements about cleanliness and chores divided. She has much higher standards than I do which I have tried to meet but we have an argument once a month where she says she feels like I‚Äôm ignoring chores until she just has to do them. 

Yesterday we talked again and she said that she expected me to improve more than I have in the last year. I keep telling her I will try to change my system to help me achieve what I need to but she told me not to try but to just do it. I feel like all I have every been able to do is try. I feel like I have been taking on half and have been getting better at cleaning to her requirements. (for example: we split dinner prep and cleaning and a year ago I didn‚Äôt consider wiping down all the counters and table part of cleaning up after dinner but I do now) I can definitely get the tunnel vision. She has insisted that she doesn‚Äôt want to nag me and I don‚Äôt want to make extra work for her by her nagging me but I‚Äôm struggling to meet this expectation. 

I have tried a few systems to try to clean different parts of the house on a schedule but it doesn‚Äôt always work for me because sometimes I run out of time after work or I‚Äôm so tired I get distracted in the middle of the chore and it doesn‚Äôt get done. She always tells me I should just listen and not make her repeat herself. 

I struggle to communicate that I have been trying. I asked her last night if there was a way that going forward we could discuss these issues positively when I‚Äôm obviously trying but not hitting the mark. For example if I sweep but forget to get under the couch, she could say ‚ÄúI appreciate you sweeping but I noticed that you might have forgotten about under the couch.‚Äù She said this creates more work for her and she doesn‚Äôt want that. I‚Äôm struggling to find a system that will work for us and not make me feel like I‚Äôm failing until I achieve perfection. 

We have a dog that causes some dirt/dander and I bought a Roomba to compensate but she won‚Äôt let me automate the Roomba routine because she works from home and it constantly goes off in the mornings during her meeting when I leave for work. (Trigger based on when I leave the house) I think I struggle a lot with this topic also because I want to move forward with this person in my relationship and I feel that if we were to have kids and the kids were to struggle with adhd the same ways that I do she would be really mean about it. I love my parter but I just feel so stupid for not being able to communicate the difficulties that I have had for the last 2 decades to them.",3,adhd

"Hi /r/paranoia,

Lately my stress and paranoia have been spiraling out of control. A few months ago, a paranoid thought popped into my head, and I cannot get over it. No matter how much I try to reason away the thought, it doesn't change the fact that it affects my mood and self-image. This thought is also about a touchy subject which makes me feel ashamed to admit to it.

I woke up one morning, and I had the thought that someone had molested me in my sleep. 

I couldn't remember whether the doors had been locked the previous night, and I couldn't check in the morning, because my roommate (who wakes up before me) would have locked the door after leaving for work. I don't suspect my roommate did anything to me. I'm instead worried that somebody broke into my house at night, and had their way with me while I was sleeping.

I know that if I was actually molested, then I most likely would have woken up during the act. I didn't feel like I was drugged. I also know that the odds that my roommate and I both forgot to lock the doors is very low. I'm also sure that my dog would have barked at any strangers coming in, and that would have woken me up.

Despite the rational side of my brain telling me that nothing probably happened, this thought continues to eat away at me. It's because I can never be 100% certain what happened. There's no way to definitively prove this thought to be false. 

I haven't told anybody about this, not even my therapist. I'm embarrassed by this thought, especially since there are so many people who have gone through real sexual trauma in their lives. It feels like my delusions are spitting in the face of those who have been legitimately molested and assaulted. I'm worried that I'll never be able to have a healthy sexual relationship again. I just feel so violated.

Does anybody have any advice for overcoming thoughts that can't be proven false?

&#x200B;

TLDR: I had a paranoid thought about something that happened, and I can't prove that it didn't happen. Any advice on overcoming this thought?",5,paranoia

"I've been married for over a decade to the love of my life, but I believe she has a problem with paranoia and I worry it's going to destroy our marriage.  She always feels like people are criticising her, insulting her, judging her negatively, etc.  If someone says something completely innocent, she'll read a lot of unspoken, negative meaning into it and often times either cut them out of her life or lash out in anger at them.  Every time we've visited my family, she's gotten upset over something totally innocent -- someone having a certain expression on their face, or watching too much TV, etc -- and she'll be convinced that it's somehow a personal slight against her and demand we leave early.  I'd say about 40% of the time that she goes out to e.g. pick the kids up from school, she comes back all pissed off at some random person because of the way they exhaled or failed to greet her and she's sure it's an intentional slight.  She can't go to buffet restaurants because she feels the owners are watching how much food she takes.  If someone tells her something, she believes there's a whole mountain of hidden meaning behind it, which is always negative toward her, and this causes her to behave angrily toward them.  Years ago, she agreed to go to therapy (not for this, but because of depression) but only went for one session because she believed the therapist insulted her.  

None of it ever makes sense to me.  I try to discuss it with her and she's never able to rationally provide any evidence for how she feels, but she is 100% certain of her perception.  It enrages her when I am not ""on her side"".  Every time I bring this up because I am concerned about her, it leads to the hugest arguments where she talks about leaving me.  In our marriage, it's basically the only thing we argue about.  Her father is the same, and she often complains about it, but she is unable to see the same behavior in herself. 

She has other issues which, best I can tell, often accompany this.  Trouble sleeping.  Anger problems.  She had a bad childhood.  These issues with paranoia get worse when she's under stress.  

I feel bad about the drama this causes, the relationships it hurts, the things it prevents her from doing.  Mostly I feel bad that this problem robs her of the happiness she deserves in life.  And I'm scared that one day she really will leave me for not ""supporting her"" by playing along with these false perceptions. 

If I explain that I've done a lot of reading online and that the way she behaves is a common thing people experience and seek help for, she'll react badly.  Broaching this subject in any way that proceeds from the assumption that she has a problem and that her perceptions of persecution don't make perfect sense will just result in a blow-up; the same blow-up that we've been having on a regular basis for years.  I don't know where to go from here.",5,paranoia

"Like whenever friends would flake on me all the time, ghost me, not invite me to friend group hangouts, I would always be devastated. This keeps happening to me all the time, and due to being bullied and made fun of for being ""weird"" growing up, it hit really hard.


I recently found out one friend group I'm in, where I thought everyone was hella tight knit and close to eachother... was actually very casual and not close at all. And I realized that a lot of people I thought I was close friends with viewed me as acquaintances. When I go into friendships I look for people I can have really deep connections with, and it has never dawned on me that other people just want someone to have fun with. 

This is so weird to me, but that doesn't mean that it's not normal. It's just different from what I want. They aren't villains, and I'm not an underdog, we just want different things. Still weird to me how people will talk about their deeply traumatic childhood to people they only wanna go bar hopping with, but then again, alcohol can make people spill these things out.


Anyhow, I mention all this in here bc apparently it's a thing with a lot of people on the spectrum; we want an almost soul bounding connection, not just with a romantic partner, but with our friends. And those not on the spectrum seem cool with spending a lot of their time with people they don't really care about all that much. Weird to me, but who am I to judge?

Honestly, knowing this is making my life a lot easier. Now I don't perseverate over why I wasn't invited to the pool party, if I'm a horrible person, or if they are evil and untrustworthy. I just move on.

"Hi there,

I have been living with paranoia for all of my life.

Even before entering nursery school I can remember not being able to sleep because when I closed my eyes I felt like I was being watched.

A key memory of mine was in primary school where I sometimes ran to school as fast as I could because I was able to see shadow creatures far behind me when I moved my head quick enough. Even though it was exhausting it was better than the fear of being followed.

Over time it got worse enough that in secondary school I didn't go to school for a week because I the creatures were getting closer. Almost breaking of the intense fear the creatures just stopped appearing and I went on as if nothing happened.

Through secondary school I started to have moments where the creatures appeared again and over time the frequency started to increase. I was in school acting like usual and suddenly freezing, internally screaming and barely able to breath while a creature stands besides me, barely visible and terrorizing me with its gaze.

I thought often about telling someone about my issues with imaginary monsters but I didn't trust a single person and was scared to appear like a clown so I just lied when someone noticed it. I also considered suicide multiple times and I'm glad I never went through with it.

At some point when I was 20, covid had started, this state was permanent again and made me quit work, I hid in my room below my blanked. I only survived thanks to my roommate paying rent and giving me bread and water. (True MVP here)

I am only able to rely on my roomates telling as most of memories of that time are very blurry and dominated by extreme fear but I remember that I somehow started to actively suppress it. As suppressing it was very demanding I used weed to calm my mind while searching for other solutions and then I had a weird idea while being high.

By recognizing their existence (looking at them) which makes them look real (they usually were shadow/fog like) I got used to it and realized a few days ago that no matter how close they are, they just exist and can't be a danger to me.

&#x200B;

Currently I'm sitting in my room while a bunch of humanoid creatures are watching me which gives me a weird feeling of assurance and well-being, occasionally I look at them in awe for what my mind is able to create. I may struggle a bit with trusting others but that's something I just have to work on.

Is that a good way to accept my paranoia or do I sound insane? I honestly don't know but I'm generally more happy than ever.

Thank you very much for reading and it's very relieving to have written down what has been on my mind for a very long time.",5,paranoia
"hi. I'm 18f. 
I am kind of scared right now.
I opened my Instagram dm requests for the first time in weeks and saw a sugar daddy saying he wanted to get to know me. usually I only message these guys back to mess with them then block them and move on. but this person sent me pictures of a check so I could do the mobile banking feature on the CAPCOM app on my phone.
I did it thinking it would just be bullshit but it wasn't. $1,050 into my account.

so I was obviously very shocked and a bit confused. he tells me to buy bitcoin with it and send it to another account and was starting to get aggressive. 
I know this was stupid so please don't berate me too much in replies but I gave him my phone number and email. like an idiot. I know.
anyway, I blocked him because my friends told me to do so and he emailed me saying he had my information and I needed to return his money so I tried but my account would only let me transfer $200 and then wouldn't let me do any more. 
I tried to explain this to him multiple times but he continued to be aggressive so I blocked him again. then he texted me the following message: 
""Hey. [my first name] [my last name], I'm U.S Marshall G.H Dozier from the Department of Homeland Securities. A report just got to us from a certain Smith Christopher that  you attempted to Steal from her of her work funds. It is advised that you get in contact with her and sort out the discrepancy before the law takes matters into its hands. We will have approached your bank and acquired all the necessary information needed to find you and confiscate you. Make America a better place. And get back to me ASAP.""

so obviously I knew it was complete bull because
1. a US. marshal would not text you
2. he spelled my first name wrong
and just a whole bunch of grammar issues I don't even want to point out.
I blocked the number and thought that was the end of it. two hours later I received another text.
we had the following conversation:

him: ""hello [my first name] [my last name]. Good morning. Am officer Eric.""

me: really now. police officers don't text people. or use improper grammar like you do. if you continue to harass me I will be in contact with the police. leave me alone.

him: why do you block your sugar daddy. why get u paid $1,050. 

me: because he was scaring me and so are you. goodbye. leave me alone or I will call the police.

then I blocked that number as well.
I finally thought that was the end of it, but I checked my bank account because I wanted to see if I could change my pin number just in case and all the money that had been sent was gone (there is still however an extra ~30 that was not there before and everything that was there before is still there as well). 

when I checked the mobile check deposit tab in the app the check now says ""pending"". 
does this mean he has my banking information? or can you just un-deposit someone's check if it's in your name. 

I'm very confused and very scared. it is also important to note that I have a paranoia disorder. every time a car goes by or I get a notification on my phone I start to freak out again. my cat was just messing with my sisters door and I thought it was a knock at the front door. every little noise has me on edge. I'm terrified. please someone give me a rational explanation and tell me this was just a stupid teenage mistake and I've learned my lesson and nothing else will come of it.",5,paranoia

"TL;DR: Lot of sad shit happened to me and while I was positive for most of it, this week I suddenly became more sad and suddenly lost care for a lot of things and lost enjoyment in everything. Do I have depression or am I just going through a tough time?

Before I start, I am unsure if this is the subreddit I should use. I am new to reddit and looked up ""depression"" to talk about this. If there is a better place to ask this or if this ain't where I should, just tell me. So, the last 2 months have been nothing but a nightmare for me. It started when my parents started arguing a lot, and then later, I found out they are planning to get a divorce. My dad is heartless about it and being an asshole to my mom while my mom is crushed, feels lonely as hell, and has been going to my sister and I for emotional support. Then a few weeks of this and I start to feel sad, and I got less affectionate with my gf because of my sadness. My gf then dumps me, saying she ""hasn't loved me for a few months and tried to regain love for me by herself"" which I felt odd about but was too heartbroken by the fact I lost my gf of 1 year to think about it. I later found out she actually cheated on me with her roommate and told me to hide his and her shame for it. For the most part, I was taking it all well. I was trying to stay positive, and I started exercising. But then suddenly I started to feel worse in a subtle way. I stopped caring about things as much, and I lost enjoyment in my hobbies. Then this week starting Monday, after a bad day at work when I fucked up a lot of things I went home and realized how awful I was feeling and cried myself to sleep that night. Each day I started feeling worse and worse. My sister has depression, and when I talked to her about how I was feeling she told me I might have depression because she's experienced what I'm feeling before. I don't want to believe I have depression because I've been known as the friend and family member who comforts everyone else, I don't want to be seen as the one who needs comfort because I do enjoy making people happier. I told my sister that everything recently is probably just catching up to me. Do you guys think I actually have depression, or am I just dealing with a lot at once?",2,depression

"Antipsychotic medications only seems to address the positive symptoms and I'm just anhedonic and bored all day I feel like a husk my life is so fucking boring.

Like even if I were to do meth it wouldn't be because I'm an addict. It'd be because I need a stimulant to counteract negative symptoms that my psychiatrist simply won't prescribe. I'd essentially microdose it and just take the equivalent to a therapeutic dosage of Desoxyn.

I'd rather just have my Dexedrine prescription back. I know it'd obliterate the anhedonia.

Wellbutrin worked for like a month or two then it just made me irritable and clench my jaw a lot. Dexedrine actually remained effective and made everything exciting. This was before I even developed symptoms.

I did eventually abuse it but that's because I was dumb and immature as I was still in highschool and just entering my drug experimentation phase at the time. I'm 19 now and I probably wouldn't abuse stimulants if I got put on them. Fuck I want them back life just isn't worth living with anhedonia.

"My rabies anxiety started to rule over my life. I try to cope with it my having monthly projects but what if I die in 2 months?

In my holiday, while I was swinging, my toes touched a flying creature but I don't remember what flying creature it was precisely. I remember it has distinct wings though. It may be a butterfly, a moth, or even a bat! I highly doubt bat is a likely possibility because I saw the flying creature for like 2-3 seconds and did not move from my place. I think it may have been too slow or even too small for a bat. If it was a bat, I would probably only see a big flash for a split second instead. I don't even remember bat wings but I remember a black/grayish color. I actually saw bats in the area but they were flying high at night. This event happened during sunset instead. I sometimes try to reassure myself by thinking if it was a bat, I would have known it or I would have shuffled my feet away (or not able to because bats are much faster than moths/butterflies)

OK. Now the worrying part. I had a very small and old wound on one of my toes (3-4 days old at that time, not bleeding, no scab). Maybe it was a rabid bat that happened to fly slowly and some saliva touched the small old wound? For sure, there was no bite or scratch from that animal, only a small preexisting old wound. (which may not even count as open wound by that time but some of the ""toeprint"" wasn't present, the skin color was intact though, just looked like smooth new skin) Maybe my memory is wrong and it was actually a bat? They say that a bat flying during sunset is completely normal but my anxious mind says that it's definitely an odd behavior and it's definitely a rabid bat.

When I told my family about the vaccine, they went crazy and insulted me as if I was mentally defective. Yes, they know that rabies is 100% fatal. Yes, I told them the so-called ""wound"". But it didn't work. I guess I need to see what happens without the PEP.

**If I wasn't worrying about rabies for a month, for various reasons, I wouldn't even CONSIDER a bat exposure and even if it was indeed a bat, I wouldn't consider a rabies risk.** But now I keep my worry with me. Not only I don't even attempt to remove my worry, I even think removing my worry would be dangerous. It's like if I think it's a bat exposure FOR SURE, I'll try to get the vaccine, no matter the harsh consequences. But I'm not sure. It may not have been a bat at all. There may not even be a contact at all. Even if there was a contact, it may only have contacted the intact skin. But sometimes, I vividly imagine my parents' regret and depression, while I'm lying in my deathbed with a foaming mouth and hydrophobia.

I try to reassure myself by telling myself that if I wasn't having a rabies fear for a month, I wouldn't even consider an exposure but at the same time, I sometimes think my paranoia may save my life. But sometimes, it feels like someone told my death date to 3 months later. OK. At least I know my anxiety doesn't increase the chance of rabies, it may even decrease it. Even if the chances are almost zero, I sometimes think I may have won the rabies lottery with an unheard transmission method. Also, I live in Turkey, not USA. I know I wasn't exposed to bats indoors but my OCD-like self sometimes tells that I may have left the door open.

BTW, if I try to deal with this without the vaccine, the result would probably be exactly the same as what would happen without that anxiety. (unless I had a death instinct at that time and knowingly touched a rabid animal, which is too unlikely to even consider)",5,paranoia

"I‚Äôve suffered with anxiety mainly my whole life. 

When i‚Äôm not anxious I start to feel sad. Its like I become hypersensitive to how shitty the world is and it brings on depressive feelings. 

Or its like when Im not anxious and feel like i‚Äôm living in the moment, my mind freaks out and thinks I‚Äôm going to die or pass out because its like ‚Äú I‚Äôm finally feeling happy so something bad is about to happen ‚Äú

"i'm putting this in r/paranoia because people are less likely to see it and it is, in a way, just me being paranoid.

i've had severe misophonia since the age of 6 (severe as in i wear ear defenders almost always, i can't eat near my family whatsoever, if someone is chewing gum i have to put on ear defenders and loudly chew to myself, if no ear defenders are available i will genuinely go into a screaming and sobbing tantrum like a toddler who was just told they can't buy something) and it has affected almost every part of my life. my mom always found it stupid, my nan accepts it as a thing that i have which i'm thankful for. 

i swear my mom used to purposely chew and smack her lips way louder and kore frequently than normal if she was mad at me. she always made me sit in the room with her to eat with no ear defenders (yes, i cried every time. no, she didn't care, she told me to stop being dramatic a lot. no, she's not in my life anymore, and my nan is okay with me eating alone) and i swear every time she was upset with me she would purposely trigger me because she wanted 'revenge' and the only way to properly upset me was by triggering the disorder that disables me the most. 

i was talking to my nan a few minutes ago. another trigger for my misophonia is sniffing. i can't explain it but i can't explain any of the triggers. she seemed a bit annoyed with me and i swear she was just loudly sniffing for the entire conversation. 

i don't know what to do. i don't want to ask my nan if she's doing it on purpose because she'll say no.",5,paranoia

"I have fears about service providers. Long story, i have been mismedicated and misdiagnosed and mistreated by them to never trust one again.

Some of those thoughts people tell me are ""paranoid"" though, like my therapist told me yesterday, i don't veiw as such. The main thing is i've learned i can't trust psychiatrists, emergency rooms, crisis beds and any other crisis service or source of psych meds. I know i struggle with unmanageable problems (i just broke 4 days straight of too much energy no sleep hypomania among other things) and no one i know who's this fucked up is medication free, but i've spent most of the last 5 years med free after my medication-induced psychotic break. It's bad enough that if i swallow pills i frequently throw them up involuntarily. I have been on them recently but never more than a couple months, and only at extremely low doses. I honestly feel that the only providers available to me drove me insane intentionally and am terrified it will happen with all of them after what they put me through. I don't know how to trust any psychiatrist to the point where i can get stabilized. I know i'm ranting but i don't want a generic ""just go to a-proffessional/hospital/etc. What's the worst that could happen"" As i have a history with these people and know what the worst that can happen is.

"Im going to try to keep this as comprehensive and to the point as possible. I dont feel loved by anyone, and i oftentimes question why i continue to live. It has costed me several jobs and my sanity when i came to realize the most important aspect to life is about love, and even though i had my heart completely broken by someone who i thought loved me but actually betrayed me, i still have the innate desire to find someone who completes me. i know that love must come from within before you can love another, i just feel so distraught because my partner who i was smitten with betrayed me, then spreaded gossip about me to further shame me and my reputation. that alone id think would drive anyone crazy, but on top of that, my own family has been mentally abusing me for years, and im just starting to understand why i am the way i am. they told me I was being abusive, when in reality i was gaslit, and now i feel so depressed and alone. my brother is a piece of shit addict who keeps lying, stealing, and backstabbing me, but i try to continue to help him in spite of that because i love him so much. at this point i realized that if i stayed, it will only drag me down more, but inside, i know that if i left or my family left, hed be dead within a few weeks, which compels me to stay to help at the cost of my mental well-being.  


tl;dr: I grew up in a dysfunctional and hostile household. non-biological grandfather was an abusive alcoholic who manipulated people for a living, and did so to my grandmother, who in my mind, was the most selfless and beautiful person i met, because she made me feel like she actually loved and cared for me(unlike my own mother), but she got cancer, and i watched her die in the worst way possible. after her death, said grandfather basically stole my familys inheritance, and my mom, brother and i were left with very little even though it wasnt his right to take. my house was financed by my actual biological grandfather, who by comparison, was highly intelligent and caring. he died of cancer at age 32, so my grandmother being in a vulnerable state, made the mistake of marrying that piece of shit... he ended up dying not too long ago, a couple years after my grandmothers death. after that background, i was very likely cheated on, and used by the woman i thought loved me. my brother overdosed 2 times, and i saved his life both times while he continues to steal from me and berate me. my family betrayed me by not being there for me to show emotional support or love, and theres a specific incident in mind that id rather not share online, but it did happen, and basically my mother refused to tell people the truth of what happened because she was selfishly afraid, so instead of telling  people the truth, she pretended she didnt know what i was talking about, and i made myself look crazy and stupid. my fathers been dead since i was 11, and i still remember the cryptic and depressing things he said before he died. my uncle is probably the only person who shows love, but even then i feel like he thinks im some kinda joke since im not independent yet, even though im on the cusp of it. theres many other examples of emotional trauma that i went through but it would be pages long. in short, it feels like no one in my life truly loves or cares about me, and it makes me question the point of living in itself. I know that i deserved some of the bad things that happened to me, because i realized how toxic i was BEFORE, but that doesnt mean that i am NOW. i learned. not saying im suicidal, im just saying that the pain my past and current situation has created has been overwhelming, and im just expected to ""man up""... WHATS THE FUCKING POINT IF I HAVE NO ONE TO LOVE OR LOVE ME?! seems like society is mentally abusing the fuck out of men, because apparently women are never wrong in america, and if youre failing at life, then the whole world will ruthlessly scorn, judge and shame you over things that you feel like are outside your realm of control.",2,depression
"Dear schizophrenics, 

I want to warn you about flat earth. I didn‚Äôt really study this stuff much when I was young, and got stuck in it for a year or 2, and had to study my way out of it‚Ä¶ I was a slow/lazy researcher, and kept letting it get hold of me, and it would make me delusional.

Please don‚Äôt get caught in flat or hollow earth.

Do your best to study.

This stuff can really mess with your mind until you grow enough to understand it. Don‚Äôt become delusional with it.

Eratosthenes experiment isn‚Äôt the same on a flat earth‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt let people confuse you about it. Think about what a shadow would look like on a stick at the North Pole, with the sun hitting it from the side, with parallel rays (not mentioning tilt). Hollow earth would have inward pointing shadows due to an opposite curve. Sticks in the ground with shadows really can prove a lot.

South celestial pole is not possible on flat earth.

Moon and sun somehow magically float on flat earth and hollow earth.

The North Star disappears once you go south far enough.

Clocks speed up, and gravity is less at higher altitudes.

Meteors somehow make it through the flat earth dome.

The flat earth excuse for seasons is the sun moving further out on the flat earth map, but that would technically mean a longer day due to the sun doing a bigger circle. And doesn‚Äôt explain the analemma properly, and in Australia in summer, the sun actually appears to curve south during sunset, due to the angle and tilt‚Ä¶  

Personally, I still think the moon and mars stuff is dodgy looking‚Ä¶ but they aren‚Äôt 100% messing with us about the shape of earth‚Ä¶ their camera angles do suck tho‚Ä¶

There's a youtube channel called ""brew"", each video have Millions of views. Most of the videos consist of something like ""How one small cut can break your spine"", "" The Juice Mix That‚Äôs Killing People"" etc.

You can think of these videos as informative, but they are not IMO. They create a true paranoia in people that watch the channel regularly. It's kinda ironic because I think the channel 'Brew', brews paranoia and probably schizophrenia.

Now, I don't suffer from paranoia or any other mental illness but I have enough knowledge in this business to know these videos heavily affects people with a predisposition for them. Also, these people are the ones following and watching the channel, because i tell you, no completely sane, mentally stable person, watches more than 3/4 videos without removing the channel from the watch list.

"-Heads up this is probably going to be long-

I've been paranoid for around 1.5 years I think, not constantly but there are spikes to it and I had previously had a what felt like severe episode of paranoia maybe last year where I was sure everyone was out to get me and kill me and poison my food ect I found it hard to meet up with friends and go to work without feeling like everyone was plotting against me to harm me or to get me fired, that my l my girlfriend was cheating on me and my family was deeply disappointed with me ect, I knew this wasn't the reality and felt like I was going mad. It soon died down after I quit my job which was causing a huge amount of stress so I think stress is an attribute to getting  paranoia panic attacks and having breakdowns.

Now I am experiencing the breakdowns again. I don't dislike my job and it isn't too stressful at all, but I think it could be my living situation. I live in a shared house with my mates and I've been having panic attacks/ breakdowns for the last three days now every day because I feel like my friends don't want me there because they just want to smoke green without me in the way and that my girlfriend doesn't love me anymore and wants to be with other men that aren't as fucked up as me and can smoke with her. Usually I wouldn't mind people smoking, I have other friends who use it daily and I've never had a problem with it before but I think because I didn't see it constantly it didn't affect me like this but it is affecting me and I don't know what to do.


My housemates and sometimes my girlfriend smoke together which I cannot partake in because obviously I experience paranoia and the substance isn't exactly helpful to me in that sense, but it has left me feeling like they want to cut me out and so I've been trying to let them get on with it which at the same time is making me feel like I'm losing my friends/ the connection isn't the same. when I spoke about it yesterday with one of them it was confirmed that that wasn't the case but I can't help feeling like it is and that they're doing it on purpose to get away from my negativity or to talk about me behind my back. 

I feel horrible for thinking these things but it's eating me from the inside. I don't feel cared about I'm scared my girlfriend won't love me anymore and wants to leave me because she won't talk to me about her problems and it's always me talking about mine or that I'm stopping her from having fun or doing the things she needs to do all the time and that I'm the problem, to confirm these feelings she doesn't want to have sex with me either which is making me anxious that she's fucking other men because I can't satisfy her or something, I know she wouldn't do that and it's in my head but I can't help thinking things like this.

All this paranoia and anxiety I then took to work with me on Friday where I misinterpret normal conversation and think that the actual conversation I'm having means something entirely different and it really ends up hurting my feelings or making me angry/anxious, which I have experienced before last year also, this would be and is with basically every single conversation I have or overhear where I think it is about me in a negative way or people hiding information about me in their conversations and I have to depict the meaning.


I've had to stay at my mum's house because I am scared to go home in fear of having these breakdowns from seeing my mates smoking weed and thinking all these things that aren't real or are I don't know. It's nice to get these things off my chest but I really just want them out of my head as well.",5,paranoia

"So I'm 17y I've witnessed some things when I was young that I wasn't supposed to witness (such as a my parents abu$ing eachother)..I also didn't have a family like a cousin or a grandma because we don't talk to them.

When I was 14y I've seen my parents fighting in front of my face and I couldn't handle it so I went into a panic attack so I still have this panic attack from a time to time and sometimes without any reason!!.

So when I turned 17y exactly I start getting attached to any guy I talk to also girls! For example when I'm talking to a guy i just met and he's kind to me i tell myself omg I'm gonna be with him or I'm gonna marry him and I get attached to him so fast but when I meet someone else who's more kind to me i forget about the other person and I get attached to the second person and it's going like that...

After I talk to that person and they start ignoring I start crying and sometimes I feel depressed for three days or smth...sometimes I want to kms so baaad cos I always beg for attention or dying to find someone who can take care of me idk why I wanna be loved so bad!!!!! Even tho I do love myself is just I feel like with a strange feeling when someone really take care of me and idk whyy!

"I had to move back to the suburbs a couple years ago and been struggling with commuting big time. Every single time I start a new job or new studies, on the first day I arrive super organised, carefully dressed and combed, my skin glowing, and a nice little make up on; all my lunch boxes and outfits are done for the week, my home is in order, and I have a fancy new notebook and take neat notes. But everyday after that, my structure falls apart a bit more. A week or two later, I go to school (it's worth mentioning I'm changing careers) unshowered, with greasy hair, nothing to eat for lunch, my smoking habit back, dressed like a coat rack,  my notebook looking full of doodles and scribblings, because I can't keep up, and shores piling up at home. I get burned out for running around in transportations (I study in Paris, and the tube is particularly grim, and there's a lot of corridors, few Escalators and a gazillion people, which makes it even more exhausting. This morning when I saw my gigantic pile of dirty dishes, I cried out of despair, and guilt for not being able to cope with what other commuters can deal with everyday, and with some with kids to take care of on top of it. Everyday I want to call in sick just so I don't have to run and can catch up with my shores. Even though I love what I'm studying. Commuting really drains the shit out of me and makes me feel like a failure. Therefore I'm looking for some advice, and, -I admit- some sympathy, people who can relate. Thank you ‚ù§",3,adhd

"I've been emotionally abused by my brothers in my childhood. I haven't realised of the traumas I've been through until recently. The stigma of having a normal happy family stopped me from looking at back. I have asked myself so many times how did I turn out to be this way? And the answer, the main reason, lies within my family. Infront of everyone I have a pretty much big family. And they all get along. Except for me and my brothers. We had our share of brotherly fights but at some point it went out of hand and detached me from them forever. We don't talk anymore.. We don't even smile. It's been like that more than 10 years. I'm 23 now. And I feel more alone and depressed when I'm home. Don't have that many friends. But I feel more comfortable when I'm with them. 

Years back when I first got diagnosed for my mental health issues I didn't know it was only gonna get worse. That I would be left hurt for the rest of my life. That I would be constantly thinking of death. At first my parents were the reason that held me back from it. the pain they would suffer. the trauma I would cause them. Nothing matters anymore. They are the main reason for me to turn out like this. And yeah, of course my mind isn't normal from early days there's that too. A couple of months more. I know a miracle like someone coming to your life to save you is not gonna happen. I had someone like that, very precious, and it turned out to be the second most haunting thing now. So I'm just waiting it out to all end. I beared myself these fucked up years what's a couple more months. It's going to be hellish like or worst than the past six months. But yeah I'm preparing myself for the end. I have tried to die two times. But it was more like a suicidal gestures, a cry for help. But there won't be another one of that. The third is going to be the last. And I learned it the hard way. NOT EVERYONE'S LIFE IS WORTH LIVING FOR.",2,depression

"Just like the title says, I think I accidentally gave myself some sort of paranoia. I have been a fan of analog horror (bear with me), and none of it has ever really effected me outside of a simple spooky fear rush, but for some reason a new one I watched has made me so paranoid being in my own home. I've had to sleep with the lights on, I'm terrified every time I open a closet or pass by a cabinet. I KNOW what I'm afraid of isn't real, it was made up by someone online, but something in the back of my mind is making me scared that I am going to be attacked. I already have anxiety, and this definitely doesn't help. I can't stop thinking that someone or someTHING is in my house, in every crevice and corner, ready to kill me when I turn my back. And, like I said, I know it's not real, that nothing is there and nothing is going to harm me, but the persistent worry and anxiety is there throughout the days.",5,paranoia

"  
Crippling indecision. Depressed people can be consumed by an overwhelming inability to make decisions. Everything is questioned right down to the granular level. This constant self-questioning and evaluating leaves the person paralysed and unable to function. For instance the depressed person might make a decision to take a shower. What follows next is a tsunami of questions ‚Äúshould I wait to later‚Äù ‚Äúwhat if I don‚Äôt have the energy‚Äù ‚Äúwhy do I need a shower anyhow I am not going anywhere?‚Äù This can literally play out for hours and hours until the sufferer finally says something along the lines of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù Needless to say this self-doubting will be followed by recrimination and more than likely self-hatred for being so weak, which in turn feeds the depression, an almost perfect vicious circle.  
Critical self-judgment. Depressed people don‚Äôt really see themselves as ill. They rarely give themselves that good a break. Instead they can very easily view their depression as a personal weakness they could overcome if they just tried hard enough. This train of thought is perpetuated by other people telling them to just snap out of it, or a thousand other platitudes they have heard a million times before. Instead of seeing this nonsense for what it really is they turn it internally and berate themselves for having a character flaw that doesn‚Äôt allow them to function like normal people. They don‚Äôt need other people to be judgmental as they are expert at doing it to themselves a thousand times worse.  
Interaction is painful. It‚Äôs something most people take for granted. Interaction, conversing and relating are things we mostly don‚Äôt have to think about. For someone suffering depression this natural ability can become excruciatingly difficult. In most instances we pull on a socially acceptable mask and pretend everything is fine. We are present but not really there if you know what I mean? We can be surrounded by people and feel painfully alone lost in the quicksand of depression. We are experts at hearing but not really listening. We are ninja warriors at the art of avoiding talking about how we are feeling. Everything is great and fine when in reality we are dying inside. While you are talking about how your day went we can be reliving the worst moments of ours and at the same time making sure you don‚Äôt see our pain.  
Fear of the future. Ask a depressed person what they think their future looks like and they will more than likely tell you ‚Äúmore of the same or worse‚Äù Depending on the severity of the depression a sufferer doesn‚Äôt see a future. A future is something other people have not them. Their future is the struggle they are going to have tomorrow morning when they wake up and think to themselves ‚Äúplease, not this again, I don‚Äôt think I can go on like this‚Äù We think about the future by comparing it to our past. It‚Äôs very difficult to imagine a nice future when all the evidence from the past is telling you it isn‚Äôt going to happen. For the vast majority of people a future is something they can feel optimistic about. For a depressed person it can feel like something to dread. Something filled with hopelessness and helplessness. Not living in the present is extremely common; it can feel like we are adrift in an ocean of misery and torment stuck in a no man‚Äôs land of despair and apathy. Once hope is lost, everything is lost.  
Even the good times can be bad. Imagine not even being happy at the birth of your child or in fact any landmark occasion that marks a supposedly joyous event in our lives. A chronically depressed person doesn‚Äôt have to imagine it. For millions of people this is a reality and is something that is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. Guilt and shame which feed the depression are experienced in equal measure. They know on a rational logical level they should be happy, unfortunately they have lost the ability. Their happiness has been replaced by numbness and indifference which they have seemingly no control over. I well remember when I was going through my own depression someone asking me what I would do if I won a million pounds. Without even having to think I said I would probably give it away as no amount of money could ever make me happy again. These are the depths a depressed mind can sink to.  
Observing not participating. There is a song from the movie midnight cowboy sung by Harry Nilsson that I think sums up depression beautifully. Here it is. ‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs talking at me, I don‚Äôt hear a word they‚Äôre saying only the echoes of my mind‚Äù. Severe depression is probably like having an out of body experience. You can see and hear everything happening around you but you are not part of it. It can feel very lonely and isolating to realise that you are a spectator to your own life. Your heart aches to be part of something that will make you feel like a human being again but your depressed mind is constantly telling you that this is for other people to experience, not you. Just like the song you literally do hear what everybody is saying but you are lost in mire of the echoes of your own mind. It can feel like you are living a life where the pause button is permanently pressed. A state of non-existing if you like.  
Dysfunctional relating and relationships. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the rate of breakups and divorces amongst people suffering depression is quite high. Relating to another human being requires motivation that is sadly lacking as they struggle with their illness. Maintaining relationships requires effort and energy both of which have been sucked out of them. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs because they have lost the ability to care and they feel powerless to do anything about it. When you don‚Äôt care if you live or die yourself it can be very difficult to care for someone else. They are trapped inside the prison of their own mind desperately hoping for someone or something to set them free. For a depressed person isolating themselves can be preferable to relating even though they absolutely know this is doing them real harm. A depressed mind doesn‚Äôt think rationally it will push away the very thing that could help them. It can see relationships as having very little consequence, even though the opposite is true, such is the contradictory nature of depression.  
Lack of autonomy. The most important thing to every human being on the planet is having a sense of autonomy or control over their lives. When depression comes into a person‚Äôs life that sense of control is taken away. Choices start to become very limited and the person‚Äôs world can become microscopic. In an effort to fill that emotional void many people turn to food, alcohol, drugs, shopping anything in fact that alleviates, however temporarily, the crushing feeling of being out of control of their own destiny. These strategies can of course bring about bigger problems to add to the depression. A sense of meaning or purpose to their lives is missing and in its place is a gaping hole. This can set some people off on a journey to find that missing piece in the vain hope that it will complete them. They never find that thing that will make them whole again because it doesn‚Äôt exist. It is a depression generated wild goose chase that can easily turn into an obsession. Depression holds out the promise that if you could just find that thing outside yourself everything would return to normal and the depression would vanish. Unfortunately as many people have found to their cost, including myself, it‚Äôs simply not true. The answer lies internally not externally.  
There are a countless different ways that people can experience depression. There are however quite a few commonalities between the different types. If any of the above resonated with you it‚Äôs time to seek professional help. These types of symptoms won‚Äôt be exercised away, prayed away, snapped out of or ignored. If left unaddressed they have the ability to devastate your life for a very long period of time.

"I tried to kill myself when i was 12 years old. I swallowed a bunch of pills and unfortunately, i failed. i felt like nobody cared about me, no one would miss me and that everyone would be better off without me. why i did it? i dont know. my own mom didn‚Äôt care about me even after the suicide attempt, nor did she take me serious. that was almost 10 years ago, as i‚Äôm about to turn 22. i‚Äôve been dealing with untreated depression for this entire time and it‚Äôs only gotten worse. overtime i‚Äôve developed more issues such as social anxiety, persistent suicidal ideation, feeling like everyone hates me, nobody cares, im still not good enough, im boring, and the list goes on and on. it feels like nothing i say or do really matters, i‚Äôll never be free of this thing. i dont want to see a therapist, and some days are better than the rest but the moment i take two steps forwards, i fall 10 steps behind its a never ending cycle.. i dont know what to do. the only thing i can think of is finally putting an end to my misery and killing mysef. a lot might ask what caused me to feel this way, and i really dont know. maybe the years of emotional abuse from my mom? the fact that i‚Äôve never really had friends, everyone leaves me in the end and it does nothing but prove my insecurities and make me feel even worse? i‚Äôll never really know.. it‚Äôs just constant headaches, feeling like i wanna die and feeling worthless and unlikeable 24/7.",2,depression
"This post might get taken down, but I don't care. This has to be said and I didn't hear crap about it from anyone.

Last few years or so I was in a pretty low place for a while. I've always slept bad for as long as I could remember, but I also became quick to anger and get irritated. I had a cynical look on life and had a depressive mood at least once a day. I always just thought that it was because I slept bad, maybe cause of stress, perhaps I just think too negative.

I was thinking of stopping meds, but only because I didn't like that I was dependent on them to function well. Then I had an interview and drank some coffee. I just felt sedated doing the interview, couldn't form any good sentences, had major brainfog. I started thinking that I'd literally be better of without meds and I had to stop because this simply isn't me. I could probably focus better without them.

I happend to have a lighter dose of meds in my closet (ironically because I've been procrastinating on returning them to the pharmacist) and took them to see if the dose was too high, and wow. Now the meds actually do benefit me. I've never felt so sharp before, my depressive moods are gone, I barely feel irritated anymore, and i'm just happy all the time - the way I remember myself.

I've had some feelings of greef, thinking about all the things that couldve been different if I noticed this before. My dose is too high for 1.5 years!! Imagine all the things I didn't do or miss out on because I was too tired or depressed. It might've even contributed to a recent breakup.

If you experience things like:

-Insomnia

-Feeling Passive

-More irritated than usual

-Depressive moods

-Feelings of sedation

-Changes in character

Then check in with your doctor and try a lighter dose or other types of meds. Just because your heart doesn't go bonkers on a certain dose doesn't mean it's the right dose.

TL;DR: Watch out for a dose of meds that might be too high. It's not as obvious as you would think and the symptoms of a dose that's too high aren't obvious and are almost never talked about.",3,adhd

"I'm so frustrated. I graduate with my master's degree in a week, and I am having crippling anxiety over the ceremony. I normally wouldn't, but for the past 10 months, my anxiety has been causing me to dry heave. I'm severely emetophobic (afraid of throwing up), so this symptom is my biggest nightmare. No other anxiety symptoms scare me, but this one terrifies me. I've still managed to live a somewhat normal life, but it's considerably limited compared to what it used to be. 

I have a big family/friend graduation party over the weekend - I don't want to do that because I'm terrified of dry heaving during it and ruining my whole day. It's even worse for my actual graduation ceremony. My boyfriend is flying in from 1,000 miles away to come see me, and I don't want to make his trip pointless if I panic during the ceremony or I'm not able to actually participate because I'm too anxious. I don't even want him to come because I'm so panicked. I'm afraid of disappointing my parents by panicking and not going to the ceremony (they're also traveling to come see). If it were up
to me, I would be able to skip this all and just move on. I still have an entire week until the ceremony, but for the past 3 days, I've been waking up with a horrible racing heart, nausea, and I feel like dry heaving all day. Xanax helps, but I don't allow myself to take it more than 1-2x per month. Hydroxyzine and propranolol don't touch it. 

I don't have social anxiety, I normally love big events. I love parties and ceremonies. I'm not scared of the social aspect, I am just terrified of gagging and being trapped in the ceremony/grossing people out/looking like an idiot. I haven't been able to find a single thing that stops the gagging - not water, not other drinks, not mints or gum, nothing. The fact that I can't prevent it is what scares me most. I've tried positive visualization, but all I can visualize is me getting all done up for graduation, getting to the ceremony, and either dry heaving in my seat or worse, walking across the stage. It's so irrational, but it feels so real. The *only* reason for the dry heaving is anxiety, so you'd think that if I knew I could stay calm, I wouldn't worry about the dry heaving - but nope. 

I don't know what to do. I'm considering just not going so I can stop being this anxious. I'm so angry that I can't just enjoy exciting, happy life moments like most other people can. No one in my life even gets why I'm so anxious because I should just be ""happy and proud"" instead.

"A little context before we start: I am 20, and suffer ADHD (likely turned bipolar but have no official diagnosis), and depression. My mood swings and behaviour makes me believe its no longer ADHD but bipolar disorder instead. Please note that I am currently jobless, so while I don't pay rent, I do cook and clean, and generally make sure my younger sisters don't do anything stupid. Anything I do use up, I replace it if possible using my own savings. 

My dad and I have not gotten along since I was 13. At first it was just typical teenage rebellion stuff. While my mum and I have always had a close relationship. She was the person I could go to and talk to about my problems. She understood me, and she was my rock. My dad however...due to how he was raised he is not like my mum. He has no empathy (sympathy in case I'm getting these mixed up again) for anyone, doesn't understand what to say and when, and does not seem to understand that his blatant comments are hurtful to me. Sometimes I feel like he's being intentionally hurtful. Our personalities clash violently, so when we get in an agrument we tend to say really hurtful stuff we don't actually mean. We know when the other doesn't mean it because we don't say that same thing again later, its always something different. 

I know he favours my younger sister (15). She's like him in every way. No empathy (or sympathy), loves trucks, wants to be a diesel mechanic and drive machinery etc. He lets her get away with almost everything and this is admittedly the source of a lot of our fights. While he lets her get away with everything, he's constantly on my back about stuff I did, stuff I didn't do, stuff I need to do and what I shouldn't do. From age 14, he has treated me like the source of his problems, but never outright hurt me, laid his hands on me or said the worst stuff, he just acted like I could do no right. 

Recently, we have had more arguments than normal. I recently finished a contract to study a Cert III in Business, and currently have no job but I am actively looking for work, I actually have an interview next week so it is not like I'm sitting around doing nothing. I clean each morning: empty the dishwasher, tidy off the bench and clean it, and even vacuum the floors of dirt and kitty litter, and anything else. Sometimes when I'd get home from work I'd do the cooking but that wasn't often. Now, unless my parents have something else in mind I'm cooking almost every night. He comes home to a tidy house, a hot meal, and still often complains or has an attitude with me. 

Every single fight we have now, he has picked up the tendency to tell me: ""if you don't like how I run this house you can move out'. He was telling me this before I finished my work. Keeping in mind I wasn't earning a lot. I was making 25K annually as a trainee, so even if I'd gone for a Cert 4 and stayed in the job I still would not have been able to move out and stay out. But even after i finished work he still tells me to move out if I don't like it,  he knows I can'tleave otherwise Id be homelessand he doesn't care. I feel unwanted in my own home. Every time he tells me these words I cry myself to sleep. Sure we argue but I still love that man. I always worry for him, I always love him even if he treats me like a 2nd class citizen and favours my sister over me. I feel unwelcome in my own home and I am constantly reminded by him and my sister that: I have no friends, I don't have a job, and I'm single. I am constantly made to feel like I don't matter and I'm getting so exhausted that death sounds good right about now. 

I've been considering death for a while now, thinking about how I'd do it, when, how long it would take. And then I'd ponder: would they miss me? Would they even care? My mother does not call him out when he makes these comments and it makes me feel like I can't trust her to have my back. They don't seem to realise my lashing out is a cry for help, and even now as I'm typing this I'm crying after being told earlier tonight to move out. If he wants me out I'll go, but I know if I go he won't help with the house. He won't keep my sisters in check, they wont pass inspections because he can't even wash a dish and I know mum will divorce him when it becomes too much for her. I don't want to leave my mum alone to them but I don't want to keep enduring this. I can't take it any longer! My sister expects me to take her out places, buy her nice things but doesn't want to be nice to me in return, and my dad wants me to contribute around the house but cant even see the effort I'm putting in now. I've put in so much that my hair is falling out, I can't sleep, and while my appetite is still in tact, I know if this goes on that'll die too. 

Every time he says these awful words I die a little more inside and I'm exhausted.....I just want it all to stop. I feel alone, I just want someone to hold me and tell me its going to be ok. But I don't even want to go to my mum this time, as I worry she's going to get mad or tell me I'm being dramatic.....

Sorry this was so long but I needed to get this off my chest....thank you all for listening and I'm sorry if I'm taking up your time internet strangers...",2,depression

"(TW: Drug use, mentions of suicide) I used to be so passionate about things I still see and remember how much I used to love them. I'm on the verge of having to do credit recovery for some classes, I'm not paying attention because I'm just so mentally exhausted from fighting my thoughts and pushing them down. I don't talk about it much with anyone even my best friends who I trust the most. I'm trying my best to get out of school early because it's so taxing, but all I get when I talk about that is ""what do you want to do when you're done"" and the truth is I don't know what I want to do for the rest of my life, however long it is I can handle all this. I work a ton to get out of the house and away from a toxic manipulative household and I stay out as much as I can but I'm not to be trusted because of some past drug problems and reckless behavior, mostly as a result of trying to feel something at all. I don't want to talk about it to anybody because I can't handle any more people being disappointed in me and seeing me as a failure. I have no interest in anything anymore except getting out of the house, but when I do that it's made to seem as if I hate my family (I do) and I'm ungrateful. Everything bothers me, even people I used to be close to or still am, i'm just really angry at something and I can't figure out exactly what it is because I think it's multiple things or a whole part of my life. Im constantly thinking of what's next, and people tell me I shouldn't be depressed because I have a ""loving family"" and I'm (relatively) financially stable. I go to therapy but I never talk about how I really feel. I keep telling myself I will next time but I just keep being scared to open up for fear of being sent to the psych ward or having to trust one more person. I broke up with my partner because I didn't want to drag them down with me into the hell that is my life. I don't know who I am, I don't know where I'm going, and I don't even know where to start. I don't know who I'd be if I was happy. It's been like this for so long it's just become part of me and if it were missing I don't know what I would do. I push everything down and it all streams out at once in one breakdown, but I have to control it because I can't show it or I'll just be more of a failure and a disappointment to my family and I cant handle having to repeat a year. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I look at everyone else and they have something going for them, somebody loves them and they have a value but I can't say the same for myself. I would kms but I would hurt too many people and I would just become a statistic. And I can't tell anyone that because I'll be in a psych ward so fast I won't even be able to blink. It's fucked up I can't get help with something like this without filtering so I don't get hospitalized. Some things make me laugh in the moment but then i'm back to it. Nothing actually makes me happy except working because I feel like I'm helping someone out and I'm part of something, but I can't just work a minimum wage (basically) job forever and never move forward. I feel like I'm fake for laughing at things and sometimes I wonder if I even find whatever it is funny because I don't know what happiness is anymore.",2,depression

"I hate it when people misunderstand me in conversation and assume the absolute worst. This happens too often on social media, when I'm just trying to discuss something with someone, and maybe I say too much or something, or maybe it's simply the fact I don't completely agree with them idk, but it appears that they assume the worst of my intentions because they either insult me in writing or they block me. 






Today it happened again. There's an autistic content creator I've occasionally watched videos of and I saw a video from her about ""autistic coded"" robots and other non-humans. I tried to discuss it with her. I asked her if she feels that the term ""coded"" implies intent because I feel it kinda does and I am not a huge fan of it because of that because we're not in the creators / artists / writers brain so I don't think we can know their intentions for certain unless they've outright said they intended for a character to have x trait. I didn't attack her for saying it. I asked her whether she feels it implies intention and said why *I* don't like it. I then said that I think in some cases robots / non-humans with autistic traits do come about for the reason she said but also offered another reason I think it happens too - which was coming from experience because I literally write about fictional robots myself. And she blocked me. I was just trying to discuss it with her. I had no bad intentions and definitely didn't want a negative interaction with her. 








Its so frustrating when this shit happens. I just have a lot of thoughts about things and I like to discuss things, and when people actually discuss things I'm interested in with me its awesome. But it also at other times results in people misunderstanding me and getting angry or blocking me on social media. It really sucks and makes me feel bad, especially when it's someone I've had positive interactions with before.",1,autism

"There was an incident in my Food studies class a few weeks ago that has left me upset enough to skip the class for my own mental health as I no longer feel comfortable or welcome in the classroom.

I was working with my friend (17M) in class when another student (17F) who we were not working with put pepper into our bowl.

For some context I (16F) am autistic and have severe sensory needs that makes me react to tastes, texture, smells, etc.. Pepper is something I am unable to cope with as it freaks me out and I have a minor allergy to it.

I rightfully got upset with her as I was never asked if she could add anything into our food(and I'm allergic), so I freaked out and yelled at her. I admit I might have overreacted but at the moment I was panicked and confused. The yelling got my teacher's attention and she got mad at me for swearing, which I understand but I felt targeted as she was only telling me off and not the boy‚Äôs in my class who were saying things much worse than I had (calling each other the c word and a range of slurs).  
It was getting really Loud to the point that I was on the floor in tears trying to calm myself down, when my teacher loudly exclaimed to me ‚Äúthat is verbal assault and I'm going to have to send you out‚Äù I took off my apron, left the school and I went home.

I purposely missed my food studies class for about a week as I didn't want any more conflict, But I did show up today.

I pulled the girl aside and I apologized for yelling at her and tried to explain that I had sensory problems and that I was allergic to pepper and her adding it without me knowing really freaked me out, but she rudely cut me off saying that she didn‚Äôt care and that It was my problem not hers.

I then tried to explain how putting things in other‚Äôs food is NOT ok and that even if she had asked my partner, she should have also asked me as it wasn‚Äôt JUST his food, to which she just said I was overreacting and ‚Äúyou should be grateful I even tried to help‚Äù I was calm the entire time and I was trying my hardest to not sound like I was blaming her, as that wasn't my intention, but It was at this point I got fed up and just let her go as she just wasn't listening.

I then tried to talk to my teacher and she just pushed me off and wouldn‚Äôt listen to me so I gave up and went to the library and did work for my art class.

I still feel really bad and I understand that she has the right to be upset, but I feel like my need's aren't being taking into consideration and I don't know what to do :(",1,autism
I went out the other week and drank far too much. I blacked out and can‚Äôt remember much. All I can really remember is falling off a bench oops.

I seem to recall also having some cross words with someone who often has made unnecessary comments to me in the past which I‚Äôve let slide‚Ä¶ I feel the drink may have aided my confidence to stand up to them. But I cannot remember how the conversation went down and it was infront of people who I do not know. My sister said she was concerned for how drunk I was but more of a how am I going to get this bitch home rather than me acting out of line. Other people have also said you were fine just drunk. I keep messaging people asking if I‚Äôve offended or disrespected them or if I was really bad or embarrassing.

"Hi everyone, sorry in advance if I write a bit weird, Honestly I find it somewhat hard to open up, I'm not very good at it. Throwaway account because this is rather personal. I figured this would be the best place to ask this as I believe its related to my ADHD and you fine people might relate.

I have been attracted to a friend for some time, so I finally decided to take the plunge and ask her out. I got rejected, with a very cookie cutter rejection, which kind of hurt, but we are still good friends. Initially I had a wave of euphoria because I actually managed to ask her in the first place, but this went away after some time. Next came the inevitable sadness.

I still see her in a romantic way, it feels like it wont go away. I got a no, I should be fine to move on, but I'm NOT. I don't know how to handle this, and tbh I feel like I'm wasting time, imagining a relationship that will never be. So why am I still so attached? This feels like such a setback when I've been working on myself mentally for a good while now...

Hey guys, I'm not really sure why I'm posting this, but I just wanted to put myself out there for once. I'm a 19-year-old guy, and I'm really struggling with some stuff. I don't even know if anyone will read this, but I figured it couldn't hurt to try.

I've been dealing with some pretty severe depression for a while now. It's hard to describe exactly how I feel, but I just feel really lost and hopeless all the time. I don't really have anyone to talk to about it, and I don't think anyone really notices me or my problems. I actually don't have anyone to talk about anything except my weird confusion and poor self image.

I've been isolated for most of my teenage years and even some of my childhood. I don't really blame anyone for that, it's just the way things worked out. But for the past 5 years, I've been completely alone, and it's really taking a toll on my mental health.

I don't have any goals or anyone to live for, and I just feel like I'm drifting through life with no purpose. I've tried to find things that interest me, but I always seem to lose motivation pretty quickly. I feel like I've failed at just about everything I've tried, and anything good that's happened to me has just been luck.

I know this might sound irrational, but I feel like the only thing that might work for me is finding someone who's going through the same thing. Someone who's just as confused and lost as I am, so we can figure things out together. But I don't want advice or a mentor or anything like that. I just want to connect with someone on an equal level.

Anyway, sorry for rambling on. I don't really expect anything to come of this, but it feels good to at least try to put myself out there. Thanks for reading, whoever you are.",2,depression

"So I have had severe depression since I was 10. I also suffer from extreme OCD, ADHD and OCPD. It did a number on me as far as self esteem and confidence. Fast forward a few years and I was very lucky to get a get a girl that really supported me through thick and thin. Due to her I became highly functioning but everyday was a misery fest. Of late, last 6 months I have lost my job and am the lowest point of my life. I am 42 so no spring chicken. My wife has grown progressively tired of dealing with my issues for the last 23 years. She seems to be disengaging and charting a way for herself and my son. I can‚Äôt get up and pursue anything meaningful to save my life. Always plagued with guilt, regrets, doubts and FEAR. 

While I have savings right now that will last me a bit due to my high functioning years I can‚Äôt help but think what happens after that. Do people who can‚Äôt earn (like me anymore) and don‚Äôt have active family support just end up on the street, homeless and waiting for death. 

My biggest roadblock to any success is my own mental limitations. Am on 22 medication a day and just don‚Äôt see myself ever coming out of this black hole. 

Can someone relate? Is there a story of inspiration out there, any helpful advise to a person who has spent a lifetime self sabotaging.

"I was cheated oo and abused in the last relationships by two exes. One was bipolar or borderline and the other was a narcissist.

After the narcissist came my actual girlfriend and so i had no time to deal with my emotions and immediately i was quite distant with her because of my anxiety. But she understood and tried anyway because when i was strange she asked me to explain why and I could do that. 

Now after months we are together and we start living together as well. Now she is far from since 2 weeks for reasons different than us and so we text and we call each other. This though meant that we were very stressed and we fought a lot. Either we were sexting, or talking about stuff or having discussions.

Discussion were started by both of us. The last though was a bit strange on her part and she was a bit aggressive. She didn't insult or anything, just aggressive.

That being aggressive reminded me of my abusive ex and made me go in a fear state.

She recognized almost immediately like an hour after the fight that her ways of communicating was shit (after i said its not okay to be that aggressive when i was trying to give my reasons calmly and she could not understand)

But after that i entered a paranoia state were i had to prove she was or she wasn't borderline.

That has been very stressing and sometimes i wake up at night being anxious and tense about that thinking about scenario were it will get worse and that she's actually BPD and she will abuse me and the more i read about BPD the more i get anxious.",5,paranoia

"I will try and keep this short. I have been fighting depression for my life and seeing psychiatrists and doctors for around 12 years. I am 35. With my current therapist, over the last 9 months or so he has basically stopped trying to help and simply listens and says he will help me look for a better resource. But every resource referred to me just doesn't take new patients, doesn't take my insurance, doesn't provide the care requested, etc. So I left a voicemail on a potential new therapist machine where I expressed that I was struggling and I was crying quite a bit. Instead of helping, they called a neighboring parish Sherriff dept. who called me and tried to figure out my location so they could pick me up. I made it home and was able to convince her that I am under the care of a psychiatrist and therapist and was simply upset, and never expressed I wanted to harm myself or others. She agreed, finally, that I was safe and we ended the call, and told me that she would not send anyone. But, the cops showed up anyway.

Since then I just haven't been able to trust anyone at all. My therapist has been saying for months I need to do some kind of inpatient program but I cannot defeat the paranoia that I will be drugged into submission and have something horrible happen to me. I am terrified I will lose my job and I have no savings or family or friends as a safety net. I would be homeless. Louisiana, where I live, is very poor and our healthcare is from another era.

I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I can trust any advice or help from the medical field and the more I express this, the worse they treat me, and it keeps becoming a self fulfilling prophecy. I can't call and ask for another therapist. My current therapist does not help. I am terrified that if I ever voluntarily went to inpatient I would never be released or I would be tortured into submission. There's nothing anyone can say to me that will change my mind, and I know that is wrong, but I also know it is true.

How do you ask for help when you don't trust the help? What can I do to convince myself that inpatient facilities are not simply mental jails to ease state suicide statistics? I read so many horror stories online, and I hear so few good ones. And the good ones don't seem to explain very much about what happened there, it's the bad ones that go into detail. I would rather die than go on antipsychotic medication again, because to me the feeling they bring is the worst thing I've ever experienced. It's like truly being undead. I know that isn't the case for everyone, but for me, I just feel like a small eye in my skull peeping into the world, but the rest of my body is something else, controlled by something else, I'm just watching, I no longer exist. And if that's the case, I might as well be dead. Here are all the diagnoses I have been given, but I am not really sure which ones are real:

Major depressive disorder

Double depression

General anxiety disorder

Adjustment disorder

Borderline personality disorder

Avoidant personality disorder

ADHD

ASD

"Last night I helped one of my best friends get into a relationship with someone who I actually had feelings for. I was going to make progress but unfortunately, she saw my friend as her soulmate. I‚Äôm glad that they are together considering my friend has never been a relationship. I‚Äôve been heartbroken for years, she managed to put it all together for me, then I handed to her and went to my friend.  I‚Äôm now heartless.

I helped many of my friends that got into a relationship, some of them are even married.

"I keep getting the advice of ""oh, if you just practiced, your social anxiety would go away.""  No, no it won't. I feel like people either don't know what social anxiety actually is or they're using the term in a very mild way. When I tell people I HAVE practiced and it's done nothing, I feel like they think I'm not applying myself hard enough.

I took a public speaking class where I had to present regularly. I got better at acting like I had it together, I suppose. I got feedback that I was improving, but I never *felt* any better. I was always anxious and always relieved when it was over. And our presentations always had a time limit because it was large class. When I've had to give presentations or talks at work that last longer than 10 mins, my hands start shaking and my voice starts shaking, and if I keep pushing it, I'll lose my voice altogether and not be able to speak. Even when I tell myself ""you've got this"" and ""it's not a big deal"" and even if I feel calm, the physical stuff starts happening, and I can't control it. The only way I've found to sort of manage it is take a few seconds to grab water and breathe, but I'm always worried that tactic will give out eventually.

I can practice in front of a mirror, but all I'm doing is staring at myself. Where's the fear in that? I can practice the *words* but that doesn't prepare me for the *environment*. I can practice in front of family and friends, but they aren't people from work who will be judging my performance on a different level.

I fidget and get very uncomfortable during job interviews (I'm back on the job hunt), and it's the same problem. I can practice interview *questions*. But I can't practice sitting at a table surrounded by people I don't know who are judging my physical appearance and job history in a very de-humanizing way.

I was encouraged to sign up for a leadership course (""to build confidence"") where they're supposed to teach you all those great leadership skills. And I suppose they did, but I can't say I got anything out of it. It was absolute torture. I was highly anxious the entire time, and I hated every second. Threw all my learning materials in the trash when it was over and ran as fast as I could from there.

I've spoken to a therapist who suggested MORE public speaking, and I stopped seeing him (he also tried to suggest certain traumas happening in my past that didn't, so he had other issues). I feel like people aren't getting it. Repeatedly putting me in stressful situations again and again doesn't relieve the stress. I can develop skills to *mask* it, I guess. But it doesn't make me hate the situation any less. It still feel constant anxiety, and eventually, I will do whatever I can to not be in the situation anymore because no one likes being that stressed out all the time.

I have several years of customer service on my resume. *Can* I work with clients? Sure. Can I do it *confidently*? You're going to have to tell me because inside I am screaming the entire time about how much I just want the situation to end. I've also worked as a receptionist, and I left that job fast. I got a lot of good feedback from my supervisor about it, but I could *not* handle the stress of picking up the phone and not knowing what I would encounter for 8 hours straight. 

I just started with a new therapist, and I'm *hoping* she's going to have something useful for me other than what I've been told my entire life because it doesn't work. And I am so tired.",4,anxiety

This feeling seems a moot point because when I am alone all I have the energy to do is sit, dissociate, and find ways to not be alone. I wish to be healthy, I feel a sense of dread when I take my medication, remembering how unhealthy I've become. No amount of health will prevent what befalls us all in the end, so what is the point? These thoughts make me anxious, they make me wish I were a character in a story, timeless, ageless, immune to the depravities of the world and of what comes after. Sex is a great distraction, when I am embraced I do not remember I will die, but then he/she/they leave and I am then left with myself, my reality.  I daydream the what ifs and sometimes almost forget they aren't real. I live pleasure to pleasure, what will give me enough pleasant chemicals in my brain to get me through the foreseeable future? What will distract me to the extent that I forget what it is I am anxious about or that I am anxious at all? If there is a cure please let me find it.... Perhaps this existential awareness and dread is what it means to be human? I am not sure if this is ""normal"" or if I will ever feel ""normal."" I just know I am exhausted and tired of being anxious.",4,anxiety

"I was very flattered to be asked to be a bridesmaid (one of six) to my mother-in-law who is remarrying. She see's me as a daughter and wanted me to me part of the very special day.

I have various anxiety disorders, which make it difficult for me to do, well, anything. It is extremely debilitating. I barely leave the house. Can't get into other people's cars. Can't go into public places (other than a supermarket), don't see friends etc. I see a psychiatreist and a therapist weekly, and we have been working on a plan and doing exposures to help.

When she originally asked me a few months ago, I initially said that I do not think it was a good idea, due to my mental health. I said I did not want her to be worrying about me, as the day is all about her, so I am happy to be in the background, unnoticed. She said that I do not have to partake in any activities that I will not feel comfortable doing, and I do not have to match dresses or walk down the aisle etc.

Well, this has now all changed, and before I knew it, I had an invitation to a dress try on's, booked to see a hair stylist, makeup etc. All, I suppose, are normal for a wedding (so yes, stupid for me to assume that I wouldn't do this). I have said that I can't really do these things, but I keep getting booked on to do it. I have only managed to do the dress try on. But, I have been trying to find the bravery to book to see a dressmaker to make alterations, and just can‚Äôt face it. And, even though it‚Äôs well known I can‚Äôt get into a car, I‚Äôm getting picked up by a bus to take me there. Something I just cannot do.

I managed to get a dress second-hand very cheap (less than ¬£30). I bought my own shoes and jewellery, so, the brides hasn‚Äôt paid for a lot. 

There are now several months until the wedding. And although I have been doing a lot to try and get myself into a position where I could walk down the aisle with her, do a speech etc., but, I just don't think I'm there yet. So I am wanting to back out of being a bridesmaid, and just attend as a guest, where I can sit at the back near an exit and be more of a fly-on-a-wall.

I want to know if I‚Äôm going to be a horrible person if I back out. I'm so nervous to even speak about it with her, because I cant stand that I'll be upsetting someone, or ruining their plans. This is THEIR wedding, and they must be so nervous as it is and I really really do not want to add to it or cause any unnecessary stress. I'm just so worried that it'll come to the day and I just won't be able to leave the room, and by then, it's too late. It‚Äôs horrible that my anxiety affects others and not just me.",4,anxiety

"Struggling to live normally in my own home

(Long a** read) - anxiety and paranoia.

Hi all, 

TLDR; anxious and paranoid  about neighbours listening to everything I do. So I live in complete silence and it‚Äôs driving me insane. Help!

_____________

I moved into an apartment a few years ago. And when I first moved in I felt great. I played music a lot and everything else no problem. My neighbours were also a lot noisier, like I could hear my next door neighbours TV, general chatter. It was really nice and homely. 

Anyway, I went through a rough patch and started drinking heavily, during which time I would go on rants & argue with people.. i was very loud & obnoxious. I also fell out with a few of my neighbours, because I was blasting music until early hours and just being an all around prick really. Once I quit drinking I managed to make up with everyone expect my next door neighbour. Deep down I‚Äôm also embarrassed how I was when I was drinking, and I genuinely think some of my neighbours want to listen in on me for entertainment now & probably didn‚Äôt realise I was going through some BS and drinking. 

My issue is that when I do anything I feel like people are listening in, and it‚Äôs like people stop what they‚Äôre doing. The only time I hear ‚Äúnormal‚Äù neighbour sounds is when they don‚Äôt realise I‚Äôm at home. I‚Äôve been living so quietly that my downstairs neighbour commented to me ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre alive then‚Äù sometime last year.. a few months back he mentioned that he can‚Äôt hear anything, but just my footsteps.. and now I‚Äôve resulted to learning how to step silently and placing thick cloth or thick material on where my main walking paths are in the house so I can walk silently. 


Some more examples: 

* I have a loud mechanical typing keyboard, which sounds similar to tapping ‚Äî and my neighbours aren‚Äôt too young, 50+ mainly and I‚Äôm 28,‚Äî & multiple times I‚Äôve heard people tapping back. Not just one tap. But  consecutively, mimicking me typing. I don‚Äôt think they realise it a a keyboard. I‚Äôve resulted to learning how to type without noise and placing a foam pad under my keyboard. I‚Äôve not heard the tapping since. Another example is when I was using a normal computer mouse with a loud click. I would hear a neighbour flicking things on and off asif mimicking me. I‚Äôve resulted to getting a silence mouse ‚Äî now I never hear that.   

* when I want to use my oven or washing machine which both slam into their latch, I hear someone slamming back. 

The one strange thing is, when someone else is with me none of this happens, and actually when other people are here my anxiety completely goes. 

My only remedy is putting my washing mashing on a long wash, or leaving my heating on which makes listening through the walls nearly impossible and masks my noise. The only issue with the heating is, when it‚Äôs pressure is low and on a timer, where it turns on and off frequently it sounds like a tap turning on and off ‚Äî  one of my neighbours started copying it.. until a few days ago where i was speaking to a neighbour and I told him I always have my heating on, he looked a bit puzzle and now I never hear someone copying it. Another remedy was leaving my kitchen fan on, but the noise was unbearable. 



I‚Äôm unable to cook, clean or socialise. I can‚Äôt watch TV out loud or have conversations on the phone. Im also a music recording artist, and I cannot record my vocals. It‚Äôs driving me insane. Im struggling on a incomprehensible level. This is holding me back, and I feel like I‚Äôm trapped when I‚Äôm at home. I can‚Äôt ask my neighbours if they‚Äôre listening to me because no one would admit to that. Today, I was playing music, heard taps on the wall asif someone is listening and it resulted in me playing my music lower and lower until it was all the way down and I snuck into my room silently to lay on my bed in silence & write this reddit post. 

I have told my doctor about this but he doesn‚Äôt really understand, and it‚Äôs something that sounds so ridiculous it‚Äôs hard for me to convey & express. I‚Äôve told my parents. my mum just thinks  I‚Äôm scared of someone & doesn‚Äôt understand.  some friends know, but they can‚Äôt grasp the idea of someone suffering with this so can‚Äôt relate or give advice.  The response is usually them telling me how good their neighbours are. I am currently taking anxiety and depression medication partly as a result of this anxiety I have at home . But the medication is becoming less affective as time goes on & all my doctors wants to do is increase the dose and call it a day. I don‚Äôt hear voices or sign in my head, I‚Äôm not schizophrenic or anything else. 



Help üòî!

Edit ‚Äî also times I feel like I can‚Äôt even breath or chew on food. This isn‚Äôt an issue that I struggle with anywhere else, though I do have social anxiety which can be really bad or non existent depending on my extent of depression. Also, if I‚Äôm wearing headphone then the anxiety and paranoia just goes away",5,paranoia

"After a break up I recently had where my girlfriend would lie quite a lot about things being okay, going into a new relationship has me panicing, without any actual reason, every single day. I find it extremely difficoult to trust whatever my current girlfriend says, and also what some of my closest friends say. I've always had shown signs of paranoid behevior but then I could easily calm myself down by thinking about these thoughts were just me overthinking without any ""evidence"" behind them, but now not even this helps, not even the words of my girlfriend or best friend are enough to make me even a bit less paranoid. I've talked to my mom about this and she said that she was experienced similar things but none of them were as bad as mine. I honestly don't know how to deal with these thoughts, sometimes I'm able to convince myself that these simply aren't possible or are just not realistic, but that only works for maybe a few hours at best. It has gotten to the point where I can hardly fall asleep and even that's only after I had a panic attack. I'm wondering if anyone has any sort of advice?",5,paranoia

"When I was little I also had this long-running delusion (I think it would be called a delusion?) that my dad was going to kill my mom and I. I had no basis for this except that he owned knives, a gun, and he was very avoidant so if I suspected he was annoyed I thought it gave evidence for him wanting to kill us. This delusion got weaker over time and now I don't believe it at all. I told a therapist about this but she never commented on it or brought it up again.

A few years ago I was so depressed that I felt like I was losing touch with reality. I was convinced that my family and my ex knew I was planning to kms. My ex had texted me asking how I was and I remember being so paranoid and thinking, ""How does he know?"" I texted my cousin asking if she said anything to him since they he had contacted her before asking about me. I thought my parents had contacted him and told him to text me. I texted her again saying, ""I feel like I'm going crazy, everyone is trying to stop me but they're not confronting me"" or something along those lines.

Now it's 3 years later and I'm really depressed. I worry that I'll start being paranoid again because I feel pretty detached from everything and hopeless. I also have trauma and I've been triggered lately, which causes me to dissociate. That feeling is really scary because I'm already worrying about losing touch with reality to the extent that I become psychotic.

I watched like two videos of psychotic depression and they said how nihilistic delusions can be stuff about how nothing matters, you don't matter, etc. I mean isn't that just depressive thinking? I feel that way now so am I delusional? Please someone tell me I'm not crazy.",2,depression

"For years and years, I have always thought that someone on Grindr was altering my pictures and making fake profiles to fuck with me. 

And now it's happening again. Everyone always tells me I'm just paranoid. But there's so many connections/spam profiles that appear to just send me the same 10 messages and then disappear.

The most recent one was a guy and I were talking about meeting up and he suggested the softball field where I was playing softball that night. For 20 some years, I'd never hear anybody mention anything about this softball field. But just the other day this guy does and I tell him there's a league that plays there. and he blocks me.

I want this to end and I want to find out who's doing this! I previously got a new phone because I was so paranoid somebody had hacked into my phone. Now I think somebody is able to generate fake profiles on whim on this app and fuck with me through it. 

Idk if anybody can help. Reassuring me that it's just my paranoia won't do it. I've been in therapy for years, and nothing. I feel helpless.",5,paranoia
"I finally opened up to someone about what I been going through, I've been really concerned about opening up to someone about things cause I worry they'll use it to take advantage of me or become afraid of me suddenly.  But it went well and felt really good being able to finally talk to someone.

I feel like it would have been helpful to have a concise term for people not experiencing schizophrenia when I was sharing stuff with them though.  I've heard people use something like Neurotypical or something for people who don't have A.S.D.  I tried googling stuff but couldn't find the right search terms to get something useful.  Anyone familiar with a word that would scratch that itch? Or if you want to take a swing at minting a new word lemme hear it!

And just to reiterate:  Absolutely not looking for anything mean-spirited

P.S. I just re-read the sub-rules and got anxious that my post broke rule 10 about labeling people, I don't think it does but apologies if I misinterpreted.  I just want a respectful word that isn't ""normal people"" for people that have different challenges then me.",6,schizophrenia

"She loves her family but also is fearful of conflict with her parents. So as much as she loves them, and is willing to do what they ask, she will go out of her way to ensure they are not angered.

This ""going out of her way"" has entered our relationship.

We started dating at 24, and now were 29.

When we started dating and still to now she needs to ask to use her parents vehicle because she still has not got one yet due to focusing on school and not work.

She has a curfew living at home, and she follows it very closely. She has never slept over at my house and any time she has been like 30 mins to an hour late her dad will blow up her phone, and yell at her for disobeying his house rules... despite her age. This has affected us because she has slept over maybe 5 times in the years together, but she has to lie and say she slept over at a friends house.

She and I lived together for 3 years during college. She made me agree to never tell her parents that we lived together and so any time I speak to them about college I had to lie. She was paranoid and worried that they would disown her because she was living in sin (catholic) since we were not married. So for 3 years, anytime they came to visit I had to move all of my stuff out, and further continue to lie.

One time her dad mentioned that I should lose weight because I look unhealthy. I shrugged it off, but what annoyed me more was that she didnt stand up for me since she was at dinner and heard that be said. Her siblings told him to cut it out and such but she didnt. She just apologized for her father and said ""thats how he is.""

She and I have sex, and she is very worried they will find out, not just like caught in the action find out, but even birth control wise. Her sister was on birth control for period pains and her mom found out and forced her to get off of it. So in the years together she and I do NO form of PDA in front of her parents.

She got a tattoo and has to wear make up to hide it for fear her parents will yell at her.

Finally, this has been a huge mental struggle of mine. I have been in therapy because of this. But she got an abortion, our contraception failed. Her fears of her parents finding out came up and she felt depressed, numb, and even suicidal. She didnt want them to find out about being pregnant out of marriage, and so she went ahead with it. She was very much against the idea but her fear of her parents outweighed her wants.

Further and sadly, she blamed me for her abortion months later. I talked with my therapist and they mentioned how she is projecting her wishes to keep our baby and since we weren't married, she blames me, despite her clear reasons being her parents.

I understand the red flags here. I do. 

But I want to understand what is going on with her. I wish she didnt have so much paranoia and didnt let her parents affect her decisions so much. 

She doesn't see how unhealthy her fear of her parents is, I brought it up once around when we had an abortion and she almost left me because it was as if she couldn't face the truth.

What is going on here? Please reddit, help me understand...",5,paranoia

"Just a warning I‚Äôm going to talk about a medical experience which honestly would be very triggering for me to read, if I wasn‚Äôt the one writing, so please skip if it might cause distress. 

For context I was diagnosed with anxiety and have been seeing various therapists and psychologists since I was around 12 years old. 

Because I was lucky enough to get some kind of treatment (even if half of them were unhelpful) I have learned strategies to manage my anxiety over time and it does not usually dominate my life. Full blown panic attacks have been very rare for the last 8 years or so.

I used to have severe medical phobia as a kid (throwing up & hyperventilating over something as simple as an x ray) but I became a lot more comfortable as an adult with these strategies, even getting blood tests and such on a regular basis. I discovered I have a high pain tolerance, and that I can go through lot more than I thought possible.

Two years ago however, I had an IUD insertion done as it is a highly recommended birth control. Before the insertion I was told to just take an ibuprofen on the day, but reassured that it wouldn‚Äôt be too uncomfortable and no further pain management was necessary. I should have suspected something was up when started panicking while signing off all the waivers in the waiting room‚Ä¶ the procedure was very painful but almost nothing compared to the painful side effects that would last almost a year afterwards. Not only did I have trauma from the procedure, but the way I was brushed off, or made to feel like I was over reacting by almost every doctor I saw while trying to fix the damage (and put an end to the constant pain) made me absolutely mental. 

Now I have meltdowns even thinking about having to go in for a physical exam, or Pap smear in the future. I try to control my anxiety but it‚Äôs also fuelled by the fact that I‚Äôve experienced how women‚Äôs pain is not considered, barely even researched in the medical world. I keep panicking, just thinking about what will happen to me if I need to go in for ANY medical check up or procedure. 

I don‚Äôt know how to overcome this medical fear when it feels so realistic. Tonight I accidentally read a post  about colposcopies and I immediately was shaking and crying, couldn‚Äôt control my breathing just thinking about how I might need this procedure one day.

"18F - I currently have enough money to buy the car of my dreams I have always been dead set on getting a classic car and I found it and have the ability to purchase it in the next few days but my constant paranoia about finances and how that can affect me in any way shape or form is holding me back from doing this. I feel like I get so close to doing some thing that I really want to do and have a passion for and then seconds before it happens I switch flips my brain and I go down these holes of what if‚Äòs like ‚Äòwhat if I buy this car and I magically get kicked out of my apartment and I have nowhere to live but I just wasted money on this car when I could‚Äôve used it to help my living situation‚Äô ‚Äò what if people think that I am trying to flaunt wealth that I don‚Äôt have and I start getting harassed or people talk about me and I get pushed out of the city I live in‚Äô ‚Äò what if me buying this car is stupid because the follow your dreams idea seems to not work out for a lot of people and cause a lot of disappointment what if I end up super disappointed in myself‚Äô 


I have suffered from paranoia and OCD for a few years now and as much as it has calm down in certain areas specific events like getting close to my dreams and doing what makes me happy starts this spike in paranoia and obsessive thoughts and obsessive actions where I don‚Äôt know how to function and I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends so I can‚Äôt bounce things off of people when I need to talk about them so I just have to sit alone. 

I have the option to put down a $500 hold on the car and I want to do it but my brain isn‚Äôt letting me do anything it‚Äôs like two sides of my brain are fighting with each other one wanting to do this thing in the other constantly spewing anything to talk me out of it. I want to do things that make me happy but I Ithink the problem is that I haven‚Äôt been happy in a really long time and I don‚Äôt know if putting my happiness above some thing that tomorrow or in a month or years later could really hurt me financially is worth it. My need to constantly explain myself to people and hear their feedback has a lot to do with my paranoia and now that I‚Äôve reached an age where decisions are up to me and I know the decisions I want to make but my brain cannot let me go through and do it.

A big part of my anxiety has always been that I convince myself that something is a massive issue when it really isn't, so coping with that has meant a lot of just taking the time to reassess the situation and realize that I'm not in danger.
So what am I supposed to do when something actually is a problem? 
I dealt with this issue when covid first started, and I'm dealing with it now as a trans teen in the US. I'm medicated now and it's definitely helped a little, but things are still bad. How do I keep my anxiety from becoming debilitating when I can't just reason my way out of it? How do I look a situation in the face and acknowledge that it is shit and then just keep going? If anyone has any advice please share because I've been struggling pretty bad lately. I seem to swing between overwhelming panic when I acknowledge the situation or feeling fine and just ignoring it completely. Neither are sustainable, is there anything I can do?",4,anxiety
"So he‚Äôs going on holiday and he just said in my group chat:


‚ÄúHey, I just thought, I wonder if they‚Äôre taking me on holiday to kill me. I‚Äôm going to take a knife‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck it, crap. This could honestly happen. Okay I‚Äôve said it now, if I go missing it‚Äôs not an accident.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay this could happen, tell the police this if they investigate my body‚Äù 


This goes on for a while. We also saw his ex the other day walking down the street, they‚Äôve not seen in 3 years and he theorised that she must have been stalking him and following him, so we should wait near her school and ‚Äústalk her‚Äù.

He also has pride in himself for the fact that he always considers every possibility but it sounds a bit more like that a justification for being paranoid.",5,paranoia

"I made a post yesterday asking how to know when you need to seek professional help. Today, I happened to end up in the situation perfect for me to seek the school counselor. Such a coincidence right? And I guess I must've been insane because I decided to. And lol that essentially felt like public humiliation and I'm  never seeking help ever again.

First of all, they informed me that discussing anything related to self-harm or suicide obliged them to inform parents and the relevant authorities. Although, I guess I expected it. But that just means that the only legitimate reason I had for seeking help couldn't be a reason anymore. 

Still, I decided to talk about friendship-related stuff instead. I even teared up a few times (which made it worse because why did I break so easily and why did the person's words even mean anything when I knew they thought I was a joke). They were judging me the entire time I was there, as if I was an immature teenager who was overly concerned with friends and obviously lacking life experience because life isn't all about friends. Fair enough, I am. But I wasn't expecting it. I used the term 'emotionally unavailable' at some point, which may have been slightly off because I just wanted to describe being too emotionally overwhelmed for anything, but then the counsellor basically clowned me for the rest of the session with that term lmao. They kept laughing whenever they said it 'to put it in my words', along with things.

Not that I want to discourage anyone else from seeking help. Please do. This is just my personal experience. Perhaps I expected too much of a school counselor. Perhaps I didn't even need to seek help in the first place. Either way, I'm never doing it again. I tried taking a step towards getting better and now I'm two steps back. Dying does seem like a better alternative doesn't it lol",2,depression

"So I (23F) absolutely love plushies. In fact, I'm working on collecting a certain series of plushies. They are a bit expensive (like $10) but I consider myself responsible with my money. I have a good amount of money saved up and hoping to buy a house at the end of the year.

I got one of these plushies and my mom spotted it in the plastic bag and I told her what it was since she asked, and she was like ""another one?!"" and I tried defending myself saying how it's a series I've collected and all she said was ""well you need to save your money!"" There was time before where she questioned me on what those plushies were and I felt embarrassed. 

I feel like now I always have to hide those particular plushies from my mom because I'm always questioned or feel judge for this particular interest. I don't feel like this interest/hobby is hurting anyone and not hurting me financially, so why am I being judged for this? Does anyone else have their parents judge them for their hobby? I just feel embarrassed when my mom comments on it.",1,autism

"My head is a mess as I write this so apologies if this comes across as very scrambled. Just need to get this out.

I am so exhausted of feeling this way - every day, from the minute I leave the ""safety"" of my bedroom, I am on high alert. I can't explain it any other way - it's like my body kicks into fight/flight mode and I become super sensitive to everything (movement/touch/especially **sound** \- I cannot stand loud noises). It's especially bad when I go outside, I feel my heart beating so fast and can barely catch my breath, I am so afraid. I make eye contact with other people, but only for a split second to try and see their intentions. If it looks like they are going to walk too close to me, or worse still brush past me and touch me, I will honestly cross the road. I do this multiple times in every journey, to the point where I think I must look like a lunatic. 

If somebody has to cross my path and walk behind me, I will turn my neck and follow them to make sure they don't come too close. 

Plus, I feel like nearly everyone is watching me. As in, when I walk past another person they will turn their head and look at me, I never know why and it just makes me even more uncomfortable than I already am. It's like they can see into my mind and know how scared I am. 

I am actually at my wits' end and feel like I am losing it. I just want to try and be rational, but I'm struggling so much.",5,paranoia
" I saw an old woman who has been begging in my city for years today, she is always covered in filth, wearing destroyed clothing, and mumbling incoherently while stretching her arm and forming a bowl with her hand. I used to think that she was a nuisance and should be locked away from society, but i realised, that maybe if i hadnt gotten  assistance early in life i would have ended up like her. Im not better than her. I have no idea what she has,   but it has been going on for decades without any help, that sounds like hell. I cant even get to class on time because sometimes my hallucinations end up keeping me up at night, and i see a psychologist twice a week and a psychiatrist every now and then. 
 Although, im 16, and i used to hate her a few years ago, i was a child and children tend to be assholes lol. But i do feel bad about how much i detested her, given that she hasnt done anything, besides begging. Its sad how society is organized in a way that fails people like her so badly.",6,schizophrenia
"I get these scenarios that pop into my head and cause me to be paranoid all the time over things that have a very little chance of ever happening. Please note that I am on medication and I do share these scenarios with a professional. 

My newest one involving the bathroom in my house. See, my bathroom only has a small window. It‚Äôs between the shower and the toilet. From the outside you can‚Äôt even see ones shadow because it‚Äôs up so high. The scenario I keep having when I go in there is someone seeing me turn the light on, stand in front of the toilet to either sit to use the bathroom or to undress to get in the shower and just shoot me through the window in my head. 

It‚Äôs like I can see the outside of my house, the mysterious shadow person lurking in the deer grass (some tall grass that the deer like in my yard). I can see him (because mysterious shadow person is always a man, idk, I don‚Äôt make the rules when it comes to my thoughts) move closer to the window to get a better shot, pull out his gun and shoot. 

The scene switches to inside my bathroom where the glass breaks, and just before I have the chance to look over, my body falls lifeless onto the tile. The scene switches to my 4 month old crying in his crib from the loud noises waking him. The scene switches back to me laying on the tile just gone. Unknowing of what happened and what will happen to my son and my fianc√© now that I‚Äôm gone. 

Whenever this happens in my head I tend to duck when I enter the bathroom and avoid getting too close to the window. I find standing in front of my bathroom sink stressful because I can‚Äôt duck and still see in the mirror. I sometimes find the intrusive thoughts after that scenario playing to be too much and so I‚Äôll leave the bathroom without finishing or starting what I went in to do (excluding using the toilet cause I can‚Äôt just get up midshit or piss). 

I have a major fear of death, no understanding of the afterlife and don‚Äôt know how to react to death. I‚Äôm a paranoid schizophrenic. Most of my paranoia comes from that fear of death so therefore most of the scenarios end in my death while others end in my fianc√© or my sons death. I have many other repeatable scenarios that pop into my head every day. It‚Äôs interesting when I get a new one because it only takes one time seeing that in my head to never go away. 

Most of the time these main scenarios are followed by a plethora of intrusive and unsettling thoughts. These thoughts will continue until I change what I‚Äôm doing or where I‚Äôm at to get rid of that setting, or they won‚Äôt stop until I‚Äôve found some resting time, whether it be laying down for a short nap or just finding a moment to collect myself. I have also found that i have more throughout the day and night since I‚Äôve had my son. 

Just wanted to share something publicly that I struggle with anonymously. Also once again please remember that I do see a professional and I do share these issues with said professional. I live a normal life aside from my mental flaws. Please delete if not allowed.",5,paranoia

"Once every while it happens. I see a post from one of you where you stand up for yourself only to immediately retreat and apologize when the other person plays the victim. I know many of us are weak to manipulation because these kinds of things are simply our Achilles heel. I'm not sure who needs to hear this among us, but don't let them do this to you. 

The reason why we stand up for ourselves is because people from time to time cross our boundaries and we have to enforce said boundaries to preserve our mental health. Your boundaries are completely up to you and you will likely surround yourself with different people depending on what they are. Enforcing boundaries against people who do not give them the respect they deserve is never wrong. Do not be afraid to do it. Everybody is entitled to respect. You too. 

A lot of you will paddle back and apologize because we are easily manipulated. But even then we can do our best to arm ourselves against it. There are actually many common strategies that manipulators use like gaslighting or guilt tripping. It's vital to be informed of these behaviours because it will allow you to pinpoint such strategies and know how to respond to them or prepare for what comes next. Please understand this. If you apologize, they win. And if they see that they can easily trample over your boundaries, it only invites them to do it more cause they now know you're an easy target. It might feel like the polite or civil thing to do, but it's the wrong course of action. Stand your ground. I'm sure you have your reasons for calling people out. Respect your reasons. 

The world is a good place, but at times it can also be really nasty and bad people can often take advantage of people who can't resist them in really vile ways. This is my attempt to look out for people who need to hear this. Look after yourself, folks. And if you can, look after people who need you to do it for them.",1,autism

"I am 20 (m) and my depression is at an all time high. On November 1st 2022 I quit my job at Walmart for an opportunity to leave state and go live with my grandfather in Mississippi. I had only met him once in my life after my father had passed. He wanted to get to know me and wanted me to stay with him. I live with my mother and before I quit I had lashed out at her a couple times (yes it was stupid and I highly regret it) I lashed out at her because I was just so angry where I was at in life. Living in this stupid town where there‚Äôs nothing for me and working at Walmart which now that I look back was the only thing I had going for myself. I didn‚Äôt have a car and was just frustrated with everything. I blamed her for not helping me enough, she didn‚Äôt teach me how to drive and I didn‚Äôt have a car and most of all for moving us to the town. I did apologize to her but my mom was listening to what I was saying and contacted my grandmother. So long story short I suppose my grandmother contacted my grandfather and he offered me an opportunity to come live with him. He said he had land and stuff and he‚Äôd teach me how to drive and everything plus it was a change of scenery. So I thought yea I‚Äôll take this opportunity. I quit and my aunt was supposed to get me but let‚Äôs just say me leaving never came into fruition. Also found out my grandfather is very negative very very negative and he pissed me off so I don‚Äôt even want him in my life anymore. November wasn‚Äôt really that bad since I got my last check from Walmart and had money. In December I had a fight with my stepfather because he was drunk and threw my mothers phone so I confronted him about it and told him to get the fuck out. He told me ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even do anything‚Äù and yes he was drunk but that statement is very true because at the time I was waiting on something that just didn‚Äôt happen. We moved past that and now on to 2023 this is easily the worst year of my life since 2010 when my father passed. Every job I‚Äôve applied for I either don‚Äôt get or I get stood up. I‚Äôve applied to Kroger, the local hospital, a car wash, sherwin Williams, a machine operator, lowes, planet fitness, big lots, super 1 and I haven‚Äôt gotten a single offer. I‚Äôm damn near going broke and I feel pathetic. I feel like my father is looking down on me with disappointment. I can‚Äôt be happy with my current situation, everyone is getting to their goals and mines just came to an halt. It‚Äôs my fault, everything. The one good thing I had going for myself I fucked it up and that was Walmart. As shitty as Walmart is, I may have to go back there. No one really talks about how being unemployed fucks you up mentally. Feeling like you‚Äôre nothing and and embarrassment. I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough and I‚Äôm still just trying to hold on but this darkness seems eternal. I know my parents think I‚Äôm an embarrassment. The truth literally came out of my step fathers drunk ass mouth. They probably think I‚Äôm a lazy bum who sits on his ass all day. I‚Äôve been struggling and I‚Äôm just about ready to give up.

And my mom hates that I don't care what I look like half the time, but really, would she rather me lay in bed all day and let the dogs and chickens go hungry? UGH I DONT FREAKING KNOW ANYMORE, all that I know is that I HATE feeling like this, this weird, empty and angry feeling with an anxious buzz in the background. My chest feels heavy, but my stomach empty, with this ache that I can't rightly explain. I just want people to see that I am trying, that I'm a person too. Hell, I'm so disconnected from reality that my vision is blurry, I know what I'm seeing and I can describe it to people, but it's also like I'm watching a youtube video. The only reason that I even picked up photography was because I could actually *experience* the pictures. And hell, my mom wanted me when no-one else did, and now she's leaving too. She adopted me when my bio abandoned me, I don't know a thing about the lady, I was barely a year old. I had a brother I never knew and had to ATTEND his funeral. I don't want my mom to leave me like everybody else, sure I've got a sister and family I love and care about, but it's different with her. God I'm just so sick of it all, sometimes I want to comit suicide because then they'll wish they saw the signs but I know thats shitty of me, and other times I wish I could commit but I always shame myself down from it. I just don't want to exist anymore, not if it's always going to be like this. And for anyone even thinking that I should go to therapy, trust me, we have tried to get me in counseling, the places in my area don't take my insurance, and that crap is expensive, and frankly we are not in the best of financial situations right now. Nobody around me would understand if I told them, I've been this disconected since I was around 7, and I genuinely believe I don't deserve help, I deserve to suffer for all the bad shit I've done, and I know nobody agrees with that, but they would if they just knew the half of the crap I've done. In some twisted part of me I just want someone to agree that, ""Yes, I am useless and I deserve everything bad that has happened/will happen to me.''",2,depression
"I am pretty active on twitter under a pseudonym. Recently, I've grown incredibly suspicious of a handful of my followers. I feel like two/three in particular are plotting against me. I think one of them is trying to push me out of the fandom space in order to take over my position. I think another one is posting seemingly innocuous tweets where she talks negatively about a character I like, and that these tweets are directed at me in order to make me feel bad because she wants me dead/away. I think a third one is pushing my buttons a little bit. I think people in general are surveiling me because they dislike me and are waiting for an opportunity to attack me. I'm afraid that some people are gonna stalk or doxx me.

Thing is, twitter can be ruthless, so it's not like my fears are completely unfounded. I don't have any definitive proof that these people are out to get me, just a feeling. 

The issue is that it's affecting my real life a lot. I struggle to sleep because I'm so anxious. I have nightmares. I have been growing increasingly fond of alcohol to lessen the feelings. I'm struggling to concentrate on uni. I deactivated my main twitter account and I look absolutely deranged on my private account because I'm talking about how people are out to get me.",5,paranoia

"I (37/F) feel like I have it all. I have a job I love that pays well and can buy most things I want. I am managing my debt very well and am making big strides to pay it off early. I live on my own in a clean, well decorated apartment. I have 10 people I can call my best friends, and we get together in person often. I have a boyfriend that I feel super secure with relationship wise. I am incredibly physically fit and am working towards my first strongman competition. I have trauma from childhood stuff (long story, family of addicts, hoarders and enablers), but my family is now clean and did 180s with their personalities. I forgive my parents for what happened and, while I still butt heads with my sister at times, overall have a great relationship with my whole family. My cat is healthy and loving. My car is paid off and has no issues. Everything is perfect. Everything.

And I'm miserable. I have trouble sleeping and focusing at work sometimes. Sometimes, I am not actively doing something, my body feels like it's gonna explode with anxiety. Tonight, after a great workout day and day at the horse barn with my mom, while playing video games with my male friends, I started sobbing and as far as I can see I have NO reason to be upset.

"People always say to work on your own skills and improve. But it seems that something is wrong with my brain, because I can't do it.

I wanted to learn to play the piano. I played when I was a child and I wanted to learn again, I even took a class. But I hardly continued to practice, and now I've forgotten everything again.

I wanted to write a novel. I've started several, but never finished a single one. I only made it halfway through Nanowrimo. I have an ongoing webnovel that I haven't updated in three months.

I wanted to learn to draw. I said I would draw one page a day in my sketchbook. Now I can't even draw one line a day, and my drawings look just as bad as when I started out. I only made it to Lesson 2 of DrawABox.

I wanted to learn a new language. I can't keep up with my daily reviews, and I've just been doing them off and on. It's been over five years since I started, but I can't even form simple sentences in my target language. Like, first-grader level.

It seems that I don't have the resolve to learn anything new, and giving up seems like the only reasonable option. It's not just that I don't have the motivation or energy, it's the fact that I literally don't improve when doing it that sends me into a cycle of giving up on my dreams, only to try again later before giving up once again.

"For context, I live in Canada and I work for a large financial co-operative in the Property and Casualty insurance sector going on nearly 7 years now. I work from home which I enjoy tremendously. I like the work I do although it can get overwhelming at times. I like the people I work with and I really like the organization as well. We have had many restructures at work; teams have been amalgamated, managers have come and gone, temp assignment coworkers stepping in place of managers while the role is being filled... it's been a wild ride. I received my ADHD diagnosis 3 years ago. During my time with said employer, I have had my fair share of ups and downs being put on Attendance Plans for taking too much sick time off, Performance Improvement Plans due to my inconsistency at work, and was given 2 write-ups for performance related actions (these only stay on HR file for 3 years and have since expired). In the past 2 years I have been consistent and done excellent work, but as anyone with ADHD knows these flashes in the pan can fade and you're hit with little to no motivation - this is where I am now.

During year 4 with my employer I went on a leave for 1 year which led to my ADHD diagnosis with a psychologist after years of struggling with depression and anxiety along with on and off alcohol abuse. I do take medication but it's effectiveness varies. I am speaking with a therapist but effectiveness also varies. Right now in the midst of yet another restructure, one of the best managers I have ever had the joy of working under left after 2 weeks. This was devastating as he had given me so much support with my issues; lots of guidance, empathy and understanding. I am yet again in limbo waiting on a permanent manager and I am anxious to see what kind of individual this person will be.

To get to the meat of it - I am on a ""Sick Note Program"". This means that I must provide a sick note from my GP (who is amazing and very helpful) every time I am off. This has been no issue. Since the temp assignment manager has shown up they have now told me I need to list my ""limitations"" in the note in order to get paid. This has been a struggle since any time I tell my GP I need the note to list my limitations she hesitates. She tells me they do not need to know this information. I had one manager ask me to get a write-up of my diagnosis from my doctor, to which my GP politely said ""the fuck you don't"". I have also been taking too many breaks at work as my mental health has declined and I am into the alcohol again... I was then notified by my temp assignment manager that this may put me on another Performance Improvement Plan which I *really* do not want to go through again. I was only just advised very recently that I can use a certain ""time off unpaid"" code on my schedule if I need a longer break here and there and I am floored as to why I was never told earlier as I could have utilized it sooner.

I want to put heavy emphasis on the fact that **I know employers are not friends or family and they only care about their bottom line.** The organization I work for puts a strong emphasis on mental health and employee support at work but I feel left out. I have made each manager/temp manager aware of my diagnosis/struggles/need for accommodations but since management has been coming and going this is getting very tiring and I am feeling ashamed/burned out. I took this week off to regroup and get back on the bandwagon - I have a call with my GP today and we are going to work on a new action plan. Mental health struggles are never linear. We go through ups and downs, set backs and great strides. I am frustrated by what I feel to be a lack of transparency on employer's side, but I also feel great fear of losing my job. I don't know what sort of accommodations I can have made, and I am worried I am going to be let go. HR is not your friend, but I want to protect myself as much as possible yet I am afraid of reprisal.

Thanks for reading.

"I underwent a miniature diagnostic process for autism a few weeks ago with my therapist. I got a 6/10, which is just on the threshold that qualifies me for a full follow-up, potentially leading to a diagnosis. I had a previous therapist indicate that I could be on the spectrum as well.

But, frankly, I'm dying to know the answer. I live in the UK and with the current state of healthcare it could take months for me to find out. But, I feel like I've already kind of accepted my diagnosis before getting it, which feels foolish. But something about it feels so right, I don't know. Even the few people I have in my life seem to think it's highly plausible that I could be.

I don't know what I should be feeling, but I'm already feeling a strange sense of relief. Like even if I am not autistic, it feels like I'm a step closer to understanding myself and why I am the way I am. It feels like a very important question that's going to be unanswered for a large amount of time.

How did everyone else's diagnostic process go? How did you feel when you first found out you might have autism, and how did you feel when you'd been officially diagnosed?",1,autism

i had this card for less than 24 hours and i ruined it, and now all i can do is cry because i don‚Äôt know where i‚Äôd be without my mom and i just want her to know how hard i‚Äôm trying and how much i appreciate her but the card i bought for her is bent.

i‚Äôm gonna write everything i said here in it i guess and i KNOW she won‚Äôt care but i just feel so incompetent. like i got up for THIRTY SECONDS for the EXPLICIT PURPOSE of getting something to keep the card from getting bent and then i FORGOT the card and BENT it anyways.

"I have been awake over 24 hours and I got to say, the relief that acute sleep deprivation provides is insane. I have not felt like this in so long. Damn I never realized how dark and heavy of a blanket depression has been on my life. Wtf What an eye opener. Not recommending it as treatment, but it is eye opening to do it once in a while and literally see night and day. This is not the only time sleep deprivation has provided total relief. It is well documented. We are talking about acute sleep depravation here, not chronic where a person only sleeps 5 hours a day for extended periods of time, that is really bad for you, but so can being awake days straight.The main point of the post was to stress the eye opening experience that is the relief from depression through acute sleep deprivation. Put it this way: I really did not know what depression was until I saw the night and day difference. Depression is evil.

Anxiety is causing me severe stomach issues to the point I‚Äôm just laying in bed constantly. I‚Äôve no appetite from the pain, which leads to more pain/dizziness/fatigue/weakness from not eating.

"Hi all,

I used to be a strong believer of God. Then I entertained the doubts which grew day by day until very little of my belief has remained.

With that, my mental well-being went downhill as my anxiety was through the roof.

I've lost some of the ideas that used to make life so much easier such as 
-Everything happens for a reason.
-God has chosen what's best for me.
-I have a connection with a higher power and he'll take care of me.
-I have a high purpose in life.

Ever since my faith has weakened, I've become much more dependent on people for emotional support. I've become more needy whereas all I used to need was a quick prayer to make my worries go away and be content and hopeful.",2,depression

Then when my mind is somewhat clear I look back at life and feel nothing but existential dread knowing this is just how things are and I can't really do anything about it.

They say ""get help"", I have tried this. I did exactly what I was told, and I can say beyond any reasonable doubt that ""help"" made everything worse. 

Go to the doctors, get locked up and dehumanized and abused for a week or two, beg the doctor every time you seem him to let you out of there as this is a horrible place to be, eventually get let out and despite the meds they put you on be notably more depressed, reclusive, and psychotic to the point that you try to game end yourself and end right back up in there bc you can't do a single thing right. 5 times.

I get bothered very easily by minor things, like people looking at me or people talking to me or me failing to do anything perfectly or as according to plan. 

I live in a large village but the area is pretty self-contained, everyone knows each other there, I used to be a public drunkard.

My mind and my body is always planning to cause problems for me, and hence I always need to be very watchful/vigilant or else more problems mount up. 
I do walk outside when I am bored, but am unable to do so for very long due to the amount of people outside, don't want anyone to see me or know that I'm there.

Can't even walk out at night because my paranoia got the better of me and I caused some trouble, so I'm too scared to go out at night now because if they see me again they would kill me for sure. So I'm stuck in the house.

"I always seem to have these intense thoughts of people dying. 

When I was 10, I was SURE I wouldn't make it till age 11.
When my brother was 6, I was certain he would die before 7 because that just didn't sound right on him (and I feel HORRIBLE for even thinking that, I know it's awful).
We're both still here.

In November, I was driving with my family somewhere and I could not shake the feeling someone was going to die the whole trip (3 days) - I was sure it was going to be one of us but then I thought it would be my best friend's mom. I don't know why I even thought that about her specifically, maybe because she had been a little ill in hospital but not enough to die - she was literally due to get back home that weekend. My friend told me on the third day that her mum had died... on the same day I first got that feeling. 

And now, I'm moving away for college with my dad, leaving my mum and brother behind and I'm SCARED that something's going to happen to him and I wont see little brother again. Probably because I'm generally an awful sister who doesn't interact with him ever, and I feel like by the time I miss him and realise how much I need him, he's going to be gone and I'll have to live my whole life with regret. 

There's also another thing, I'm constantly scared that there's secretly someone, an evil spirit, murderer, whatever you wanna call it, in our house or hiding in my room. Did I used to watch a lot of horror movies at night? Yes, but even then I've never been scared for longer than just one night, if that. 

Even now, I had to curl under my duvet because I'm sure if I carried on typing this out of it, the thing or whatever would get me (it's night). Last night, as I was sleeping at about 5am, it seemed like something was shaking my bed - we don't get earthquakes and there's no feasible way for anyone to actually do that to my bed because it's massive, so I spent that time scared there was something with me. It's happened one or two times before too. I'm constantly expecting to see something in the mirror at night or just anything anywhere, and there are times I've fully convinced myself that there's something behind me in the mirror and that I saw it,
and I really don't like staying in my house alone if I could have a choice.

Am I just someone with an overactive imagination/horrible thoughts/childish? I'm 18 now, if that helps at all.",5,paranoia

"Yesterday I had a constant high level of anxiety that was so crippling I thought I was losing control and lost my mind and losing my life. I also had poor stomach health, and felt so nauseous, weak and sick. 

I‚Äôm on meds for stomach (IBS) etc so I thought it was the meds that gave me anxiety and that it was just my stomach displeased with the foods I ate. I sleep it off and I‚Äôm ok, had a pleasant day. 

At night after decorating cakes my narcissist grandma hurls some passive aggressive insults that sent me spiraling. It hurt me so bad, and then I felt nauseous as hell and I kept feeling light headed, dizzy, faint conscious and like puking. I‚Äôm sure she knew what she was doing.

Then I recalled an art TikTok where the commenters were bashing a beginner artist with things like ‚Äúare u 8 drawing like that‚Äù and I clicked on their profiles and I laughed thinking THEY WERE THE 8 Y/OS, with their appearance being literal children and felt so bad thinking they must be parroting awful things they‚Äôve heard from people and when my grandma said this I was haha. So there‚Äôs where those children are coming from.

I‚Äôm usually able to withstand the bullshit she is pulling. But I really couldn‚Äôt today.

"I have an on off boyfriend of about 7 years. We are both in our late 30‚Äôs. We don‚Äôt live together.  Over the past 18 months he has let me on much more and I‚Äôve realised he has anxiety and depression sometimes which seems quite debilitating. He can‚Äôt get to sleep normally with something and he struggles in every aspect of life really although he has been working to improve them ultimately he is still quite stuck. 

He is really a beautiful person and I‚Äôve seen the changes he‚Äôs made going from extremely angry acid tongued to now quite mellow albeit quite sad. The changes are what‚Äôs kept me around. 

However he has been saying he needs space and although my attitude was like ‚Äòyea right‚Äô as we were having the best time in our whole relationship I found this hard to believe. He has few friends and is alone a lot. 

I know I can‚Äôt make up for what he doesn‚Äôt have in friendships but he is actually my best friend and always been really supportive. I‚Äôm now trying to be on the same page and support what he needs which is space.

I‚Äôm just finding it hard to grapple with the great times I experience when I‚Äôm with him and him not finding value or fond memories of it to keep it going? 

We did spend some time together last weekend doing some selling which was planned months ago and when I left he called and asked if he ends the space will I come back? The issue is now I‚Äôve seen the extent of the depression, anxiety and how evening something like a holiday, new experiences and total change of scenery will not pull him out of it I think he needs therapy and that‚Äôs the only way I would even consider going back. He really has done a lot by himself in improvement but he has got some traumatic memories if I think about it from quite young (being abandoned) all the way up to recent adulthood. 

I guess I‚Äôm trying to find out if he is just actually tried of me or if the depression is affecting his perspective on the relationship. We have had our issues but we have always worked through them. I‚Äôm just struggling with the space as we‚Äôve kinda gone out on a high.",2,depression

"for the past few years, my ability to talk has become worse and worse. i used to be able to speak somewhat okay without getting too tired out and slip up occasionally (like stuttering a little or switching up words a bit), but now nearly every sentence i say makes no sense. everything i say is jumbled, i stutter super often and it takes longer than it should for me to get a sentence out. i have to often resay sentences 3+ times because i cant organize my words and it pisses me off. if i talk too much, itll start to feel like i have a faint sore throat (which i DESPISE the feeling of) and i have to strain more than i already do to get the words out. its so exhausting to speak aloud and i hate feeling ""pressured"" to continue talking because of the fact its not socially acceptable (from what ive gathered) to just choose to not speak. sometimes talking feels overstimulating, even when im not overstimulated otherwise.

as bad as this likely sounds, every time ive been overwhelmed to the point of not being able to speak at all, ive felt a sense of relief that i cant talk anymore, and my energy came back much quicker than if i were to be less overstimulated but still be able to talk. i wish i could just write on a notepad or in my notes app every time i wanted to speak, but i fear people wont be patient with me and i dont want to get yelled at by a stranger or something. GODDDDDDDDDD i just wish it was socially acceptable to not talk, because at this point it feels so irritating and horrible that it makes me want to punch something.

"Ok this is going to be hella long but I hope someone is willing to read this because I need help. For nearly my whole life or as long as I can remember (my earliest memory of feeling like this was when I was 4 and I am now 16) I have been extremely paranoid and it has not stopped in 12 years. It‚Äôs not a type of paranoia that I read about most on here like I‚Äôm afraid my neighbors are plotting against me or my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt actually love me. I constantly feel like there are ‚Äúthings‚Äù around me and out to kill me. They taunt me all day every day waiting for the one day they will all finally get me. Now obviously I know that this is a delusion, but I guess the thing with paranoia is you can‚Äôt actually convince yourself it‚Äôs not real. There is never a single moment where I am not afraid or weary of my surroundings. Like I said this has been going on since I was about 4. The first memory I have of it was I was sitting in my parents bed alone and I wanted to get up and go to the living room but I felt like there were evil things all around and if I got up they would hurt me and when I finally worked up the courage to get up I had to sprint to the couch because I could feel them chasing me. I‚Äôve lived with this feeling every since day since then. I don‚Äôt remember having any sort of crazy trauma that may have caused this, or maybe I did and it was so bad I can‚Äôt even remember it. My childhood is a foggy memory I don‚Äôt really know. 
I have ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù I guess that can be as short as a couple hours or as long as 2 weeks. They‚Äôre just periods of time where I am twice as paranoid than I usually am, and in consequence I severely lack in self care such as showering or brushing my teeth because I‚Äôm too scared to go into the bathroom or be near the mirror, or I can‚Äôt do anything all day because if I get out of bed or up off the couch I‚Äôm too vulnerable and in danger. I‚Äôve found that they are usually triggered by seeing a scary movie or creepy picture/video on social media because it gives my mind more delusions to make and place them everywhere in my life like for example something that has happened before was I saw a video from an account that makes like digital art video stuff and it was this very disturbing human looking creature creeping around and then bam that was everywhere in my house for the next two weeks. I basically live life in constant fight or flight mode. In my house it‚Äôs just me my dad and my dog. I do online school and my dad works full time 5/6 days a week so I am home alone 80% of the time and that is when I am the most scared and vulnerable. I am still very paranoid when my dad is home though, it‚Äôs just not quite as bad. I don‚Äôt think I have ever truly  hallucinated but I do always think I see things or see an object as something else like a person, or think I see things running around or past me. I also don‚Äôt think I really hear voices necessarily, it‚Äôs more of my voice in my head saying things that I‚Äôm not voluntarily thinking like ‚Äúif you go in there you are going to die‚Äù or ‚Äúget out right now‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs coming‚Äù, ‚Äúhurry‚Äù, stuff like that. Maybe that is what hearing voices is, but it sounds like my voice so idk. I used to only be paranoid when I was alone and when someone was with me I was completely fine. But in the past year and a half ish everything has been getting continuously worse I‚Äôm not even slightly okay anymore when I have someone with me, sometimes it‚Äôs worse and I think they‚Äôre not even real and just a trick to get me to feel safe and let my guard down. 
I‚Äôve always thought this would just go away one day or I‚Äôd get used to it but it is impacting my life way too severely now that I‚Äôve been considering therapy and maybe even medication who knows.

Even while I was in a genuine crisis I don‚Äôt think my friends did enough. Enough isn‚Äôt even a lot. 

I feel like it is very obvious when I start struggling but nobody ever asks if I want to grab a beer or something. Small things go so far for me. I feel like the worse I get the further they pull away. I‚Äôm not in trouble right now but I‚Äôm having a rough time but nobody has pulled me aside and asked if I‚Äôm okay.

Hell, I brought up to her that I had too much on my plate at work and she completely dehumanized the entire conversation and made it all about the company.

"Hi everyone,

I've written on this subreddit a few times. I have schizophrenia and my condition has always been very stable. I've always been positive and really my condition has worked out reasonably well, although it took a lot of time (years really) for it to become just a normal part of my life. I once wrote on this subreddit that the voices in my auditory hallucinations are my friends. This has always been true, the slight murmur of these kindly voices has always helped me. They tell me they care, and in some way are my companions. They are not very real just in the background really, but somehow I find them comforting - and certainly my medication helps me manage this constant part of my life (as it can be distracting.. amongst other things it keeps the energy low somehow).

I did not really understand that there could be bad hallucinations until recently. In my experience up until then I thought they (the hallucinations) could be tamed just by talking to them, or saying comforting things - I learned this as a coping strategy for when things seemed a bit surreal. It wasn't always easy with the voices there, certainly not all the time, and I could misunderstand how my feelings were projected by the voices - in a way they just respond to what's happening around me it seems. I have always loved them as a part of my life, it just makes me be me, although there were times I wished I could just be normal. In a way it was just that I was generally stressed at the time (it isn't easy finding out you have schizophrenia) - although now so long as I can find my peace, I just realize that I am normal.

However I did have a bad voice. I now think I did not understand how others felt on this subreddit, although I really did relate on people's situations. The way the bad hallucination spoke to me, I could tell the voice hated me. I don't know why this would have appeared to me, as my medication still works wonders. The voice really tried to torment me and wished every curse and hatred upon me.

I did not ever give up hope, and I knew this hallucination is nothing I personally consider about myself, and it has got better. Just by talking my way through it and staying strong I withstood it. I also distracted myself with plenty of other things to do - and filled my life with all the good things I could (as I try to do anyway). (I really like looking for free activities to do, or just stuff online etc.)

In a way this wasn't the first time a voice like this had occurred, but it had only ever lasted for a few hours - and so infrequently (maybe twice ever), I did not really remember or think of it as a bad symptom. There has been quite a lot of negative stimulus in the media which may have triggered it - and I find any negative stimulus can make my situation a bit worse (but generally I just don't watch TV anyway).

&#x200B;

So I just wanted to reach out to all of you, and say I really feel for you everyone. Keep safe, stay well. Wishing you peace.

&#x200B;

Edit: I should also say that it got a lot better, but it did take some time. I had to rest pretty much for quite a long time. Also I just did small things to keep active.

This hallucination was a new one also - it was very strange. I'm glad it's gone, but I'm going to look up some more techniques for strategies to cope in case something like this could occur again.",6,schizophrenia
"I've been having anxiety for the last 8-9 years of my life, but the last 1-2 years have been over the top.

I started Lexapro 10 mg about 1.5 years ago, and it has definitely helped a little bit, but I still have 1-2 week periods of excessive, bed ridden, over the top anxiety.

My biggest struggle is obsessing over certain thoughts.

I'll be 100% normal for 3-4 weeks. Living great, going out, spending time with my gf and my family, but then something will happen and I shut down.

I'll get sick, and I'll convince myself I'm dying.
A simple chest pain and I'll literally be stuck to my bed for a week checking my pulse and blood pressure 20 times a day.

I just can't keep going on through life with these crazy 1-2 week periods. I can't keep putting my girlfriend through this.

"Ever since I was forcefully injected with haldol in 2019 I have not been the same. I have just been living my life day to day. I can not remember what i had for dinner last night, I can't remember what anyone has said to me yesterday and Every single thought I have in my head is about how long do I have to suffer living like this. I used to have the greatest memory in the world. I could walk into a room and know if something was moved and now I can't even remember why I left my register keys in the register. Even tho I never needed the injection they forced me to get injected for 2 years Every month. The cops brought me to nicolet psychiatric for no reason at all and tried to make me sign documents saying i was schizophrenic. I refused to sign these papers so they kept me there and i could not leave until i signed them. Everyday they would take me to an office to sign the papers and i refused everyday for 16 days. After 16 days of saying no i didnt want to be there anymore so i signed the paper and got to go home. If i ever missed an injection they send the police to my house and arrest me. This actually happened to me. I was arrested and they tied me down and injected me. The only reason I was able to get off it us because they changed my case worker and the new case worker saw that I was not crazy. My first case worker hated me cause I didn't listen to him when he tried to tell me the injection was gona help me. He definitely knew I was not schizophrenic cause I told him I work 50 hours a week cause im an assistant manager at my store and i have been working there for 6 years I don't have time to be schizophrenic. On top of that they ordered me to go to court to get off it and my first case worker always recommended I stay on it for no reason. After I got my case worker changed I got off it cause my new case worker saw that I was not crazy and i explained to him I didn't have time to be schizophrenic. I have been off it for a year now but this experience has made me miserable cause being injected with this haldol for 2 years really changes everything in your mind. I have been taking nootropic's which is pills to help your brain function to try to get my memory and thoughts back to normal but it's not really doing anything. I just feel like I'm just living today for today not living today for the future. What happened to me is something I wish would never happen to anyone at all. No one will ever notice that there is anything wrong with me but I will never be the same again. I think about it everyday of what happened to me. My mind wil never be ok again and I have to live with this for the rest of my life and no one will ever know how it's affecting me.",6,schizophrenia

"17M - i know most of whoever sees this will feel the same or at least understand when i say that i'm gonna sound silly. at this point i don't know if it's a delusion or fact because it damn well could be fact, but there's still the paranoia of detectives/private investigators/police after me. i will admit i'm not the most golden law-abiding citizen out there. so far:

i'm suspicious of cars, people in shopping centres, any persons in vehicles, and i don't leave my room unless i'm about to piss myself and/or everyone else is asleep. the paranoia is concerning me.

12/13th April ~6pm. two cars (isuzu and... toyota, maybe) with tinted windows were parked along the road when i was walking on the side of a bushland surrounded road headed to my estate (suburbs). from both cars i got the vibe of being watched/taken photos of. one of them on my side of the road and parked close enough to the sidewalk that i could read the licence plate. as soon as i was perpendicular to the car it drove off. then when i got into my estate a police car was driving by the school near my house. that's what the last straw was for me.

and just tonight there was a police helicopter (VH-WAH POL61 western australian police force) that came all the way from the city just to circle twice around near where i live. like they traced a nutsack and went back to the city. when i looked up to it, it's flashing light held still as if to signify they knew i was watching them from the crack in my bedroom blinds. i swear, that's proof enough.

i feel this may be the start of a decline and i have absolutely nobody. 0 (zero) friends, mother is a bad person to me, can't talk to my sisters, father will think i'm crazy. i'm fucking lost.

" Hello redditors, I came here to share a story that might be of some benefit for people like us. Several years ago, I started univer-isty in a town far away from my home town, because I hated living with my parents, even though I have two little brothers that I love very dearly and enjoy being around them.

So my university started with a lot of excitement and sense of freedom, I was going to university to party and have fun, studying was the last think on my list; I was very anxious, a virgin, no friends in the new town, very self-conscious, I felt ugly and had a generally bad attitude towards myself. So with this shitty baggage, I was drinking multiple times a week partying as much as I can and making as many friends as possible. I was basically playing the popularity game, yet at the same time avoiding all of my insecurities and not working on any of them, since I hated myself there was no room for the thoughts to fix them. Not long after drugs came into the picture and I was ""testing"" all the different drugs a student could try, psychadelics were my favorite, since they take you to a different dimension far from reality. Once in a while when I would feel very down, I'd go back to my mothers house and spend a few weeks with my brothers and that seem to recover me for the time being.

After doing this for about 9-12 months, having very little emotional or mental idea of some sort of breakdown, that is soon to happen, I just continued. Not long after about a year into, I woke up one morning, just a usual day but I was feeling like something big was missing on the inside, I litterally could feel a massive void inside of me, like my soul/being was missing. Really weird and scary feeling that I again tried to escape, by being ""productive"" to keep my mind off it. Same night, as I am going to bed to lay there, I am left with that feeling inside and if I look into it, I have an instant panic attack, where my brain is telling me that I will die if I continue, so I stop and shake uncontrollably for a few hours, I call myself an ambulance because I'm not sure what is going on, for some reason I get distracted and forget that I had an ambulance coming in so I miss it. Next day it's exactly the same and for the next two weeks my days look completely exact, I feel like I'm running away from someone for the whole day and at night time I shake uncontrollably for hours, sweating and feeling like my heart will stop any minute.

I wanted it to stop.

So I seeked help and found help in books, within the next few weeks I read like 8 books on emotions, depression, fear, mindfullness, budism, stoicism. I was applying all the practises that were being recommended, basically taking non-traditional health path. Within a month I was meditating, journaling and observing myself. During that time I gathered some courage to look at this void of a feeling that I am overwhelmed by. My brain is going crazy as I am taking my attention toward that feeling, I am hearing loud hallucinations, of a siren of some sort, loud alarms ringing in my ears, I am seeing exclamation marks in my mind eye, warning signs and everything else my paranoic brain could come up with and simply decided to laugh at it, which made me trancend it immediately it was almost shut down by my attitude towards it. Yet there was still the feeling in my body, as I sank my attention into it, the feeling was growing and it was taking over my body, I was feeling cold, empty and dead. This feeling was growing and consuming my body, I felt like I'm either going unconcious or dying. Because I was in my bed, I knew that I couldn't die just like that and as the feeling was taking my body into death, I allowed it. I was okay to die there and then, laying in bed. As I accepted my death, the void feeling that was in my body, instanly switched to a feeling of ecstasy, please kind in mind that I was sober for a month now and feeling of ecstasy in your body is not something that you feel every day. As this feeling exploded in my body, I was seeing angels in my mind eye, probably due to christian culture I was raised in, my mind symbolised, love and peace in that imagery.

After this event the feeling of a void was gone, never to be seen again and with it, the paranoia and panic attacks dissapeared from my life. I felt at peace with myself for the next 3 months and then old thought patterns came back, the hateful ones toward myself. When I realised that these thoughts and beliefs about myself were the root of the problem, I started addressing them one by one, every single day for the next year, I went sober for a whole year, no alco nothing. Everything I became aware of a pattern in my mind that I didn't like, I would take a journal, question my assumtions and beliefs, write them out on paper, and make for and against argument on them, review the experience that caused that belief and try to view it from a different perspective, one that isn't as damaging to me. Usually it meant that some people needed to hear something from me and some difficult conversations were held to settle old issues, sometimes it was so easy that I simply got emotional as a kind and assumed the worst and ended up believing it.

Now 3 years later I am mentally in the right place at the right time, I know what is important to me, I live my life by my own rules. I got a girlfriend, a job I like, an apartment, a new car, I eat what I want, I go on vacations several times a year, I been helping a few friends with their mental health for the past few years, recommending books and ideas, in the end it comes down to if we want to solve the problem and it comes from an honset and genuine place inside of us, if we do, we find a way to do it. Sometimes it means confessing something to a stranged or a friend, and them listening to you is really enough to let go on the situation. So my fellow redditors, if any of you feel like you want to talk, dm me and we can talk about it, playing a game or doing whatever.",5,paranoia
"so me and 2 other friends were playing a game, its not a horror game but its an FPS game. there were 4 areas

zombie area 

military area (kill npcs and other players)

ffa arena (free for all, 2 entrances to it)

and the 1V1 arena

so my 2 other friends started apparantly claiming to see a ""figure"" in the FFA arena, my friend describes it as a mixture of me, the other friend we were playing with and another friend i have. in the FFA arena in the center is an ammo box for ammo, and he describes it was there, he blinked and it apparantly ""disappeared"", it continued to happen multiple times until we decided to do stuff in my discord server.

my other friend started to see figures but i dont know if i believe that or not, i only believe that the friend that first saw it (lets just call him michael, and the other friend we were playing with, joj)

so michael saw it first, joj joined not long after we first joined the game.

can someone please explain what is happening since michael is describing himself to be ""traumitized and petrified"".

"I currently have depression, yet I can‚Äôt seem to figure out how it‚Äôs been affecting me.

"My younger brother [22m] has always had a lot of fears. Growing up he would cry every once in a while because he thought about death and how much he fears it. As he started growing up he got very interested in guns and began purchasing them when he turned 18, when we ask him why he goes on a tirade about the government not being trustworthy (which I agree, but not to his extent). He owns 5 guns now and still asks my mother for money on college expenses, these guns amount to more than 10k. 

He started drinking when he turned 21 and it‚Äôs only gotten worse. He accuses his ex girlfriend of cheating on him, despite her leaving him over this behavior, he had no evidence of her ever cheating on him. Yesterday he visited me and when he was leaving his eyes were red from being tired and he thought the valet in my building would call the police on him because they would think he had been drinking, but we had not had a drink all day. The valet is an 18 year old kid who I always tip, he would never do that. 

Then on his trip home he called me again because he was scared of traffic and the cars around him. He also carried his gun all day while we hung out, he has a conceal carry permit which is okay but I live in a very good neighborhood in a gated community so I don‚Äôt know why he felt the need to be armed at my house.

He also has no friends because they always do something that makes him the victim. Either he gets upset when they forget to invite him or he hates being out with them. He also thinks everyone at work hates him and he calls me weekly with fears of getting fired because he got a certain look from someone.

"26M: I think I'm pretty high functioning - I have a well-paying, stable job, good habits (sleep well and work out daily), eat healthy, etc. Yet despite these I feel like I'm never happy. I think one of my biggest problems right now is just a lack of feeling any sort of emotion at all. As an example, before when I would go on vacation to new places, or see family/friends after not seeing them for a long time, I used to get an excited feeling. I used to be genuinely happy/joyous doing these things. But now everything is just so whatever - its like I know how I *should* feel in these situations, but I just *don't*. I don't know if my emotions are suppressed, or just gone, or what. A lot of times after work I come home and lie in bed watching Youtube for hours together until its time to go to sleep. I don't think I have any serious thoughts about suicide, but I can't say it hasn't crossed my mind once or twice (although I don't think I could ever act on it). Additionally when I'm talking with anyone (friends, families, coworkers), I struggle to empathize with them. I remember when I was younger when someone told me something sad, I would feel sad with them. Now I don't feel that anymore. Again, I know how I *should* feel, so I can fake it, but I get the feeling it comes off as inauthentic and fake. And then I get mad at myself for that, which in turn makes me feel upset. I also have bad anxiety and often find myself obsessing over and thinking about inconsequential things, especially in social situations. But contrary to most other people, I don't feel any physical symptoms? (maybe my muscles tightening?), but I don't feel my heart racing or out of breath or any of that. Idk what's going on, but the whole thing has just had me really down for the past couple of years. It's like a switch flipped in my brain and I've just lost all emotion, energy, and enjoyment in life. Can anyone relate?",2,depression

"I would like to firstly say that I am not diagnosed with depression, but I feel like there's something wrong with me. Take this post more as a way for me to vent out my feelings and frustrations. I don't feel the need to hurt myself or anyone around me, so breathe easy.

I'm a 30 year old guy. During all my years up to this point, I have never felt understood. I try to be honest with people when I'm feeling down, but that always results in those people going away. I've always had these moments where, even unprovoked, I just fall into a pit of sadness and can't get out for a varying amount of time, usually from 1 day, up to maybe a week or two. During this time in the past I've tried reaching out to people, but now I just sit and wallow in my sadness.

I'm alone, ever since I moved out at 18 I've always lived alone. I've put my heart on the line and tried to make meaningful connections with some people, but it was never either the right time, or the feelings were unreciprocated. I don't blame the people for not feeling a certain way about me. But what hurts me the most is that because every time I've tried to find that special person who I would want to give my all to, who I want to make happy, it's never mutual. I'm left to feel alone, unwanted and unloved.

I've had partners, who I've been close with, who I've been intimate with, but I've never been in a committed relationship.

I don't think that I deserve anyone to feel a special way about me, I don't think I deserve someone to love me. But I want, at least once, for someone to feel that way about me. I want to feel like I matter to someone. And I know that I matter to the few close friends I have, and to my family. But that's different. People don't care about how a 30 year old man feels. They just don't. I don't care what anyone says, the feelings of a man are always disregarded and thrown away like a used napkin.

The thing is, most of the reasons I suspected he was autistic is other things, for exampel

"Hi everyone!
So i have suffered from anxiety for many years now and i usually fell into anxious thought cycles that i struggled to get out of and these caused sometimes physical symptoms as well (especially i felt a pressure on my throat). The anxiety was much better until few months ago, where i‚Äôve started getting physical symptoms of anxiety (feeling dizzy, feeling like i can‚Äôt get enough air & being hyper aware of my body) randomly and without them being triggered by anxious thoughts (after i get these symptoms i start worrying whether it is normal though). I am struggling to cope with these symptoms and breathing techniques make it somehow all worse‚Ä¶
Any advice to how to manage these symptoms and whether it is normal that they come without anxious thoughts? Thanks!",4,anxiety

"Hi, so for a little context, my bf is suffering from TB (not the contagious kind) and is on bed rest from the past 1.5 months. In the beginning he thought it was just a normal back pain but later, he found out it's TB. So, yes, because of this we haven't met since March end. A week or two ago, he even asked me ""Since we haven't been meeting and idk when we will, have you ever thought during this time that you should move on"" I was like ""no, this thought never even crossed my mind and it never will"" then he said ""okay, this made me happy"".So, at that time it actually wasn't bothering me as much because we were talking a good amount of time over the phone but now from the past week, he has stopped talking also, we talk for like 20-30 minutes max. throughout the day and this is really making me overthink a lot. I asked him last night why has he been so distant lately (He has been throwing up a lot because of his medications, which is making his body feel weak and he does not feel good because of this) So, he said that he hasn't been distant, he's just not in a great place because of his health, and he doesn't feel like doing anything. Then he said bye, I was like why are you saying bye, he said he doesn't feel like talking (he meant, in general).So, him not talking to me is really bothering me because we have only been together for 4 months now, and in my last relationship, my ex stopped talking to me in bits, like my current bf is doing but the difference is my current bf is sick that is why he is doing it, but the trauma i have because of my ex is making me overthink and question my bf. I am sorry for this long story but I am really in a fucked up place right now and idk what to do. Also, i am scared that he will forget me if he don't talk to me as much as we were before, and then he will breakup. And i honestly don't have it in me to go through another heartbreak.TL;DR - Boyfriend of 4 months isn't talking to me due to his ongoing illness which is making me Anxious and overthink a lot.

"I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that my ex husband tried to kill me and I‚Äôm lucky to have gotten away with my life. I have had a lot of anxiety lately, so maybe it‚Äôs just my mind running wild. It‚Äôs hard to tell though because this guy is a pretty sneaky and narcissistic person not to be trusted. 
Some stuff he did- He frequently killed animals. There were some stray cats that hung around our neighbor‚Äôs house that he proudly shot in front of our kids. He even bought my oldest child a gun without telling me and tried to tell her that the cats were her target practice. She was 6-7 years old then. He shot and killed the other neighbor‚Äôs sweet pet dog in front of our kids for no reason other than it had gotten out and roamed into our yard. There are many other things, really a lot of trauma for me to remember. 
On to the ‚ÄúI think he tried to kill me‚Äù: I think this happened when we started having trouble in our relationship. When I started standing up to him. Things were rocky. I was really healthy and took great care of myself at that time of my life. I was in my late 20‚Äôs. I mysteriously got really sick. I lost about 30-40 pounds in two weeks. Everything I ate and drank went right through me. I couldn‚Äôt even keep water in me. I was extremely weak and couldn‚Äôt stand for more than a few minutes. It was pretty scary how sick I was and I was only getting worse. I finally decided I needed to go to the hospital. He refused to take me and he seemed like he didn‚Äôt care that I was sick and was pretty annoyed that I wanted to get help. We had three young children that I stayed home and took care of. I ended up driving myself to the emergency room although I was afraid I might pass out on the 40 minute drive there. My neighbor watched the kids because he wouldn‚Äôt. When I got there they immediately admitted me and isolated me in my own room. They told me that my liver and heart were both in really dangerous condition. They ran a multitude of tests. I ended up staying there for 3 days and my ex husband didn‚Äôt call or visit once. They couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong with me. After the third day I was finally able to eat something and keep it in and began to regain some strength. They never did figure out what was wrong though. I went home he was so indifferent to the fact that I was so sick. I got better. And it was like it never happened. 
I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that he was poisoning me and he was disappointed that I didn‚Äôt die. It‚Äôs exactly the kind of thing he would do and get away with. He would have researched it. Honestly I vaguely recall him possessing some kind of literature on untraceable poisons or something of the sort. He was always researching and reading up on things like that. I just never thought it would be for me. I seriously have no doubt that I‚Äôd be dead by now if I would have stayed with him. But then I wonder if I‚Äôm paranoid. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt die either way!",5,paranoia

"In the past, I felt like I was getting an okay handle on my depression and finding ways to deal with it, but I just don't feel like I can catch a break latetly. I got broken up with by my long term partner that I bought a house with about a year ago. Her life had a lot of issues going on outside of my control and I was not as supportive of a partner as she needed. I have accepted that at this point and am moving on, but a major issue is the house we bought together won't stop having issues and it just so happens to be all at once instead of throughout our close to 1.5 years of ownership. I have handled almost all of it as it comes up, but it seems like as I fix things, something new comes up literally 2-3 days later. On top of that, someone crashed into me a couple months back and just finally claimed the crash on their insurance so I can get my body damage fixed. I was saving and scrounging to cover the crash if it did not work out which is a postive now, but I feel like some of this is just hangs over my head all day as I work my full time job. Outside of all of that, my overall depression and anxiety as well as living with my ex partner has been a lot. It is a very complicated situation so more just airing my grievances and hoping it will all work out, because I just want some room to breathe. It feels like everything closing in on me even if I have so many positives and have the resources to fix the problems. I mean, being a home owner so young is an accomplishment and as far as I know a lot of my house is in excellent quality outside of the one main area we have been having issues. I just never know what my expectations should be anymore.

I used to be on anti depressants. ADHD and anti anxiety meds, but they felt like they ramped me up even more in some of the ways they were supposed to help.

"Hello.. It‚Äôs my first time using this app to ask for advice because I seriously do not know what to do. I‚Äôm a sister (20) who has a little sister (16). My little sister is diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder and was doing therapy session and taking antidepressants. She was doing so well for 2 months after she decided to stop her medication. She stopped it without consulting her therapist. I didn‚Äôt realise this until she started withdrawing heavily from it.
She is currently feeling really sad and having mood swings. The thing that triggers her withdrawal symptoms is her being at school.

These past few weeks, she had a difficulty waking up to go to school and my mother gets mad at this. She wouldn‚Äôt wake up when my mom is trying to wake her up. She would groan and doesn‚Äôt get up. My mom (58) gets pissed because she cares about my sister‚Äôs education and feels like she would fail as a mother if she doesn‚Äôt have her daughter continue school.
My mother is also diagnosed with depression but takes her medication
however, I don‚Äôt think she understands what my sister is going through and can say things that I‚Äôm sure she doesn‚Äôt mean to.

I‚Äôm honestly really scared on what my sister is going to do.

She used to self-harm too but now she is doing it again..
she is also having suicidal thoughts and I‚Äôm worried she might take action.

What can I do to make her feel better but still proceed to going to school 
I know that it‚Äôs best for someone who has depression and having withdrawals to stay at home and heal better
but it is also an issue if she falls behind in her classes 
The school doesn‚Äôt seem to care either about it. I live in the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and mental health is not cared about in high school.
So I genuinely do not know what to do.

The plan so far is that she is booked again to see her therapist but it is next week and idk what i should at the moment.

I have a not a specific question to provide for you to answer. I just would like to know what someone would do if you are going through the same thing as me.",4,anxiety

I know I'm an outlier and maybe its because it's been so long since I've been on it or maybe I'm just not that observant I've never felt that respirodone has that many noticable effects. I know it helps me sleep and it has definitely given me ED but that's it. Not once did the difference psychologists I spoke to tell me why they where uping my dosage or even that 6 is a high dosage. Now after researching it I'm not sure but isn't 6mg like an extremely high dosage? Like I've really struggled to find people telling stories about there experiences who where on 6mg. I feel like I must of said something to the psychologists that concerned them but they didn't tell me what it was. They didn't tell me what part of what I was telling them concerned them and gave me the impression that things didn't seem to bad with me.

"39/F. ADHD combined and Fibromyalgia. 

I lost my previous job (story of my life) and landed a new one and I was supposed to start today.

Last night my little girl (7) was really sick and I was awake with her until 4 am, I was very close to heading to the hospital with her because her fever/pain/elevated heart rate was so bad.

Instead I did what I could, giving her pain relief/monitoring her/holding her for hours until she calmed down/fell asleep.

Needless to say when the alarm went off at 7am his morning I was a total wreck and my Fibromyalgia has flared up so badly my body is in aching from head to toe.

I messaged my new boss and he was cool with me starting tomorrow instead. Literally so cool about it. 

But.. Can someone please tell me why I feel so guilty about missing one day of work, all I did my was my job as a mother and looked after my sick child?

I honestly feel sick with stress to the point of panic and nausea because I feel like I ""let everybody down""

There are two other people in the house, and they're fine, of course. That, and we have dogs who are all fine and acting normally. I guess I'm just so used to working myself up.

Anyway I have been off work since then and am due to have a sickness meeting with my manager and HR  to see how they can ‚Äòsupport me back to work‚Äô. My work place has an Occupational Health department who have been very supportive and helpful and have been liaising with my manager instead of me having to do it. 

My manager is new, and from conversations before I have come to realise he doesn‚Äôt know what we go through with anxiety and depression, you don‚Äôt really know unless you suffer yourself or are a trained profesional. 

So about going back to work, I am worried that I am going to go back whilst in a good phase then drop back to rock bottom and my manager think I am trying to pull something. I often have a good couple of weeks then drop to rock bottom and it takes me a month or so to come out of it and that happens in cycles. 

How do I get my manager and HR to understand this and to understand that just because on was on top of the world one day doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll be like that the day after? 

I am scared of going back to work and this happening and then being penalised for something I can‚Äôt control.

"  
Crippling indecision. Depressed people can be consumed by an overwhelming inability to make decisions. Everything is questioned right down to the granular level. This constant self-questioning and evaluating leaves the person paralysed and unable to function. For instance the depressed person might make a decision to take a shower. What follows next is a tsunami of questions ‚Äúshould I wait to later‚Äù ‚Äúwhat if I don‚Äôt have the energy‚Äù ‚Äúwhy do I need a shower anyhow I am not going anywhere?‚Äù This can literally play out for hours and hours until the sufferer finally says something along the lines of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù Needless to say this self-doubting will be followed by recrimination and more than likely self-hatred for being so weak, which in turn feeds the depression, an almost perfect vicious circle.  
Critical self-judgment. Depressed people don‚Äôt really see themselves as ill. They rarely give themselves that good a break. Instead they can very easily view their depression as a personal weakness they could overcome if they just tried hard enough. This train of thought is perpetuated by other people telling them to just snap out of it, or a thousand other platitudes they have heard a million times before. Instead of seeing this nonsense for what it really is they turn it internally and berate themselves for having a character flaw that doesn‚Äôt allow them to function like normal people. They don‚Äôt need other people to be judgmental as they are expert at doing it to themselves a thousand times worse.  
Interaction is painful. It‚Äôs something most people take for granted. Interaction, conversing and relating are things we mostly don‚Äôt have to think about. For someone suffering depression this natural ability can become excruciatingly difficult. In most instances we pull on a socially acceptable mask and pretend everything is fine. We are present but not really there if you know what I mean? We can be surrounded by people and feel painfully alone lost in the quicksand of depression. We are experts at hearing but not really listening. We are ninja warriors at the art of avoiding talking about how we are feeling. Everything is great and fine when in reality we are dying inside. While you are talking about how your day went we can be reliving the worst moments of ours and at the same time making sure you don‚Äôt see our pain.  
Fear of the future. Ask a depressed person what they think their future looks like and they will more than likely tell you ‚Äúmore of the same or worse‚Äù Depending on the severity of the depression a sufferer doesn‚Äôt see a future. A future is something other people have not them. Their future is the struggle they are going to have tomorrow morning when they wake up and think to themselves ‚Äúplease, not this again, I don‚Äôt think I can go on like this‚Äù We think about the future by comparing it to our past. It‚Äôs very difficult to imagine a nice future when all the evidence from the past is telling you it isn‚Äôt going to happen. For the vast majority of people a future is something they can feel optimistic about. For a depressed person it can feel like something to dread. Something filled with hopelessness and helplessness. Not living in the present is extremely common; it can feel like we are adrift in an ocean of misery and torment stuck in a no man‚Äôs land of despair and apathy. Once hope is lost, everything is lost.  
Even the good times can be bad. Imagine not even being happy at the birth of your child or in fact any landmark occasion that marks a supposedly joyous event in our lives. A chronically depressed person doesn‚Äôt have to imagine it. For millions of people this is a reality and is something that is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. Guilt and shame which feed the depression are experienced in equal measure. They know on a rational logical level they should be happy, unfortunately they have lost the ability. Their happiness has been replaced by numbness and indifference which they have seemingly no control over. I well remember when I was going through my own depression someone asking me what I would do if I won a million pounds. Without even having to think I said I would probably give it away as no amount of money could ever make me happy again. These are the depths a depressed mind can sink to.  
Observing not participating. There is a song from the movie midnight cowboy sung by Harry Nilsson that I think sums up depression beautifully. Here it is. ‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs talking at me, I don‚Äôt hear a word they‚Äôre saying only the echoes of my mind‚Äù. Severe depression is probably like having an out of body experience. You can see and hear everything happening around you but you are not part of it. It can feel very lonely and isolating to realise that you are a spectator to your own life. Your heart aches to be part of something that will make you feel like a human being again but your depressed mind is constantly telling you that this is for other people to experience, not you. Just like the song you literally do hear what everybody is saying but you are lost in mire of the echoes of your own mind. It can feel like you are living a life where the pause button is permanently pressed. A state of non-existing if you like.  
Dysfunctional relating and relationships. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the rate of breakups and divorces amongst people suffering depression is quite high. Relating to another human being requires motivation that is sadly lacking as they struggle with their illness. Maintaining relationships requires effort and energy both of which have been sucked out of them. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs because they have lost the ability to care and they feel powerless to do anything about it. When you don‚Äôt care if you live or die yourself it can be very difficult to care for someone else. They are trapped inside the prison of their own mind desperately hoping for someone or something to set them free. For a depressed person isolating themselves can be preferable to relating even though they absolutely know this is doing them real harm. A depressed mind doesn‚Äôt think rationally it will push away the very thing that could help them. It can see relationships as having very little consequence, even though the opposite is true, such is the contradictory nature of depression.  
Lack of autonomy. The most important thing to every human being on the planet is having a sense of autonomy or control over their lives. When depression comes into a person‚Äôs life that sense of control is taken away. Choices start to become very limited and the person‚Äôs world can become microscopic. In an effort to fill that emotional void many people turn to food, alcohol, drugs, shopping anything in fact that alleviates, however temporarily, the crushing feeling of being out of control of their own destiny. These strategies can of course bring about bigger problems to add to the depression. A sense of meaning or purpose to their lives is missing and in its place is a gaping hole. This can set some people off on a journey to find that missing piece in the vain hope that it will complete them. They never find that thing that will make them whole again because it doesn‚Äôt exist. It is a depression generated wild goose chase that can easily turn into an obsession. Depression holds out the promise that if you could just find that thing outside yourself everything would return to normal and the depression would vanish. Unfortunately as many people have found to their cost, including myself, it‚Äôs simply not true. The answer lies internally not externally.  
There are a countless different ways that people can experience depression. There are however quite a few commonalities between the different types. If any of the above resonated with you it‚Äôs time to seek professional help. These types of symptoms won‚Äôt be exercised away, prayed away, snapped out of or ignored. If left unaddressed they have the ability to devastate your life for a very long period of time.

Hey, well this is something that I haven't told to my therapist and I don't know if, as I said in the title, it counts as abuse so I just want opinions, is okay if it isn't, in just genuinely curious if it has something to do with my depression or anything 

So, when I was really little I used to eat very slowly so I had to stay in the table for a long time, until I finished my food, and while I was staring at my food or eating or just seating there my dad (his desk was in front of the dining table) watched like erotic videos; it could be girls dancing sensually or, I think, even straight up porn. I think he touched himself sometime but I can't be sure bc my memory is really bad, and even if he did it wasn't like recurrent or anything. 

I remember one time I was fake sleeping at my grandma's house, I was face down with one of legs up ( I'm sorry I don't know how to explain ) so my ass was like flexxed ig idrk and he entered the room and said like 'damn'. I also remember one time I had a sexual dream with him and I felt really guilty after but not disgusted.

Also I've watched porn and known about sex since I was really small, fantasizing about having relationships and everything. When I was growing up (rn I'm 16) I've watched and listened my parents having sex without them knowing.

Well I don't know what else to say but please comment what you think :))",2,depression

"So I went to this treatment center over the summer, and it basically made my paranoia extremely bad. I felt like taking my own life just to get out of the situation. I thought the phycologist there was going to harm me, the staff members were out to harm me, etc. They didn't even do anything about it. They just told me I was being irrational. That was it. No meds, no nothing. I can't even interact with people because of it, or one of the main reasons, I should say. I feel like I have to act like I'm okay so my parents won't worry about me. I just want to be a normal kid, like the kids at school. Not having to worry if people in your life are lying to you and backstabbing behind your back must be a gift. feeling like no one is trying to kill you at night must feel great.

Hi I'm an 18 year  old Indian guy  First of all if you are reading this and even if you don't respond I thank you as you might be going through an even greater pain compared to me. I'm about to finish high school and it is truly a crucial point in my life as My further education and my career relies upon this year's academic performance the exams were   to be held in two semesters I fucked up the first one even though I believe I gave it my all and there's extremely fragile hope that I could go  for thee second semester considering the pandemic as the as it is to be conducted through online platform and the scores would be just taken primarily from the first semester as it was offline the thing is I cannot concentrate on my studies as my whole family has got covid though I moved out of town for education my mom and sisters were with me and we were safe  my mom had to move back as my whole family has got covid except me and my sister I havee noticed hairfall a couple of months ago and I got really paranoiad about it I even visited a derm and they prescribed mintop some vitamins and another lotion  but my parents wouldn't let me take it as they are a bit misinformed i know that topical min does nat have any side effects two my cousins have almost lost their hairs i have been post ing in every sub related to hair loss but I realized it's  not going  worsen it i cant even keep track of my hairall everyime theres a little sensation on my head or my face or head it gives  me the impression that  I'm losing great amout of hair and i cant even see my hair they are naturally thin and are probably thinning out more now a part of me is ready to embrace baldness but somewhere Im scared that its happening so fast. I have always been an envious individual im insecure and jealous of others my father is a very hardworking guy I regret neverr being able to help  him in the store mom and dad never aspired anything from me they kept it to themselves i believe they don't want to put pressure on me  and so does the  rest of my family they have satisfied my requirements in materialistic manners  but I feel like my father didn't understand me emotionally he wouldn't let me do what my peers did at different stages of their life which sometimes makes me feel very upset I cried myself to sleep because I felt lonely but the fact that makes me feel even more disgusted and sucidal towards myself is that at hard times like these where the health of my loved ones is at risk I could only think about my self and this stupid hair loss I have no sense of my duties im just worthless trash,5,paranoia

"So, earlier today I decided to go for a little walk in the local park with my camera. I just bought Photoshop software today, and I wanted some pictures to play around with.

I had my camera in a strap hanging around my neck, and a macro lense in my jacket pocket. As I approached the entrance to the park (this little windy path through some trees) a couple came up from the path to the park, a man and a woman. I cast a glance at them, but I was busy changing the lense on my camera as I walked by them. 

I got maybe 20-25 steps down the path when I heard a sound that caused me to look over my shoulder, and there was the same guy (no girl). I thought ""that's weird, I wonder if he wants to talk to me."" He did, as it turns out. He called out ""Hey!"" I turn around and face him. He then asks ""Are you taking pictures with that camera?"" Up until he asked this, I was thinking the most likely thing he wanted was either directions or perhaps some loose change (these are the things I've been approached by strangers for the most in my life). I was puzzled by his question, so I just answered ""Yes. That's generally what one uses a camera for."" He was wearing a mask, but apparently was not worried about social distancing, because he came right up close and personal and then asked ""Are you taking pictures of me?"" Again puzzled by his question I simply told the truth. ""No."" I said. Then he asked ""Are you sure?"" And finally I understood what was going on. This guy was paranoid about being photographed. I told him ""Yeah, I'm sure. I take pictures of birds and trees and stuff like that."" He then just stood there for a good 5-10 seconds looking me straight in the eye. Then he said ""Good. I wouldn't recommend you do that (photograph him) either."" And then he turned and walked away again. As he was walking I just said ""Alright, sure, nothing to worry about there."" 

I was a bit exhausted in my mind, so I didn't come up with any snarky remarks on the spot, but I thought about a few during the rest of my walk. Something along the lines of ""Don't worry, you are not pretty enough to be in my scrapbook anyway."" Probably for the best anyway. I'm sure such a remark would have just set him off. He seemed the type that possibly was very insecure about his manhood, and would possibly compensate by beating witty strangers down.

Anyway, I had a good few laughs thinking about the absurdity of the situation during the day. How paranoid must you be, to think some random stranger is photographing you in secret? I don't know whether he was high, selling drugs or possibly both, but what the hell? üòÜ",5,paranoia

"Hi. I've recently been through an extensive process of trying to get an ADHD diagnosis. I have it, I know I have it. My sister has a diagnosis of it from when she was a child and my symptoms are so much worse than hers, I've researched back and forth for literal years and it's the only conclusion that makes sense. I figured I needed meds, so I pursued a diagnosis. 

I went through like a whole system of questionnaires aiming to figure out once and for all whether I have ADHD or not. At the end of it all (months of work) my psychologist said I don't qualify. I have plenty of symptoms, especially of inattentive ADHD, but not enough hyperactivity to count, so they can't prescribe me any meds. The condition has such a strict definition in my country and meds are so tightly controlled that I just can't get them. I can't even try them out just to see if I'll get better. 

At first I was pretty frustrated and disappointed, but after about a week, I figured I could at least pursue non-stimulant meds. Surely they'll be less strictly controlled. So I researched and immediately found out all of them require an ADHD diagnosis. Every single one. 

Now I'm just disappointed. Am I supposed to just pull myself up by the proverbial bootstraps and deal with it? Live the rest of my life with cobbled together planners and calendars trying desperately to fit into the world? Is there any other way? I just don't know what to do.",3,adhd

"Hi, I'm(21yo) currently very desperate. The desperation just exploded with my bachelor thesis. Even though I almost have it (only a few details are missing and a few sentences from my conclusion) my consultant is away(work trip) till the due date and 99% can't check it and approve it. Right now I am trying to finish it in tears...

Anyway, I have gf (19yo) for almost 2 years, she is a very good student finishing grammar school, and we decided a long time ago to send applications to really good universities in Denmark and possibly build our future there. But since I might not defend my bc thesis and finish my current university I can not go there. I will extremely piss off my parents and also my gf.

My current university became very stressful for me after the coronavirus lockdown (I had 3 semesters online from my bedroom) I couldn't find many friends. Recently I started crying regularly on my drives back home from the uni. The economics and business mngmt programme I study is kinda interesting to me but for my entire life, I haven't found an area or someone/something I want to become. In Denmark, I chose UI/UX and content creation since I have been goofing in cracked Adobe Photoshop and Premiere throughout my life. And for the past 1.5 years, I have been actively coding html css and did a little online product catalogs for a little company from: styling the products -> photographing -> editing -> putting them online. So I guess this should be my point of interest. 

And here comes my recent indecisiveness. I have trouble getting up in the mornings, I lack motivation. I can't plan my routine. I am acting very lost and frightened in public. I feel extreme pressure to finish my current uni, go to Denmark, accommodate in Denmark, and live there. It's not only this, my gf is not pushing me into anything, she is actually very nice and supportive. But the most pressure I feel is that I disappoint all the people who know me because I become in their eyes the guy who achieved nothing, prolonged his studies, or didn't even finish them...
Sometimes I wonder why she is still with me when I can't come up with nice dates and we only spend time at my place watching movies alone.

I can't get anything done. I start but never finish any work or assignments. My head is constantly spinning between I'm a failure and suddenly it wonders to how many things I could do, that I should go run every morning, study 4 hours a day, write every single line from my lectures, start a business... And I'm the failure cause stopped attending the lectures, procrastinated at the end of the semester, and wrote the thesis very late. But I couldn't persuade myself to do it. Now I don't even know what I want from my life, I'm not sure of anything... This is the indecisiveness I mentioned before.

And now I am a wreck sitting in my room as I do most of the time nowadays. I look out to all the successful former classmates from grammar school or friends building their careers and compare to them. The worst thing is that it shows that I do nothing. My parents see me in my room lying in bed, playing guitar, etc  -> simply procrastinsting and not studying. But I really can't focus on the studies. And I see that the time has been wasted which now eats me inside out on top the my current mood.

I also started thinking about what it would be like to kill yourself. Cause I want the burning pressure to stop when it gets serious sometimes. I remembered, a few years ago having a mental health lecture at grammar school and they asked if we have suicidal thoughts and that it is a bad thing and a lot of people might have them. I thought to myself, that I must be very lucky to have never actually thought about it. But here I am with the thought somewhere deep back inside my mind.

I've never met anyone like him and genuinely saw myself being with him for the longterm. The only issue we really had is that he would get very, very low because of depression. He had no energy, sometimes for weeks on end, had consistent feelings of emptiness and numbness, and overall would be very hopeless about life in general. He has said a few times that though he isn't necessarily suicidal, that he wishes he had never been born. He will sometimes withdraw from reality and just lay around. I would sometimes get mildly upset about this, especially in the beginning, bc I thought it was bc of me. But then he explained he has dealt with this his whole life and if anything our relationship is actually helping him feel better. I overall have been very supportive and understanding since he explained things to me. 

Some back story that I think is important: he was married before. He was with his ex wife for nearly a decade all together, 3 of those years married. He packed up his life and moved a few states away to support her career and paid all the bills while she was going to school. He said after the marriage, she completely flipped on him. She became very insecure, controlling, always accusing him of cheating (I can tell you now he is the type that would never cheat) and even tried to cut him off from his family. She was always telling him his teaching job wasn't good enough and he needed to make more money. He wasn't allowed to have friends or do anything without her present. Well one day he flew back home to visit family while they were going through a rough patch. She called him and over the phone told him she was divorcing him, not to come back to the house other than to gather his things, and then cut off all contact. He is such a sensitive person and i cant even imagine how painful this was for him. He is pretty certain she was cheating with a wealthy guy she married about a year after they split. Bc his teaching contract wasnt completed, he still had to go back, get a crappy apartment, and wait out the school year in a state where he knew noone and had no support.

I am the first relationship he has had since this. We started dating about 2 years after they split. He said he's dated a couple other people since, but I'm the first person that made him want to try a relationship again. Over time, he's made comments like ""I feel like you're going to meet someone else with more money and realize you don't want me"" and ""you're going to realize one day I'm not as great as you think and leave"" and ""I am going to disappoint you like I do everyone else."" I always assured him that those are intrusive thoughts and totally untrue. I adore him and want to work on any obstacles we encounter in life as a team.

Well Saturday evening, I was pms'ing and got emotional asking why he doesn't talk about the future much with me and was worried he wouldn't be able to emotionally move on with me. While I know he loves me, he does sometimes have issues being vulnerable and letting himself be emotionally deep bc of what happened to him and bc of his depression. I told him I wanted to go home for a little bit for some space and about and hour later I called him. His voice sounded different than I've ever heard. He went from sounding like my sweet boyfriend to this cold, stern person I've never heard before. Its like he snapped. He said he could not be in a relationship anymore bc he is bringing me down and he is so empty and numb that he can't even take care of himself, much less me. He said he can tell I'm down bc of him and he loves me too much to keep disappointing me. I told him to come over and he did. I thought once we talked face to face that everything would be ok. It wasn't. He was firm in his decision and left me there crying after an hour of talking. He kept saying he isn't right for me and that I am amazing and will find someone not screwed up that can give me everything I deserve. When I asked why he sounded so different, he stated he had ""shut down"" as a defense mechanism and that it was the same thing he did in his marriage when things got bad and that his ex couldn't take it.

The only contact we have had since was me calling him the next day asking about things. He still sounded so cold and said it was for the best that we breakup. I am devastated. I never thought in a million years this would happen. We never even fight. No relationship is perfect and when you love someone you help them through things, and that is what I want to do for him but he won't let me. 

He is an amazing, selfless human and I would never leave him like she did. I love and appreciate everything about him. 

Have any of you ever been through this?
Does anyone have advice on how I can navigate this? I am really struggling right now. And comments or perspective would be appreciated. I am trying so hard to make sense of it all. 

TLDR: My amazing relationship with my boyfriend ended bc of his depression and past relationship trauma. I am devastated and don't know if he will come back.",2,depression

"Usually posting somewhere makes this issue worse. But I want someone to know what I'm going through because its weird and I don't know if this is severe paranoia or delusion at times. There is a woman in my brain, whether it be a separate entity or not. Whether she actually exists I dont know. I have severe OCD with constant compulsions. I cant enjoy anything without compulsions and Ive set up a while system. Were both in charge of my brain and when I do my compulsions I touch something three times. First time I say yes in my brain, second time is no, third is I don't know. Its always no because its usually something like ""do this or you will be punished, do this or someone you know will die, do this or whatever idk its a bunch of horrible shit."" I have argued with her and basically just had breakdowns saying ""STFU THIS ISNT REAL"" I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT. But every time I do this or ignore my compulsions something bad happens. IDK. EVERY TIME. I feel like this is genuinely real. I don't actually hear her bc I don't hallucinate. Either something bad happens (I don't want to say bc it triggers me to actually type it out) Or I feel like I'm outside my body (depersonalization, de realization) or I just feel high or like nothing is real. I feel like she is going to banish me into another dimension or Ill never see anyone I love again if I continue this. I don't know if I fully believe this , but sometimes I don't have the capability to think irrationally and sometimes I do think it is. It is ruining my fucking life and I want to end things. I mean the feeling high or outside my body could be anxiety but sometimes it happens when Im not even anxious. I keep seeing signs that this is real like after I argue with her or ignore a compulsion I see the word die or burn or i see fire or something in a youtube thumbnail or whatever. Ill hear sounds like banging immediately after I ignore it. Immediately. Almost every single time. Sometimes I have been like ""if I see the color red three times in a row its real"" And i have done it over and over again and its red. There are so many other examples. I dont know what to do. I feel like something bad is going to happen to me. I cant do online therapy bc its not fucking free or go in to in person therapy bc I have no money.

I literally have made up a whole system for this. I have to write S for sorry when I argue with her on a flat surface or say intrusive thought out loud whenever I have one so she doesnt punish me. She is a irrational person and I have to be the rational one so sometimes she could punish me without me even doing anything bad. Ive literally made this all up and never saw or or hear her but Im convinced its real sometimes? I dont know if its bordering onto delusion or not but this is ruining my life. Even making this post I feel like something bad is going to happen. ",5,paranoia

"Hi my name is lupe and I‚Äôm 18 from southern California (sorry about getting so much into detail) but i have a brother who is turning 31 on June and for about 3 years since 2020 in my eyes he wasn‚Äôt himself anymore.

For about 3 in a half so maybe years my brother has been dealing with paranoia, delusions, and thats really about it, and i have been telling myself this doesn‚Äôt look like schizophrenia maybe delusional disorder, bi-polar, something of that nature but basically he believes he‚Äôs being watched from every single device from my game console to his phone camera, the cable box, he believes he‚Äôs being watched when he gos out to do something, he also believes celebrities, the government and other different agencies are in on it, he names different celebrities to me who are watching him, he believes he‚Äôs the most influential person, he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bigger than social media‚Äù he believes different celebrities want to be intimate with him, it goes on and on.

The thing is that he doesn‚Äôt deal with hallucinations (auditory or seeing things), he doesn‚Äôt have disorganized speech, he doesn‚Äôt have psychotic tendencies unless it involves the delusion, like hell get mad if i don‚Äôt agree with what he tells me about these specific delusions, in his case all of these beliefs are reality.

Its been hard dealing with this for 3 years especially since i live with him, i feel like i don‚Äôt know him anymore at some times, he was completely normal until boom he snapped in 2020, and now he‚Äôs just this now. Theres so much more detail that i can get into but its a lot to explain but i hope some of you people get the gist and have insight.

Me and my sister don‚Äôt have any mental health disorders, well i have ADHD and anxiety but i feel like thats common i was diagnosed when i was in elementary. But other than that my uncle does have severe trauma from jail which may have caused him to have a mental health disorder but my biological mom had 3 kids with 3 different dads so i have a different dad my brother has one and so, my grandmother says we don‚Äôt have schizophrenia in our genes as well, somethings i get scared ill end up like that, but at the end of the day i wanna live my life.

So i wanna conclude this on i hope you guys can give some insight on this, i also want to include that my brother has been through severe trauma like being ran over by a car at a very young age, doing narcotic drugs frequently like Xanax,Percocet‚Äôs, lean, pretty much ODing on them, also he got a yeast infection due to having intercourse with another girl, he also start smoking since high school until now but he stopped once he started to get like this due to panic attacks.

"so my entire life i‚Äôve always had anxiety about feeling like i‚Äôm always being watched/stalked, and sometimes those feelings will also be telling me that whoever is ‚Äúwatching me‚Äù is going to try to hurt/kill me, but i‚Äôve never really thought it was a big enough deal to really tell anyone. lately though things have really escalated, those feelings telling me that i‚Äôm being stalked have become much more intense, to the point where i‚Äôm only getting around 3-4 hours of sleep every night because the feelings are too intense to let me sleep. it‚Äôs not only the feeling of thinking i‚Äôm being stalked though, because around a week ago when those feelings started ramping up i started having new feelings too, ones that were telling me that people around me were going to poison my food, and that my family/friends were planning on hurting/murdering me. most of the time when this is happening the feelings will tell me that i have to leave the room or even building i‚Äôm in because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot safe‚Äù or something. these feelings have been making it incredibly hard to function and just do basic every day things, so i just needed to ask, what qualifies as paranoia? does anyone think i have it? i just need some opinions.

"(TW: brief mention of H/tler)

(Warning that I swear a lot here. Usage of ""haha"", ""lol"", or ""lmao"" don't mean I find the situation funny. I just use humor to cope. And disclaimer: I don't care if you disagree with my political opinions. That's not what this post is about. This is about my friend being a shithead. I mention politics purely for background info.)

(And this is hella long.)

I've made a post about this person before, but I'm talking about a very close friend, like sibling close, who I've known for almost six years.

And she's super ableist. In a particularly obnoxious, irritating way.

I could ignore it at first, where it was annoying but not blatant. Usual stuff, like throwing around ""autistic"" and the r-slur as regular insults. Laughing whenever she saw the word autism like a fucking five-year-old or something. Clear lack of education stuff, which is annoying but not harmful.

It's just gotten worse, though. To be clear, she's conservative. For me, that isn't an automatic friendship-ender (though it depends on some specific opinions), but she's only gotten more extreme (she's a borderline Hitler apologist now, gotta love that /s).

We are basically complete opposites politically, so she rarely talks to me about politics, immediately shutting down any discussion when it starts heading in the direction. I realized she was doing this, so I told her that I didn't care what her opinions were (since she made it clear that she hates being belittled for said opinions). This isn't entirely true, but I wanted to be able to have open conversations with her. Didn't see why they needed to get heated. I was mistaken, of course.

Anyway, this eventually led to us having, obviously, a heated discussion. I didn't instigate it; she just started airing some of her opinions out, and I just responded. She does this with one of my other friends, who doesn't interact with her at all, so the discussions never advance from simple one-sided rants. In retrospect, this is what I should've done. I made the mistake of engaging.

She was driving and started the conversation about abortion. She's pro-life. I'm pro-choice. Again, complete opposites. We were throwing pretty stereotypical internet talking points out at each other until I eventually started asking her when, if at all, she would be open to getting an abortion.

And this is deadass what she told me. The only scenarios where she would get one or be okay with others getting one:

1. Significant evidence of a poor financial situation.
2. R@pe.

And here's the real banger:

3. If the child is mentally disabled.

So of course I ask her to back up on this point. For reference, she's always confused Down syndrome with autism and uses them interchangeably even though I've told her multiple times that they're completely different disorders. She basically says that, if the child was diagnosed with autism and/or Down syndrome prior to birth, she would abort it because she ""doesn't want it to suffer"".

I told her that the child suffering wasn't a given, and that she wouldn't know whether the child would be incapacitated pre-birth. I said that she prob knows autistic people without having any idea, because a lot of them are able to blend in with society (i.e., mask or not have stereotypical autism traits ‚Äì which would apply to me, esp in this situation). Then she dropped this incredibly shitty line:

>Well, people with autism can't communicate **like normal people like you and me**.

This left me completely speechless. I was able to keep myself calm (since I wanted this to be a level-headed discussion, and she was driving, so yelling at her could be a bad idea), but this fucked me up. I've never told her I was autistic. *This* is why. She's so fucking uneducated and careless that I was able to fly as a somewhat quirky allistic under her eyes, while she spews shit like this about other autistic people. Like seriously, what the actual fuck. I may be overthinking this, but doesn't the whole idea of aborting a mentally disabled fetus sort of reek of eugenics thinking? Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the idea of being completely prepared to raise a child, then aborting when you discover it's autistic or has Down syndrome seems completely fucked-up to me. Just because you ""don't want it to suffer""?

Like *wow*, what a kind-hearted martyr we have here. Saving this poor, defenseless autistic child from the world instead of trying to improve the world for the child. That makes sense to me. That's convenient! /s

I almost can't handle it anymore. I'm trying not to make a big deal out of it, but it's just becoming dehumanizing to hear this kind of rhetoric from her (or anyone, for that matter; this coming from someone I considered a friend just makes it that much worse). I have made multiple attempts to try to educate her about what autism really is, but she refuses to improve or even try to understand, seeming content in living in her own bubble. And that's acceptable, because her opinions are accepted in certain communities. And that shit is insanely frustrating.

We're probably growing apart as friends. But that idea doesn't scare me anymore. I feel disappointed. I wish it didn't turn out like this, and that people were more open and accepting in general. One of the most infuriating things about this friend is that she is in full belief that she's an incredibly open-minded and nice person and can't fathom why anyone would be uncomfortable around her. Like seriously, dude, some self-awareness would be spectacular. Get off fucking Instagram reels and Fox News and self-reflect for once, man.

(For the record, I have friends that are not like this who I've told I'm autistic. And they were completely normal about it because they're not fucking obstinate.)

TL;DR: Realizing my long-time friend is a completely ignorant idiot.",1,autism
"When I have a negative thought, I will sometimes involuntarily blurt out a word or a grunt or a sigh. I see the shock in people‚Äôs faces. It‚Äôs very embarrassing. It‚Äôs hard and even impossible to recover from it socially. It gets worse. I will also dissociate, seemingly black out for a few seconds, having no idea what I said; the blacking out happens once every couple of years or so. But it just happened again. 

I was recently with some new people in a social situation, and we were hitting it off great. Then at the end of the party, I seemed to a have ruined it. I was leaving the party and getting my things. There was a struggle to get my things together. I was exhausted. I remember struggling with my things but I don‚Äôt remember saying anything. Then someone asked me if I was ok. Everyone got quiet like the mood was killed. It‚Äôs a terrible feeling. I know I said something, but I don‚Äôt know what. I just left the party. 

I‚Äôve been through therapy and I‚Äôve done EMDR in the past. But I can‚Äôt seem to shake this issue. It‚Äôs really making me sad today. I just called a therapist who specializes in anxiety. It‚Äôs time to go back.

I do not take any anti-anxiety or anti-depression medication. Maybe it‚Äôs time to look into those again. It‚Äôs been over fifteen years since I was on medication for depression. 

I‚Äôve been through some tough stuff that I won‚Äôt get into here. I guess it‚Äôs taken its toll. I hope help is around the corner. I feel pretty beat up right now. It scares me that I haven‚Äôt been able to stop this. It‚Äôs a helpless feeling.",4,anxiety

So I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with anything like besides ptsd anxiety and autism so I don‚Äôt know exactly what I have that causes my paranoia or what subreddit to put this in but like 2 years ago it was so bad to where I could barely leave the house or even sometimes go online. Now I can regularly go to school and I function mostly good during the day but at night especially around 10pm it starts being triggered again. Does the night make anyone else‚Äôs paranoia really bad? I used to stay up late like until 2am on the weekends but now I have to lay in bed and sleep before 11pm or even 10:30pm or my anxiety will get so horrible I Will harm myself to calm down. It is now 12:20am and I am regretting not going to sleep. I start believing that people are out to get me and that I need to delete all evidence of my existence online and stuff like that.,5,paranoia

"It‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day and I was told to arrive at my parents‚Äô place at 11am for a casual brunch. 5 ppl. For various reasons, I didn‚Äôt get there until 11.50am.

Once I realised I was going to be late, I was really stressed and anxious and trying to get there as quick as I could.

I sent some messages to my family to say I was running late, apologised, and said that they should start eating.

When I arrived I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry Mum‚Äù and tried to go up to her and say Happy Mother‚Äôs Day and give her a hug, but she wouldn‚Äôt look at me and wouldn‚Äôt let me touch her.

" I don't know what happened to me. As a teenager, I was wild.. I started doing meth when I was 13 and was on and off til I was 17. I'm sure that has taken a huge role on my mental health now. But I was soooo care free. I used to hitch hike all around North America. Meet new people, sleep with strangers. (Not just sexually, but actually sleep with them in many different situations.) Then when I was 21, I started doing heroin, which then lead to fentanyl. That's truly what ruined my life. I had always been a functional alcoholic/drug addict until I did opiates. I went through a lot of pretty traumatic shit thanks to my fentanyl addiction. My husband and I lived with a severely psychopathic and abusive dealer for a long time. We watched people dying in front of us. We were also homeless for a long time and dealing with the gangs and being robbed and stabbings and stuff was obviously difficult. But it never truly phased me. Maybe because all I was thinking about was dope, idk. My husband went into the hospital for a week and I was on the streets by myself. That was the worst part, shit got really bad when I was alone. There's a lot of things I don't talk about, and definitely will never tell my husband because I don't need him to feel guilty because he couldn't protect me or whatever while he was literally on his death bed. Anyway, we got clean like over 3 years ago. I don't know what the fuck happened to me because ever since we got clean, I've been going through phases of extreme paranoia. No, it's not like day 6 of a meth binge where I think the shadow people are stalking me. I'm scared of real life shit and it's becoming crippling. I feel like every person alive is out to get me. Unless I know them well. I'm convinced that most people are violent and sociopathic and sadistic. The paranoia I feel in public is overwhelming but here's the stupid part - 

I did something I never should have done. See, I've always had this irrational fear of war, bombs, jihadists, religious extremists of any sort, neo nazis, acts of terrorism. Sometimes I'd play into that fear by watching war movies or documentaries that give me pretty severe anxiety and typically lead to nightmares. I don't know why I do it. I just wanted to feel afraid, but it was never as bad as it is now. Anyway, a few months ago, my 15 year old brother in law asked me if I'd ever heard of ""run the gauntlet. "" I said no, and he showed me one of the videos from it. It was a video of a man being beheaded, I think by some cartel members. About halfway through, I vomited and I was really upset. I don't know why the fuck I did this, but after that, I started seeking out gore websites. I'd specifically look up videos of murder or violence in general. Not because I enjoyed it, but because it was making me sick with anxiety and for some reason, I've always done this shit to myself. It's why I used to watch war movies. I would literally watch these videos of people being murdered and I've sobbed, hyperventilated, thrown up, and then continued watching. I realize how fucked up this all sounds. Well, I've stepped away from the gore videos because it was all just too much. But now my paranoia is at an all time high. I'm scared. All day, every day. I was shoveling snow at work yesterday, and every single car that drove past, I'd run and hide behind my car because I'm scared they'll drive by and shoot me. Or see me and get out and try to hurt me. Every time I go to get in my car, I get sick with fear that someone is in the backseat waiting for me. I try to take my dogs for walks and when I walk past other people, I specifically move far away when we pass each other in case they try to stab me. I don't go to any ATM's anymore, I have to have my husband do it, because I'm scared someone will be waiting for me to pull my cash out so they can rob me. When I'm in stores or restaurants, I start to freak out because I assume someone in there is going to pull a gun and shoot the place up. I wasn't going to admit this, but I literally am considering getting a helmet to start wearing in case someone shoots at me, I want my head to be as protected as possible. Needless to say, my time in public is extremely limited. I hardly go anywhere unless it's work. Which has become torture because I'm alone for most of my shift. I pretty much stay home now because leaving my house is a fucking massive challenge. I feel defeated. I'm so fucking over-stimulated because of all the anxiety and paranoia. I wish I never discovered those videos. I feel like they literally traumatized me, which sounds ridiculous, like.. How could a video traumatize someone? But it's just what I'm feeling. When I pass by people, I start having images in my head of the videos but it's my face on the people being murdered. It's like it happened to me. I already struggle with flashbacks from my fentanyl days, and these videos are just like that. I imagine people doing things to me that have never happened to me, just like a flashback. I get stuck in my head. I panic. I don't know what to do. I fucked up big time watching those videos. I now know how truly easy it is for people to murder and hurt others. Not just easy, but it's so much more normal and common than I realized. I just don't know what to do, I need help because I'm telling you, I cannot go on living this way for much longer.",5,paranoia

"Hi everyone. 

This might take a bit to explain so bare with me here. 
My boyfriend left for Basic Training for the army 2 weeks ago, and my anxiety has been off the rails - always assuming worst case scenarios. I was able to get a few calls while he was waiting to start, and it put my mind at ease a lot for a few days. 
When he actually started basic, his parents weren‚Äôt able to write down his mailing info for letters. 
Well, my sister is friends with a lot of people at the base he‚Äôs training at. Her ex husband is a captain there as well. I mentioned to her that we didn‚Äôt get his info, and she ended up asking her ex husband to get it. 
Ever since then, I have been spiraling about if that impacted him and made him stand out (which in this situation is not necessarily a good thing). And then, I talked myself down from that ledge, because with how things work there they‚Äôre not allowed to only focus on one person‚Ä¶ and why would they, they don‚Äôt even know him. 
I did, however, write in one of my letters to him a brief explanation of what happened and that I‚Äôm sorry if it DID cause any issues for him briefly. 
Now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm spiraling thinking what if he reads that and gets mad that something COULD HAVE happened and blames me for any issues or thinks I‚Äôm the reason for any of the attention he gets? I don‚Äôt think it even makes sense after typing it all out but I‚Äôm still concerned I shouldn‚Äôt have even said that in the letter. Ugh. How can I get out of this negative thought spiral? 
Did apologizing before even knowing if anything happened potentially make the situation worse?! Help!",4,anxiety

"Hi all, I was curious if anyone has had delusional behavior with just an anxiety diagnosis. The reason I ask is because I have always felt that there is something more going on with me than just anxiety. But, anxiety is very strong so I thought I'd ask. My delusions happen when I go off my antipsychotic medication. An example of one is I thought poison was in my food which was a really intense delusion. Usually they are a bit more mild, like suddenly being religious when I have no religious beliefs on my medication. Going down rabbit holes like alien encounters or near death experiences, believing everything I hear/read. I have been in psychosis before but it was due to a drug withdrawal so I don't believe I have a psychotic disorder but I don't know. Please let me know if you experience anything similar.

"After months of job searching I finally have a job, and a decent paying one for an entry-level position in my field. Only thing is now at work I am plagued with intense paranoia and anxiety about how my coworkers perceive me. It gets to where I have a really hard time concentrating on what I'm doing and then I screw up, which then adds more fuel to the fire because ""oh, now they saw me mess up and are probably gonna talk about how stupid and incompetent I am"".

At my previous job the people were great, I felt very safe, comfortable, and just appreciated there. It was such a nurturing environment to be in and I really took that for granted.

The last person in my position was very well loved by everyone there and I feel like since I am not her and I am very shy that at least some of the people there already dislike me. Like yesterday I said good morning to the receptionist and she looked me dead in the eyes, saying nothing back. It was quiet and I spoke clearly. I know she heard me. I just hate it, because I always have felt negatively toward/about myself and to have that mirrored by others just multiplies that self-hate, self-criticism tenfold. Back when I saw a therapist, he commented that I have rejection sensitive dysphoria which means that anything I even perceive as rejection I can't help but fixate on.

This is a solid position for me to start out at and gain experience with so I don't want to leave, but I just wish I could let go and stop caring. But I can't. I have never, ever been able to just not care what other people think about me.",5,paranoia

"First of all, don't use any management tools including this to avoid seeking professional help. That said, let's keep it real. Let me give you a process and then some tools.

First, really get a grasp of the actual problem. I can't speak for you, but if I hypothetically had such an issue, I'd imagine what is happening is that I'm always very fixated on potential negative motives and plans of other people. There's a lot of paranoia involved in this, and what really would fuck this up is if your hyperfixation on this was ever partially validated. Because then, if part of the scenario you played out was validated, and you can process and think through all the rest of the negative scenarios, you necessarily believe then that anything you can conceive yourself is actually being done by others that have these detrimental motives.

What's the problem then? You will constantly maneuver and avoid or confront those things constantly. You can't function because you are in constant fight or flight.

How can you manage it? Well, easy, allow yourself to completely play thru the worst scenarios and delusions. Think about what the world is and your place if it were true. Realize despite it, you're still here. Whatever the worst thing that could come to pass is (most likely some sort of being killed), come to terms with it now and be amazed of the experience of life you've had and the potential opportunity to pull the cloak away before you slip back into the same aether you were pulled from before birth. Let go of your ego and your need to fight something that if actually is, is so much bigger and awe stricking than you that you should feel privileged to be the focus of such a thing. Allow the ultimate thing you fight every moment to avoid to consume and carry you away, it's OK. We all will turn into the same dust in the end, everything you do and experience will end in you fertilizing the soil exactly the same as your enemies. There are no winners. Allow what can pass to pass, if for nothing more than to witness it and be amazed.

If you no longer fear the meaningless consequences you were trained to fear by your doubts and conditioning, you will be free to just exist and observe, and whatever time you have there, you will be happy and you will be able to do anything you want.

Stop fighting, just let the forces push and pull. Let yourself be in danger, accept death knowing it comes exactly the same for anyone who plotted against you.",6,schizophrenia

"First off here‚Äôs what the teacher has said to me so far (these are just the things I remember off the top of my head):
He asks me ‚Äúhave you even done computer science?‚Äù I said ‚Äúyes but last year I had a lot of health issues so I missed almost half of the school year, so I‚Äôm not as confident as most people in this class‚Äù he rolled his eyes said ‚Äúsure‚Äù then walked off.
A couple of days after that - ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôve taken computer science before?‚Äù.
‚ÄúI really want to punch you‚Äù.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stupid‚Äù.
‚ÄúFool‚Äù.
‚ÄúOf course yooouu don‚Äôt understand this‚Äù.
Moves his hand towards my face with a clear intention of hitting me, stops and within inches to my face says ‚Äúno I can‚Äôt do that because you‚Äôre a girl but my patience is wearing thin‚Äù.
‚ÄúThis is so easy even somebody like you should be able to do it‚Äù 2x.

I know I‚Äôm not dumb and I‚Äôm capable of excelling in this class as prior to this year  I have been a straight A student in all of my classes including computer science but this teacher has made me doubt all of my abilities and has made me cry every single fucking lesson. I no longer find joy in this subject. I used to cry every morning about going to school as a whole but now I only cry about going to computer science. I know this sounds like over kill but I‚Äôve had a few nightmares about him.

I know it seems like the obvious answer is yes but there‚Äôs some variables.
It‚Äôs term 2, I‚Äôm half way through the year and switching to a different class i have no knowledge on (which are the only classes available) is going to be extremely difficult.
Because it‚Äôs term 2 the dean will ask why I‚Äôm changing classes now which means I‚Äôll have to tell her or she won‚Äôt let me move. I can‚Äôt do that because if I do she will likely talk to him about it which means I will be paranoid walking around the school in case he approaches me and yells at me/hits me because I got him in trouble (I already feel this way but I know it‚Äôll become unbearable if I talk to her about it). 
He‚Äôs known around the school for making controversial comments so what if I‚Äôm just being ridiculous? What if he‚Äôs joking and I‚Äôm just being overly sensitive?

A few days ago I told my friends about this thinking it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal and I was just being dramatic so they‚Äôd laugh it off, but they said he‚Äôs abusing/bullying me and that I should move classes. What they said has really gotten to me and ever since then my anxiety has been through the roof and I can‚Äôt sleep because I‚Äôm having nightmares about him. I think what makes this really difficult for me is that he looks like my granddad who hits me occasionally and that he acts like my mother, who has been the leading cause to my diagnosed ptsd. 

I know I‚Äôm being dramatic and that I‚Äôm just being a worry wart but I need help or some advice. I have school tomorrow and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capable of going to computer science or the dean. I wouldn‚Äôt be posting on Reddit but I don‚Äôt have an appointment with my therapist until Wednesday and tomorrow is Monday and I‚Äôm just at such a loss.",5,paranoia

"Hello! I am looking for some support and advice on hyperventilation.

Over the years I began to develop this hyperventilation habit, where I'd take unnecessarily deep breaths out of anxiety and slowly and slowly it became my most prominent anxiety symptom, and especially more this past year when my anxiety turned into nonstop panic.

A week ago, I was prescribed Sertraline (50 mg) to take daily, and quite honestly it has already made strides to my anxiety, and has helped a bit with the hyperventilating.

But my problem now is I have noticed it must be a habit of my own breathing now rather than just out of anxiety, likely for the years and more recently the intense months I struggled with anxiety without help.

What I would like to learn, or get help with, is how can I rid myself of this habit. To explain a bit deeper, when I hyperventilate, it's not what people think like a sudden rapid fire of breaths, rather mine is every 30 seconds to (I've been getting better at not doing it so often) a few minutes, I take this intense gasp of air through my mouth in order to get a satisfying feeling in my chest, almost like I am addicted to some type of substance and I need my fix every 30 seconds to a few minutes. Some people say I sound like I am sighing because the gasp is very much like a sigh, it's like an almost relieving breath of air that does more satisfaction than simply breathing through my nose or even my mouth (as I am a bit of a mouth breather due to my weight - don't make fun of me haha).

The problem is, I never hated these deep breaths, they've always given me a satisfactory feeling in my chest. However this past year, my anxiety skyrocketed, and these breaths were not always satisfactory, it was no longer a failsafe for my anxiety, but a symptom of it, and the satisfaction in my chest with these really deep gasps of air has gotten fewer and far between that they leave me feeling breathless often, and bring on the more traditional hyperventilation you see in media like the rapid fire breaths, I'll essentially inhale air until I get that satisfaction in my chest.

The issue is it's just become such a horrid habit that has exacerbated my anxiety even deeper and caused me to hit this bottom point where I decided to finally try medicating the anxiety, but this habit still persists, and I've out of fear started to believe it will end up worsening.

I am very familiar with habits, I chew on my shirts a lot during anxiety and stuff like that, but this breathing is just something else, I fell into it for far too long and it has now become a second nature thing, where I get this knot in my chest if I don't gasp for air. I plan to work on this with my therapist and healthcare team, but wanted to get a head start on providing if any relief sooner than through therapy.

"For years I've had pretty bad periods of time filled with major depression, and severe anxiety has been a constant for as long as I can remember. This was my entire life and as such it was not as big a problem as it could have been, because it was just what I was used to. I still had desire and purpose to do things, I had friends who hanging out with was purpose enough for me. 

At the start of this year, I found a girl, and every cliche in every love story happened. We had (and still have) an incredible connection, I'm talking favourite shows, songs, interests, everything was the same, we were both incredibly emotionally intelligent and we would make each other laugh and were invested in each others lives, yada yada- you get the point. Everyone says it, I know, but I've had relationships before and I like to think of myself as emotionally intelligent enough to know that she was and probably will always be the ""one that got away."" 

Naturally that implies that yes, a few days ago, she broke things off with me. We talked in person for a few hours about it, both cried buckets into each others shoulders, and there wasn't a hint of maliciousness from either side. We both agreed it was better for the both of us in the long run. I wanted to be pissed at her, to have a reason to hate her, but it was no-one's fault she lost the spark.

She said that it was up to me, but that she does truly want to remain friends, because while the romantic feelings were no longer there, we still connected on an incredible level that she didn't want to lose, and that when/if I was ready, she would like to be friends again. (Again, huge cliche.)

After talking with her, and a lot of self reflection, I realised that I made the mistake of having her be such a major part of my life, and purpose. This whole year has been with her, and every day I was thinking of when I would see her next and waiting for a response, which would sometimes take more than a day. Nothing else was even half as important to me as her, and so obviously it absolutely killed me to not get a text more than once a day, to go hours without constantly talking to her. This was my fault, and even if I had realised it sooner, that wouldn't have affected her not feeling a spark. 

Now that we aren't together, and I know that I have to take time away from her to get over her, I am completely and utterly depressed. Everything that I have now after she's gone is simply useless to me.  I haven't stopped thinking about what I am supposed to do. My workplace, Uni work, even hanging out with friends, these all became things to pass the time until I got to see or talk to my girlfriend, whereas before they were way more than that. They were actually my life, and my interests. 

I don't have any desire for anything. I don't have something to look forward to, I have nothing to feel but regret and absolute grief for the way things were. The only time I have felt any sort of relief since then was bawling my eyes out to my mother on the phone. Getting wasted on alcohol, which usually would do the trick, does nothing. 

I can't help but feel like such a fucking loser now. I had the perfect girlfriend, I had a social life I was happy with, I had plans and desires for the future. Now I'm back to being a student with ADHD and OCD who's only friends are the three or four people from school, and the most we do is go to someone's house and play games until we go home. I am in pure agony and I have to make a constant effort to not think about how good things were. 

I have nothing to show as an 18 year old. I understand people have it worse than me. But to now have 3 guy friends that I barely hang out with, brother's who I barely talk to, no social skills or confidence, University work that I'm struggling with, and a mind-numbing workplace, I can't do anything but miss what I had. I think about how most Uni students have networks of friends, go out to bars and socialise, drink, party, have fun, and I just don't have that. 

My girlfriend breaking up with me is not why I am this disheartened. I was like this before, and I was like this during the relationship, but because I was happy when I was with her it wasn't as bad and so I paid no attention to it. I'm really struggling to know what to do with myself. I am at the point now where the only reason I haven't seriously considered or attempted to hurt myself (for lack of better wording) is because this girlfriend doesn't deserve that, and neither does my mother, or brothers. It's getting harder to not entertain the thought, because all I feel now is not numbness, but pointlessness, pain and sheer, utter grief. 

I know these feelings will pass. But while everyone tells me this, it's irrelevant to me in the current moment because it's happening right now, and I can't do anything but wait. 

I have medication for these feelings now, and I have organised professional help, but they all take time to work and I cannot just put these feelings on hold until they help.

"I've been spending more time thinking about how I'm autistic and didn't know most of my life, and doing more research to better understand my autism. 

I really miss how things were during the height of the pandemic. I live in a major city and I enjoyed working from home more often, less people outside and on public transit, etc... Everything felt less overwhelming for me, and now that things are pretty much back to normal, I feel overstimulated in public places more often. I am trying to learn ways to better manage this. I already wear noise canceling headphones pretty much everywhere, I wear loose fitting clothes to feel less fabric against my skin (and I'm picky about what I wear), and I recently bought a pair of sunglasses and a sun hat because sometimes the sun and other lights are too bright for me. I was on the verge of tears wearing the sunglasses yesterday because I felt immediately more calm, and I had no idea the bright lights made me so stressed out and I've been living like that for 27 years. My baseline stress level is likely much higher than NT people and I had no idea because this is all I've ever known. I'm trying to figure out other ways to feel less overwhelmed outside of the house now. 

As I've been thinking about this more though, I've talked to people in my life about me being autistic, and even people who know me and really care about me, they're supportive of me, but they don't understand. They are willing to do things to help me, like being okay with me turning off the lights because they're too bright, or fidgeting to calm myself down. But for everyone else, I explain it to them, and it's like in one ear and out the other. They say they're supportive, but when I ask for what I need to feel okay, I'm told that I need to, ""be flexible,"" and that, ""we all have to deal with things we don't like,"" without acknowledging that I already have to be very flexible to exist in a world where I feel like an alien. 

I want to do more to educate myself so I can better support myself and advocate for the autistic community more. I'm trying my best to be optimistic and focus on solutions, and I've been relying on God to help me through this emotionally difficult time (I'm a Christian). It's just difficult to accept that most people don't understand autism and don't want to learn anything beyond their limited understanding of it. And that it will be a battle to fight for more awareness and better accommodations for autistic people in the community. I already did a lot of education and advocacy work for the trans community because I'm a trans man and I know a lot of folks who are trans who I care about. I'm tired and I'm sick of life being an uphill battle just to have the same rights as everyone else, and to have an even laying field. I feel like I'm mourning the fact that being autistic had affected my whole life and I didn't know until like 3 years ago, and that if I want more awareness and better treatment I have to basically go into battle again. It feels so unfair. 

I'm not really asking for anything, I just wanted to get my feelings out here because I feel like this is the only community I know that will understand. I don't have any autistic friends irl and I don't know where I could meet some.",1,autism

"So I just want to say I had a friend for a long while for a good few years like while. They have been a good friend and they are still a good person and we've always gotten along wellvery rasily.  For some reason and  I really don't know how it happened but last night this friend ans i who has always been aware that I have some mental challenges that present to the world at large as very stoic and non obvious.  I present as pretty normal and live a normal life because I've pretty well  learned how to deal with my challenges I keep my stuff inside without it being apparent to everyone else that there is in reality a whole ass shit show playing out in my head at most any given time.  Chaos would be peaceful. LOL Anyways..  I guess I made a mistake last night and I'm old enough to know better that I should never even say schizophrenia as a diagnosis term applicable to myself. I could just kick ny own ass I swear.  It came about while in process of a normal discussion about noise being quiet, peaceful and just nothing. No sound. We had stoppied in a rural area for a monent and she was sharing her detailed admiration of the peacefulness and just taking for granted I too was enamored of such an awesome moment that doesnt happen very often    I truly didnt even have an imagination to assist me understanding her poetic sounding details. I mean that like way out fictional and still I just dont get what silence must sound like. Oh but anyways..  i kust honestly slipped up  stating how it really must be a true moment in time worth cherishing. It sounds wnderful. My dum dum ass then  explained to my friend that silence that he is hearing  is not the same type of silence that I hear. He givets this look like.. silence is silence. Like everyone hears the same sound of nothing. I then explain silence sounds like for me what i hear is utter chaos. Constantly. There is never this silence and nothingness he is describing for himself. I explain to him that i of course understand rthe difference between it but it's very hard to explain that to somebody and I had never used the word schizophrenia before and decined my mental provlem  It just straight slipped out. Well then of course he was all  understanding and yeah it's okay and doesn't make a difference blah blah blah and questions galore . Todaywe had some plans and he said he needed to go home. He didn't speak one word to me after that was said and i didnt speak either. We didn't say I'll see you later when parting. No goodbye. Nada.  It was totally bizarre. I guess now he is a different person. Because  I have schizophrenia.  I have always had the stigma and it's never going to go away no matter how well I take care of it I know better than to use that ""S"" word I know better but I did it because I thought this was my friend.  But you know what?  I'm sad and I regret saying it but then of course I also dont regret it. Maybe he wasn't my friend at after all.  Generall anytime anybody hears you have that specifi issur they just don't understand it.  They just don't and obviously don't want to. I see Sally Field cross their face and wait to be called Sybil. Its just so ridiculous. Anyways... I just wanted to get that off my chest. I'm. Well you know as alone as i can be . I cant trust people I guess. It makes me me feel so fake  No matter how well I act no matter how well I try to keep myself contained it just takes the mere mention of the ""s"" word and that to completely change any type relationship. I swear i hear a door slam right in rhe moment  It just  make me very sad. Sorry everyone for my rant. Thank you guys I hope none of you are going through these same things.  If you are please know you're not alone.  I'm truly just very sorry for all of us. We are just out here doing the best we can. Just like everyone else.  Enjoy your Sunday All.",6,schizophrenia

"26 years old, male. 

Military veteran. College-educated scientist. Definitely been ""gifted"" and ""higher learning ability"" all my life at the cost of severe social and generalized anxiety disorder and major clinical depression.

Bounced between careers. Army, secondary education, laboratories, warehouses. Bounced around multiple states. Don't have many real-life friends anymore. Cost of living has officially spiraled, and probably going to try to live in the car and try to figure out communal places for vets/homeless or something due to rent being this unreal.

Had girlfriends before, but haven't met a woman my age in like 3-4 years. All the apps are infested with bots. Definitely missing intimacy and just flirting in general.

Was a gamer for 24 years since before I could read, write, or talk. Played so many games on so many platforms that it all feels the same. Gaming isn't really fun anymore.

Got into drawing and painting, had fun, but got tired of it real quick.

Body works fine for now albeit unable to eat much or put on any weight and tired of being this skinny or weak but always had stomach problems i.e. nausea, unable to consume large quantities of food.

Feel like I really REALLY messed up somewhere along the way with the majority of my life and goals, and not sure to do, or where I messed up, but I don't find enjoyment from anything I used to, I've tried enough new things for a lifetime, and I don't see stability in my career, financially, and without those - DEFINITELY not in finding a partner or connecting with humans again emotionally.

I can't be the only one.... right?! Oh, please tell me this feeling is normal. Just lie to make me feel better even if it's not LOL!

"I've been depressed for most of my life. It's usually not too bad. More of a back of the mind type of feeling. Sometimes it gets really bad, but I can usually pull myself out of it enough to start enjoying life somewhat. It's been gradually getting worse over the past two years. In the past few months, it's gotten really bad. I've slowly lost interest in a lot of things. My performance at work as gotten worse and my boss is starting to notice. I feel like I've over compensated in doing all the things that normally help me pull myself out of my depression. I moved into my dream apartment, I went on a week long vacation abroad, my apartment has never been cleaner, and I've been trying out all of the hobbies I've been wanting to do. Nothing is working and I feel like a shell of a person right now. I'm starting to get really scared about the path I'm going down.   


I've started to wonder If I should try anti-depressants.  I know that I need to start looking into therapy as a longer term solution, but the waitlist for therapist inn my network are insane. Plus I know it will take some time to find one that's a right fit for me. I don't know I can wait for a therapy appointment and subsequent sessions to be prescribed medication.

Hey, Reddit community!  
  
I'm reaching out today because I'm facing a significant hurdle in my life‚ÄîADHD. It has become a constant roadblock, preventing me from fully capitalizing on the opportunities that come my way. I'm tired of being unfocused, constantly changing my plans and goals, and feeling the frustration it causes in my business and personal relationships.  
  
I'm an ambitious individual with big financial goals, but my ADHD often feels like a bottleneck, hindering my progress. I find myself overwhelmed by countless distractions and flooded with new ideas, leaving me unsure of which path to pursue.  
  
So, I'm turning to this incredible community in search of guidance, support, and mentoring opportunities. If you've been down a similar path and have successfully navigated your ADHD challenges, I would be incredibly grateful for any advice or recommendations you can offer.  
  
Are there any proven programs or therapies that have helped you manage your ADHD symptoms effectively? Perhaps you've come across certain strategies or techniques that have made a significant difference in your life. I'm open to exploring all possibilities and suggestions.  
  
Moreover, if anyone is willing to offer mentorship or share their personal experiences, it would be a tremendous help. Sometimes having someone who understands what you're going through can provide the motivation and direction needed to overcome obstacles.  
  
I genuinely believe that by learning from others who have triumphed over their ADHD challenges, I can acquire the tools and strategies necessary to unlock my true potential.  
  
Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Your support and advice mean a lot to me. Together, let's transform these roadblocks into stepping stones towards a more focused and fulfilling life.  
  
Looking forward to hearing your stories and insights!",3,adhd
"I've had some paranoia before, delusional thinking- particularly when going through extreme periods of anxiety or stress, or when feeling disassociated. Nothing for a while.

However over the past couple of days, perhaps slightly over weeks, I've been really worried I'm going to die suddenly, or that something is really wrong with me. I started bleeding when it wasn't time for my period, which really concerned me thinking I had cancer or something. I quickly learned my periods had just changed, becoming irregular, but nothing really to worry about. (It has been said the jab can cause this temporarily in women so I didn't feel like it was anything to be concerned about, and nothing has come of it since so I'm in the clear). But later I started feeling like my heart was beating irregularly and kept wearing my fitbit everywhere, checking my heartrate constantly. I told everybody how I thought I was really ill and needed to see a doctor but the doctor wouldn't see me. Over time, I kind of forgot about this process of thought after my fitbit ran out of charge and I lost the charger. I stopped checking my heart so often and subsequently, I stop feeling it beating 'irregularly'.

This past week I've been sick with the flu and tonsillitis. I've never experienced the flu before although I have experienced tonsillitis, kind of expected it to be like it's been before, but it was so much worse. I was concerned when I was so dizzy I almost couldn't make it to the bathroom. I started experiencing a high pitched sound in my ear, which has now radiated to both my ears and never stops. My headache was bad when I first got ill then as I've gotten better I felt like I was getting over the worst, but my head is now pounding again in such a way I had to look up brain aneurism to make sure I wasn't just about to die. My neck and head hurt so much, but I know logically lying in bed for three days will cause a stiff neck. I just keep thinking there's something really wrong, then rationally knowing I'm probably fine, but with a sneaky voice saying ""but what if you're not?"" It's really annoying. 

I'm not even afraid of death. I die in my dreams all the time, it's even kinda fun (I lucid dream a lot, so most of the time I know I'm actually not dying). I guess I am afraid of dying suddenly and not having a chance to say how I feel to my family and friends, I am very bad at not knowing. I just don't know why this train of thought has kicked off all of a sudden, and how to reign it in. I've been isolated from my colleagues for a good 6 days now I guess, and I work pretty consistently, work is a part of my identity at this point which may be why I feel a bit disconnected right now. On the other hand, I've enjoyed being away from work and if I was well, I would have been delighted with this time off, a chance to get my University work done and talk with online friends. 

In contrast to other paranoid thoughts I've had in the past, I'd say these are relatively harmless and don't drastically change my lifestyle, but I would like to try and do something about them in case they get out of control. Any suggestions? I don't have any diagnosis of mental health conditions other than Anxiety, Depression and ADHD. I'm 25, Female.",5,paranoia

"Hi all,

Hoping for a bit of a sanity check here / maybe some advice. If not, just venting and hoping someone can relate!

I'm having a bit of an issue with a person who I regard as my best friend. This is 100% an issue of my own making, and I doubt she's even aware of the fact that I'm upset. To be clear: I don't think *she's* done anything wrong, but I'm struggling with my own feelings on something.

I'm identifying this as an autism issue because I have a really REALLY strong sense of injustice/when something's unfair, and this is exactly what is eating at me.

Might require a bit of a long explanation, and it's a bit specific, so please bear with me!

So, background, this story involves two friends - names changed because I'm grouching about them on the internet, lol. We have Anna (my 'best' friend who I've known for 15 years) and James (a more casual friend to us both). Both me and James work in the music industry: I'm a photographer, he's a journalist. Anna does not, but she's a music fan and goes to a lot of concerts.

I introduced Anna to James about 6 years ago. Over the last 2 years, she's become closer to him than I am, because they live near each other, and hang out quite often. 

Last weekend, James got married. Anna was invited to the full wedding, but I was only invited to the evening party, so I felt a bit left out over that - I know weddings are difficult and friendships are like this, but it was eating at me a bit. And then, later in the evening, I found something out that really upset me.

In a couple of weeks, there's an awards ceremony happening. James goes to a lot of these sort of things - he's been working in the music industry for way longer than me, knows everyone, and gets invited to everything. But something very special happened for me this year with regards to these awards: as a 'music industry professional', I got invited to join the voting panel - to be one of the industry people who nominates bands for the awards. As a consequence, I too got invited to the awards. This was really important to me, because I've *grafted*: I've spent over 15 years working my way up in the industry, worked hard, networked my ass off, and to finally get recognised as a 'music industry professional' and get invited to something like this was a huge milestone for me. I'm quite insecure about my work and I finally felt like I'd 'arrived'. I was so pleased for myself.

There was a catch. Even for invited VIPs, tickets cost nearly ¬£200. Granted that came with free drinks and hospitality and perks and such, and it really is a proper thing like any other music/film awards ceremony, but, still... ouch. I'm not exactly rich at the moment, but I justified it on account of the fact that I've been working my way up to this point for years. I deserved to go. So I paid, and I told James that I was going. We talked about it quite a bit, and he sympathised about how much it had cost me.

James, meanwhile, applied to cover the event as a journalist. This isn't quite as plush as it sounds - he'll have to work for most of the night, interview bands and stuff. But he'll get in for free, or for a small mandatory donation.

I also told Anna that I'd be attending. I told her how much it cost. And her immediate response was, ""oh, I'm 99% sure I'll get a free ticket.""

There's a backstory to this. Quite often James gets 'plus ones' - when he gets free tickets as a journalist, he gets an extra ticket so he can bring a friend. This isn't typical for a music journalist, but can happen if you ask. (I rarely get plus ones because photographers don't typically get them). And when James gets a plus one, he often offers it to Anna, because she's usually available, likes going out, and enjoys a free gig ticket.

So when she said ""oh, I'm 99% sure I'll get a free ticket"" I knew what she was thinking - somewhat arrogantly, she was assuming that James would have a plus one. Considering the fact that they were charging even invited industry guests ¬£200 to attend, I told her to manage her expectations - I really doubted that there would be free tickets for many people this year.

And then, on saturday night, I found out from a mutual friend at the wedding that Anna was going to this awards ceremony. James had a free plus one, and had offered it to her. Neither of them had told me.

And I was extremely, perhaps unreasonably, upset. I was *really* upset. And angry. FURIOUS, out of nowhere. I didn't really say anything and held it together, but when I got home that night I ended up in tears.

I wasn't sure why I was so upset, but after a bit of introspection, it's the sheer injustice of it all. On top of the wedding grief (the fact that she'd been invited to the whole wedding and I hadn't, which knocked my self esteem) it was a huge, overriding sense of - *she doesn't deserve this.* 

It's the music industry in a nutshell really. It's not what you know or what you do, it's WHO you know, but it's the fact that a friend who hasn't grafted like I have (OR like James has!), who doesn't even WORK in the industry, gets into something like this for free. Meanwhile I, having worked my ass off to get to this point, had to pay ¬£200 for a ticket. After all the stuff she's got into for free thanks to James, it just really, really got to me.

If you're still with me at this point, can I get some feedback? Am I overreacting? I know I probably am. I haven't spoken to James about it, nor her (she still doesn't know that I know!) but it's absolutely eating me alive. I'm furious. It's so unfair.

I don't think I even wanted James to offer me the ticket instead - I like knowing that I worked for my ticket and I'm attending off of my own hard work. I'd just rather he'd offered it to anyone other than my 'best' friend who doesn't deserve it. She knows that I've paid ¬£200 to attend, and she's going to be so smug, because she always is when she gets into things for free, and she's used to that now thanks to James. 

I'm pretty sure that most people would be like ""eh, that's just the music industry, that's just life"" but I'm really struggling with this. It's really affected my perception of both of them and it's turned what was a special event for me into something that I don't actually want to go to any more, because it doesn't feel special now. I'd feel better if she'd told me, I'd feel better if she was excited and shocked and grateful, but she hasn't even said anything. It's just standard for her - another free ticket from James.

Am I being totally nuts over this? Would anyone else be this angry too? Am I the only one who thinks this is the unfairest thing in the world?",1,autism

"For the past 5 years my employment has been extremely inconsistent due to a panic disorder. I was first put on medication ( Zoloft w/ xanax for breakthrough anxiety) at 14 (25 now). Got off all meds at 19. Since then, it's been a total rollercoaster of panic attacks one month, depression the next, and so on.  
  
Should I get back on the meds if that was the only thing that helped? Therapy (CBT, EMDR, Hypnosis, Exposure-Response) didn't help.

My digestive system is in shambles from the constant anxiety, and I am at risk of losing my job. I'm a substitute teacher and a uni student and this condition is sucking the life out of me. The way I see it, I can stay off meds and lose it all, or take them as needed and keep my job.

"I finally mustered up the courage to ask my psych for an ADHD eval. I got the results yesterday.

I do, in fact, have ADHD (primarily inattentive type) but she said I scored way higher on the autism part of the test. I'm really not sure how I feel about a memory/focus test being used to diagnose autism? I'm not a medical professional but that just doesn't make sense to me. 

I also didn't realize I was being tested *for* autism. I thought I was just taking an ADHD assessment. I feel kind of violated about it? Not that I'm mad about being autistic (I have suspected for a while now) but I wasn't really interested in pursuing a diagnosis because

1. There's no ""treatment"" for it
2. I've heard you can be denied medical care for being of unsound mind or whatever

So yeah I'm kinda miffed that that's on my medical record now. I don't really need another reason for doctors to belittle me and talk to me like I'm stupid.

The other reason I'm upset is that my psychiatrist seems reluctant to prescribe stimulants to me because my ADHD ""isn't severe enough"" (compared to the autism I guess? idk) even though I've already expressed that I'm struggling with task initiation and follow through, as well as time blindness- which is all severely affecting my work.

She increased my Wellbutrin rx and said we'll meet again in 6 weeks to see how that's working. If there's no impovement, she'll add strattera. Hopefully things will improve, but I'm also worried that if they don't, she won't want to try a stimulant.

She very briefly mentioned some behavior therapy to ""help"" with the autism (and I mean very brief). I'm hoping it was more of a ""this is a thing that exists"" comment and not a ""this is a thing you should do"" comment, but I'm still wary. I don't really struggle with the ""classic"" neurotypical ideas of what an autistic person struggles with. And I also couldn't give less of a shit if people think I'm weird or hard to talk to (although I think the general consensus is that I'm funny and easy to get along with).

I like her as a psychiatrist, she has generally been very good at listening to me and letting me decide what kind of medication I need. I guess I'm just worried she's going to start treating me differently now because she knows I have autism.",1,autism

"Hey everyone. 

I've been diagnosed with adhd for 2 years, type one diabetes for 24 and coeliac (severe gluten auto immune response) for 20. I also suspect I struggle a lot with autism socially. 

I'm struggling to tolerate side effects of both stimulants and atomoxetine so can only tolerate a small dose of dexamphetamine every other day.  

Basically, I have ways to sort of get by and cope about half of the time but the pmdd side of things throws me out of whack and I stop being able to function (unable to work, so irritated by every little noise/find it so difficult to be kind to myself because of the amount of pressure I have to do things because of my health, intensified rejection sensitivity, feeling and thinking irrationally).

Due to the unpredictable and demanding nature of type 1 and of how difficult is it to avoid cross contamination for gluten I'm nearly always unwell (especially with adhd making it hard to remember to do things/to eat/hard to process things at the necessary speed to keep up with my health). 

I live in the UK and I'm very lucky that we have the NHS I doubt I'd survive without it. However, I don't know I can help myself, not sure if I'd like comfort or solutions maybe both? But I'm experiencing a lot of suicidal ideation (no planning just the feeling) the last few days, particularly from the effects of when I accidentally ingest gluten (malnourishment, brain fog on top of the adhd kind, migraines, double fatigue). 

Is there anything anyone has found helps them cope or lessens their number of meltdowns? I know this was a long winded one so thank you if you're reading. I have a pip assessment coming up which is a battle in itself, I know that support would go a long way if it goes well (ongoing for 5 years).",3,adhd

"Back around 2017, I left my job because it was too stressful for me. I was coming home crying. the final straw was I couldn't stop crying long enough to drive to work. work was bullshit. I worked at a deli in a grocery store. this was right around the time of a minimum wage increase in Michigan. people would quit and no one would be rehired, leaving me to the responsibilities of 4 or 5 people. It was so straining that I was sore everyday and had difficulty sleeping. I have bad anxiety so finding a job is extremely difficult. I have gaps in my resume that people hiring always ask about. I never know what to tell them. It adds to interview anxiety, so I didn't look for jobs.

My dad was supporting me completely, paying 10k or more a year for rent and food. I drove my car dry and seized the engine, so my ability of finding a new job was greatly diminished. my only choice was to work another straining minimum wage job near my apartment and that gave me anxiety. I'm not lazy, I just worked the jobs of 4 people for minimum wage and I have trouble asking for help.

Anyway, this starts a cycle of me trying to get help and accumulating more anxiety by being misdiagnosed. I text my dad suicidal texts, I had no plan in acting them out, but I had anxiety and my dad was always threatening me to take my apartment away and force me to live on the streets. I guess I just wanted him to feel sorry for me or something. there was some feeling that I wanted the suffering to end, but I didn't want to die.

He petitioned me, like he should have, and I went to the psych ward. it wasn't my first time, as I had been there in the past when I was overstimulated one time and had to take a break from life. The time I went was 10 years prior, idk what happened but I was stressed out from work (another overworked fast food minimum wage job) and I couldn't go home to sleep because it was turned into a party house by my friends. I went to my dads and I was stressed out and said some things that I forget now but my step-mom ended up calling the hospital and I was voluntarily admitted to the psych ward. I believed I was going through a quarter-life crisis. I had recently dropped out of college because work scheduled me on days I deliberately took off for school and forgot about school (I was 19, just moved out of the house and had bills to pay) and the book store didn't restock a book I needed for a VB class because someone bought it but then dropped the class. couldn't find the book online, so I ended up dropping the class in the middle of the semester, giving me an incomplete. anyway, at the psych ward I was diagnosed with psychosis and let go on some weak antipsychotics. they didnt do anything to help my anxiety and really didn't seem to do anything at all, so I stopped taking them. I don't think the meds were important but I didn't take it seriously and never went to my doctor about anxiety.

back to 2017. I left my job, lost my car and I was in a vicious cycle. I would text my dad suicidal text, get admitted to the psych ward, take the meds find them ineffective with my anxiety, stop taking them, and would sent more suicidal texts to my dad. this cycle led to a total of about 7 psych ward visits, which is a limit before they have to take serious action. in an act of desperation to break the cycle and maybe get a disability claim, I reported some pareidolias as hallucinations. It was a stretch to call them hallucinations. The water running though the pipes sounded like someone whispering my name, and I reported seeing ghosts after my hair got in my eyes and it reminded me of some scary picture I saw on the internet, it was a pareidolia.

They diagnose me with schizophrenia and force me to live at an adult foster care cities away from my apartment. not collecting disability at this point although im now eligible. I'm forced to comply with my ATO and am forced to take meds. The AFC ended up being a good thing in my eyes because I was able to get out and ride my bike almost everyday. nature and exercise do wonders for mental health.

I was moved to another AFC closer to where I was living before and these new caretakers didn't care for us very much. I was lucky if I got dinner. they were supposed to prepare 3 full meals a day, but they didn't and food piled up and they would end up taking it home or throwing it away, even though your taxes are going to this food and for them prepare it for us.

one day in june 2020, fresh in the pandemic, they decide to turn the AC off and make it hot in the house. It was 86 degrees in my room and I told them it was hot. I go to the store and 30 minutes later, still hot in my room. so I break the box covering the thermostat and turn it on, this angered the caretaker so much that she got in my face like I had a problem with her. ""I cook you food, don't I?"" she ironically says. I start formally refusing to take my med (they weren't forcing me to take them anyway) and a couple days later, 3 cop cars show up like I have a gun or something and handcuff me and take me to the hospital to get admitted to the psych ward. I was starting a business and started making about 1k a month, but they put a halt to that. This time at the psych ward, their goal was ""to get me in and out as fast as possible"" and I wasn't provided care that was personalized towards me, rather to someone who was schizophrenic and had anger issues. I may have had a little problem with anger, but nothing a little anger management couldn't solve. In the psych ward, they prescribe me with Haldol and I'm forced to take it in order to leave the psych ward or basically stay there indefinitely. This medication has plenty of severe side effects that can become permanent. I experience absolute drowsiness, I sleep 12 hours a day, get the jitters all the time and it affects my ability to play/enjoy video games, not to mention it causes anhedonia and permanent sexual dysfunction. I am forced to take it according to my ATO.

I sent a letter to my doctor, outlining my concerns and asking me to take me off of haldol, which happened for 3 or 4 months, but out of the blue they call me and want me back for routine injections.

i am trying to find a legal ground to get off this med, but with the added stigma of schizophrenia, its nearly impossible. People with schizophrenia don't believe they have it and refuse to take their meds, so I'm forced to inject haldol even though it's meant for people who absolutely can't control their anger or have debilitating hallucinations, which I don't have. I've tried posting on r/legaladvice but my posts get downvoted and largely ignored 

Now, I am stuck in another loop with this debilitating drug, but they won't take me off of it. If I refuse, I get to have cops come to my door and haul me away from my business and my responsibilities of taking care of my cat all because I had bad anxiety and was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. They can hold me in the hospital for 15 months if I refuse my meds and probably physically force me to take an injection.

personally, I believe I may be schizotypal or have SPD, as I have had delusions that I consider magical thinking, but also some real stuff has happened to me that may seem like a delusion, but I have no problem telling the difference between what is real and what is not. I don't have hallucinations. The only audio hallucinations I have are called auditory afterimages from listening to my 3d printers run all day.

Does anyone know how I get out of this? I've emailed legal aid but they have yet to get back to me. I really need a lawyer or someone to navigate the hasty, unforgiving code of Michigan's Kevin's law. Do I sue myself for defamation? How do I get a copy of my mental health records and court documents and make sure they didn't falsify or exaggerate 

before you downvote this post or say I actually have schizophrenia, know that I have all the telltale signs of a misdiagnosis (reported auditory hallucinations, repeated psych ward visits for suicidal ideation, prominent anxiety) and studies have been produced that prove over 50% of schizophrenia diagnoses are wrong. I have seen many doctors and none of them were native english speakers.",6,schizophrenia
"Hey all, I have an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow and I‚Äôm so nervous. For a while my primary care physician has been prescribing my anxiety medication but none of it seems to help and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm being taken completely serious. My anxiety is making my life miserable. I have nausea and digestive issues almost daily(all day), no appetite, back pain, fatigue, and headaches. I constantly feel anxious with a pit in my stomach and all of these other symptoms. I‚Äôm also being treated for ADHD with a stimulant.

I desperately fear being labeled as drug seeking and not being taken seriously. I‚Äôve been severely struggling for the last year and I‚Äôve spent a lot of time trying out a couple meds but I‚Äôm still miserable.

I can‚Äôt even practice the breathing techniques or grounding exercises because most of the time idek what I‚Äôm anxious about OR I panic from holding in my breath.

"Ignorance is bliss. It's sucks knowing the cause of all your major life problems and having no power to fix it. 

Finding out Adhd existed was like having all my  problems put into one word . 16 and I just really want to see a psychiatrist but my mother doesn't believe anything is wrong with me and dismisses the argument everytime. 

Before I knew what Adhd was I thought I was just an idiot doomed to fail in life. I was so happy to see that others shared the same issues in life and were able to fix it.

Knowing that my problem has a name and discovering medication was a solution to improve my unhappy life and my parents not giving a shit just made me grew bitter and resentful. 

Why me? Why did I have to be born with all this shit? Why couldn't I just be a regular kid that fits in and does teen shit? Why do I always have to give my all to things just to receive the bare minimum?

"Unless one looked closely, everything in my life would seem fine from the outside. I am at college, am lucky to live in relative comfort and have parents who are decent people.

The thing is... I am absolutely miserable. My life feels completely empty and nothing I do is fulfilling. I got a job offer for a graduate position due to start at the end of the year and I declined because the thought dealing with real world responsibilities while living an empty existence is too much for me. I know it would drive me to suicide. Even now I think about suicide on a daily basis. 

How do people cope with this life? How do people even hold down full-time jobs? For me it seems it's just all too much. And in this modern world it feels as though our lives are increasingly devoid of meaning and purpose. I am so lonely and I know I'm not the only one, but it's like we have lost our way as a society.

"Seriously i know this question gets asked im sure all day everyday, but ive never even heard of another situation like mine and just, I can't find the words for this feeling. I think i just want to ease the stress in my head with relatability. I have 3 things: ASD, OCD, and finally schizophrenia but with a huge caveat; I have accelerated thoughts i cant turn off which I'm sure is normal to most reading this, but i also have a deep, unending, obsession to question myself on everything, all the time. ""Just because"" is not good enough. I HAVE to answer why, to myself, or to anyone listening. I HAVE to. Because of this i have crazy high insight into my condition. I understand how and why i hear voices, how I go into psychosis (the primary mechanism is doubt if you're curious), why i cant stop thinking, why my head just fills with void sometimes. Everything. I understand, everything. And its absolute hell. I feel like im just constantly micromanaging myself, and i can't ever stop because letting go and not caring risks psychosis. I'll be okay. I have the tools to care for myself, and the support. I'll be fine. But i feel completely alone, so i ask. Is anyone like me?

Addendum:
I'm in a little loop. At some point in my youth i was confused, and said ""i don't understand."" And was then asked to explain. And so i did, but i did it wrong. I have to do it again, but better. Ive been doing this for decades now.",6,schizophrenia

And i feel so sad, i don't want him to feel like that around me or at all. I feel like he would be better off without me, that i am his reason for unhappiness and that I'm not really a good person. I feel so guilty and unworthy all the time. 

I try so hard to be calm and chill but i don't trust him. I don't feel safe with him. I don't think he really loves me. 

He's told me he doesnt want to marry me, he doesn't try to come see me, when he gets mad at me he grabs me and he's put his hands around my neck and it scares me.

"F(21)My father passed away in December, around a week after I turned 21. I wish it was one of those peaceful goodbye stories. But no. He fell into my arms in public while we were dancing, I spent 14 days in the icu with him, he passed away, 9 days of mourning right after. Then the viewing, and finally the funeral which I had helped plan. 

A week after im back in university. I‚Äôm a fourth year at a somewhat prestigious university. I feel like I‚Äôm even more useless now. I‚Äôve dealt with depression and anxiety before but now it‚Äôs getting worse. My winter quarter went well I was able to get straight a‚Äôs, handle my research job, treasurer of an organization, and two other managing roles at another org.

I was in the emergency room various times winter quarter due to stress related pain but I thought I could manage. Now I can‚Äôt help but feel severe pain when I have an exam.

"There isn't a lot of people in my life that I can express this to soo here I am. I've always had a very hard time using words to express what I really want to say. That equals to a lot of stuttering and stammering until I give up and usually get frustrated with myself. Writing helps.

I work a part time job and I get paid ten dollars an hour. This is relevant later. This is my first job out of college and I genuinely love my job. I've been working for about a year and while I enjoy what I do I cant help but feel stagnant. After a year working I still have nothing to show for it.  I still live at home. I don't know how to drive and my parents usually drive me everywhere. Do I hate this? Yes, very much. It's not that I'm not allowed to drive, I just don't have anyone to teach me (different story) or a car to use.

It's gotten to the point that I feel resentment towards my own home. I wake up everyday and I don't want to get out of bed. However, I realized that I completely despise my bed. I hate my room (I share with my sister). I hate all of my stuff that I used to love and collect. I hate all of my clothes and how they fit me. I want to buy more clothes but I cant because I don't make enough to just splurge on myself. I have a car payment (for a car I cant even drive) and I'm currently trying to go back to school for something low-key in the hopes of getting a better job. Everyday I see myself and I hate how I look (I'm very overweight). I sometimes wonder if I'm actually hungry or if its the ED just making me thing that I am. I'm starting to withdraw into myself and my family is noticing. I don't want them to but I also don't have the energy to keep pretending that I'm happy. How do I fix it? Does this shit actually get better or is this just my life now. My family always jokes that I'm very bitter. The thing is, I never saw myself as that. I remember always being happy and excited. I was the girl that used to hype people up. The girl that loved to yell the lyrics to songs in the car. I was the girl that wanted to go out every weekend with friends. To be described as bitter is eye opening. Like..why even try? I'm currently at work right now and all I want to do is go home. I want to sleep and just not wake up. I hate my bed but it's also the only thing that I have. It feels like an itch in my chest. It itches and itches and I want to explode.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. Like I said I don't have many people to have this conversation with and even if I did I am not sure I would be able to express it properly. I realize how all over the place my rant was, sorry. Does anything ever get better?",4,anxiety

I want to check for intruders, but I don't want to knock on the door because it's very late at night and I may wake him if he is in there and I'm anxious about bothering him so late. If I don't check I'll be bothered all night and not be able to sleep.

"So I can‚Äôt really talk to my friends and family about this and I‚Äôm not sure where else to turn.

This goes for family and irl friends too. People I‚Äôve known for years I find myself second guessing their intentions constantly and every good moment is immediately followed with intrusive thoughts. ‚Äúthey keep you around out of pity‚Äù ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt really love you‚Äù ‚Äúthey‚Äôre using you for something‚Äù things like that.

"Even as i type this I am feeling anxious. I've been missing classes and have dropped a couple of shifts at work because I found it near impossible to take a train without feeling really anxious, needing to vomit and have a bowel movement.

Around 1-1.5 months ago the near-incident i am talking about was basically me needing to immediately have a bowel movement while taking the train. Now, I can get off on a lot of stops, there are shopping centers nearby the stations so it shouldn't be a problem? Yeah, it isn't, however, I don't know if I had something bad, or if it was just my diet as a whole (I went on a healthy diet, got sick, ended up on a crappy diet for a bout a month and a half, back on healthy diet now)  but I had one of those really, really ""emergency need to evacuate bowels RIGHT NOW"" situations.. while the train experienced a FAULT in the middle of two stations not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES. We were stuck for about 15-20 minutes and judging by how I feeling at the time and what my experience was like, I'm pretty sure I had a panic attack.

Ever since that experience, each time I went onto the train I've always experienced abdominal cramps even if I've had bowel movements in the morning (I made sure to wake up an hour earlier to get everything out of the way) and then I started experiencing nausea ontop of that. I keep 3 water bottles in response to the near incident because it barely manages to keep me from wanting to vomit. Then eventually I just couldn't stay on trains and caught ubers to my classes. I get really nauseous in the mornings and it gets even worse if I see someone with a coffee cup or even a small snack like a chocolate bar.

I've gotten a blood test and stool test done but I still need to wait for results. Is there any techniques that I can use apart from breathing/meditation (which is the first thing I focus on if i feel uneasy) that can make my experience bearable until I get over this?

We  have a friend that always asks questions but never talks about himself.  He is 40 years old. Once I met him after job he asked me: did you go  somewhere in Saturday night? I replied that I went to some coffee shop.  Then he asked me 2 more times if I went to other places. Then he asked  me same questions for Friday. I was at 3 places.  I replied where I was.  Then he asked me if there was some band playing at place 2. I figured  out that he was checking if I am saying truth and I said yes. I figured  out that he will ask me more questions about my life and I decided to  play that game. He asked me if I go to coffee shop on working days, what  do I do at home, what do I do on computer, do I play games on phone.  Later he asked me what is happening on Facebook , how many Facebook  friends do I have, when do I wake up, when do I go to bed. Do I always  go to bed early? Did I ever go to bed at 3 am? Do I always go to beach  at 4PM. Once I told him that it is not good to go to beach before 4PM  because of UV radiation. Where do I go for the walk. Do I go outside at  same time. We know each other in real life. He asked me on chat: were  you outside, where you were, did I met somebody?  ( probably to ask that  person if they met me, to see if I am telling truth. ) I asked him same  questions to test him and he skipped them all. On question he asks new  question, he does not answer. he also asked me if I was drinking, how much, did I vomit  after drinking, do my cats pee on walls. etc. Once he was traveling in  other country and he spent 1 month there. he told nobody that he will  travel there. He spent one month there and he never told what happened  there. I asked him 3-4 questions and he gave me most boring answers.

He  does this to other people too. After he asks you many question, then he  talks about windows 7, Firefox, smart TV and other easy to understand  things about technology, but never about himself.

He  behaves like he is programmed. He walks same streets every day, He goes  outside at same time and goes back to home at same time. He goes to one  of 3 coffee shops every day. he stays at home every Sunday.

This makes me feel like a burden on myself, my family and makes me fell like a fucking joke to all the people who have to put up with an idiot like me, it has always been like this but when i was 16 it wasn't a big deal, now it's really hard.

Last year i had an appointment to get an ADHD diagnosys that i forgot about and now i have to wait again to go to a psichiatrist and get the prescription for the diagnosis, i forget about exams, i forget about birthdays and important dates, i forget to eat, i forget so much it makes it hard for me to keep a normal life and a healthy mental state...",2,depression
"I‚Äôm 22 y/o female have never been in a relationship and sitting here right now is hard . This dude i went to a festival with and have known for 8 months we finally hung back out recently and went to a festival together. I thought it was well i started falling for him he even texted me today reassuring everything was okay and called me babe.. But then i see him post on his snap story with a girl that was from a month ago and captioned it, ‚Äúmi amor‚Äù. I broke down . This always happens to me no one ever wants me and jumps right into a relationship agter talking to me. it makes me feel worthless not good enough and why am i not good enough. I don‚Äôt feel like living anymore just because i have no hope i‚Äôve tried to stay positive for so long. But it hurts me so bad because i care way too much. I really just don‚Äôt wanna live anymore .",2,depression
He seems completely normal then says something that reminds me that he thinks that that society/the police are watching him. He feels the need to kill himself before they do. He thinks he is being watched/followed. Is this something he will always think now? Or does it only happen during an episode? He had his first episode this weekend and I really don't know if he is still in it or if it's over and this is our family's new reality.  We are waiting to see a Dr but he is def schizophrenic in my opinion as it runs in his family and he fits all the symptoms,6,schizophrenia

"Hey,

I‚Äôve had a weird experience in the past where one day I was really bored and went on urban dictionary and I started to look up some guy name of some guy I had an argument with.

I came across a post and then I looked at the profile and it was recently created and most of the posts were kind of related to our arguments and I got freaked out and some of it was mocking someone.

I felt so bad like I kept analyzing it daily and I even texted him one time and he stopped talking because I think I upset him. I looked at the profile again and one of the posts were deleted. Now the profile has been deleted. 

It really affected my self confidence:(",5,paranoia

"so, i live in not the safest neighborhood. majority are on meth, the rest of us are either old or uncivilized families. my family is one of the more normal families here, thats not saying much considering our next door neighbors are on meth and constantly being roudy in the middle of the night. 2-3 years ago, i was never concermed for my safety and i loved being home alone. now i dont even feel safe when everyone is home. anyways. we recently purchased 2 ring cameras, one for our front porch and the other for our driveway. so far we've seen multiple people, one presumably on something and others who had stolen from houses nearby. i keep hearing things. outside my room is a blind spot to the camera which is terrible because i can not constantly moniter who is outside, and i have to make my own judgements. i will ALWAYS go with my gut, which is why i have currently locked myself into a different room in the house and i will be sleeping here for the rest of the night. i dont know what to do. i dont feel safe in my own home anymore. im terrified somebody is watching, waiting for the perfect time to break in and do god knows what. what if they hurt me or my family or both? ive been living everyday like its my last because it could be true. i mean, these people are already senseless, but anything that mightve remained has definetly been overtaken by the meth. i cant live like this anymore. id rather burrow away for the rest of my life than live in this constant state of fear and worry to the point where i jet to a new room at 3 in the morining and rant on reddit about how scared i am. im always listening and worrying. i cant take it. i might as well be the one on meth because it feels like im going insane. what do i do?",5,paranoia

"hey guys, i don‚Äôt have a medical diagnosis or anything and am not sure if i have ‚Äòparanoia‚Äô but i was wondering if any of y‚Äôall had advice or tips for some symptoms i live with DAILY that control my life.

some examples:
- constantly scared that i will die or my family will die
- think i will be part of a shooting or mass shooting every time im in public
- cant eat fast food bc i think the workers spit in it or did something to it
- cant get mad at someone for too long before thinking they will die that night
- hear noises that aren‚Äôt there and assume someone is breaking in

i don‚Äôt feel like i have anxiety, because i‚Äôm not jittery or insanely nervous to leave the house, but i struggle with these main fears every second of everyday. i don‚Äôt think a moment goes by where i‚Äôm not thinking abt my paranoiac thoughts.

does anyone else go through something like this and have any advice or tips? im not sure if i need medication, or maybe just therapy, or maybe to practice grounding. 

any advice will help!",5,paranoia

"Hi, im new here and im having a hard time rn with an obsessive fear (don't wanna talk about it). I don't know if im paranoid or something but it was always a thing i asked myself in the back of my head. I remember when i was little, my mum would go out of the house to take care of our garden (to hot the day to do it), and i was absolutely terrified that she would disappear in anyway, the more common fear about that that i had was about aliens abductions (i feel stupid writing thst down) or just the fact that it was not her but someone or something else that took her appearance (same with the rest of my family when they go back from outside, i just automatically think it might not be them. I even do it my my pets, i tell them stuff like ""i know its not you"" and all, i even try to test their normal behaviour.

Another time i remember when i got out of school waiting for my mum to pick me up, i had the sudden fear that everyone, EVERYONE, was not real, they were robots, i could've stand that my loved ones might be too, then the fear went away for most of the time.

I also have this fear of behing spyed on with everything, phone, spy cam, people. I was so scared of that, that i didn't go outside for a long time.

Now back to present, im scared right now, i wonder if i could just take a lorazepam to try and calm that down but i dont have any prescription for it and im scared what it would do if i take one, but i also just want it to stop hurting for the night",5,paranoia
