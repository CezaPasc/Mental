"I hate myself for what i did. I slept 11 boys and who knows the number of bjs. Some of them was one night some of them was fuckbudy. I lied to a boy about my past just to make him love me although i had a boyfriend at that time. And after i broke up and started to date with new boy i talked to another boy and sent my photos which new boy took from our date and i said to him i want to go drink. New boy loved me but fake me but learned truth and devastated. He learned all of this. He started smoking again because of me. All this time he cared for me like i am his child. I didnt even see this kind of caring and loving non of my parents nor relationships. And i hate being myself and not treating him as he deserves. After he found out i lied again about the number of people but he found out again. I also said i did check stds and i have nothing but i didnt said that after this check i slept with 2 people. How stupid i was i couldnt think i would spread something to him. (we checked i had hpv not cancerogen thank god) I promised not to lie again and comitted him. I was using paxil and he was so good to me i could quit in 7 months after using 7 years. He is always so good to me he helps me so much he always cares about my health, spends money for me. I cant stop myself from feeling devastated and very sad and crying every day. Every day my past comes to my mind. I know i dont deserve him but its like idont deserve to be happy at all. I cant work because i am always sad, i cant even brush my teeth sometime. I cant stand the reality of my past. I dont have anyone in my life who cares except him. It will be 10 months after i have changed but sadness still crushes me. What do you suggest, also please dont fuck up your life like mine",2,depression

"I think I should leave my family. My depression isn‚Äôt responding to treatment anymore, I‚Äôm still trying and will to continue to try. It has been a lifelong struggle but two and half years ago got really bad and has not lessened at all. I have a husband and two teens. My husband supports us and takes care of everything including me. I‚Äôm not really parenting and I‚Äôm not really a partner.

It would not be ideal as there is some tension and ugliness, but it‚Äôs not extreme. My husband has said it‚Äôs not what he wants, but my being here has a negative impact on everyone.

"I honestly have no idea how to begin or if this will even read coherently but, 

I have social anxiety, it‚Äôs the type that causes irrational overthinking of social situations, panic and usually the immense urge to run away and hide. 

My issue relates to real life interactions and video game interactions (I‚Äôm a big gamer) I play games that are designed to be played with other people but yet I struggle to do so because the idea of using a microphone and talking to other people causes me to panic

In real life however I‚Äôve basically become an isolationist. I‚Äôve not seen any friends for years, I hardly ever leave the house. I lost my job during the early days of covid and haven‚Äôt had the confidence to go back out there and get another, which in turn has only made the anxiety worse. I overanalyse everything, every person I walk past could be a threat to me. I even cut my own hair because going to a hair dressers and having to make idle conversation would make me want to run. 

All of this originates back to when I was in school (I‚Äôm 24 now) I was bullied terribly, never had many if any friends.

This is compounded by part of my family instilling in me the ‚Äúget on with it‚Äù attitude, they have little to no sympathy for mental health issues and call it weakness. Being raised around this has caused me to keep my issues to myself, again adding to the problem. 

I live in the UK and have tried several times to get a doctors appointment but I‚Äôve not been successful due to waiting lists and such. Also the thought of having to say all of this to someone‚Äôs face makes me feel very fearful

I‚Äôve allowed my person appearance to slip, i don‚Äôt look after myself as well as I should and sometimes getting out of bed feels like the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done. 

I guess what I‚Äôm asking for is advice or just to know I‚Äôm not the only one feeling like this, because it seems like everyone around me has an abundance of confidence.

Maybe I can even make a few friends who feel the same way. Id be more at ease being around others that also struggle as I wouldn‚Äôt feel like the ‚Äúodd one out‚Äù",4,anxiety

"Hi everyone. I would like some support and advice as I feel like my life is at its end right now. I've been put into a very bad financial spot recently and it's put me at my wit's end. I've been unemployed to study and now all of the sudden, all of the financial burden has been put on my shoulders.

I've been applying to every job listing that I see have been relevant to my previous line of work, but the response time from companies is so agonizing. I don't know if they'll contact me back, let alone give me a chance at an interview. I can manage to get by for another 2 months from savings and I honestly don't know if I'll get anywhere before my savings run dry.

My biggest issue with anxiety at this moment is my inability to sleep and wake up peacefully. For these past two weeks, I've been heading to bed with a giant pit in my stomach and it haunts me to the point where I can't sleep. When I do sleep, it'd be from pure exhaustion of trying to fight the sense of doom. Even still, I would only sleep for 1 to 3 hours at a time. I'd wake up with the pit in my stomach feeling like it became a giant crater. I'd wake up sweating and frantically trying to seek the presence of others because I feel so alone. Often times no one else is home and my friends are still asleep, there's no one for me to cry to. I'm fairly new to feeling like this, is this what it's like to have a panic attack? It feels so terrible and it puts me on edge every morning.

This is certainly putting a strain on my friends and relationships. I've cried to them so many times already and I feel like at some point, everyone will understandably become tired of me and I'll lose my line of support. I don't know what to do. If anyone out there can share a piece of their story on how they overcame this terrible time, or how they're coping, please talk to me. I don't know what to do about this pit in my stomach and I just want to be able to sleep again.

EDIT: To clear the air, I am not asking/begging for money. I would just like some advice on how to overcome this and to hear everyone's story. I appreciate those who have made it this far into the post.",4,anxiety

"

Hello. I'm not sure if this is the correct place to put this, but I (24f) need some advice for a situation with my brother. TLDR at the bottom. 

For the past 10 years, he has had a very rocky relationship with my parents and members of my family due to differences in beliefs and values, mainly on smoking weed. This resulted in him moving out about 4 years ago. However, he began talking and repairing the relationship with them, and over the past year, it has slowly gotten better. This is the case, until last month when he started making 2 accusations about our family. The first is accusing relatives as well as our dad of putting spyware on his phone and computer about 8 years ago and tracking his every move, and the second is that he was caught at a family function smoking weed and family members laughed and mocked him for it. Both of these events never happened, nor anything similar to it. This has also been confirmed with many family members as well. However, my brother refuses to believe it, and believes that we are all lying to him. He will also continue to call/text my parents, myself and other members of my extended family questioning us, and trying to get us to admit to both of the events. We continually try and call him and check up on him, and visit him in person, however he only wants to talk about the accusations and refuses to discuss anything else. He also continually comes up with more and more ""memories"" about the situations each conversation we have, and is becoming more aggressive each time.

After some researching and talking to some mental health professionals, we believe that my brother is experiencing a psychosis and is dealing with paranoia. We have a ""diagnostic"" virtual family therapy session this Friday which we got my brother to join (Basically, the therapist can learn more about the situation and assess my brother and then refer him to further psychological therapy, and us to family therapy if that makes sense). However he texted me this evening stating that he was expecting us to admit to him what the family did before or during the session or else he will never speak to anyone in our family again.

I honestly do not know how to talk to him anymore, since he believes that we are trying to harm him. Through my research online, I have read that we shouldn't argue about the paranoias the person is facing because it will agitate them even more, nor should we agree to their delusions. because of this, I'm at a loss on how to communicate with him, and am very worried that the therapy session won't meet his needs and then he will stop communicating with the family and we won't be able to get him help and resolve the root issue. If anyone who has been in this situation or knows someone in this situation, or is a mental health professional, can please give me advice on what to do in this situation and how to communicate with my brother, and also how to approach this therapy session, or even how to calm my anxiety before the session it will be very appreciated.

TLDR: Brother is most likely experiencing psychosis and is accusing members of the family of harming him years ago. We have a family therapy session this Friday and he says that he will cut us off completely unless we admit to the accusations at the therapy session.",5,paranoia

"I just want to start by saying I don't really feel that my life has been terrible as far as it goes, but I can't help but feel like nothing ever quite went the way I hoped it would. I turned 30 recently and the realization about where I'm really at hit me like a truck. I don't have many happy memories from childhood up until I was about 23-24 years old because everything I did had the shadow of my parents looming overhead. They fought a lot as long as I can remember and wanted to control my every move. My dad is addicted to pills because of a problem that caused him a lot of pain. My mom had a heart attack when I was 13 that couched her indefinitely because she was too afraid to move. When my brother passed away everything in the house got worse. Every conversation became about death and loss. All of their expectations crashed down on me and I was intimately aware of how short I fell of them. I got bullied a lot in school up until I got expelled. I just sat in my room, never really left except to get weed and then I just smoked and wasted time until I could go back to sleep, the one time I wasn't looking over my shoulder.  I missed everything from the ""golden years"" of high school, and I miss everything now because being in uncontrollable social situations fills me with dread. Now I'm dealing with my own daily physical pain from a vague condition my doctors can't pinpoint. The sole saving grace in my life is my wonderful partner. I love her, but I feel more and more every day that I'm robbing her of a fulfilling life because of the demons in my heart that I can never seem to grapple with. It's always one step forward, two steps back. I can't ever finish what I set out to do because there's a titanic fear of failure on my back.

I've been on invega injection for about a year now and I gained something about 20 pounds. My doctor even lowered my dose from 150 mg to 100 then to 75 and now I'm on 50 mg after a year. Still that gained weight does not want to come off. Does anyone know when weight gained by antipsychotics go away or is it permanent? Anyone used invega before and then stopped using it so he or she can tell me more about it. Thanks.,6,schizophrenia

Me:I learned against my own will how to hide my entire being at a young age as a result of chronic, repetitive child abuse, emotional neglect, bullying, ostracism, and social isolation simply because l'm autistic that lasted for over a decade, causing me to involuntarily mask on a daily basis and become a bitter, confused dissociating mess of a human shell who for a long time believed that there was something horribly wrong with me as an existing human being and couldnt comprehend that I was just different and that there was actually nothing wrong with me and I never came to terms with it until early adulthood and that is why, my friend, I don't look autistic to you

Everyone, and I mean *everyone*, grew up and was harmed by the result of living in a society built for neurotypicals. Including our parents, family, and the other people around us in our everyday life. So, maybe, we shouldn‚Äôt vilify people and essentially call them *abusers* for not knowing how to help us in a neurotypical world.

Jumped on reddit and saw a post on r/AITA where some dude was complaining about how his girlfriend was introverted & didn‚Äôt like to socialise with anyone including his friends (she would not stop him from doing his own thing with his friends and socialising with whoever, she just didn‚Äôt want to partake)  so he staged an ambush on her where he invited her around to his house and then invited his friends as well without her knowing. She tried to be amicable with his friends but was obviously anxious, became ‚Äúmute‚Äù as he put it and snuck out the back door 30 mins later. He then goes on to say how childish she is for not being able to deal with 1hr of talking. The general consensus was that he was the asshole for staging an ambush on her BUT she was the asshole for not wanting to socialise with anyone and that she should be socialising with him & his friends for the sake of the relationship. 

I really couldn‚Äôt believe that people were saying she was an asshole for not wanting to socialise with people. Honestly reading those comments made my anxiety skyrocket.

"I'm attending university and while I am on the road to a top grade, it doesn't feel like I've done much to deserve it, it does not feel like it is genuine. I keep worrying that if I leave the university, it will tell its students and staff to track me down and watch me, so I think their grade system has been altered to fit my pace. A few days ago, they announced an extension for an activity that I have been vocally but privately discussingwith someone. I am sure that I am being watched and monitored by my university and friends right now. I was told to download a software for my course and I can't disable it. My university has a hidden reputation and I worry that they will use it to their advantage to intimidate me into submission or notify my friends and family of my whereabouts in the event that I move someplace else. This would lead to me being tracked down for life and I have been aware of this since I was young. I need to ask for forgiveness but I don't know how. I was dismissive at the time that I didn't think about it. Three days ago, there was an RSPCA van but it wasn't genuine because the logo was smaller and did not look real, and upon looking at the side window, it drove away immediately. The person inside had a GPS . A day before that, a lady was walking by my house with what looked to be her friend, and she was looking down at the ground, the way that she was walking was unusual and I think it was something that I was supposed to understand, but in that time, I didn't understand, so I never got if she was helping me or not which I feel really distressed about even now. I have only taken a photo of the van but I can't share it. In my walls, I heard tapping (not heating) around 4pm yesterday, I knocked at the wall and nothing knocked back, but the knocking continued every time I diverted my attention from it. I looked at my laptop while still focusing on my walls and nothing happened, so patterns are taken into consideration. This is recent so I don't know what this is pertaining towards, but I remember that I had a dream about my wallpaper being red paisley which was a sign (not from God), but I didn't want it, it's a bad sign which I have gathered. I worry that people can read my thoughts when they touch me or are talking to me. I had a very uncomfortable thought while someone was talking to me and I felt sick, they asked if I was okay which I attributed to them knowing I was uncomfortable due to the thought. Now I'm worried that my lecturers have seen my thoughts but I don't remember if I have had awful thoughts during lectures so I am panicking badly about this. I can't eat and I feel sick every time I try to, and attending lectures makes me feel extremely nervous, but I can't turn to God because I have no knowledge of whether I had been dismissive, so I have no good reason to. I've been looking at pictures on my Pinterest to stay on board as I store my good pictures there, and have been hanging hamsa in my room to divert the bad pictures. Bad pictures usually come from bad numbers, sounds and rarely music. I can't stop crying and feeling sick and I have to go under my covers when I do but I keep worrying that cameras are being poked through the fabric and my neck. Every time something doesn't feel right or go my way, I get overwhelmed immediately and it's affecting my relationships. My best friend could be a part of this which is horrifying to me as I have told him a lot of things. How do I ask for forgiveness? I'm really worried but more messages and signs keep coming through, I'm really frustrated that I can't understand all of them",5,paranoia

"I can‚Äôt be completely honest with the people around me but cannot keep bottling this all up, so I‚Äôve resorted to telling strangers on the internet. It‚Äôs a long post. 

I struggled with depressive thoughts my whole life. But this has got worse these past few months for one main reason and a couple other reasons that have compounded on top of the main one. I am just so sick and tired of pretending I‚Äôm at least a little bit okay to a majority of people other than my mum. Who I can‚Äôt even tell everything to. 

Recently, my thoughts have deteriorated to thoughts of suicide, nothing that will be acted upon at this moment. I‚Äôm just so sick and tired of feeling this way. I don‚Äôt want to die, I just want the pain to end. 

I have moved into a new house since the split and I just feel like an imposter. The three of them get on really well and whenever I get in the vicinity they go quiet and when I try and join in conversation they just disperse and everything ends. Even after I‚Äôve heard them laughing and joking. I pay rent in two places, one is with the girl I love, who isn‚Äôt in love with me back, and the other I have bad imposter syndrome in. 

Medications don‚Äôt seem to help and fluoxetine actually had nasty side affects that were worse. The closest medication seems to get is making me feel numb, a complete and whole lack of emotion seemed to actually make the thoughts of wanting to die even stronger, if I can‚Äôt even feel emotions then what is even the point of bein alive? 

I wrote a very long suicide note and a couple individual ones to certain people, not sure why. Maybe in case I just decide to do it one day. So at least they‚Äôre there as back up. 

I have two key reasons to not at this moment. One is my mum told me when I was really bad and she sensed something that if I do anything it‚Äôll probably kill her as well. She‚Äôs not very well and I do believe her and if my mum died then my sisters life would crumble as well. Which cannot happen as she has two kids, of which I am in her will as the next of kin. She has a bit of a dangerous brain condition and she wanted to be safe. 

The other reason is that it would probably devastate my ex. Her leaving was what triggered this steep decline, i don‚Äôt hold any negative feelings toward her at all, actually the opposite. But it wouldn‚Äôt be a stretch for her if she heard that I had actually done it that the steep decline as a result of the breakup led to this, and I wouldn‚Äôt want her to feel guilty if I did do anything. To bear the thought of my mum and her hearing about this and their reactions is probably the main reasons I haven‚Äôt done anything serious.  

I just needed to tell anyone. I‚Äôm seriously losing motivation. The doctors don‚Äôt really help and are just trying medications to hope something works. Doesn‚Äôt seem like they really care that much. I‚Äôm starting to feel like a lost cause. Destined to be alone and depressed. Like I said I don‚Äôt want to die, I just want the pain to end. 

I just had to tell anyone that would listen (or read), it‚Äôs getting too tiring to hold the thoughts in.",2,depression

I am 32 years old female and I'm in the process of getting diagnosed with ADHD. At least I really hope so! I started looking into all of this maybe about 6 months ago (after a TV show talked about it) and let's just say that everything suddenly clicked.

  
Thankfully, I found a really great doctor. She referred me to get tested with QB Testing without any extra questions, although she didn't say much more about the diagnosis process. I probably should have asked but I was really nervous about it!

  
Now, my question is about QB testing. I am a bit nervous very about it as I have read some stories about people getting a false negative result with the QB Test. Does anyone have any tips for when I do take it? How would you suggest preparing? Anything I should keep in mind, anything I should make sure to do during the test?

It makes me sad that the sound of kids playing gets to  me this much, and i can literally feel it igniting my nervous system and I'll try so hard to just work through it but the anger always comes in so quick and fiery if yk that feeling. 

I know it's not the kids' or dog's fault, but I just feel so frustrated bc it seems like these adults give absolutely no consideration to the echo chamber of concrete walls that surround the area.

"(CW: ED, overbearing parents, undiagnosed)

Hi!! This is my second post here. This is also kind of a rant. I am doing not super okay since then but I need advice because I don‚Äôt think anyone has made a post like this yet. 

TLDR: my mom is feeding me too much, not leaving me alone, making me go from my house to her house and being waaayyy to overbearing  because of my mental health and hallucinations and I just want to be alone. Is it okay to be alone during this? Am I mad for no reason?

My mom is very overbearing and has been ever since I was small. I (20) live alone and she lives on in the middle of nowhere (farm) where there is nothing to do in a small house. I like my home and feel good living alone with my cats. but since two months ago, she doesn‚Äôt leave me alone. A doctor told her it‚Äôs best to not let me be alone.

Because of her work, she needs to be home.  She makes me go with her. I am very unhappy at her house and 60% of the week and time I am stuck in her house and the other 40% I‚Äôm allowed to be back home.

I have gained weight. have struggled with eating my entire life because of my parents eating patterns. Upset? Eat. Happy? Eat. I learnt to live a healthy lifestyle after living alone. I love working out and going for long walks but now, I am unable to do so because I can‚Äôt be alone. She doesn‚Äôt get how bad it makes me feel. 

I told my mom that I am upset the way she is making me eat and not allowing me to workout or go for walks. I told her it‚Äôs unhealthy how much weight I‚Äôve gained in a short time and now I am very upset because I have absolutely no control over my life and it‚Äôs constant bad though and the voices are so awful I can‚Äôt stop them when I am like this. My mom said I‚Äôm not eating too much but I am. 

I just want to be alone again not because I want to do something unhinged but I am just too overwhelmed. I got taken off all my meds (adhd and birth control for hormones) and I just hate this I can‚Äôt take this experience anymore. 

The clinic that will help me will call me next week after a month of waiting to get in and two hospital visits later. 

Can someone just tell me I‚Äôm okay to be alone? She talks to me like a child now and I feel so useless here with her. I have no control over my life and don‚Äôt want to go from house to house anymore. I just want to be with my cats in my own home.",6,schizophrenia

"Currently, I'm living in a group home on the campus of a psychiatric hospital. I've been outpatient here for the past couple of months. I've been struggling with self-harm, and I had to go inpatient twice. I don't think that helped me much, though, and they've given me a lot of chances. I've been warned that if I self harm again, I'm getting thrown out, so I'm trying my best to control myself and use some coping skills, mostly breathing exercises or listening to music to calm down, but sometimes these urges are just so strong that it's like I'm so ready to act on impulse, but I also think about the fact that if I risk self harming again, I'll actually be homeless, and I don't want that it'll make everything worse for me. Everything is just so hard right now. All I feel is constant stress and depression; so many things are building up inside of me. I'm just so used to using self harm as a relief for everything. It's like I'm an addict, and I need it so badly as an outlet to relieve myself. I know it's up to me to try harder to help myself.",2,depression

"I‚Äôve dated, had one-night stands, one friend of with benefits.

No one has ever told me romantically that they love me. Or that I‚Äôm beautiful (I have been told what features on my body are unattractive by the men I‚Äôve gone out with.)

I sleep with a guy once and they lose interest, so now I feel like my naked body is vile to look at. I go on a date with a guy once, and never hear from him again, so maybe I‚Äôm both ugly AND I have a bad personality.

It‚Äôs just crushing me. The unyielding loneliness is always there.

I‚Äôm tired of people telling me to love myself before someone else can love me. Bullshit. Insecure people find relationships ALL THE TIME.

They say ‚Äúput yourself out there‚Äù. I have a pretty decent social life and don‚Äôt get approached romantically. I‚Äôve been on dating apps for 23 years so it‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt blurred that. I go to bars and the only time a male stranger acknowledges I exist is when they‚Äôre interested in whatever friend I‚Äôm with.

I‚Äôm working so hard to stay alive. Other parts of my life are a disaster right now, but the lack of companionship throughout my entire adult life just hurts the most. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this.

EDIT: fuck, man. Being a woman sucks ass so much. We‚Äôre not even allowed to be sad on the internet without manipulative, evil men trying to use the opportunity for sex.

If you have something to say, you can comment on this post. I‚Äôm at least mentally stable enough to see how fucked up it is that guys see this as a dating ad. I just wanted to be with people that could relate to my pain, not people who see my hurt and go ‚ÄúI can work with this.‚Äù Your interest in messaging me is manipulative and gross and only adds to my sadness because your interest in me is LITERALLY founded in what you can take from me.

they only want to see me suffer, and they'll start by torturing me slowly. the only way they can do that? brainwash my boyfriend into thinking i'm going crazy so he'll break up with me.

"I've got 2 exams for my mortgage and protections qualifications tomorrow and Friday. This is the final hurdle to get qualified and be positioned to start working with my dad to take over his business. 


My dad is terminally ill at 60, and when his cancer returned he asked me if I'd train to take on his business that he has built up over years and years. It was just his brother and himself working there but my uncle retired last year so he is solo and doesn't want it to go to waste once he has to step down. So I took it on and pivoted from my own pursuit of growing my fledgling gardening business to a sudden halt and change of direction to do this both for his legacy and my future prospects. I've studied for months and gained the first part of qualifications with this being the final 2/3rds of it to be able to work in the business. I've come back to the UK after being in Ireland with my wife (we moved there when her own father was terminal to support her mum etc), so I'm here in Scotland for my last few weeks revision and exams. 

Since arriving I've mentally and physically dive-bombed and spiralled. I've not been capable of studying properly or consistently as I planned, I've let my nutrition slip greatly and lost lots of weight that I can't afford to, my insomnia is amplified and colluding with my anxiety, stress and low moods to the point where I'm barely functioning. I've had 2 nights in the last week that I've not slept until about 9am and I am feeling so utterly lost and overwhelmed with the pressure of getting past this exam and all it represents. I'm racing against time against my dad's cancer and I simply have to get this done and begin the transition ASAP before his health fails to the point that he cannot work at all and be there to supervise me as is part of the necessary process to be allowed to run the business (I need 6months supervision once qualified to be eligible to run solo). So there is a very meaningful and powerful rationale for being motivated to study and pass these exams, yet I've failed miserably at giving myself a good chance at doing so. 


I've slipped massively into a bad mental space, I'm not doing anything right for myself, both body and mind, and I'm on a collision course with failure. I've spent much of the last 2 weeks here in bed, avoiding life, my studies and feeling entirely consumed with anxiety and depression. I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen yet it has. I'm away from my wife and pillar of support and main source of external regulation. She believes in me and says I'm dojng great and she's proud of me etc but I feel so much guilt and shame when she does because I know I've fallen so far and am letting everyone down. I tell her that I'm not managing to study and when I do rally to open the books that I cant force myself to stick to it for long before I get saturated and feel like nothing is being learned. I turn a page and don't know what I've just read when I reflect on it. My memory and recall is shot, and I know why and that not only am I not helping myself by practicing self care, drinking water, sleeping well, eating regularly and well, exercising, going outside to get done sun and air etc, but I'm also making it much harder through the neglect of myself and health. The sleep has been a nightmare and constant battle. I'm using melatonin, started to try 5htp this week, and nothing I do can override the presets of my nocturnal mind. I'm so very fucked and really don't know what I'm going to do if I can't find a path back to balance and break above the darkness I'm being shrouded by. 

Thanks. Just needed to vent and get this out my head to alleviate some of the obsession of thoughts since they're just building inside my head all the time.",3,adhd

They‚Äôre no threat but it seems my whole life is part of one big defense. I flinch at knocks on my door, I‚Äôm always scuttling to the door/window every-freaking-time a car so much as passes my place.

I hate taking naps, even far before my anxiety has become a regular thing, I always hated the feeling of waking up and feeling confused and tired all the same. 
In the morning typically I have the most energy depending. I‚Äôll get up stretch do my morning routine eat, then play some games if I have nothing to do starting out the day. After a good hour or so of playing i‚Äôll get this overwhelming sensation of tiredness or something. Most people seem to be able to recognize the way they feel and go and do something to counter act that feeling. I usually spend too much time trying to identify why I feel that way. 
If I attempt to lay down and watch a movie with my family i‚Äôll also get this feeling halfway through the movie of just some sensation of tiredness, and it seems to take a while to shake it off. 
The only time I don‚Äôt overthink as much as to why i‚Äôm feeling this way is at work, I work in retail on the sales floor and I close. So usually i‚Äôm recovering and moving quite a lot, I often don‚Äôt feel the tiredness until i‚Äôm on my break sitting down for the first time in hours. I don‚Äôt tend to overthink it though because it seems to be the only logical time to feel that tired, so I guess the reassurance works easier there.

I'm guessing you are heading to the comments suggesting that I go see a therapist or talk to parents, friends and or other family members about it, but I wont. You see, therapi is a scam (I can't even afford to go, even if I wanted) and I don't believe that it would help me, it might help for some, but i doubt it would for me... The therapist prob would just give me some anti depression medicine and throw me out to the world again. Therapi useually just makes you get a view from other angles, it can't solve problems with the world which makes me depressed... You can't trust the therapist either, he/she doesn't actually care about you in an emotional way, the therapist just cares about you working in the societiy and not killing yourself, heck they even sometimes be sending you to psych wards, that sh\*t would just make me more depressed. Meanwhile, when it comes to friends/family, I feel as it none of them could relate to my problems and once my feelings are all in the open, it would just make it more awkward to be around them, they be scared do anything wrong. I don't want it to be that way, it's better if I just put on my fake act of being happy, all tho it's painful for me...

&#x200B;

I wont go too much into my depressive issues, cuz there is way too much wrong, and I have accepted that there is no way be happy nowa days (other than anti depressive meds, but I don't wanna have fake happiness). Being happy = lying to yourself about reality, and that is something I just can't do... I bet most of ya'll would prob just skip it all anyways.

"Bare with me, this is going to be looong!

My background:  I grew up in a dysfunctional family. My parents always fought growing up. I think I saw them once or twice as a child being nice to each other. 99% of the time they were fighting and being loud. Idk why but that used to scare me, & I would go hide somewhere. I used to hate myself for wanting them to get a divorce. I never understood why they were together. Also, my mom is very manipulative. She used to feed me lies about everyone close to me, even my dad. She would tell me he doesn‚Äôt want me, and he wants other kids.

Anyways, I‚Äôve been married for over a year now ( I had known him a year prior to that). Our honeymoon was a disaster. We fought all the time. It used to bother me that he would check out other women ( I told him I don‚Äôt care if you do it, as long as you don‚Äôt do it when I‚Äôm around). He said I‚Äôm disrespecting him and he does not checking out women üôÑ).

It all started when he asked me why I‚Äôm still friends with some of my old exs, & he said he‚Äôs not in contact with his exs, and that he deleted all their contacts. I was like are you sure? And asked to check his phone. At the time I only knew of one ex. He tried to trick me by pretending he left his phone in the other room (gave himself time to change her name). When I confronted him, he still had her pictures on his phone, he said he freaked out and just didn‚Äôt know what to do. 
3 weeks later, I found out her younger sister called him. My husband is a Doc, and the ex is a PA. Apparently, the sis called to ask my husband about a ‚Äúsick a relative‚Äù. And he asked the sis about how his ex is doing, and what she‚Äôs up to now. (He said i thought it was the nice thing to do). He claims he told the sis he‚Äôs married now. Eventually, I told him this has affected my trust, and asked him to consider couples therapy. I really hate being lied to. 

Shortly before we start therapy, I told him it‚Äôs important for me that you delete pictures of your ex-romantic partners. He was against this idea; ‚Äúthese are memories I want to keep, to look back at‚Äù. Through the therapist, he was somewhat convinced that it‚Äôs a good idea to delete pics of his exs. 

A month goes by, and I had a mini surgery. He was taking care of me over there weekend, since I was heavily medicated. I felt he was acting odd. Few days later I asked him what was going on, he tells me he felt resentment towards me because he had to lie to meü§î. It makes no sense!
Also, turns out, that Saturday! he created a ‚ÄúTrash‚Äù folder on his laptop, with all their pictures. But he never deleted it. I felt really sick. Because a week prior to that he said he deleted everything. Another lie. I felt the need to leave the house, and ended up staying in a hotel that night. I thought maybe I was being overly dramatic, so I went back home & realized he wasn‚Äôt home. (At that point he knew why I left). 

I came back the next day, and we talked it out. I asked him where he had been that night, he said I was home all night. 3 days goes by, I kept telling him I know you weren‚Äôt home. On the the third day I explained to him that I came back so I know he‚Äôs lying. He suddenly remembered he had to go back to the hospital.( it‚Äôs something he has never done before, nor after).

He told me many times that he has no feelings for her. He told me he actually broke up with her, because his friends told him if you don‚Äôt see a future with her you should let her go, and not use her. Her claims there were no emotional feelings towards her, it was just the physical part for him. However, as I glimpsed over their messages I read that he sent her ‚Äú...this was very hard on me...‚Äù. Also, he had dated others after her.

I just knew I couldn‚Äôt trust him, so I purchased a tracking device. To see if I can catch him going somewhere, up until now, I haven‚Äôt caught him going anywhere crazy.

Also,  I recently found out, this whole year, we had been driving by his Ex‚Äôs house (same PA ex) almost every weekend on our way home. He claims it‚Äôs a ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù. I noticed he would look into that house ALL the time! & if the car windows are down, he would shut it as we drive by. (Before researching the house, I had asked him if he used to live there, or if he knew someone that lived there, he said ‚ÄúNO‚Äù). Continued to drive by until I confronted him with my findings. He claims he doesn‚Äôt know if she still lives there or not. And that I was making a big deal out of nothing.

He deleted all his messages has his phone set up to delete messages every 30 days now. I still feel my trust has been shattered. I don‚Äôt truly believe him, I just pretend that I do as to not fight. 

When we are not intimate for more than a week, I always assume he‚Äôs cheating on me.I‚Äôve this fear that he‚Äôs cheating on me, and I‚Äôm just dumb and can‚Äôt see it. There were two instances where I found hair strands that weren‚Äôt mine. I just really don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm actually going crazy, and over exaggerating this whole thing...or if I should be worried.

"For 8 years now I have been playing video games as my main source of entertainment. Gaming does something for me that movies and TV shows haven't really been able to achieve. I would say it's the immersion and flexibility of the stories in video games that I really like in comparison. 

Around 2021 though I got progressively more burnt out of videogames. This was around when I played through all campaigns of Halo: MCC on Heroic difficulty. I felt pretty good and played a bunch of multiplayer. I didn't really have anybody to play with on that game, so I got bored after a while (110 hours). I noticed afterwards though that I would spend more and more time on the library screen, scrolling through trying to figure out what would be a good game to play next. It got to a point where I got stressed by the scrolling and zoned out on Youtube. 

It wasn't all bad though, it gave me more opportunity to discover more hobbies and activities. I've been more social, I drew more art, and I recently discovered a love for directive writing. What bugs me nowadays though is that I would still have moments where I really wanted to play a game, but I would just scroll though and end up not playing anything. The only opportune times I played a video game was when my friends were playing a game on Steam or Roblox and I joined them for 1-3 hours. 

There's many reasons I have come up with too on why I'm so burnt out on games, not finding the right genre, not playing with the right groups, shying away from stranger players on MMOs. Those are some of the surface issues that I have with games, and it's not the lack of games that bother me, but rather I think it's an issue with really getting into the game that I'm playing. I've struggled recently to invest myself into a game, and it's caused me to close the game in the mid stages of a campaign or a storyline. 

Recently I tried playing RP and MMO games, but I notice that in those games I get really shy, even more so then in public, (it mostly stems from toxic players online). I also got hooked onto Dwarf Fortress for a bit, getting invested in it's complexity, but then I got bored of it too, unprompted and without reason. 

I'm hoping that I can find a spark sometime for games, I feel that it fulfills me emotionally and it sharpens my strategic, perceptive, and reflexive skill. If anyone here on this forum knows/feels gamer burnout too let me know, I'm still semi-fresh on my own super powers :) .",1,autism

My younger sis who is only one year younger is graduating in a month and I want to go because I love her and I am proud but I don‚Äôt know if she even wants me to go she never said anything about grad to me (she is technically only my half sister and she lives with our father same with all his other kids except me I live with my mom who I have more half siblings) I mean we get along and i really do care for her but I hate myself so I started pushing everybody away by not taking as much to anyone and I don‚Äôt think I even deserve to ask if she wants me to go but I also don‚Äôt what her to hate me for not going and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. She‚Äôs one of the only reasons I still am here to this day but at the same time I don‚Äôt want her to feel guilty if she doesn‚Äôt want me to go,2,depression
"They're everywhere. I've had like two today. All the time. They've been more frequent this week.

I'll be wondering about a certain thing, and I'll run into countless random references.

So I have been using many different medicine to help with my anxiety and depression but none worked great and I had terrible anxiety attacks randomly. But now I'm using a new medicine at 300 mg a day and it really does help with my anxiety. I finally feel like a normal person but the thing is idk what to do now. ƒ∞t's been roughly 2.5 months since I have started to use this medicine and it's effects are getting lower I can kinda feel it. I wanna get rid of my eating disorder and be able to lose weight but it just feels impossible. I also feel my rage level going higher at certain times in the day. I will be talking about these with my doc but idk what to do. I'm also already using smt to stop me from hurting myself but it's not that effective tho my hurting myself is only pulling on my skin in my certain parts of my body (hands etc.). I just wanna be someone who can be a part of this population. I wanna be able to function by myself. I wanna have smt I'm interested in. I enjoy nothing and I have no future plans or dreams. All I want to do is having no responsibility and dying.,2,depression

"I was diagnosed and medicated in kindergarten, thanks to my mom being a specialist. I never knew any ‚Äòstruggle‚Äô associated with my school career. I excelled in elementary and middle school, and ‚Äòlearning‚Äô was nothing more than just arriving at school, doing work, and then going home. I never really studied or saw the deeper meaning of an education.

When I went into high school, I had no reason to change my ways. And I started to get horrible grades. I couldn‚Äôt understand the concepts, I had no scheduling or organization skills, and more importantly, I had no ethic to get shit done. Because I never needed those things.

Every time I try to independently look into a topic outside of school (for example, trigonometry today), my brain crashes again and again into an obsidian wall, and I get frustrated. I know that education is something that I can do. But it‚Äôs been heavily stained by these experiences.

My last day is tomorrow, and I‚Äôm graduating later this month. My peers are accelerating rapidly towards job applications, prestigious colleges and the like, but I‚Äôm sat here struggling to understand trigonometry.

Everything I do embarrasses me. I wonder what I have done to deserve this. I wouldn't be typing this if I hadn't seen someone I used to know. I wonder how it was so coincidental that I was parked next to them. As soon as they got out of there car my heart dropped to my stomach. When they got back to their car they took a picture right Infront of the window I was sitting by. They were happy and smiling with a friend. While I sat there like a loser with no one. I have no friends. They could try to fight me and then convince everyone I did something wrong. I feel like a joke and an idiot. Why did I have to see them today in the spot I chose.

"This is fairly new to me but I‚Äôve been dealing with ongoing anxiety and panic disorder and am looking for some information from others who deal with the same that might help. 

In therapy today, after telling my therapist about a panic attack I had yesterday, she said it sounds like my nervous system is very unregulated and very much in ‚Äúfight‚Äù mode (in fight or flight). This is the first time I‚Äôve heard of this and have a few questions.

Is that something that happens in the moment or is it in a constant state of being unregulated?
Is there a way to regulate it again for good?
Do I need to rest and reset or keep pushing through and putting myself in uncomfortable situations? Feels like I shouldn‚Äôt avoid stuff but also feels like my body needs a break.
Is a panic attack an unregulated nervous system or is generalized anxiety? Or both?
Any success stories of those who used to be in constant ‚Äúfight‚Äù mode?

"Hi‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm a F23 with two troubled parents, I have BPD, my mom has ADHD and my dad was just diagnosed w schizophrenia today, he is 42 years old and has always been depressed and dissociative ever since I can remember. He begun having manic / psychotic behaviour beginning 2018. 

He is highly intelligent and sensitive, loves movies, music, video games and the cosmos. 

I want to be there for my dad. I want to know how it has been for those of u who are diagnosed to have ur condition and what to be mindful of. I also do have a few friends who are sc and I want to be as mindful as possible of what I can do to help when they are very triggered. I always make sure to ask them myself what they need too ofc in a soft manner.

I just got the ¬´news¬ª of his final diagnosis today, though he started experiencing drug induced (Ritalin / Amfethamine / Weed ) psychosis in 2018 and ever since then was he ever the same.

Up until now I thought he might be autistic with isolated incidents of drug induced psychosis‚Äô that turned to the psychosis lingering for years after.

In his very intense episodes he mostly sees demons and wants to fulfill some sort of prophecy, and / or he thinks he‚Äôs being followed and is suspicious of everyone but me and my grandma.

I remember him as being calm, witty, sensitive and smart my whole childhood / young adulthood leading to 2018. Though, apparantly whenever he was ill I would stay at my grandma‚Äôs house and she would tell me he had a fever or stomach bug instead.. 

Since 2018 he has been aggressive, accusive, he breaks things (electronics, his windows and walls). He was recently forced to sell his apartment because he‚Äôs been screaming a lot, and broke things constantly and I guess my worry now is will he with his diagnosis and finally getting the right medication be able to lead a good life again?

I don‚Äôt want to be insensitive to my dad but I really miss the way he used to be so much, we were best friends and talked every day pre 2018, and I guess I thought there was a possibility that he would go back to his ¬´normal¬ª self again but I now understand that he has actually always been like this and I actually just never knew. He has been in a good psychiatric hospital for half a year now and after careful observation they finally diagnosed him 

I am curious to hear from those of you who have been diagnosed with sc yourselves in your later years and how it affected you. Also those who have sc parents and how it has been for u.‚ù§Ô∏è",6,schizophrenia

First of all, let me start off by saying that I‚Äôve had OCD for quite a while; therefore, I get all kinds of crazy thoughts. However, recently I‚Äôve developed thoughts about me being harmed for bizzarre causes.
For instance, this week I received a friend request by this guy with a blank profile picture on instagram and rejected it. He then sent it again, and I blocked him. 
Whenever things like this happen, I always get scared that someone is trying to harm me somehow. The most annoying part to me is this feeling of vulnerability‚Ä¶I just feel like I‚Äôm scared of everything, and I would like to simply live life without having to feel fear constantly.

"I have begun to think that my anti christian beliefs have been being programmed into me from the age of 10 through a government mind control program that targetted me specifically because my mother was a very good christian very religious went to church every sunday didn't drink no sex outside of marriage didn't dress like a man didn't spare the rod (Though this one is somewhat arguable sometimes I think I have issues because she never properly beat me with a paddle/branch/didn't put enough force into it. As much as I dislike my father I probably would have turned out better had I lived with him and I believe my brain knows this.)anyway I am convinced the government was afraid of the power this may have given me had my mindset been correct. I believe there have likely been multiple people that would have risen up and made america believe in god again that the government has targeted to turn them into the opposite, typically the children of very religious people or pastors.  Recently however I have begun to realize what they have been doing to me for 10 years- it wasn't the devil. It was the government, though not much of a different. For this reason they have ramped up their interference and are making their presence KNOWN to me.",5,paranoia
"I am currently in a very deep major depression, . I was okay for a long time but now I am at a point I had already been 15 years ago. I find myself planning how to escape. I know I need help and I was actively trying to, but there are some points that don't work out. I am so tired of trying. I need more meds and I start questioning if a life on meds is worth the struggle.
This morning I already had a panic attack and I cried. And I need to sort my thoughts and give them space so that's why I am here, writing. I did some awareness excercise to calm down amd afterwards I started thinking in circles what a mess this is. It is getting harder to get out of the circling thoughts. And how shall I go for a walk when I can't open the frontdoor to step out? When I try progressive muscle relaxation I find myself all tensed up.
I feel bad for just sitting with a coffee and not being able to do normal stuff, feeling guilty for not being functional. And all I can do is concentrate on breathing. 
And there are the thoughts that everyone around just things I don't want to, not believing that I can't and yes through all this I can't... I additional don't want because it feels exhausting to only think about. I know I can feel better, I know It won't stay like this, I know I have to be patient and accepting and nice to myself, but my whole life experiences work against me and I just want to give up.
Is it okay to just do the absolut minimal things? Is it okay to just sit and stare and cry? 
How do you give yourself a friendly hand, when you hate yourself for being sick? Because all you ever heard is that you are weak not sick. Sometimes it even hurts to breath. I am holding on. But I don't want to. How do others cope with this I can't and I don't want anymore?",2,depression

"I have a persistent belief that my neighbors are spying on me with hidden cameras in my living room and maybe other places in the house. Rationally I have tried to believe that they had some sort of device in their house that can make out images of the inside of my house. I read that this belief is extremely common with people that suffer from Schizophrenia. However, the other day something that I believe happened to me concerning my neighbors has left me as confused as ever. 

For many years when I masturbate, I do it as if I am a woman. This means that I act as if I am a woman. I do not cross-dress but I do act as if I am Demi Moore from Striptease, Elizabeth Berkeley from Showgirls. When I see an attractive woman on television like Faith Hill during her NBC NFL opening, I like to act as if I am a woman, that I have the body of a woman and that usually allows me to ejaculate. This started probably when I was a teenager when I was admiring my butt in the mirror. I even use to joke to the few friends that I had growing up that I was a lesbian trapped in a man‚Äôs body. 

The problem that I have with my neighbors is that when I do the things, they appear to have a way of arriving and leaving from their house in strange 10 minute, 20 minute, Hour rituals. So let us say I ejaculate at 5:13pm. Say someone is at home at his or her house. At 5:23pm, a neighbor 10 minutes later will arrive or a neighbor already inside the house will leave 10 minutes later! Overtime this same thing has occurred 20 minutes later, A full hour later, 5 minutes later (this also appears to happen a lot when someone is about to arrive at our house they will show up five minutes before they arrived). 

Strangely, when this happens lately I have noticed what appears to be police sirens going off in the same matter. Therefore, it has caused me not to masturbate even when I should. I believe that it is not all legit and that these same neighbors along with other people routinely seen in my neighborhood could very well be involved. 

I need to know if this is all real or imagined and why I‚Äôm feeling this way.",5,paranoia

I have to be onest, i am very afraid of the possibility of a misdiagnosis. I feel so weak and tired every day. I used to run almost every day and now i can bearly do it at all. I feel light headed 24/7. I feel like I'm wasting away day by day. Can depression really do that? I am afraid my doctors missed something...

"I have been working in Sales for coming up to 10 years now. During that time i have struggled with Social Anxiety and Imposter Syndrome to varying degrees. At its best, i can just about manage to control it, at its worst it severely impacts my ability to articulate myself, communicate with colleagues/customers and focus on what i need to get done in any given day (I procrastinate a lot through the overwhelming feelings of the tasks at hand). I foolishly believed at certain milestones in my life/career that i would reach a point where my anxiety would dissipate but this is yet to happen for me. 

I am at an Industry event tomorrow where there will be lots of my current colleagues, people i know from other companies in the industry and of course prospective customers. 

My anxiety is playing havoc at the thought of this as i hate the expectation to ‚Äòperform‚Äô that these events bring. I feel like i am not good at small talk or that people won‚Äôt want to listen to what i have to say. I overthink what i want to say (i almost always play conversations out in my head) and think that the people who do speak to me are judging me and end up inevitably losing interest.

Having said all of the above, i am trying to get better at managing these feelings of anxiety and reframing my perception of them (It won‚Äôt be the end of the world, if i f**k up, will it?) to try and control it to the point where i can get by.

"Yup. I'm just a shadow of the man I used to be.   
I can't find happiness in my life. I just can't. No matter how much I try, my demons will always get me and drag me down. I have a lovely and supportive wife, a small dude - I love my family, but instead of feeling happy, I'm constantly worried about them. About their health and well-being. This constant health axiety  and ovewhelming  saddnes is affecting my family - I can see that, I see my wife even though she is helping me as much as she can, is alredy tired and fed up with my constant worries. It also affects my little dude - he can see that daddy is not happy, and worried, so he starts to show same behaviour as myself - he is also starting to worry about things he shouldn't.   
I am on anti-depressants (lexapro 10mg) and they were working really good, but since last week or so, I feel they completely stopped doing their job - how is this possible?  
  
I left my home country 20 years ago, and I just missed my home, all the stuff I know, love and understand. I am in an English-speaking country, and I can communicate easily, I can have small chats, and so on; but so what, if I can't have a social life - as I don't understand nuances of the language, phrases and jokes? I don't have a social life at all actually. It's just home, work, home, work.    
  
All I do is just exist, I feel empty, like a husk and I am not the same person I was 20-30 years ago - I was full of life, I had friends, I was chatty and happy. Now, it's just white hair, a tired face and bad emotions. Just overwhelming sadness. I need to change it, I know - but I don't even know where to start, how to start.",2,depression

And I keep asking myself why I am so impossible and where is the line, when is it still normal and when is it a prelude to depression.  Does this happen to you too?",2,depression
"I just don't know anymore. I feel like I have tried everything. Things just don't seem to be getting any better. I've been depressed since I was 13 or 14. I'm 36 now. I often think about a teacher I had in highschool who told me things would get better. He lied. There's not a day that passes where I don't think of ending my life. The meds help and then they don't and so I switch..rinse and repeat. I've tried making friends but nobody is really interested. I know they think I'm weird or ugly or something idk.

I'll be 40 in four more years. And I have accomplished nothing. I still live at home with my mother and everytime I come out of my room I can see the disappointment on her face. My 13 year old nephew asked me one day: ""how are you 36 and still live with your mom? I was so mortified. I didn't know what to say. He's right. I'm a terrible example. I feel like such a waste of space. Often times when something tragic happens on the news where people die, I wish that I could have taken one of there places so that they could keep on living.

On top of it all I have anxiety and it makes me paranoid. People are either talking about me, laughing at me or out to get me in some way. I could never make friends online because I was terrified. I think I've been lurking on reddit for almost eight years and I just made my first post a few months ago. Ridiculous! Why am I so scared? I love video games but avoided online ones bc I was too scared to play with strangers.

I quit everything. Every job I get, project, hobbies, everything. I took me 14 years to get through college! It's so hard to keep my room straight. I have too much stuff and refuse to throw it all away bc it's all I have. I don't have anything else. It makes me somewhat happy but at the same time I'm drowning in stuff. I just wish I could restart. But at this point it just one step forward and two steps back. This post is all over the the place. Sorry.",2,depression

"This is really one of the few only communities i feel comfortable posting this in; I've been suffering a lot, I've sacrificed my own mental health for these past few years to be a genuinely good person. I helped local homeless people by giving them a safe place to stay, do laundry, eat food, give them a contact for applying, etc and i've begun to realize the help ive done is negligible, none of them have I substantially changed their lives for the better, and in rare cases there are people that take advantage of my kindness and charity. I have taken in local feral kittens as a foster parent, but it hasnt reduced the overpopulation of cats, and the people who feed them. I have helped run a political organization, i networked and made other contacts, i wrote theory and did commissions so our org would get sponsers, only for it all to fall in on itself as other leadership fell into dogma and ideological division. I have made a nice community of friends online, but I have made even more enemies because of my convictions, untop of that as cool as internet friends are, by all intense and purposes, irl i am a hermit, i have no real friends near me, and it has made me feel emotionally isolated. My mental health doesnt get better whether im online or offline, and psychiatrists have betrayed my trust, choosing to target the voices i hear, even though they helped my mental health, rather than targeting my anxiety, anger issues, depression, insomnia, and nihilistic thoughts. Everything in my life has also just gotten worse, I'm extremely poor, and even worse now as my food stamps dropped. I have neurological conditions that are progressively getting worse, which has led me to applying for disability. My phone is going to shit, and i dont find happiness in the hobbies i used to find happiness in, and instead they cause me misery and stress. Also the enemies i have developed, were all once longstanding friends i used to have, who built trust up overtime, which id difficult with my bpd and other prior betrayals of trust, but many still betrayed me to stand with my former abusers, because they didnt like my backlash to him. They also have gaslighted me, minimized my issues as being online too much, even though im the only person in the community who has repeatedly left the internet for extended periods of time.

And to top it all off, because of my constant excommunication from leftist communities, and my low economic standing, theyve been able to do more for others than i have, even though i put more of my energy into it, which its good, except because of that, theyve been holding that over my head as well. They have done a lot to stain my image, and have made this a constant topic, simply to use me as a lolcow.

"I'm going to post this to a couple different places but I need help. 

So I finally decided to change therapists after:

‚Ä¢ She's continuously told me everything is in the past and to just ""let it all go""

‚Ä¢ Her advice for dealing with my agoraphobia and debilitating social anxiety is to just go to stores, stand in the aisle in the way, and just repeat to myself I'm okay.

‚Ä¢ To just get into the car and drive to clear my head (when I don't have a license and terrified of driving) 

‚Ä¢ Despite doing my intake, didn't know of my diagnoses and acted shocked when I had mentioned a hallucination (and tangent but also acted like a was a specimen or something) 

‚Ä¢ Told me that sometimes the people we love hurt us because they love us and that's okay

‚Ä¢ Told me I cant control anyone (i get that) and no one can control me or make me do anything. When I said I disagree having been SA'd more than once, she told me that I ""learned what I do and don't like"" and ""learned how to say no."" Which triggered me bad for the past month and has had me really messed up. 

After all this, the biggest thing is that I have (for pretty obvious reasons) have not been comfortable reaching out to her for support when I'm really struggling, so with much encouragement from my friends and family, I decided the next appointment I was going to talk to her about switching. 

She then no call no showed that appointment after I confirmed. (I did miss two prior to this from other appointments and honestly just couldn't get myself to go to the one immediately after the above.)

So we put in the change provider form with the secretary who understood... and then the therapist called and said that I can't change providers and if I don't see her than I won't be able to see my med provider. I'm freaking out and at a loss. It's taken so so long to get into the psych and now I feel like I'm being threatened because I want a new therapist and have ALWAYS been told that if it isn't a fit, we can change at any time. I don't know what to do. I feel so lost and hopeless, it's just affirming that they were out to get me anyways and that I'm just another paycheck. I can't handle losing my meds but I also can't handle seeing her any longer. My paranoia and anxiety has been off the charts since this. Everyone told me it'd be okay and I feel like I've been set up.",6,schizophrenia
"For the record, I am not diagnosed. Although I have been diagnosed with bipolar, BPD, ADD, pretty certain that I lie somewhere on the spectrum

I am currently stuck in a horrendous position in retail. Constantly with the ableism directed toward me simply because eye contact isn't my strong suit...

I want to get out bad, and while applying to other positions I would be interested and more comfortable in, I noticed that most of these places only do ONLINE INTERVIEWS

I am extremely uncomfortable in front of a camera, add the fact that I'd be essentially responding and speaking to the void while having to mask up and put on my ""happy face""

I PHYSICALLY cannot force myself to smile or pretend to be cheery on demand in front of a camera. It's so impersonal and cold. I get nervous and anxious just thinking about it

I just had a mini freak out because I put in 3 apps and all 3 want an online interview response. One of them too, I tried to ask for accomodations to interview in person rather. They denied it... Smfh

I either get no sleep or stress myself out so much that I pass out. 

Only thing keeping me from going even further down the hole is my dog who should flip if anything gets near the house but there are so many creaks and thumps and i swear i see shit in the corner of my eye by the massive windows in my room.

So, this constant hypervigilance and trying to lower my voice and just whisper instead exhausts me too much. I dont know what to do. I have had a psychotic break almost 3 years ago in the same apartment because of neighbors' talking about me and almost-psychological bullying behavior, and used antipsychotics for over 1.5 years to treat it; but didnt receive any other psychological guidance related to this. (These neighbors left, but I am always on the lookout for threats from other neighbors). Anyway, how do I manage this? Any tips? I want to feel comfortable, but just the fact that there exist neighbors all over, freaks me out and makes me so uncomfortable.",5,paranoia
"I‚Äôm not gonna give a long prefacing ramble, so let‚Äôs just get straight to the heart of the issue- I am paranoid that my dad drugs me in my sleep and possibly rapes me while I am drugged. Yes, I know, that‚Äôs kind of heavy. These thoughts come and go, but when they stick around I find myself becoming completely lost in them. I find it all so disgusting and terrifying and disturbing. My mind and body instantly become riddled with anxiety. I feel like I am constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown, because of how much this paranoia weighs on me.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt trust my dad, which is probably why I am paranoid in the first place. What makes it all worse is that I currently live with my parent‚Äôs, though I am trying to save up money to move out. I just feel so confused and stressed over this all. It‚Äôs like when I start having these thoughts my capacity for rational thinking and reasoning completely disappears, and I feel truly unable to discern reality from what sinister scenarios my mind has conjured up. 

My worst fear is that the drugging my dad is doing to me (supposedly, according to the paranoia) is going to give me permanent brain damage, and eventually my brain will be so damaged that I will be rendered a human vegetable, more or less. And then maybe I will no longer be functional enough to live on my own, and so I will be trapped, forced to live out the rest of my days with my parents while being in a nearly brain-dead stupor. Even writing all of this out right now is giving me massive amounts of anxiety. 

I don‚Äôt know where to turn next. I have a therapist, but I am worried that she will think I‚Äôm really mentally ill if I tell her these thoughts. I‚Äôm a generally competent and functional person in most areas of my life so I feel as if this paranoia is too ‚Äúout there‚Äù and dark to confess to her. But admittedly I also feel at my wit‚Äôs end, and I have this sense that if I don‚Äôt take action soon, I may end up in an even worse place than I already am. Sigh‚Ä¶I feel so scared.",5,paranoia

Everyone makes excuses for her, I made a post not long ago because I had an argument with her, got overwhelmed and she mocked me for it and I‚Äôm the one who got lectured. 

Today I had an appointment with my therapist who told me I should get my dog certified to be an assistance dog and when I saw my sister I told her about it. My dog is really intelligent he learns so many things easily and she told me he‚Äôs too stupid and would never be my assistance dog and then proceeded to grab him to get him away from me.

I‚Äôm not leaving the house for a while, as you probably know the economy is ass and I especially for autistic people who aren‚Äôt hired at jobs so can‚Äôt save up to afford an apartment, plus I‚Äôm still in school. So I don‚Äôt know what to do when I‚Äôm being disrespected like that.

I think what hurts most is that at her job she prides herself on ‚Äúbeing the one knowledgeable about autism‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing the most accepting‚Äù. But when it comes to me, I‚Äôm the annoying stupid childish sibling who says weird things and doesn‚Äôt have any real friends. I‚Äôve tried so hard to be a good sibling to her, I was like three years old when she was born and I already wanted to be there for her and care for her I actually remember that because that was such a strong emotion. So that makes me extra sad that all her life she never wanted to have anything to do with me, would always break my toys and say mean things and I would get yelled at just for slightly raising my voice. 

She only cares about autistic people when they‚Äôre her eight year olds gymnasts who she can boss around to do whatever she asks them to. Oh they‚Äôre so cute because they give her hugs and they‚Äôre tiny children with no agency! I guess adult autistic people aren‚Äôt as cute and are just stupid and annoyingly dysfunctional so they don‚Äôt deserve respect!",1,autism
"Lately my relashionship couple has become the mirror of all my personal failures. Less athletic, I struggle to find the motivation to take care of myself.

Usually I change the room to sleep somewhere else when we sleep at my girlfriend's place but it's impossible at my place having only one living room. I am very unhappy to snore. I miss some of my friends that are far from me (other countries) and it's make me feel sad and lonely, even though we share a lot through messages. I feel that I can't recharge socially to be able to boost myself on the work side. On a professional level, I often feel put aside by some of my working mates who keep me away from certain projects, probably because I am a bit too critical and I bring them more problems than solutions.

"I was recently playing a tabletop RPG, playtesting my own system I'm working on. While playtesting a new rule I had added, my brother got very frustrated about the new rule after losing a roll to another player. He claims I interrupted him. I'm not sure if I did before he started yelling, as I was trying to explain that the changes he was recommending were something we already tested and rejected in a session he didn't attend.

I definitely interrupted him as he was yelling, asking him ""Will you listen?"" I raised my voice slightly in exasperation and to be heard, but didn't approach his volume. I don't think it's disrespectful to interrupt someone shouting to intimidate you to ask them to calm down, though it probably isn't effective. His response was to get louder, shouting ""NO I WILL NOT LISTEN"" and continuing on a tirade that lasted maybe 30-40 seconds. Myself and the other five players went deathly silent. When he finally stopped talking, I said I'd have to reconsider that part of the system and moved on to something else because I could see that everyone was uncomfortable and just wanted to get back to the gaming.

The next week, I wrote him a note expressing how unacceptable that was to shout me into silence. I tried to set a personal boundary in that note, and it enraged him. He called it an ultimatum (pasted word for word below this paragraph), and I can see why he might call it that. It was my first attempt at a personal boundary, so I don't have a lot of experience with this.

*If another such outburst occurs in any game in the future, that will be the last game I play with you. I‚Äôm playing to have fun, hang out with friends, tell an interesting story, and in the case of last week‚Äôs playtest, I wanted to try out various systems and changes for my own game. Outbursts like that make all of those things impossible.*

Of note, he declared angrily many years ago that we would never play a competitive game together again after I beat him in a game of Dominion. He claims I gloat when I'm winning and whine when I'm losing, but I think that's more of a product of his perception than my behavior, as no one else has ever raised this concern. We still play cooperative games, but I often find if we start struggling or lose the game, he starts criticizing my gameplay, either immediately or in the car ride home.

He has interpreted the above italicized statement in two ways. First, he accused me of trying to dictate what he could do and deny his rights. I view it as telling him I won't put up with being silenced, and he has no right to do that to me.

Second, he hasn't said this out loud, but I believe he interpreted this as me trying to kick him out of our gaming group. If I wanted to do this, I could have simply called for a vote to kick him out over the shouting. Instead, I suppressed my desire to immediately declare I would not play with him any longer, and thought about it for six days before writing my letter. I asked several of the players later, and they were all deeply uncomfortable.

He's gone on the offensive because of the note. He didn't even talk to me about the letter I wrote, bringing it to the next game session and forcing a two hour discussion about it with the others. I had no idea he was going to do this. He had what I can only describe as a predatory glare when he brought out the letter, stared at me, and said something along the lines of ""You think you can make an ultimatum to me? I'll show you what happens when you make ultimatums."" He hadn't said a word to me about the letter yet at this point, choosing instead to pop it on the entire group and try to paint me as the bad guy.

This is the second time he's had an outburst like this. He did it in a previous game, but because it was the first time it ever happened, I didn't know what to do, and we moved past it without a consequence.  There was no letter or even discussion about it, we just moved on. That was four years ago. I still didn't know what to do the second time, so I'm trying to put together a personal boundary statement to prepare for this in the future. He's only ever shouted at me, but I've seen him take an annoyed/angry tone in other games and our writing group if people contradict him. He hasn't shouted them down, but it wouldn't surprise me if those other folks had felt intimidated.

This is what I came up with after watching some videos and reading some mental health webpages. This is my first time ever having to do something like this, so any advice would be appreciated.

*This is me setting a personal boundary for my own health and safety. When you shout me into silence, I feel disrespected and intimidated. I cannot control your behavior, only how I react to your behavior. When you shout me into silence or otherwise intimidate me, I will repeat this boundary and ask you why you feel it is okay to silence my voice. I also reserve the right to walk away if I don‚Äôt feel safe or capable of engaging in respectful conversation.*

I appreciate your input. Thanks.",4,anxiety

Hi so I've noticed for a while now that whenever there's any sudden noises my head jerks forward. This happens often already whenever I'm extremely anxious about something underlying (which is always). But now instead of it just being a reaction to my anxiety it's started to happen with any noise. Like I'm at school right now in my art class and someone just dropped their paper which made a noise (it's Bristol paper so pretty thick paper) and my head jerked forward. This happens all the time but also not? Like it picks and chooses. I don't know if this is normal. Does anyone else experience this? Is this something I should mention to my therapist?,4,anxiety

"TW?? paranoia of course: afraid I‚Äôm being watched, thinking of being killed, suicidal & intrusive thoughts


I got really spooked by them and the first night was terrible. I was frozen in fear that someone was watching me in any dark corner of my room, watching my every move, waiting to kill me. That was three weeks ago. My sister has been kind enough to let me sleep in her room on the floor this entire time, but I still feel unsafe and scared. I feel like I‚Äôm seeing and hearing things that aren‚Äôt actually there. Not like hallucinations though, I don‚Äôt know how to describe it right now. 

Then I saw another tiktok on my fyp a few days ago (I don‚Äôt want to go into detail about what it was just for the sake of you all) and it genuinely screwed with my head even more than the first one. I cried for an hour on the floor panicking and my sister let me sleep on her bed for that night instead of on the floor and I calmed down a little. But this paranoia is still here. It wont leave. I‚Äôm having to force myself to stay up late even when really tired  to get to the point where I physically can‚Äôt keep my eyes open anymore and would fall asleep any minute so I can easily fall asleep without all these intrusive thoughts that someone is watching and waiting to k1ll me.. but at the same time, it‚Äôs painful to sleep because I‚Äôm so afraid I‚Äôm going to have nightmares about all of this. 

I haven‚Äôt had any paranoia before this really, but I do have GAD. But I‚Äôm assuming all of this is paranoia right?? I can‚Äôt get it out of my head and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to be like this forever now since it has been 3 weeks. People have said it‚Äôs normal to be spooked for a day or two by something, but for something to last this long and this intense there is probably a problem.. 
I don‚Äôt understand...we have a dog AND an alarm AND I‚Äôm in my sisters room. Why do I have to be like this? I feel so unsafe and it‚Äôs honestly to the point where I just want to kms so nothing has the chance to do it first. I already am suicidal as it is (but never would act on it) and this just makes it so much more intense I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just hope this is temporary, but is it possible that this literally just stemmed into my brain now and am going to be like this forever even though I‚Äôve never had any previous experience with paranoia?..",5,paranoia

"So, I'm pretty paranoid about health.

Today I had a 2 litre Pyrex measuring jug filled up. I took it out of the microwave and as it was very heavy and hot I dropped it about a inch or two onto the counter top by accident. It made a loud bang. I checked the surface to see if there was any cracks, but there was nothing major that I could see. However, after closer inspection I found a faint hairline scratch, I guess is what you would call it, on the outside of the jug. I can't be certain that it was there before.

Then tonight I inspected the inside of the jug and found very very faint hairline scratches and I don't know if that is from today.

My worry is that I'm going to absorb some of the glass when I cook with it through the hairline scratches. I feel like if I was a normal person then it wouldn't be a concern, but I am considering buying a new jug as precaution but I don't want to spend the money (that's another issue for another day).  


I'm trying to rationalize by saying if the food that I cook with has the ability to discolor the glass and grim can build up in between the microscopic glass particles then what's the difference between the hairline scratches and this as the glass always carries a risk of absorption, if this makes sense.  
If the glass particle compounds are the same on the outside as in the inside is there any difference? Maybe it's coated with a different compound.  
Also, let's say I do absorb some of the glass, does it really pose any risk?

"Single female living alone for first time. The walls are really thin hear and you can hear everything. Like last night I heard the guy below me watching porn.

""She's peeing""
""She's gonna take a shower""
""She's in bed""

"
	After being in college for two years I have been asked out three times. In the past since I was asked out over text I would sort of avoid the question and change the topic, but most recently I was asked out by someone I see very frequently as we are both in a relatively small major and typically have lots of classes together.

	Him and I have literally never held a conversation and I really don‚Äôt know what to do. He‚Äôs sweet but not really my type, but more importantly I have absolutely no interest in dating, and hanging out with people one-on-one is a literal nightmare for me. I don‚Äôt think I have ever hung out alone with a guy in my entire life. I don‚Äôt talk to people often in class and I never hang out with people outside. I‚Äôm basically a shut in‚Ä¶

	He has texted me every day for the past week and I had been able to put off agreeing to hang out with him because of legitimate reasons, but now it‚Äôs just getting too much, and I‚Äôm running out of excuses. In the past when I guess I essentially ghosted people, I always felt like shit because I know if I were In their position I would be really upset. 

	I know the easiest thing would be to just say I‚Äôm not interested but the fear of awkwardness of seeing him every day for the rest of my time in college is overwhelming. When I asked my friends (who don‚Äôt know about my anxiety issues) for advice they said I should just hang out with him once so he‚Äôll stop asking. But I just know I‚Äôll be awkward and probably end up having a panic attack when I come home. Plus what if he ends up asking again? My friends think it‚Äôs stupid that this is even a concern of mine and I can‚Äôt really turn to them anymore for help because I‚Äôm worried they think I‚Äôm trying to boast or something 

	Sorry this post is a bit of a mess but every time I think about the situation ship I feel like I‚Äôm five seconds from a panic attack. And sorry if this seems like a stupid worry, I guess that‚Äôs sort of the point though",4,anxiety

"I don‚Äôt know how to keep on

Hey Guys,
First off all: Sorry for the length and my english grammar (should have went to school more often back then lol).
I‚Äôm suffering from a very specific issue for almost 2 years now and it slowly took possession of me. To give u a little background information i was (at least the way I see things) a very bad person in my teenage years. I did awkward things to gain attention from people and to get ‚Äúcool‚Äù. I bullied people, i went out drinking in parks with bad people, i did drugs etc. and just acted so goofy. In this timeline some people from around my town started laughing at me, took pictures from me in the bus without no clear reason and I experienced a lot of very specific issues which, since they happened i‚Äôm constantly feared of. After I finished this first phase of anxiety things went quite well till I got encountered again. People I didn‚Äôt knew were yelling my name. So I was starting to ask myself again why those people would shout my name, what they may know about all those awkward things I did etc. At this point, I was hyper aware of every person walking by and as soon as I thought people were watching me I felt anxious and started to panic. I even feel people are standing in front of my house in order to wait for me in order to just make my life terrible. I‚Äôm not quite sure if this really happens but I‚Äôm constantly looking for signs which may were left for me in order to make me feel bad. From this point, I just feel followed everywhere I go, I‚Äôm feared that people know me and i didn‚Äôt went out with my friends for 1 year. I‚Äôm pretty much stuck in my room isolating myself. I went to a therapist who diagnosed me with depression. I tried to take the advice from my therapy but I‚Äôm just too feared to do anything. I‚Äôm even scared to sit in my own backyard because people could notice where I live and follow me. I just hate myself for what I have done and I can‚Äôt get over my old me. Slowly, suicidal thoughts added up. I feel unable to take serious actions against this. I also talked to my friends about this issue but it seems as they don‚Äôt really taking me serious plus i don‚Äôt want to annoy them every time we see each other. I don‚Äôt even eat while the sun is up because I‚Äôm feared people could see me through the windows. I was wondering if you guys maybe made similar experiences as I did.",5,paranoia

"Had to share this. Went through rejection.
As it is, have been a reserved, introverted socially awkard chap my whole life. I used to be in a military school for 6 years. Now I am 23.
Getting out of the military school and adapting to outside world was a tough thing but somehow got connected with some old friends from elementary school. Pretty nice people. These people pushed me to do a bit of socializing. I always stayed away from girls on my own. But during one of these sudden hangouts, I met this girl who is a jolly and friendly person, quite gregarious as well. Slowly fell for her though I got to meet her only twice. Let me call her 'P' for now. Then on, I texted her once in a while but nothing other than some casual conversations. I realized that I do have something for her but never knew how to go ahead or approach her. 'P' used to have a boyfriend who cheated on her and messed things up for her. 
Someday, I was asked by one of my friends to approach her but I didn't pay any heed to his words. Later on, I realized that I should give it a try by asking her out though I accepeted that most likely I will get rejected.
I decided to do this by writing a note and send it to her through a mutual friend of 'P'. I talked to this mutual friend (another girl) of her and explained this to her. She said it was quite a nice idea and be hopeful that it will be a 'yes' though I told her that I am not expecting such for reasons.
Then the note was handed over to 'P' and she said no. I was okay with it. But she added that she felt very uncomfortable because of this which basically makes me look like a creep.
Just these facts of unwillingly bothering someone I do like and getting passed on as a creep have messed me up from all possible ways. I feel like throwing up. Moreover, I don't know anyone to share this with. This happened two days ago. My exams are going on. Today while I went to attend my exams, a few minutes into it I realized I don't have any drive to finish the exam, all these intrusive thoughts engulfed my mind. I submitted the script with nothing on it. I am just horrified with the fact that this whole thing has started to affect other spheres of my life. Some friends have told me apologize to her (though I don't know how did I bother her), but the idea of reaching out to her again freaks me out. I don't know what's ahead. Some support and advice will be appreciated.
I pray and hope this happens to no one else again.",2,depression
"So I'll start by saying that I don't really have anyone I'd consider my friends, until I started working a new job and I become friends with some people and then we all became one group of friends.

They are only in my city for university and then are heading back home over summer, but will come back once university starts again. As it is their last week here, we all planned TOGETHER to go out and get drinks and have fun.

Which was supposed to be today, yet none of them are answering me back but I can see on snapchat maps that they are all together and active.

So basically my only ""real"" friends have just left me out and now I feel alone again. Actually more alone than before because I convinced myself these people actually liked me, but now I'm thinking they only pretended to like me.

I don't know what advice I want, maybe should I confront them about how much it hurt me that they just left me? Should I keep being friends with them and just ""move on"" from this? 

Thanks for any help.",2,depression
"For some reason, I have always latched onto nostalgia as a coping mechanism. Occasionally it's for my teenage years, more often than that I get nostalgic for my young child-preteen years. 
It's hard to explain, because even though I still had things to be unhappy about, I was content with how I perceived the world in my little kid brain. I wasn't corrupted by bad actors in my life, or exposed to evil. As an adult, my brain is so noisy and chaotic that I'm more of a homebody than anything. Being an adult with a drug/alcohol/gambling/anger problem is a much different animal and zaps of me any motivation to feel human. It kills the part of me that has imagination and creativity.  I used to be an open minded kid hungry for knowledge about things I didn't yet understand. Sometimes I'll put on an old movie or play a video game I used to like to peer into my little kid brain, but it's usually a very bittersweet feeling.

Sorry for the long rambling, hopefully my post connected with you in some way. Especially those who long to feel the innocence of being a kid again.",2,depression

"I have seen posts online that only confirm what I was fearing: a fair number of autistic women hate us autistic men. I wanted you guys to know how unbelievably heartbreaking and degrading it is for them to make generalisations such as ""most autistic men are creeps"" who ""harass and stalk women."" On one post, there were literally a thousand upvotes. Now imagine going through your whole life being called a weirdo and a creep. Why would you even talk to people? This causes many autistic men to just not speak and keep their mouths shut throughout teenage years and young adulthood - a key period for social and romantic skill development through trial and error. When they finally go to college and the workforce and try to get romantically involved with women, they end up demonstrating these traits of poor social development. On top of immense levels of bullying and rejection, we are now ""mostly creeps and weirdos who stalk and harrass women?"". The fact that they blame us for this shows how unbelievably un-empathetic they are towards us. Imagine I make a post about how from my experiences with autistic women, I feel like they are extremely dull, boring and creepy due to their poor posture, lack of social skills and weird, obsessive and clingy behvaiour. I would get downvoted to hell and people would call me out for making generalisations, even if I made the statement ""this doesnt apply to everyone"". It is so unbelievably unfair.

"i'm currently cat-sitting for a friend, and i stayed over today. wanted some toast to eat while watching tv, there's no toaster here, so i turned the gas stove on, which has like a middle griddle on it, which usually just has one big burner (my stove and most other stoves layout) but this stove has two burners, so i turned both on, changed my mind about the toast and just turned one off (this is what i'm used to since my stove has the one big burner) and forgot all about the other one, went to watch tv, felt tired, got in bed and as i was about to go to sleep i got super thirsty, went for a glass of water and realized i had left the one extra burner on for like 2 or 3 hours with the griddle on top, i obviously turned it off and instead of relief i freaked tf out which was followed by an unshakeable sense of dread and my mind just started racing with what-ifs: 

what if i hadn't gotten thirsty and left the burner on all night and burned down my friend's house, killed myself, her cats, the neighbors, the neighbor's kitten, what if i left it on and the flame somehow got extinguished and i killed myself and everyone in this building from carbon monoxide poisoning, the tamest one: what if nothing happened but my friend's gas bill came back at an exorbitant rate and she got super mad at me and stoped trusting me altogether.

mind you, stovetops have been a huge struggle for me since time immemorial, but being unmedicated (idfk know why since i was dx'ed pretty young), i've prided myself on becoming an insufferable controlling apprehensive heap of neuroses, because that's the only way i can cope with this ~~curse~~ disorder and not fuck everything up in my life in one millisecond, and yes, i do have some modicum of control over my life despite the adhd and mainly because of these neuroses that stemmed mostly from continuously and mercilessly self punishing whenever i fuck up since i have a memory. this is a double edged sword as you can see because i cannot stop ruminating on all the fucked scenarios that might have come from this and now i can't sleep even though i'm tired as hell and need to sleep because i'm in the middle of a major ibs flareup from too many stressors and sleep is much needed. 

 i just can not stop going over the same damn thing and hating myself about it and thinking about how i told my therapist i didn't feel fit for catsitting because i had preemptively thought about all the worst possible scenarios and she told me i was actually trustworthy and responsible and now this is a testament to the opposite and that i shouldn't have been trusted around the cats because i was obviously going to kill them and myself from being such a ditzy dumbass, as always.

"I feel like such an awful person because I was fired for insubordination and passive aggressive behavior. I worked at a preschool that had some skewed values. My bosses verbatim told me they believe in using micromanagement. I also asked my supervisor to please kindly not speak to me 
in a certain way, as she was beginning to be snappy and short. We had a great rapport at first and I felt comfortable expressing this. She became very power over. She replied ‚ÄúYou just need to nod your head and say ‚ÄòYes ok got it‚Äô‚Äù. I told her so nicely and it was just such a sudden change in her demeanor. I don‚Äôt work well with supervisors like that nor do most people. 

I was constantly told I‚Äôm inflexible for pointing out things many, many other people would frequently complain about. Things my bosses previously apologized for and said they never wanted to happen to an employee again they used against me. Such as, they said parents were complaining about a specific teacher that I also brought up to them, as did many other teachers. Then, they mentioned that in my firing that I was causing too many problems with that instance in particular. That makes no sense. Obviously a bullshit reason.

"I'm in art school, art was something I used to love doing, but in the past years i began losing my focus. I do less and less every day, be it school work or just personal art for my own enjoyment. Right now, finals for my 2nd year in uni are _weeks_ away and I have absolutely zero drive to work on anything. All I do is fixate on very short-lived obsessions for that dopamine rush, like certain games or movies. I dont have any aspirations. I have a burning need in me to _know_ things, to learn and experience and DO stuff. But i just... can't.

Recently, I began to realize some things are not actually in my control, and out of a last attempt at finding _why_ i couldn't escape from this hole I've dug myself into, I went to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with ADHD. I will start medication in a month, which _is_ progress and will most likely help in gaining some control and drive in my life... yet I cant help but overthink everything. The second i feel that terror and discomfort creep in, I dont even try doing any work. And due to toxic relationships in my life, and due to my previously undiagnosed ADHD, i have little to no trust in my own mind.

Here is where i feel i need an outside opinion. Whenever I'm in a conundrum, I start spiraling and end up with nothing but mush in my brain. Am I stopped by my condition, or am I letting myself be stopped? Do i have the power, actually, but its just very uncomfortable to overcome this struggle, or is this thinking the same one used by the toxic people in my life, to belittle my struggles and blurr my limits? Am I, by not trusting myself, reinforcing my insecurities, or blocking out the response I learned to throw _at_ myself as a punishment?

Am i pushing myself in this corner or just accepting ive been pushed here by other factors?

TLDR: I'm overthinking my every choice/ avoidance _of_ choice, cant tell if its more my fault or out of my control and I need an outside opinion in hopes that i can figure out what to do.

In a month she is shipping out to basic training and I‚Äôm just really scared because she‚Äôs a big role in my life.

She would stay after school with me while I‚Äôm at my track practices and always wish me luck on all my meets and tell me how I can accomplish anything. And she‚Äôs literally leaving soon and I‚Äôm just so happy for her but so sad that I won‚Äôt be able to see her again until a year or two later. At first I was fine since she wasn‚Äôt going to be active be now that shes decided that she is going to be active now and wants to travel which I love that for her but I just won‚Äôt be able to close to her anymore and it‚Äôs just so frustrating because she‚Äôs always there for me and now she won‚Äôt be around anymore.,4,anxiety
"I am desperately looking for help and advice. I am the caregiver for my mother living with schizoaffective disorder. My mom is young at 46 years old, was very active, and very stable on her medications prior to these additional medical issues. 

Winter of 2022, Mom sustained a back injury resulting in 4 rib fractures. These fractures are where the rib meets her spinal cord. She was bending over to tie her ice skates when she felt pops and pain. X-rays confirmed the breaks and the doctors assumed this was a one-off occurrence and told her to take it easy so she could heal. She ended up healing very slowly but the pain remained and increased.

She has been sent to an Endocrinologist, has multiple tests done for bone density/degeneration. Countless X-ray/MRIs. Pain clinics. Nothing came back conclusive and the doctor cannot provide an explanation.

Not getting an answer as to why the ribs broke has caused a spiral.

The past 15 ish months have been horrific. Words cannot express the absolute derailment that has happened. Everything from medical delusions, fears that her medical team is trying to kill her,  psychosis episodes, etc. I have not seen my mom this way since right before her diagnosis. I have been advocating for her, booking appointments, speaking with her doctors, etc.

In April, she broke 3 MORE ribs after bending over to tie her shoe. 1 was a re-break, the others were new fractures. Again, doctor has no answers. She has been checked for signs of self-harm and abuse. There are no bruising or anything indicating that is was self inflicted. SHE IS 46 YEARS OLD! Why is this happening? Her medical care has been severely lacking and I wont get into it on this post but IMHO I believe it is because of her disorder that her concerns have not been taken seriously. I know they have performed tests but that took a year for them to be ordered and over 30+ ER visits and many hours of advocacy. 

I have been doing research this whole time and after speaking with a schizophrenia advocacy group, they told me about a linkage between anti-psychotic medications and breaking bones.

**My main question is - Do any of you know about or have experience with anti-psychotic medications leading to unexplainable bone breaks?**

I am desperate to find answers for my mom and am open to any questions or advice. If you need some extra details please ask and I will provide what I can. I didn't want to make this post too long. Thank you in advance.",6,schizophrenia

"I've had very strong paranoia ever since I can remember. I used to be unable to sleep without my mum in the same bed because I was too afraid of ghosts. Sometimes I couldn't sleep even with her lying next to me.
I also sometimes get extremely paranoid when I wash my face that when I look up there will be someone behind me. This happened to me earlier this evening actually. 
Anything related to ghosts can make this paranoia worse. 
It's gotten slightly better as I've gotten older, but sometimes I still get the same fear and can't close my eyes at all, despite how tired or sleepy I might be. 
Location plays a big role in this, for example, in my home I generally don't have problems with this anymore, but I still am extremely paranoid when I'm staying at my mum's childhood home.
The frustrating thing is that I get these very vivid images in my brain of ghosts in doorways or in the reflection of the mirror, despite the fact that I generally can't picture things very well in my head.",5,paranoia

I try so hard to fight back but it always wins. everything makes my anxiety go crazy. If I hear a loud noise or if something is unexpected I get so anxious. I‚Äôm scared of my anxiety. something simple that makes me anxious makes me nauseous, heart race, feel like I can‚Äôt breathe, feel like I need to run away. I haven‚Äôt left my house in months. sometimes I cant even go outside. I constantly feel overwhelmed by everything. anytime I imagine myself going out to do something I imagine myself panicking. I never feel calm or relaxed. I feel emotionless all I feel is sadness and anxiety. I miss feeling happy and feeling excited. I feel like I don‚Äôt even feel love anymore. I miss my old self so much. and knowing the only way to get better is to do it myself is so scary. I don‚Äôt know how to get better. I feel like i‚Äôll never get better. I want my life back. I miss the things I used to do. I feel so useless now. I don‚Äôt understand why i‚Äôve gotten so bad. I feel so trapped in my head. I‚Äôm so negative all the time because nothing seems worth it anymore. I just feel so alone. I‚Äôm quite honestly scared.",4,anxiety
"Somewhere in my brain I know I'm extremely paranoid and because of anxiety and all the things that have happened in my life, I'm being careful about everything on a paranoid level. Yet I can't help it. Maybe after I write this post I'll realize that I'm getting crazy paranoid so I'll be a little better and delete this post.

My relative who lived with my aunt (my aunt's brother) and was financially dependent on her, suddenly died. At time of his death, my aunt was at home, she called ambulance but he was already dead. Deceased person was supposed to inherit a part of big house later (inheritence would be shared by him and her). He was around 50-55, suddenly got sick and died. Everyone says it was likely a heart attack, but because my aunt and her other family members said no one suspected a foul play, they refused further examination. It just hit me really weird the way she said ""examination doesn't matter as he can't be brought back to life anyway"", ""it doesn't matter whether it was heart attack or if he died of other natural circumstances"" and so on and she repeated it several times, very weird. (I know she's kinda right and it would be pointless and if I were in her position and innocent, I'd also think that... I'm just being paranoid again). 

Now I'm next person to potentially receive a share of that house (though I do not plan to do so cause I don't need it) and I think she might try to harm me assuming I'm right about the thing I wrote above. Thankfully I don't live with her and I barely ever visit her (and probably will never do it again, but if I do, I will not eat or drink anything). Though I suspect she will try to find a way, to make it look like an accident.

Soon it's my birthday and she might soon bring a cake by which she might try to posion me. I will not eat a single piece of it. 

Yeah now that I wrote it down I feel even more paranoid. I am not usually like this and I hope I'm not gonna get worse or anything. The worst thing is I kinda understand it but at the same time I can't help it, cause I think to myself ""I bet if you had told this to every person who got poisoned and killed before their death would have told you that this idea was just crazy"". 

Anyway, regardless of anything, I'm firmly decided on not ever eating or drinking anything from her. Yeah.

Pardon my paranoia and crazy paranoid brain. :)",5,paranoia

"I've been paranoid about everyone close to me for a while now, even my neighbours I've never met and random people that just walk by the house. I feel like they're all just keeping me around to fuck with me and make my life a living hell, without me even knowing. Like they're constantly posting on a social media account that I can't access that has all.of the stupid shit I do on there. Like they're constantly watching me and laughing at everything I do. I can't talk to anyone about it because they're just going to lie to me to keep the facade going. I don't trust anyone, and anytime I try to open up to somone I get a really awkward and ""you're fucking crazy"" reaction. Which adds to the feeling of paranoia. I even feel like my girlfriend is cheating on me, eventhough that's not possible during this pandemic because she looks after someone vulnerable. I don't want to bring it up with her again either because the reaction I got before was a really in the middle reaction. What drove me to write this post is a feeling of dread caused by a dream I've just had. My girlfriend broke into my house while I was sleeping, and when I opened the door of my bedroom she tried to attack me, but I eventually got her sat down and I took about 5 weapons off her.

So my trust for everyone close to me has just disappeared. Even if they try to tell me how much I'm valued my brain can't accept that and just thinks they're lying.

"I grew up in a sketchy town where crime is high, so anything after the sun sets, gets suspicious quickly. Recently, I moved into a nice neighborhood, real nice, Americana suburbia, so I let my guard down a bit. Yet, I've been noticing some weird things lately. I've seen someone outside with a flashlight looking around. It might just be the neighborhood watch lookin' around for mischief, but I've only seen him once around 10 or 11, so that puts doubt on my Nightwatch theory. I've also noticed that every time I leave my window open at night, I hear strange noises. They could be the local wildlife, cats, and whatnot. 

Now all of these things could be waived aside as an overactive imagination, but the reason I'm typing this is because of what happened a few moments ago. It's 4 AM, and I'm still awake. Nothing new; this happens every few months. I stay up longer, a bit longer every day, and eventually, my sleep cycle flips itself; then I pull an all-nighter, and everything fixes itself. My father went to work a few hours ago, so only our sleeping roommate and I are home. 

I'm droning off to the computer but notice at the corner of my eye a tiny glint coming out of window blinders. I ignore it, thinking it might be my neighbor's porch light, but I swear it moved. So now I discreetly moved my seat to get a better view, and I saw that light again. At this point, I stare directly at it, and then It's gone. I turn on my room's light and head into the living room and kitchen to turn those lights on and get a knife. I'm sitting here hoping that this is a footnote and not a period in this story. I'll keep you guys updated.

I hope all‚Äôs well. As for me, not so much. 

Earlier this morning as I was went to the grocery store buying some food to last me for a bit, I‚Äôve noticed that strangers keep on looking at me and talking bad about me like a rabid dog. I felt so uncomfortable that I quickly and angrily paid for my items and left. 

Later on in the day, I was making a food delivery for a customer. As soon as I was dropping her food off at her apartment door, I heard her in there saying ‚ÄúOMG, it‚Äôs the DoorDash driver dropping off my food. Yeah, it‚Äôs her. The one in the paper girl. I don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs doing DoorDash because she‚Äôs about to get arrested and they‚Äôre going to execute her ass!‚Äù I swore I heard this word for word. 

Onto the next delivery, I had to go into the store and shop for a customer. As I got out of my car, I saw a boyfriend/girlfriend couple approaching their car that was parked next to mine. The girl rolled her eyes and she whispered to her boyfriend. The boyfriend says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad they caught her ass!‚Äù Then when I got into the store, I heard a few workers in there saying ‚ÄúBye!‚Äù ‚ÄúBye! You‚Äôre about to leave!‚Äù As I was getting the items for the customer, I heard other customers shopping saying ‚ÄúShe might go to Texas and get the death penalty and I hope she does! Then no one will have to see, hear or smell her stinking ass!‚Äù 

I‚Äôve been hearing that I was in a newspaper for something crazy, according to strangers.

"Hi! So I have been struggling with depression for a while now, and a major aspect of my struggle is isolating myself from others. I usually stay in my room and sleep since I don‚Äôt have the motivation to really do anything, especially to spend time with people even my family who I am very close with. 

On most websites that cover this subject it recommends going out and spending time with people even when you don‚Äôt feel like it, but I have found that even spending time with the people I love and enjoy spending time with the most makes me feel so much worse.

I see posts on TikTok about these and  usually they‚Äôre pretty funny and relatable but at the same time, i feel like it tends to put a pretty bow on something not pretty in the slightest. This shit is destroying me every second of my life. It‚Äôs so isolating, i feel like an alien disguised as a human trying to play a role i know nothing about. 
Everything is difficult all the time, does not matter how hard i try. Im so tired constantly, everything leads me to burn out.

Edit/Update: wow, & Thank you for all the insightful responses. I tried to respond to everyone so if I didn‚Äôt yet, I will later. Taking a break from Reddit for now. 

In summary, I think one can conclude: being ‚Äúbusy‚Äù appears to be a better alternative for coping with depression than just being sedentary - but does NOT guarantee happiness. Some say it‚Äôs just a distraction from thinking, and a few others say it has either helped them get through everyday life while living with depression or know someone else who has expressed and admitted this. Many of you, including myself, say it‚Äôs hard to always be busy because the symptoms of depression make it incredibly challenging to do so. However, I‚Äôve also gotten several practical responses to how I can incorporate more quality activities in my life that are realistic for me and even offer a perspective I hadn‚Äôt considered before. Maybe the the goal isn‚Äôt to spend every waking hour doing something to avoid thinking, but instead, choose a few activities that give you some meaning to your life.",2,depression

"l feel empty, currently nothing I do is truly ""fun"" Hobbies such as music, videogames and sports are all unfullfilling and none of them are fun. I feel like im wasting my time because I do these things to have fun and yet I dont, I never have fun.

No matter the game I play, the sport I do or the music I try to learn I never feel like im having fun. My life currently just feels like, studying and then I waste my time trying to be entertained. None of these hobbies are satisfactory, fun or fullfilling to me. After those long hours of studying and not achieving my unrealistic goals I go and try to have fun but I never do. I feel like a idiot wasting my time

I want to have fun in life but im not able to do so. That sensation of doing something you enjoy and having fun feels just so out of reach... and everyone else can just have fun but I dont.

"these thoughts are consistent and common enough that I don't recognize them as alarming thoughts rly. today's thoughts: 

the government sees everything I do say and think and let me do bad things and ruin my life, because encouraging criminal actions of the undesirables like me ensures the celebration of our execution. I am intrinsically evil, something wrong in my core. despite my resistance and pleading to God I'll eventually become a murderer, rapist or smth. they will wait until I become completely insane, arrest me, and kill me in jail. people will celebrate my death as I was a burden on all of society and did horrible things. this creates the allusion that justice was served.

In reality they know my decay is happening and they know how to help me, but they won't. they want me to become a horrible criminal, they could stop me and save people, save me, but they won't because a local villian distracts the masses from wanting justice of the elites. its all a distraction letting ppl like me fall to the extreme so they can maintain power.

people in my life are in on it. anyone except for like my mom & dad are all fake in a ploy to trick me. all my friends are nice to me to get dhit out of me, get me talking, fill out a file idk maybe it's just a game, laughing at me while I get a panic attack from someone smiling at me. everyone who needs to know knows and acts like they don't to ruin my life, they want to see how far it goes.


why are you talking to me? what do you want? what do you know? why are you being nice?

you want to get close to me to learn more to encourage more to worsen me to drive me closer and closer to the destructive ends.

"Rant because Jesus, I need someone to understand.

Mother‚Äôs Day was a nightmare for me. Usually, my family is very understanding of my needs as an autistic person, and will happily accommodate them. For example, going out to eat at restaurants and bars can sometimes be very challenging for me, so they‚Äôll bring me home food or let me step outside if it becomes too noisy.

However, for Mother‚Äôs Day, everything was off the table. I left college that morning with my mom (she picked me up since I don‚Äôt have a car on campus) excited to spend the day with the family. My family agreed to go to a bar during the day that I know I usually have issues with, but they said w e wouldn‚Äôt do anything after, so I decided to go to make them happy. Sure enough, I had to step outside in the last thirty minutes because I couldn‚Äôt handle it. I‚Äôm visibly distressed and telling this to my family, who just tell me to ‚Äútough it up‚Äù because we‚Äôre now going to another restaurant that‚Äôs known for being crowded and loud for dinner. I ask to go home, offer to pay for my own Uber (we all drove together to the place), but I‚Äôm yelled at and told to toughen up again.

Sure enough, we get to the restaurant, and I‚Äôm immediately struggling. I was curled up in a ball with my hands over my ears trying to not have a meltdown because it was too loud, too hot, and I never had a chance to recover from the last place. My grandma snaps in my face to get my attention and tells me ‚Äúto sit normally and just be quiet‚Äù to not ruin this day, especially after my mom drove all the way to my college just to get me. That sends me over the edge so I leave, sit outside, and just cry. My mom followed to yell at me, and that was it. I spent ninety minutes sitting outside sobbing because I was having a meltdown and nobody cared since ‚Äúit ruined Mother‚Äôs Day.‚Äù My family didn‚Äôt even check to see if I wanted food or tried to help me calm down. They didn‚Äôt do anything they usually do when I have sensory issues. They‚Äôve never even seen me get to this point because they help me out of it most days, so this was a low point for me.

I just got home and went to bed without eating. Now, it‚Äôs the next day, and I don‚Äôt even know what to expect. I‚Äôm considering buying a train ticket back to my dorm a few days early (I‚Äôm not fully moved out yet since my job requires I help with closing) to get out, since I don‚Äôt want to spend the next few days living on thin ice. I thought it would be common sense that I can‚Äôt just stop being autistic and turn off my sensory issues on holidays, but I guess it isn‚Äôt. I literally did everything I could, I tried to communicate multiple times that I wasn‚Äôt able to do this, and now my family is mad at me for having a meltdown that could‚Äôve been easily avoided if they listened.

"Ok, so I haven‚Äôt ever actually gone this in depth explaining what I experience. Like ever. And it might seem weird that I would feel comfortable telling strangers on the internet, but that‚Äôs just where I‚Äôm at right now. 

Ever since I was a kid, I have felt like someone could see me. Like all the time. Not necessarily in a malicious out to get me way, just like someone could always see me. And what‚Äôs weird is that it‚Äôs not super specific or thinking there is a specific motive. And what‚Äôs even weirder is that it‚Äôs usually characters of a show or movie I just watched. That‚Äôs the most embarrassing part. Because I KNOW they aren‚Äôt real people. So when I dispute the cognitive distortion, my stupid brain switches it to the actor that can see me. 

I‚Äôm also pretty sure someone in the government can see everything electronically that I do and is judging me constantly to the point where most of the time I can‚Äôt write in a word document, it has to be by hand if I‚Äôm writing notes or journaling. 

And all of this is exhausting. So sometimes I will get to the point where I just say ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù and go about my day. Or I might explain what I‚Äôm doing because I don‚Äôt want to be misunderstood by whoever can see me.

"I'm sorry this will be kinda long and might be hard to read, I'll try to break it up as much as possible.

Ive tried in the past to bring up the possibility of ADHD to a few people. My therapist and APRN both told me that my case is too complex for them to be able to come up with a definitive answer on their own (I also have severe anxiety and they said it would be hard for them to be able to decipher what symptoms came from what). And my parents don't believe there's anything wrong with me besides anxiety. But there also pretty uneducated when it comes to mental health stuff. 

About two weeks ago I had an appointment with someone who is supposed to specialize in testing and evaluations. He wasn't specifically testing for ADHD but it was something I had brought up and he said he would help look into. I filled out general forms that covered multiple disorders, but the only thing he gave me that was specifically ADHD related was one screening test. 

I don't remember what it was called, but it was a test that asked questions about when I was ages 5-12 with a scale of like never to very often. 

The only things I answered ""never"" for were questions about disobeying adults (which I never did because I'm scared of confrontation and I used to be terrified of not listening to authority like teachers) and things like ""did you feel like you were driven by a motor"" or ""did you get up out of your seat when you weren't supposed to (I'm believe I would most likely have innattentive type anyway). And there were only a couple questions like that. 

He then said that, based on that one test about when I was in elementary school and the fact that nobody noticed anything when I was a child, (he hasn't finished going through the general forms) that IF I do have ADHD, it would be ""more on the mild side"" and I could probably leave it alone until I got a proper job and had more responsibilities (I'm unable to work and still live with my family) unless I'm saying ""I can't get up, I can't read a book, I can't start anything..."" To which I went ""well..."" But he kinda just kept talking. 

I really regret not speaking up more because I do have those problems and thats part of the reason I'm trying to find someone who will assess me. Like if I don't have it that's fine. I'm not trying to root for it or whatever. I just want a fair, cohesive test so that just that if I do have it, I know I have options available to me. Not ""maybe but if you do then it's fine.""

I literally had a day a day or so after I saw him where I was trying to get up to go do something, and it literally took me 20 minutes just to get myself to reach out my hand and grab my water bottle because my throat was dry. Like literally 20 minutes of me going ""reach your arm out, just grab the bottle, all you have to do is move your arm a little bit, just grab it."" I read a little bit of a book the other day too, and when I first started I had to read over every paragraph twice because the first time I was only taking in about half of what I was reading. It got better as I got a few pages in, but still. 

And I mean maybe that's related to anxiety or something else idk. But I'm just really tired of hearing ""IF you have it"" and like ""that MAYBE could be related to ADHD"". Like I just want answers and I thought this guy was gonna be a big step towards that. But instead I just got more ""maybes"" and ""ifs"" and it's really frustrating.",3,adhd

"I have been severely depressed since I was a child. I have survived several suicide attempts over the course of my life and I honestly don't understand why everyone around me is always surprised when my depression completely takes over.

I suffered at the hands of an alcoholic and abusive father as I grew up. I spent most of my childhood alone and afraid that I would be berated or beaten for the tiniest bit of non-compliance. I didn't even have any real friends until midway through elementary school. I even tried to talk to my parents about how lonely I felt and how I struggled to make friends, but that was met with ""What the fuck is wrong with you? How do you not understand how to make friends? This is normal kid shit. Get the fuck out of my face before I throw something at you.""

Even when I did make friends, my father would go out of his way to embarrass me in front of any friends I had. From forcing my friends to help me perform chores while they came to visit my home, to screaming at me for not doing something as simple as picking up our family dog's poop when my dad wanted to cut the grass, to even saying that my friends are not welcome in the house if they wouldn't help prepare a meal. My friends just stopped coming over and I spent more and more time out of my house. Honestly, my best friend's parents were closer to me throughout childhood and high school than my own family. But it never fixed the gaping hole within my spirit. I always felt so broken and alone.

I was also ruthlessly bullied in elementary and high school. People around me would see me getting punched, kicked, choked, and one time even literally having my bully stomp on my throat in the school cafeteria. No one would ever step up and help, even teachers looked the other way. I'd show up at home with bruises and a couple times with a broken nose, only to have my parents ignore the obvious signs of bullying and abuse. I eventually stopped trying to defend myself. It only made things worse.

My mother was too afraid to challenge my dad as well. They both drank for years until my mother realized how miserable my dad was making her and she decided to stop drinking so much and start exercising.

Things only got worse as I got to post-secondary school. In my first year, my father was so controlling that I got so depressed that I stopped going to my classes altogether. I tried to date to help me find some value in myself, but I began gaining weight so quickly as soon as I stopped playing sports. I gained between 35-50 Lbs in my freshman year and the self-loathing only increased. I was completely unsuccessful in finding a partner, and rejection after rejection only deepened the black hole that is my soul. I tried to off myself again that year for the 5th time in my life, my first time being hospitalized for a suicide attempt.

My father seemed to finally understand how much pressure and damage he had done to me while he saw me lying in a hospital bed, barely clinging to life, but it didn't actually flip a switch in his brain to realize that he needed to change anything. After my required time in a psych ward to ensure that I wouldn't try to kill myself again, I went home, only for my dad to immediately revert to his old, shitty ways.

I continued to try to finish my schooling, switching subjects several times, but I was too depressed to succeed. Any time I started failing tests or assignments, I dropped my class. Three and a half years of this did not result in a degree, infuriating my father to no end. My father refused to hear me when I told him that I was lost and none of my majors interested me. I mentioned that the only solace I had in life was video games, as they were the only things I felt like I excelled in, but that was not a valid option to my father. I tried to take programming courses, but was so depressed that I kept failing out of them, and my father was fed up with paying for my schooling. The only thing left to do was drop out completely, as I did not have the funds to continue going to school.

My parents were also on the brink of divorce at this point. I moved home from school and started to work a minimum wage, dead-end job, which seemed fitting for a pathetic loser like myself.

My father tried with all of his might to pressure me to go back to school, and once he realized that I wouldn't go and I was depressed beyond measure, he tried to force me to go to a psych ward because he was so ashamed of me. I tried to kill myself for the 6th time, and was hospitalized again. That seemned to have put the nail in the coffin for my parents' marriage, as my mother and I completely blamed my father for pushing me straight to the edge of my rope. ""Apologetically"", he offered to take me to a mental health clinic in the city that he worked in, trying to claim that he only wanted the best for me. Sadly, I overheard the truth behind his actions while at his job. He was deeply ashamed of his pathetic excuse of a son. He figured that this was the only way that he would ever be able to get me out of his house and potentially able to work for a living.

I spent multiple more years languishing, literally praying that I would develop cancer and would finally be able to die without any guilt, but I would have no such luck.

I am still alive a decade after my last suicide attempt, and after cutting my father off for a period of time, I was finally able to cobble some form of a life together, going back to school, graduating, and getting a decent job, but the depression has never left and is now back in full force.

The older that I have gotten, the more broken I feel. I've been trapped in a never-ending pit of despair and loneliness, unable to properly connect with all of the wonderful people that have come into my life. I've dated a couple people over the past decade, but never to a point where I could honestly say that I have ever loved my partner, even if they told me that they loved me. If anything, my partners telling me that they loved me immediately scared me and made me push them away. I literally could not understand how they felt or even how they were attracted to me in the first place. Every single one of those relationships ended when my partner eventually got tired of trying to connect with me or they would meet someone better (which to me would be 99.99% of the population). I am now convinced that I am too broken to actually feel love, let alone any form of intimacy, even though it's the thing I want most in the world. I simply don't deserve a partner. I have nothing positive to offer.

I hate myself beyond all measure. I literally feel like I am worth more as an organ donor than a human being. I am tired of existing. I am tired of the constant fucking pain, suffering, loneliness, and the abject nature of my life. I feel like a poison in everyone's lives around me, dragging everyone down, making this world a darker place every day.

I will likely be required to be on medication for the rest of my life in order to be a barely functioning member of society. I am a leech of my region's socialized healthcare system, requiring inordinate amounts of funding to barely hang on. There are so many more worthy people than me. Beyond all of the refugees across the world, there has to be someone who could easily and happily replace me.

All I want is a painless death. My country is contemplating legalizing euthanasia for people whose sole detriment is mental health. If the law is passed, I feel like I will have no other means of escape other than to sign myself up on day one.

My family and the few friends I have are aware of this desire, but the only respond they have had is to tell me some bullshit, placating me, with empty promises of a brighter future. That, or a guilt trip.

So, again, I ask... what's the point of trying to continue when life feels empty and meaningless?",2,depression

Hi everyone, I'm sorry if this goes a bit long but I really need some advice...I've had awful anxiety my whole life, and I'm also diagnosed with ASD and ADHD. About a month and a half ago I started on some new medication and I feel like it's really made some good changes for me, but is also opens but some issues. I've been working with the idea that I wanted to do something in childcare because I have a qualification and it's something I know I can do. Since the medication has kicked in though I feel like I finally have the ability and motivation to study and do something with my life that I'd be more exited about..unfortunately i have absolutely no idea what that is. I need a job to pay my bills because I'm 23 and out of home, and I'm worried that I wouldn't have time to study anyway..but I really just can't see myself enjoying childcare much more and I don't know what to do and it's sending me into a spiral. I've taken so many career quizes and there are so mmay results that seem interesting to me, hut I know I can't do them all but I can't seem to get it down to just one...

Am I doomed to just be in this job I hate forever because I missed my opportunity to study what I wanted to because of my mental health? I could really use some advice...I appreciate it",4,anxiety

I‚Äôve always struggled with depressive thoughts but it‚Äôs been so bad recently and I have nobody to turn to. Nobody knows I‚Äôm like this I‚Äôm so tired of being alone I‚Äôve never felt so alone in my life i recently quit a job that I was content with for a ‚Äúbetter one‚Äù and it‚Äôs honestly a lot worse I hate every moment I am awake I can‚Äôt stand it I just need to vent but I have nobody to vent to. I constantly think about suicide and I hate it I don‚Äôt want to die but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about ending it all. I work 12 hours a day to distract myself but I hate my job I quit drinking and smoking weed awhile ago because I know it‚Äôll only help in the moment and dig a deeper hole. Fortunately I never got too involved in hard drugs. I just got home and it‚Äôs the same empty feeling I constantly feel I‚Äôm just so sick of this I‚Äôm so young and it‚Äôs only gotten worse as time has gone on I‚Äôm genuinely terrified that it will keep getting worse. I‚Äôm tired of telling myself that it‚Äôs going to get better and that I just have to keep pushing and trying but it doesn‚Äôt and never has idk why idk what‚Äôs wrong with me. I can‚Äôt find a woman who genuinely likes me either I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me I mean I‚Äôm not the greatest looking but I‚Äôm not ugly I workout frequently and am in good shape but I‚Äôm just not enough. And it‚Äôs not cause I‚Äôm depressed like this like I said I never show these kind of emotions. But for instance I recently had sex with this girl that I‚Äôve known awhile and we began talking every single day and then she hits me with ‚ÄúI find you really attractive and we get along well and we vibe together but I just can‚Äôt see us in a relationship‚Äù like why what‚Äôs wrong with me idc about sex I want someone to spend genuine time with and I just can‚Äôt find that idk what‚Äôs wrong with me I do everything I‚Äôm supposed to and it‚Äôs just not enough. Idk there‚Äôs so much i want to experience but idk how much more I can take. Idk I just wanted to vent I can‚Äôt sleep for some reason even tho I only slept 3 hours last night I just want the day to end and I can‚Äôt even sleep.,2,depression

"(Buckle up, this is a long one)
I wish I didn‚Äôt relate to that quote. I wish I felt like there was some reason to keep trying. I just turned 41, and I‚Äôm DONE. I‚Äôm not going to do anything, but I‚Äôd be entirely content to just not wake up one day. Everything I‚Äôve ever tried to do with my life has gone to shit, and I don‚Äôt have the will or the energy to try anything else. There‚Äôs no point. I don‚Äôt know what I would want to do anyway. And when I say everything, I mean it. My emotional support dog was robustly healthy until about a month before she died of cancer at age 11. No genetic history of cancer, and her father and mother passed away at 15 and 18 respectively with nothing worse than arthritis and general old age. As far as I know her littermates are all still thriving. My psychiatrist is weaning me off meds because I apparently have treatment resistant depression that the meds don‚Äôt affect at all anymore. I‚Äôm at the least-drugged point I‚Äôve been in *years*, and yes I‚Äôm completely miserable, but I don‚Äôt feel any worse than I did when I was drugged to the gills a year ago. Meds up, down, changed, nothing. So I guess this is my life now. I don‚Äôt even know when this started, but one of my earliest memories (age 5 or so) is a red flag in hindsight. I tried to do myself in when I was about 12. I realized later that what I did never would have worked, but at the time it was a genuine attempt. I was initially medicated then, and I was balanced through my early teens, but the downhill slide started again after about 5 years. Ups and downs, but mostly one step forwards and two steps back. Fast forward to about 4 years ago, and it‚Äôs been a steady downward spiral. I was in an increasingly toxic situation at work, so when I got covid in spring 2020 I was perfectly ok with a mandated 2 week quarantine. It turned out to be long covid (which wasn‚Äôt a known thing at the time), but continued illness and my boss being an ass about it gave me an excuse to quit. I haven‚Äôt worked since, and I don‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt want the responsibility. I don‚Äôt have the motivation. I don‚Äôt have the energy. I‚Äôm at a point where feeling like I *have* to do something makes me resentful. I tried therapy when I was younger, but my therapists always wanted to find the root trauma that triggered my depression. There isn‚Äôt one. Sure I was bullied all the way through school (I mean ALL - kindergarten right up to high school graduation), but I was never physically hurt. No one played nasty pranks on me. I was mainly just teased and ostracized, which of course is hurtful, but it‚Äôs nowhere near as bad as it could have been. I was not abused. I have loving and supportive parents. We aren‚Äôt rich, but we aren‚Äôt struggling either (thank goodness, because while I‚Äôm fully financially dependent on my parents right now, I‚Äôm not a financial burden to them). Yes my older sister was one of my bullies, but she grew out of it and I don‚Äôt hate her for it. She was no worse than the school bullies. We don‚Äôt have much of a relationship now, but we get along fine at family gatherings. Not a great childhood, but no traumatic event to resolve. I‚Äôve taken a number of hits in the last few years, and I‚Äôm trying to get back into therapy for that, but it‚Äôs either a waiting list for government funded therapy, or about $150/hour out-of-pocket for private therapy. That second option is a full nope. And if I end up with a therapist who‚Äôs determined to help me with unresolved childhood trauma, I‚Äôm going to walk right out the door.

So today: I have 2 friends. Total. One friend I‚Äôve had for probably about 15 years. I can talk to them about anything, but they‚Äôre a terrible listener. The type of person who can carry a long conversation entirely on their own, which is great, because I don‚Äôt have to contribute much if I‚Äôm not in the mood. They care, and are empathetic, but don‚Äôt really understand what I‚Äôm dealing with because for them depression is feeling blue for a few days once in a while. Constant soul-crushing despair for weeks at a time is a foreign concept. On the downside, they now have kids and I don‚Äôt like kids. It‚Äôs straining the relationship (from my perspective at least), because the kids are everything now, rightly, but I can‚Äôt stop myself from resenting the kids for coming along and changing the friendship dynamic. The other friend I‚Äôve had for about 10 years. It‚Äôs a very different relationship, and we spend chunks of time in quiet companionship. It‚Äôs restful, and I need it, but it‚Äôs not someone I can talk to about everything. Complete trust, that‚Äôs not the problem. But it makes them really uncomfortable when I‚Äôm obviously unhappy and they can‚Äôt help. I can‚Äôt make them feel like shit to make myself feel better. I won‚Äôt. (I won‚Äôt confide in my parents for the same reason - it‚Äôs distressing to them when I‚Äôm unhappy and they can‚Äôt fix it.)
I had a couple of other people I thought I could talk to. Not fully confide in, but at least know they were on the other end of the phone if I needed to vent. Apparently not. One randomly ghosted me a few months ago, and when I asked the other one for advice about something related to social anxiety today they pretty much told me that my crazy is above their pay grade and I need counselling. They blocked me the second they finished typing.

So now I‚Äôm turning to the anonymity of Reddit to vent some misery because I don‚Äôt know what else to do. My psychiatrist isn‚Äôt a counsellor, and can‚Äôt be reached (if I leave a phone message they might get around to calling me back eventually). I‚Äôm still on a waiting list for a therapist. I called a crisis line once, and got the feeling that if I wasn‚Äôt in any danger then I should leave their line open for people who were. THAT was really helpful. I‚Äôm bawling my eyes out at 4am because I want to go to sleep and not wake up, but because I have no plans to make that actually happen I should just try to get some sleep? Oh, but ‚Äòcall us back this afternoon so we know you were serious about not being in danger‚Äô. Thanks.

Downward spiral, mediocre health, no desire to continue to live, no interest in hobbies I used to enjoy, and no energy or motivation to do anything. I don‚Äôt even know what I hope to accomplish by posting here, except I can‚Äôt keep everything bottled up, and I have no one to talk to. I‚Äôve given up. I even feel like my attempts to get a therapist are more about trying to pass responsibility for the progress of my life to someone else. I‚Äôm lost. I‚Äôm miserable, and I‚Äôm completely lost.",2,depression

"I (F22) was diagnosed at 10 with ASD (they called it Asperger's syndrome when I was diagnosed.) I'm now questioning my diagnosis. Something very very traumatic happened to me as a child and since then I have had trouble socializing with others and making friends. I'm not progressing the way my peers are, even my autistic peers. It's like my brain has been numb for the past 15-16 years. I'm not ""gifted"" nor am I ""intelligent"" I never had trouble socializing before what happened to me. I didn't have sensory issues before that either. I can't stop thinking about my childhood. How I wish I would've just fucking stood up to the piece of shit, who was my abuser. I feel disliked by everyone, even other autistic people. I haven't contributed anything to this world, all I am is what happened to me. I have nightmares every single fucking night. I've been used and abused by NT people my entire life. ""Awk it's just Claire. She's daft, she won't know we're taking the piss out of her."" But I do know and that's what hurts so much. I pretend to be oblivious. I don't want to remember what happened to me again. I just want to be free. Free from pain, free from suffering. I don't go out, I don't do anything. I'm just a shell. I was born nothing and I'll die nothing. I don't want my parents or siblings to have to take care of me in their old age and I want to free them from the burden. All I do is stim all day and smoke. I'm bored out of my tits constantly but I can't work or anything because if I get another flashback it'll set me off for the full day. I failed as a human being.",1,autism

"I went to visit a friend last night and she was able to identify that I'm in an episode. I had no idea honestly. She kept looking at my eyes telling me they were dilated and that my behavior was erratic. She said my sentences were hard to follow because i was jumping from subject to subject. I haven't been sleeping much and she said it's not normal to have this much energy after barely any sleep. What killed me was when she said ""This isn't you. Where is Maia?"" I asked her what she meant, and she said ""Youre totally different, everything about you, your energy, all of it is off"". Then she finally said it and it hit me: ""Maia, you're having an episode, I can tell"". I cried. No way. I didn't think so. I felt like everyone else was just moving slower than normal. Music sounds slower than normal. And now my head is fucked. All I can think about it how long has this been going on and I didn't notice? Other people have said little things like ""Hello, are you there?"" Cuz apparently i disassociate a lot, but i thought i was just spacey. But now I'm falling down the rabbit hole. Are my relationships real? Do people really care about me or are they just using me? Are these people even real?  I feel like I'm in the Truman show.

"I'm beginning to come out the other side of a really severe, numbing depressive state. Today was horrible. Horrible in the sense that I'm not shutting down or repressing. 
Instead, I'm actually allowing myself to feel all the negative emotions. Goddamn, feeling really hurts sometimes. I haven't cried this hard in as long as I can remember. Ugly crying is what my sister would call it. 

Anyway, it reminded me of something I wrote last year. Last year when I began this self improvement journey to reconnect with my emotions. I just wanted to share. 


```
Now my emotions are not numb, I cry, I fear, I yearn, I love.
With this clarity, I remember feeling before
This softening is familiar, I've resurfaced before.
I remember how strongly I felt love for someone else, and it wasnt returned.
The most powerful feeling I've ever known.
But I was not worthy.
Following my lead, She concurred
Eventually that love was exhausted. In its place loneliness and longing grew.
The most powerful feeling I've ever known
Eventually I wasn't lonely. Eventually there was no longing.
I was worthless.
And I don't like feeling worthless. So I don't.
Now I don't feel much, everything is gray and flat.
People in arms reach are distant.
The world is foreign only to me. I am a stranger there.
Now I remember how much feeling hurts.
Now I remember how strongly I feel
Now I remember why I am numb.

"Hello I‚Äôm(24f) paranoid beyond belief about my health and life. I am overweight with a high BMI. I‚Äôve never had much concern until I had my child and then decided to get weight loss surgery. The process for the surgery is long and many different doctor visits. However recently I‚Äôve had a lot of chest pain going constantly to the hospital and each time they said I‚Äôm perfectly fine, I follow up with my primary care physician and he even says I‚Äôm perfectly fine and the chances of myself having anything wrong with my heart at all are very low. However, with all of that I still fear this upcoming cardiologist appointment that I‚Äôll find out something is wrong and won‚Äôt get the weight loss surgery or I‚Äôll die before the appointment or die before I can even get the surgery. It‚Äôs gotten so bad where I barely leave bed anymore, the anxiety medications I‚Äôm on don‚Äôt stop the panic attacks and I‚Äôve cried myself to sleep multiple times in a row. I‚Äôm scared my child will go to bed next to mom and wake up to a corpse. I‚Äôve been so paranoid to eat I‚Äôve lost 10lbs in less than a week. I also believe my past eating disorder is returning because if I do manage to eat I immediately become scared I‚Äôll have a heart attack and begging to call myself disgusting for eating when I shouldn‚Äôt.

"... And before I eat everything up or have no idea how to describe it to my boyfriend when he comes home in an hour or two I'd decided to write it down here. 

I'm 21 F, had to stop going to the therapist because they're just for kids and teenager and that ends with 21, at least here.

I've been on sick leave since October last year (because of my depression worsening) and left my apprenticeship in March, hoping that I'd do alot better with A) not being bound to a place anymore that hurts me mentally (software developing in an office with a huge lack of support from the trainer due to there being 5 for 80 apprentices) B) I don't have the stress from being on sick leave and C) I could make a change in my path and go for a more creative job with physical work like woodworking. 

I am not doing better, I'm not sure what I just had, but I was just crying, at least close to hyperventilating, stressed and throwing up. I feel like I'm getting suicidal again, but at the same time don't as I don't want to die, just need a break maybe... I feel trapped... Every day it feels like it's getting worse. 

My health insurance is forcing me to go to rehab(which I now see more as a chance to get better that I'm grateful for), the paperwork is quite alot and annoying but I got people that can help me. I just somehow need to get there. I'll probably try to find a new therapist, but I have problems with phone calls (one of the reasons I didn't call an emergency Hotline), but the social workers at the place I have to go to due to me not working currently offered to help with that aswell. 

I just stepped into a way too cold shower to distract myself enough so I can start to make myself busy, collected my favorite plushies and blanket, made myself comfortable with chocolate a tea and something normal to drink as I realized that I didn't drink for the last 5 hours and put on one of those dancing vegetables sensory videos to try and calm myself a little before playing a cozy game until my boyfriend comes home... Hopefully with food... I don't have the strength to make anything to eat right now... 

There's many more things going on, stuff I can't do that also just stress me even more.

Writing this down made me feel a bit better, so thanks for reading.",2,depression

"Hi! I‚Äôm new to the channel and just wanted to share what I‚Äôm going through. 
See if I‚Äôm alone and if anyone can help? I feel like it‚Äôs pretty common and I know I can‚Äôt be the only one who feels like this. 

I‚Äôm a cisgender, female who has been in a committed relationship since summer 2019 and I still feel like he‚Äôs cheating on me. I have literally no basis for this and each time I ask he is open and transparent, offers his phone, leaves it around all the time, answers any time I call, I‚Äôm active in his family life, like at this point if he‚Äôs stepping out it‚Äôs on him not me. Yet, I still feel sometimes (and less often every day, this post is a step for me towards not feeling trapped like this) that he‚Äôs seeing someone. And the type of trist I‚Äôm thinking of is totally out of character, he‚Äôs never been a one night stand or a cheater. He did confess to being an emotional cheater long ago and in another life and again, we‚Äôve talked AT LENGTH about how we are both different people as I used to be a cheater too. Either way, I know I‚Äôm with my partner and my person. And I know they feel the same by their actions and words. So why do I still get panic attacks when I see a girl we both know at the same event or do I go on a days long trip out when he mentions he texts this girl that used to be a good friend of his. He has very healthy friendships who are in committed relationships so I‚Äôm not worried about his friends and they spend time together weekly. 

I‚Äôm at a point in my journey now where I know the following: I need to give him his time and space and respect just like he gives me, I need to reflect when I feel these senses of panic and find out where they coming from, and I need to ask myself what I can do to control or deny this feeling either by staying busy or by not over analyzing every little thing. But I‚Äôm wondering what are some good habits or things you do to get out of this hole? Any music or books that helped you along the way? Any type of friendships I should lean on? 

Hope this finds y‚Äôall well and if you have any advice I‚Äôm happy to hear. Even if you feel the same, you‚Äôre not alone in that feeling and you‚Äôre not crazy either.",5,paranoia

"Hye everyone. Hope you guys are well.  

I wanted some advice from some mature people. So here is my story:

In 2022 July I completed my graduation and got a job too. So a 20 years long struggle of my mother came to an end. During this time I also went through bad patches(depression and shame). But during the 4 year degree I didn't have time to get depressed since I got so busy in the excessive workload. After 2022 July, I started feeling lonely. Like it was very hard. But few months back I got a new roommate. He is a great company. 

Now out of no where when my brain realized that there is nothing bad in the present, lets bring back the bad memories of the past to ruin the present. Past memories are jumping in again and again which triggers my shame. So the incident(9 years old) which triggers my shame is linked with my mother and sister. The both don't even remember that incident or even if remember it, they are not bothered, neither they ever reminded me. They both love me a lot.But they both don't know that I am still carrying it. Also another thing is the thought that I am gonna die at the end. So why work so hard? 

So currently these two things are killing my motivation to study and do other productive stuff. I have wasted 2 weekends. 2 days ago I went to a therapist and he has prescribed escitalopram(10 mg) to me. However, I don't have any generic anxiety symptoms or suicidal thoughts. 

I am 26 and I think I should be fearless and on attack mode currently and try to live these years with full excitement and enthusiasm. But I don't know why my brain is teasing me.",2,depression

if you don't want to listen to my vent pls don't bother reading this i'm just in need for desperate help

is this even paranoia? or something else...?

\---

i might've posted something like this on my profile. it's the same topic, albeit things have changed over time. i'm unsure if anyone else has this problem, too, but have you ever felt like someone is watching you, reading your mind and getting into your personal thoughts?

capable of hearing/seeing what you think of, even if you were thinking of it for one second?

it's much worse when you have intrusive, unwanted thoughts. randomly coming into your mind.

i feel like someone's threatening me and watching me while i'm at home, reading my mind. whatever i like, they'll think of the same thing albeit in negative emotions. when i like something they'll think ""oh i don't. you're stupid and cringe and edgy, you know that, right?""

i'm unsure if this is even paranoia. just a whole other level of feeling threatened, scared, worried, anxious, and paranoid but in another way.

does anyone have a problem relating to this? because i really need someone i can talk to about this. at least someone who'll comprehend and care.

mother won't care; nor will sister or brother. my mother would say ""oh, it's because you're setting your mindset to that kind of thing"" when it's not me. my father will say ""you're weird"" because he probably assumes i'm a normal, cis child who is innocent and non-suicidal. non-mentally unstable.

sometimes, when i try perceiving on what's happening to the person watching me, i feel as if they're some person/demon who looks identical to me. but more annoying and creepy.

i feel like i can read what they're saying in my mind; albeit what would they really be saying? ""oh you're a wonderful person"" no they wouldn't say that. they'd say something more opposite; like ""oh you're an idiot, you just fake your depression you ugly emo brat. i'm now threatening you because i don't care"" and i feel like nobody can help me. nobody, in the whole entire fricking g\*d-damn world.

like people would just say ""no you're just setting your mindset to that"" ""nobody can watch you, you're 'safe'"" ""the only person who can read your thoughts... well, is you"" (according to my therapist). i can't get proper help because nobody will understand me well.

the person watching me might as well be an old imaginary friend; who now despises me. or might be some person i hate irl watching me through technology. even if theres no such thing as cameras around my house, i feel as if they're watching me some other way.

i'm unsure about whats happening. i need desperate help.

summary/brief explanation: basically i'm saying that i feel like some person is watching me and threatening me in some weird strange way (not by using cameras) and i can't get any help or remove this stuff from my stupid brain.

i just want to harm myself; how would that go with the person watching me? or should i say demon?

"i am not a child, i am in my late teens but i am still extremely paranoid of paranormal entities.

i do not exactly believe they exist but i take many measures to not be killed or harmed by them.

i have installed a lock on my bedroom door to protect me at night, i avoid mirrors (especially in confined spaces) and rarely close my eyes, especially in the shower as i believe it makes me feel like im being watched.

i do not have any diagnosis but i am quite socially anxious and socially paranoid.

seeing a creepy picture online, seeing something fall over without being touched or flickering lights send me into a state of panic and i start to hyperventilate and my stomach sinks, i tremble and i am generally in an extremely scared state.

i also constantly look around myself for entities and try not to make any noise at night.

I (male 26) found out i have undiagnosed ADHD recently. I am addicted to porn and binge watching tv shows as a coping mechanism for my childhood trauma. I was fine last year in a way. I had a girl whom i loved very much. But she was not as into me which i found out later when i proposed. I really wanted it to work with her because she was the first person in a long time who saw me for exactly who i was. I was never so happy before in my life. Its been almost a year and we talk from time to time. Now i feel like there is a void where the love and friendship used to be. I need to better myself first. I am trying to move forward but i feel like i have lost my anchor in life. I find myself watching porn and binge watching shows when i should be working. I feel bad afterwards but now i feel like i have lost the reason to better myself. I would want some advice from you guys on reditt on how i can get back on track and not lose sight of what is important. The ADHD kind of makes me forget and it is hard to coordinate.

I‚Äôm afraid of the idea that my girlfriend could be leading me on and trying to get me to be really attached and then hurt me really bad because it makes her feel good. I can‚Äôt convince myself that it‚Äôs okay or genuine. She says she loves me and wants to get married one day, she says she just knows I‚Äôll be her husband and that we‚Äôll have kids and be together forever.

I don‚Äôt feel worthy of being there which makes me feel like it‚Äôs all a trick.

I‚Äôm just afraid that it‚Äôs all apart of the trick and that I‚Äôll feel so good and then she‚Äôll ignore me one day or break up with me or cheat on me or find someone else and leave me for them and she‚Äôll feel good that I‚Äôm hurting. I‚Äôll feel so dumb for thinking I was good enough. I consider or feel strongly that this could be all apart of her plan; I don‚Äôt necessarily believe it but I feel it and consider it.

"This started happening around 10 months ago. I think it started off as extreme anxiety about the possibility of nuclear war but it's kinda spiraled out of control.

At first, I was anxious about the possibility of nuclear war. I wanted to move out of the city I'm in to the countryside. I remember crying to my mum about wanting to move away because I was that terrified. I would go to sleep thinking everyday was going to be my last.

That fear got worse. I started to become scared of any planes, helicopters, etc. Multiple times a day I would start screaming because I thought one of them was a nuke and I was about to die. I would constantly be watching the sky to see if I could see any nukes. I live near a hospital where theres a lot of helicopters coming and going, it freaks me out.

I started hallucinating too. I would see everything getting really bright which would freak me out. Or everything around me would start to distort. One time, when everything was getting bright, I genuinely hallucinated my name being called. It was freaky.

Anyway, it did start to get better. Ive been avoiding the news about it and I try to avoid conversations about it. I'm still scared of helicopters, planes and loud sounds outside. 

I'm not sure if it's starting to get worse again. I recently moved in with my boyfriend and the bedroom faces a main road. There are cars constantly going past. The particularly loud ones really freak me out. I jump everytime. This morning, I got woken up by a loud car and it really scared me. My heart rate was 130bpm when it woke me up. Of course when I came onto reddit I see shit about Putin pulling out of the nuclear treaty and my boyfriend commented that ww3 is coming soon. I haven't told him about this stuff yet, it's honestly embarrassing.

I'm not even fully sure if this is paranoia? Maybe before I was paranoid but now I'm just terrified by outside noises (cars too apparently). 

I just want it to stop. I miss not freaking out over these things. I never used to pay such sounds any attention.",5,paranoia

"I'm 19 years old and home for the summer from college. my dad and I never got along that well. we disagree on most things and we get into fights all the time. maybe hate is too strong of a word because we do get along sometimes but I feel like we are always at a constant battle. recently, I have not been doing well mentally and have been really unhappy. spending my hours laying in bed and not having the energy of doing anything. Last night my dad came into my room and started screaming at me for my room being messy, ruining Mother's Day because I did not leave my room, etc., and took my phone. He made me feel so shitty and I truly felt bad. when I get into these arguments I ""shut down"" and don't say anything because I think if I do say what's really on my mind he will contradict it and say that's not a reason. Today, I quit my job and began applying for new ones online on my computer. He again, comes into my room and asks why I'm not at work and I said I quit. before I can even explain myself he starts screaming at me saying I'm lazy that I'm a guest living in his house and that I could be homeless soon and so on. I don't say anything throughout this whole thing which is making him even more mad. I can't remember all the things he said because I think I blocked it out. As he was yelling he puts his hand into a fist calling me a bitch and I yell ""Yeah Hit me"". He laughs and said ""You would like that wouldn't you"" and I ran into my bathroom and locked the door. I start having a panic attack and he says ""Let me see your tears"" like he wanted to see me cry. a few hours later he's talking to me like nothing happened but I'm still pissed. I'm I wrong to be upset? he does not understand what I am going through and called me mentally retarded for thinking I have depression or ADHD. I don't know what to do. I'm tired of all the fighting and kinda scared of him. he has never hit me but threw a cup of water in my face one time when we were arguing. any advice on how to deal with this? living at home is a nightmare because I'm always reminded that my parents favor my sister more and that my mom does absolutely nothing about my dad. i just want to leave but I have no money. any advice is good!",2,depression

Last job I had was last year for 3 months, got fired without an explanation. That was the longest job I had since graduating high school in 2013. Back then I found it hard to get jobs because of my social anxiety, now that I'm older my anxiety has lessened a lot and I've learned ways to manage it, but now my depression just makes me not want to do anything. Even though I was never given a reason why I was fired, I'm pretty sure it was my attendance. I called out a lot and came in late, because I hated that job. I didn't want to be there or do the work, and I actually wanted to quit but I still wanted the money, so I kept working hoping to be fired lol. It's so hard to make myself do stuff.

" In my life there are often great expectations of me and my fellow human beings (friends, family, strangers) and also great hopes and a deep longing for a different, better life, which logically have been and are repeatedly disappointed. 

Whenever I was a little satisfied with something, I felt at the same time this irrepressible and deep-seated disappointment and dissatisfaction. When I've been out with loved ones, I've longed for other ""better"" or ""cooler"" people, or complete solitude. And the other way around.

As if my inner self has been playing images of my ""dream life"" to me for so long that I would pick myself up and give it my all to achieve it. Like some kind of intrinsic motivation, but through a constantly yelling and driving drill instructor.

Does anybody have that as well?

In that respect, couldn't we assume that expectations just naturally diminish and become less through repeated disappointments over the course of a lifetime?

I rather have the impression that my hopes for better people, better places, better times have developed in parallel with the disappointments, and that I have therefore developed higher and higher expectations for everything.

And I also know that this is totally unfair, selfish and also quite violent towards other people, because there is virtually no one for me (not even myself) who can make me feel that he/she is enough and I feel good, while I also know that this should not be my right nor my claim towards other people, but I have not yet found a proper, healthy way to deal with it.",3,adhd

emotional downpour

High school junior here.  A false sexual accusation rumour about me spread to my only group of friends.  They all gave me the cold shoulder. Later I find that this girl had essentially assimilated into the friend group I was once in. WTF? The popular guy that she cosied up to as well is showing no restraint and blabbering the rumour to all his friends. 

About the accusation - something did happen but it was all consensual and very minor. However I have gotten into trouble for something similar but more severe, and I am worried that the school will side with the girl no matter what as a result, and that I could get expelled and my life simply ruined.

But I know that it's simply not sexual assault (not willing to share details unless via PM, if you really doubt that I am not an abuser). I've asked my scenario to friends and anonymous online users, making myself sound as horrible as I can with wording, from both perspectives, and yet without fail, every single time, they agree that I am not in the wrong, or at least, that the girl was overreacting. I did manage to win a few friendships from that group back, but things will never be the same :/

The group cut me off at the end of February. The incident happened in early October. She acted like nothing was wrong until the start of 2023. Why did she act like that, so strangely? I feel so betrayed...

Nothing has happened since then, but my loneliness and paranoia can't help but get the best of me - what if I get expelled? What if I never even get to graduate? What the hell is going to happen to me... I'm constantly anxious and jumpy on the inside. I swear, if I even had a semblance of a support group, I'd have gotten over this ages ago. But instead I'm still spreading negativity and have become my own ticking time bomb counting down to my next collapse of despair.

It feels so weird... why does she get to interact with so many of her friends as if nothing happened while I roam this school as a loner, without camaraderie? It's almost like the roles are reversed. As much as I hate it when people call themselves the ""victim""/partake in victim-blaming, I genuinely feel like I'm the victim here more than anyone else in this situation is. Surely I don't deserve whatever situation that has befallen me?

...and no this isn't simply me ""facing the consequences of my own actions."" Read above again. Please be kind and civil, I have already had enough negativity in my life.


- No mentions of SA below. Context above.
------- -- - - hyphen hyphen HH -  -  -- ---- 


Now to get onto the title. The issue is that I've been so stressed by above ^^ that I'm almost incapable of making decisions for the long-term. I used to have many university plans and different programmes, internships, and research projects that I wanted to go for.

But now I can't even think of making it past junior year (we end in November). I can only plan for two weeks ahead at a time to keep myself from internally combusting, collapsing onto myself.

I get a sense of dread whenever people talk about school or exams or education things in general, despite my relatively high GPA in a prestigious high school. I feel like all that could be stripped away from me in a blinding flash, and I'd be reduced to less than mere nothing. I have so much to lose

This has been affecting me by rendering me unable to work on larger projects myself unless given strict deadlines. (Studying for exams, finishing homework assignments/projects, etc.) If it's for my compulsory graduation project that needs to be done before the end of 2023, then good luck to myself meeting the graduation requirements! I have simply lost motivation to work on anything unless motivated by external stressors...

Because, what's the point? These things don't have any meaning if I get expelled anyway. On the other hand, if I have strict upcoming deadlines, I know that it's relatively likely that I won't get expelled within that timeframe and will actually work hard on them, almost (80-90%) normal, back to my old efficiency, speed, and amount of work done.

I also can't make plans for the future at all. I hear my girlfriend talk about her plans for college, the coding projects and paid internships she's been taking up, and I can't help but feel inadequate to her. Everything good in my life is just me riding the old wave of my successes from a previous era in my life, a time when I was less depressed and pathetic. They're not even that much. It's just going for math competitions that I know I won't win, and chemistry competitions I know I  have much to learn.

I haven't done anything noteworthy this year, neither have I worked on anything due further than a few weeks away, nor having done anything optional but helpful for my future, like additional research projects and internships. I have no research projects, internships, or notable extracurriculars. And I can't even bring myself to gun for them. I'm probably going to graduate with the bare minimum if my outlook on my future is so bleak and hopeless. I don't want that to happen. But I still can't stop worrying about myself getting expelled, and all my effort now to be naught. It's irrational. I'm irrational.

I'm falling far, far, behind. Augh...

I haven't even made any additional plans for my second semester. All I planned for was to just do the bare minimum and get through school without any problems or breaking down. All the people around me are so ambitious, I used to be like them, but now I don't think I can. It's not like I couldn't even handle it. Thanks to this great fear of expulsion, I find it a terrible struggle to function anymore.

it's weird. like i have ambition but i don't have drive. yet i have a lot of pent up energy. it's so weird.

It's like my ADHD symptoms have been amplified by an order of magnitude or two. Ugh... How do I stop these treacherous, onerous thoughts?

"Advice and also discussion:

I'm convinced that people think I'm bad looking or plain.

Looking at people who look how I want to look makes me feel so sick that it stops me from leaving the house sometimes. When I do go out, I tend to keep my hood up and not wear my glasses so people can't see me and I can't see people.

I've tried to talk about it with my closest friend and my elder sibling but both of them told me that the looks I'm seeing on instagram are 'unattainable' and that 'we can't all be models'. I just felt like they were calling me ugly, or at least, not beautiful. I want people to think I'm beautiful so, so, so badly.

I also do have a therapist but I don't seem to be making progress regarding this source of anxiety. 

I have really bad anxiety about this and it's making it harder to make friends. Every time I think about it too hard I have to spend hours calming myself down to get on with my day.

"I'm 16 and honestly I don't know what to do.My family used to be good enough financially a few years ago but ever since father's company shut down it has become tough.I was like 12 when the financial status began to hit but didn't get bothered too much because I knew something was wrong.Even growing up after it i didn't let me bother it cause I thought ""Nah it will get better,who cares if I don't have enough clothes or can't get the food I like it's not like this will affect me later on"".But since last year I have felt odd.I see my classmates go out and post on insta how they have fun and all with their nice clothes and the food they eat.At first it was fine since I tended to not care cause I had my games on my laptop and didn't have that much connection with others but I too wanted to have fun and have friends.Now it just eats me up a lot.My laptop's broken now so no more games and can't afford a new one or to even repair it.My parents are nice and loving and I love them the most and have no problem with them so I never say that I have a problem or anything but it's getting hard now.I have got some really important exams this year as I'm now in 10th grade and my cousin scored 95% so yes there's a bit of pressure.My cousin is really nice and motivates me a lot.He takes me out to movies and hangs out with me.Teaches me to socialise.Has a lot of friends and...

"So i‚Äôve dealt with anxiety for a good portion of my life but never realised it was anxiety. It got bad a few years back when I recalled some intrusive thoughts and dreams I had when I was younger and since then it‚Äôs been a constant feeling of dread and it won‚Äôt leave me. No matter what I do I seem to get drowned in thoughts I don‚Äôt want and can‚Äôt escape from. 

I‚Äôve tried all sorts but it just feels like i‚Äôm fighting against the world and when there‚Äôs no thoughts at all that sense of anxiety in the chest is always there and it causes me to overthink and feel like somethings gonna happen, like a bad thought or intrusive thought or worry that a bad dream will repeat and I don‚Äôt know what to do to stop that.

"I'm very anxiously attached to my new boyfriend of 2 months (4 months talkin. Im extremely insecure. I hate my job and can't leave it.

My
 father died 10 months ago. I had to call off work today. My heart hurts. The anxiety is physical and my chest is heavy. I drag my feet. I keep getting triggered and the awful feeling of your face suddenly going numb and your heart dropping and your legs wanting to go weak. I hate that feeling. It won't stop
 

I'm too soft for this. Im spiritual. My soul made a plan to come here to learn and experience life but I didn't fucking sign up for this. Even tho they say we all signed up for this.  I recognize this is my karma and I have to learn and grow out of this. I need help with my jealousy. When I get triggered I can't make myself do something else. I can't do anything when I get this awful feeling. 
I tried to be sober for May. I started prozac  6 days ago so I can't drink anymore. I desperately want to. I'm smoking weed when I didn't want to. It doesn't even numb the pain. Not like alcohol does. I know better than this

"I‚Äôve always been a very anxious person and i worry a lot however i think it started a month or so ago i noticed i‚Äôve been having intense thoughts of things going wrong. Such as choking on my food and no one is around to help, which has lead to me not eating until someone is home. noises leading me to believe that someone is breaking into the house, being watched if the curtains are not closed, more commonly at night (i had to pin the curtain to the wall i was so stressed out)

Recently, I went on a trip and noticed that these intense thoughts were getting so much worse. The weeks leading up the trip i was obsessively imaging the plane crashing, and during the flight I really thought we going to crash several times. 
we were going to go kayaking, and my brain told me that i was going to flip over and wouldn‚Äôt be able to get back up or an animal was going to attack. We also went on a safari drive and through out the whole week i was almost hoping it would be canceled because every single day i convinced myself that we were going to be attacked by one of the animals. 

I can‚Äôt even step outside my house because my brain has told me that someone is going to hurt me. something is going to happen.

it‚Äôs gotten pretty bad with my social life too where i‚Äôm convinced people hate me. it‚Äôs made talking to others difficult to the point where i‚Äôm pushing people away.

to be honest, i cant tell if my anxiety has just skyrocketed or i‚Äôm starting to become a paranoid person. is this paranoia or possibly something else? or am i being overly dramatic? any advice on how to calm my mind down would be appreciated!",5,paranoia

"i had a good day, or at least i think i did. i cant remember what happened because i've suddenly just been sprung into a depressive state for no reason. im wondering what would happen if i died. if i just ceased to exist. 

i know people would care for a bit, but their pain would subside after a while. it wouldn't last long. it'd be ending all my pain that appears to me in the most inconvenient times, and only causing a small inconvenience to others.

thats not true though and i know it. that'd be selfish of me also. i could never bring that kind of pain onto my friends and family. 

i just want attention. honestly. maybe if someone gave me the love and care i want, i wouldnt feel this way. maybe if someone noticed how shitty i feel, they'd all start to care. 

maybe i'll hurt myself so that they know the pain is real and have a visual.

i'll chicken out. but if it gets to bad, i'm certain that i will eventually resort to a shitty coping mechanism.

"About six months ago I was just a normal human being. Careless, and did not worry about anything. I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôve always been a hypochondriac throughout my 23 years of life but it never impeded me from doing anything I wanted to do. I worked, traveled, worked out, hung out with my friends and always had a great time. No anxiety at all. Six months ago, just out of nowhere my brain decided to ruin my life. I had a horrible panic attack that literally came from nowhere. I wasn‚Äôt even anxious at all. Never dealt with GAD. I obviously got very scared and ran to the ER because my heart wouldn‚Äôt slow down. I thought I was going to die if it didn‚Äôt slow down. After many tests everything turned out to be just a panic attack. Well, I thought that was it but little did I know that panic attack would change my life.

I had to literally make up excuses to not go because of this agoraphobia and anxiety I‚Äôm dealing with. Now she‚Äôs dating someone else. Why did this happen to me? I never did drugs, drank or did anything stupid to cause my life to be the way it is now. I can‚Äôt even take my mom out for a Mother‚Äôs Day dinner without having too many second thoughts.

"I'm in need of support/advice. I (f24) am a social work student in the UK. I'm supposed to finish my degree in the next month but I very likley could fail my final placement. The reason for my failing will be lack of professionalism (i.e. not responding to emails in a timely manner, failure to arrange meetings with my supervisors, and a few absences that I did not tell my supervisor about beforehand). I was already on thin ice and now, because of a simple mistake where I sent an email to one person instead of two, I probably don't have any chances left.

I feel so stupid because the things that may have caused me to fail were *really* avoidable. I understand that I am probably not meant for social work due to not being very professionally responsible, and I plan to pursue something else after my degree, but the fact that I might have thrown three years down the drain with nothing to show for it sickens me. If I do fail this close to the end, I'll feel like the biggest disappointment/embarrassment and I have no clue how I'd tell my family.

I'm already super behind for a 24 year old. I've always struggled in the work place (especially because I have dyspraxia too). Plus, I've already dropped out of a degree when I was 18 (although that was more to do with physical/mental health problems than incompetencey). I have no idea where to go from here and I'm afraid. 

I have a supervision with my practice educator tomorrow (who sounds like she is at her wits end with me). If anyone has any advice concerning getting through the last bit of my degree somehow, I'd appreciate it. Or if there's any advice on what to do if I *do* fail and have to come to terms with the fact that I wasted three years, I'd also appreciate it.",3,adhd

"What the title says. I love learning. I like science and geography and I'm obsessed with history. I love textbooks and documentaries, taking notes and writing essays and always having facts to tell people. I don't mind sounding like a nerd - I really, really like learning. But that's why it makes me so sad and frustrated and angry that I failed school. I officially dropped out about a year ago but I haven't attended since S3 (9th grade). I hate that my school ruined my education. I'm so smart and I'm capable and I really WANTED to learn, but they refused to accommodate me or listen to me or treat me like a human being and now I'm fucked with no qualifications and no idea what to do with my life. I don't know if it's wrong to blame them, but I tried my best - like really, really tried - and they shot me down every time. Yeah, other disabled students do learn from home, but you don't need that. And yeah, other disabled students do get support, but you don't need that either. Your meltdowns and panic attacks are just overreactions. Though we're constantly saying you're capable and full of potential, we won't let you take the exam because you won't pass. It doesn't matter that you studied at home - if you wanted to study at home, you should have asked to do home learning. Oh, you did ask us and we refused? That's because you're not disabled enough for home learning. But you're too disabled to take the exam. None of it makes any sense. I know I couldn't have passed my math or my English, but I studied every damn word in 3 different History textbooks and I know for a FACT that I would have passed that exam. I just wanted one qualification in the thing I love and they denied me that. And if they'd let me do online learning like a few others did, I know I could have passed other classes too. For the few months we did online learning for COVID, I did really well.

School sucks for everyone, I get it, but neurotypical people get to complain that algebra is useless and the cafeteria has terrible food and they don't want to take English for 4 years. I just wanted them to consider my needs for 5 minutes instead of brushing me off for years until they presented the choice: ""Attend every class full time or drop out at 15"". Why are those my only choices? That's not fucking fair. Who are they to decide who's autistic enough for support? I'm fucking autistic. I shouldn't have to look like this image of autism they have in their head just to be treated with the empathy everyone else gets.

"okay so i want to start out by saying this is me reaching out asking what exactly to do..
stats: 
age - 15
height - 5‚Äô5
weight - 137lbs
sex - female
amount of dxm consumed - probably 3000mg ish over 6 days. 

it all started off as me doing dph over a year ago, i quit ts since. i have known about dxm for a little over 6 months now but decided to give it a try about a month ago. 
the first two times did nothing exceot make me tired, this was with robotussin syrup. then, i found out about coricidin, this is where my memory gets blurry. 
about 2 weeks ago i went to my local cvs and borrowed from the generous store about 3 boxes. i popped 8ps (240 ish mg) the first night. this was the beginning of my binge. i then proceeded to pop another 4, and then another 4 all in the same night within 5 hours. i stayed up the whole night, it was amazing, i never wanted it to stop. 
the next night i did the same (night before being friday night) so it now being saturday night i dosed up 13ps. (390mgs). 
i didnt do any sunday night as i had school monday (or at least i dont think i did).
i took 300mgs monday morning before school. i didnt want to go through the day sober. 
i had an amazing time being out of my mind and going through my classes in a daze. 
i did the same routine gradually upping the dose the next few days. 
whenever i stop i get extremely depressed, ive burned myself oretty badly during all of this (second degree). 
keep in mind i havent smoked thc at all during this. the triples were enough. 
then this is where it starts to get crazy. 
on wednesday night my friend came over unnanounced, it really confused me, i thought she was a hallucination. 
she smoked me up (by that i mean one bong rip) by then i had already taken 400mg of triples. she found out about it and just really confused me. 
listen, I can‚Äôt even tell at this point who‚Äôs fake and who‚Äôs not. I can‚Äôt tell who‚Äôs real and who‚Äôs not. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. I am living through my days in a daze and I can‚Äôt tell anything from reality. 
i really want to just end it. i need help but idk what to do. someone pls tell me what to do. i cant even recall most of this past week. the morning after my friend came over i was so fucked up and shaking so mf bad and was so paranoid i flushed the rest of my pills away. (sometimes during my binge i went out and got 7 more boxes). i just dont know what to do. after smoking the thc w my friend i was having paranoid delusions about getting sent to hell and my mom finding out and calling everyone who i thought was against me. i thought my friend was doing this on purpose. i just dont know ehat to do. 

i should probably mention i did all of this coming off an antipsychotic (abilify). so probs not a good idea (haha).

So I am normally suspicious of the motives of other people but not to the point where it is interfering with my life however, I do feel like the potential is there. I recently went out to eat at a restraunt when the food and drinks are served to me a small thought creeps into my head that says ""I wonder if this could be poisoned?"", and the more I think about it the more paranoid that I get to the point where I won't eat the food and want to leave the restraunt. 
I had another incident in which I went to the doctor for a prescription for a sinus infection and as I went to take the medicine I began thinking ""what if they're not trying to help you, they're trying to hurt you"", I do manage to break out of the suspicion and take the medicine but there have been times where I almost avoid taking the medicine.
At night or when I'm alone I always feel as if there is someone watching me and due to this I keep protection near me at night and when im alone.

"What is the point on life for some of us?
I am almost 25 (M), I started working and studying when I finished school with 16. 
I have been a honest person, with values, hard worker all the time, (I even worked so hard for couple seasons that ended up in the hospital for burn out). And still, I am nowhere in life.
I grew up in South America in a poor country, I was hungry of success of course, to help my family, to help my parents when they can not work anymore, to help my little sister to study the career that she wants. Emigrated to Europe, and still. I am just an average Joe, with a little. bit of money saved, working for a big company, with a normal boring life.
I did my military service and was very good at it, I was one of the most strong ones and intelligent in my unit, because I developed good leadership and other habilities and workout a lot too, motivating some people around me. But that does not help me at all, like, in this world it seems you just have to be a nerd on Software development or some thing like that , to be able to succeed financially and provide for your family and have a great life.

And now, I am living in Europe, in a country where its raining and snowing most of the time of the year, but with good and stable economy. Just depressed, alone, with my boring life. (When I could be on the Caribbean with sime friends if I just decided to take the other short way of making a living). 
 
I have some friends here in Europe that I made, but they just care about girls and partys and alcohol. Thay had a really easy and really quiet life, so it is difficult for me to really comnect with them, and I try sometimes to explain how I feel but they just say that their country is to perfect to be feeling like that. 
 I started to join some.sports clubs, to workout with people, but they dont put the work in, it is like people forgot what is like to push yourself sometimes. 
Everything around is just, average life, conversations without meanings, drinking alcohol, planning where to go on your 2 weeks trip vacation if you are lucky to recieve a bonus.

I just want to end my life, I have not done it because I know how much pain will be for my family, and they dont deserve that, and I have my two little brothers who look up to me and I just want to make them proud. But at this point I dont see what I have to do in order to succeed in this world.
Should I stay here and be miserable but stable? Should I move to other place where the climate would be better and I can enjoy life a little bit more even when I make less money? 

What career should I take? I was already in the military but it is not like USA where you can actually get deployed or something, so I am just a reserve soldier. I though about police academy but this country is so peacefull that it is just boring for me to be one. I though fire fighter but you can just be on a side, there is no like full time career.

I dont know if I should move to somewhere where I can have the Sea close and becoming a diving instructor or something like that interesting.

How do people succeed with 25 or 30. I dont get it, I mean, I have friends that are doing really good in life, they had wealthy parents and now have their businesses and everything, and I am happy for them, really. They are making money living a great life. 
I knew for me, was going to be a little bit harder because my situation is different. But bro, I have been working my ass off the last almost 10 years and I am still a loser. 

I think some of us would never be able to taste what been wealthy or having enough money to not worry about it is. 
I feel there is.people.like me who learns really quick and are intelligent, but not able to go and study 7years at university following a system. 
I just did a 2 years career in a trade in order to be able to get out there and live life sooner, that I could learn sooner. And I have been always promoted and stuff, but is still nothing that will take you to another level.

And nowadays when you think like sidehustle, is just ecom and dropshipping, things like that. People just sealing courses and stuff.

I know my parents would have loved for me to be a doctor, lawyer, or something like that. But thats not me.

I know  this post may be confusing a little bit, maybe there is too much information on different topics, but I just dont know what to do. I am just tired of life, I do everything right everyday to be a good human and a hard worker, and it seems that its not worth it. I grew up around people stealing with the goverment and doing some dr*g dealing and things like that. And I always though  that taking the other road (the honest one) will be always better.
 I just think I am wrong, those people live better than me, because I know them.personally. and maybe they just live under their own rules, they make life how they want.

I feel everyday the temptetion to take the shortcut, and use my knoweldge in some areas to just live life by my own rules, because it seems like doing the right thing and following the rules of society is just not worth it. 

I would just like to know what you think. How did you overcome things like that? Hiw are you able to find your path and be happy? Proud about yourself? 

And please, I dont need the ""be more positive it will change"" thing. I already did see a therapist a couple times and it did not help, and is really expensive. 
I know that no one can help me better but myself, but I just dont know what to do anymore.

"For years, I keep wanting to implement positive changes but haven't found success. Part of it is depression, which is being treated, and ADHD is just recently being treated, but it's still hard to do things I KNOW are good for me. I have inspiring revelations late at night that seem to be completely out of my reach the next day.

I want to eat healthier, exercise, have a small skincare routine, etc. I want prioritize buying myself things that I need rather than what I want. I want to read, learn a language, or meditate.  These are things I've recently learned people do as acts of comfort and self-care, and they enjoy it. But not me - some of my self-care and comfort habits are in junk food, doing the exact opposite of exercise, and struggling to brush my teeth twice a day. Even the healthy food I buy, most of it goes to waste because of the effort or it's less convenient than frozen dinner or fast food.


I can't quite get into doing the better things or feel like I'm doing them for me.  When I buy takeout or X hobby item (that at this point I'm just collecting instead of doing), I get the feeling like that's doing something for myself. But spending the same amount of money on new clothes that I need or a skincare product to get me started? Can't seem to do it, or if I do, I don't use it then feel bad about my current condition.

What I want is to get that same ""comfort"" feeling from the more uplifting things than the harmful/unhelpful things. Is it that I don't want these things ""bad enough"" so my brain doesn't steer me towards them?

I would love to hear the strategies, and even the baby steps, anyone has taken to do more uplifting comfort/self-care things. How do you even get started? How do you learn to love and get pleasure from these things and prioritize them over the other less-helpful acts?",3,adhd

"Hello everyone, I(21F) have been diagnosed with ASD since I was 5 years old. Along with ASD I have: Anxiety, Chronic Depression, PTSD, and ADD.

Ever since I can remember I've always had a strained relationship with my mother(neurotypical) and I've grown up wanting nothing more than to feel loved, cared, respected, and listened to by her ever since I could remember. As time went on, I slowly came to realize she was never going to, at least, not the way that I wanted her to. I wanted her to say, ""I'm proud of you,"" ""You're doing a great job,"" or even ""I love you,"" but she never said anything like that. Not unless I said ""I love you"" first, she half-heartedly said it back. She's the type that if you don't meet expectations, she belittles, shames, and berates until you have a breakdown. 

The worst part?

Every time I tried to leave the situation to calm down, she would follow and keep going. 

This is what it's been like recently: I got a new job(all by myself might I add, super proud of myself) - I was a CNA at a local hospital on 12 hour night shifts, but got a new job at a pediatric clinic that was days and a nice 8-5 - and recently I've noticed I get sick really easily. I got sick with a throat virus that the doctors couldn't do anything about, but let it take its course. This morning- after almost 2 weeks off from a fever coming off and on- I got really excited to go but had a low-grade fever(99.4¬∞F Oral), so I had to call out. My mom woke up and saw me home, came to me in my personal space without any warning, took my temperature and said: ""You're lying, you should have gone to work, your being lazy and I hope they fire you because I know I sure would if you were my employee."" (Note here, she's a high-ranking person in my county's health department).

She took it 2 hours after I had taken Tylenol and Pepto bismal to help(Note: my stomach was upset because she made me eat food that doesn't settle well with my stomach) She claims I'm recontaminating myself by staying locked up in my room and having the germs all over my bed spread. I don't think she's wrong, but her words recently have made my depression so horrible that I thought about getting their gun and ending it all.. I haven't had those thoughts in so long, and it really hurts to be having them again all over just because of a few words she's said. Before anyone suggests I talk to her: I've tried. All my life. Therapists, other family members, and friends have all told her to be a little nicer, but she never changes, and she probably never will. 

At this point, I'm mostly staying home because of my depression kicking my ass but I'm regretting staying home because of her treatment towards me. I have nowhere else to go, very little money since starting the new job, and feel super alone through it all since I'm the only person in my family diagnosed with ASD and have a difficult time reaching out for help because whenever I tried when I was under 18, my mom would step in, threaten that the police would take me away(a giant fear of mine she knew all about), and she would never come back to get me.

I'm really at a loss of what to do or what I can do.. I want to go back to work because I absolutely adore and love my job, but I fear I will get fired if I'm gone for much longer. I'm terrified of losing this job, I'm scared of what my mom will say/do to me if I even try to bring up my depression, and.. I'm just scared of everything right now. 

Thanks for reading this far, I hope you guys are having a good day/evening/night, and I hope you're taking care of yourselves. I'm willing to hear any suggestions ya guys have. 

Thank you again. ü§é",1,autism
"Trigger warning ‚ö†Ô∏è 

I've been having this issue usually when I'm home alone but not always. It's at its worse if my back is to an open room or hall etc. Even worse than that if I need to shower. For example tonight my wife works until 3a.m. I needed a shower and 3a.m. is too late anyway so I showered and I was so paranoid I kept the curtain open. I couldn't stand to close my eyes so I did my best to rinse my hair and face without closing my eyes and ended up having to for what I'm sure was just a few seconds but seemed much longer. Hurried to get them open despite getting some soap in my eye. This whole time I got my back to the back wall of the shower curtain and door open. Getting the floor wet. By the time I was done...which wasn't long cuz instead of doing one thing at a time and rinsing separately I did it all at once then rinsed...I was shaky and my heart was and still is racing and its been prob 20 minutes since I got out. This doesn't happen every time I'm alone. 

Sometimes it happens when my wife is home. Like if I'm doing the dishes with my back to the rest of the room I'm so paranoid and anxious if my wife comes in and speaks or touches me I jump out of my skin and my heart is racing for a while afterwards and I'll be shaky for a bit. 

For context I've gone through abuse as a kid I can only remember bits of it. I'm working with a therapist and on a wait list for a psychiatrist. My diagnosis so far are anxiety disorder, depression, social phobia, and ptsd. I haven't told my therapist about this paranoia or whatever it is yet because honestly I feel so dumb about it. I'm not scared to be home alone nor am I scared of my wife. Why does this happen? I'm so tired of all of this shit and I hate myself.

Edit: just also thought this. It's started happening at work too. Thanks to the social phobia I can't work around people so I work alone cleaning a 2 story office building. Lately I'm pretty jumpy at work. If a automatic light clicks off I jerk my head towards it immediately and feel jumpy for a second until I realize it was just the light. I see things out of the corner of my eye and when I look nothing is there.",5,paranoia

Any time I get into a panic attack, my heart will NOT slow down. I repeat will NOT slow down. This has turned into a huge problem. I am afraid of being anywhere far from help while my heart just keeps pounding 130-150BPM. I'm afraid that if I don't bring it down I will damage it or it will suddenly stop. Every time this happens, I go hours and hours. Most I've ever experienced was eight hours. I had to go to the ER to help bring it down. I was told it was sinus tachycardia which means it wasn't my heart causing the issue but anxiety. This has really damaged my mental health.

"It started when I was bored at school. I was imagining how my life would look like if I was in a relationship with my teachers or classmates (I often wonder how my life would look like if I did something differently. It's not because I'm not satisfied with my life but because I'm curious or just have nothing else to do). This combined with the fact I just changed schools and was excited to meet new people made me panic a lot because I was afraid I had a crush on someone else than my bf.


At one point a year ago I wanted to masturbate to having a threesome with me, my bf and someone else. For some reason I didn't just imagined a random person but one of my classmates. I've been paranoid I have a crush on that guy ever since. 


The thing is, I don't even remember that he exists when I'm not panicking. We don't even talk to eachother anymore because I don't want to.


My bf knows about all of this. He forgave me and still trusts me. I would never cheat, I was just a dumbass who thought that imagining things is harmless (I stopped doing that after I realised how wrong it was).


I'm not paranoid about cheating with only that guy, I'm afraid I'll cheat with every single man I talk to (which is pretty funny since I'm bi). Talking to someone even when it's my freaking cousin? Cheating. Doing makeup for my crossdresser friend? Cheating. Being hit on even though I'm telling this person that I'm not interested? Cheating. Sitting next to a man? Cheating. Looking at a man and thinking he has nice clothes or just looks good? Cheating. Ironically, thinking a girl looks gorgeous and sexy isn't cheating... Fangirling over a freaking character in a movie? Cheating. Hugging my own fucking boyfriend? Cheating. Wtf brain?? 


Unfortuneatley it started evolving. My female bff, who's the type of person who kisses her homies goodnight, told me she loves me. Nothing unusual. Like I said, she tells it to everybody. But now I'm afraid I had a crush on her in the past too even though when she offered to kiss me two years ago (she never kissed a girl before and wanted to know how it feels like) I refused. 


I know I don't have crush on someone other than my bf. I'm afraid I HAD a crush in the past even though I havent. This possibility disgusts me even though I don't think catching feelings towards someone else while being in a relationship is wrong as long as you don't cheat. I love my bf and would never forgive myself if I'd develop a crush on someone else even if I'd ignore it and would work on fixing our relationship.",5,paranoia

"I don't know if anyone sees this or will comment, but I'll give it my best shot.

I am 22 years old, and believe it or not, I have been suffering from depression for almost a decade.

I have nothing genuine,no friends or purpose to go on with life,I have had ADHD since I was 2 years old and major depression with anxiety diagnosed about 3 years ago,although in reality,it has been going on for quite some time.

I feel so exhausted, so angry and so lost, that I don't even plan to be in the future. I feel like hurting people, even though I know it's not right. If I knew today that I would never wake up again after sleeping in my bed, I wouldn't mind ..... Yes, I would be afraid, but it would give me the peace I so longed for.

The only reason I haven't taken my own life is because of the harm I might cause my family.

Sometimes I wonder if teachers,classmates or people who barely knew me today wonder where I am,what I'm doing,or if I moved on as that kid who breaks out of the mold and doesn't like to be like everyone else....

"Usually I‚Äôve learned pretty well to gauge through context and experience that a lot of things that people say/do have either a fairly consistent meaning, or don‚Äôt have a conscious meaning behind them at all, at least in how they‚Äôre communicating with me. Like, I can *typically* tell if someone is being passive aggressive, or if they‚Äôre hinting at something about me, or if they‚Äôre alluding to certain ideas. The problem is, there are still a lot of times in which I am either totally unaware of any sort of deeper meaning to things they‚Äôre saying like irony or if they‚Äôre even joking at all, or I overthink things because I‚Äôm afraid of the former scenario and end up coming to a wrong conclusion and having an awkward interaction. Also sometimes this leads to me overthinking and taking things personally because I just **genuinely** don‚Äôt know what they think or if they‚Äôre subtly communicating something that I‚Äôm missing. I hate not being able to tell if they‚Äôre joking, being insulting/annoyed or expressing an actual opinion, and I hate it even more when I read too deep into it and think that they‚Äôre doing something that they‚Äôre not because I feel dumb for not just knowing what they mean because apparently it was obvious, or at least it always feels that way in hindsight.",1,autism

"So, folks, apparently I'm not just quirked up and eccentric and a little bit bad at knowing when to make a joke. 

I am an 18 year-old man (of the younger variety) who recently took time off from college because of mental health concerns. In the time I've been off from school, I've been doing a great deal of therapy, as well as psychiatric evaluation/screening.

The verdict? I somehow have made it this far in life without any doctors managing to diagnose me with GAD, ADHD, or ASD. It's kind of a lot to have thrown at me. (Not to say that this is, like, a *wildly* late diagnosis. I know I'm not the only person to experience this sort of thing.)

My entire life I've excelled academically (despite being incredibly slow at reading, writing... all that stuff), enough so that I got into a fairly prestigious university. The theory among my current clinicians is that my above-average academic performance offset any concerns of psychiatric disorder.

But here I am, as an adult, learning that I'm not just quirky with it, I in fact have a brain that does not socialize, learn, etc, as do the brains of most people.

Recently I've been feeling more alone than ever, as a result of the realization that the diagnosis makes sense. I'm not simply silly/eccentric when it comes to dynamic social situations, I literally just don't know how to navigate them. I don't have much experience of forming meaningful, long-lasting emotional connections. It's hard to feel like my entire understanding of reality and self has been turned upside-down. 

I don't anticipate this gaining much traction, but for anyone who has read this far, thank you. And for anyone who has read this far *and* can perhaps relate or impart some advice... well, I'd love to hear from you.

"I met with some friends last night. I anticipated it as the highlight of my month; year even, and it was nice - I enjoyed it - although I got the feeling it was no big deal for my friends. They're functioning, busy people. I often go blank and feel emotionless with them. I'm lucky to have those few friends, they're beautiful and supportive people. I feel crushed today.

I'm 40 soon. I attempted suicide at 17 and it broke me, I think. That and a dour upbringing, and some physical illness in early adulthood.

I was so sure, when I made the decision. But some time after taking the tablets I.... changed my mind. I couldn't believe it, after being so sure. And now, after ~8 rounds of therapy over 20 years, I still can't make a single large decision and feel utterly condemned to my half-life. I'm an empty vessel. I've buried my feelings all my life and I no longer feel authentically.


If I can share anything positive it would be:
1) please don't attempt suicide, if you're thinking about it - truly confronting death permanently alters your brain chemistry. Some will recover well, some not. I'm not sure it's possible to truly confront death by simulation, and when it happens, you may change your mind halfway through. It can be very, very scary. Get help - humans aren't supposed to overcome all challenges alone.

2) therapy does help. My first ones didn't, but later I understood myself better and I kept trying, when I badly needed help. I'm at a place now where I tell my therapist everything. No secrets.",2,depression
"My parents divorced when I was less than a year old because he was a bipolar alcoholic who was very scary when he was in his angry phases, so I was a weekend custody kid. He was actually pretty alright around me, buying me toys, taking me places, but when he moved into his new girlfriend's home, he showed some of those angry phases. I stayed every other weekend and it was very stressful sometimes, but good at least 3/4 of the time. In those stressful situations he would shout and get mad, occasionally I could hear some stuff get knocked around, but sometimes he would end up pushing and grabbing my stepsister, who was a few years younger, and I occasionally had to stop it from escalating. It was overall stressful for me. One night I had to call the cops on him when he was drunk. It was a harsh environment sometimes, but not the worst, no torture, no belts, and frequent legit happiness.

I was always spared

After that I didn't see him for a while. He died 2021, and I never got any resolution to any of it. I learned recently that his family was abusive, even covering up how my uncle raped my dad. Last semester I had to read a book in class that dealt with abuse, and it retriggered all of my post traumatic feelings. 

Now, as I look around the world, it barely feels worth living for. Abuse, torture, rape, it's just fucking everywhere. Even before I became depressed I was hyper sensitive to people suffering, and now it's so bad I don't think I'll ever read a book, or hell, consume any non-musical media again. It's all just so terrible, but if I express this, I'm just a fucking emo teenager whining about shit. I know there is more to life than this, but it doesn't change the fact that it exists.

However, he mentioned that nowadays he is always feeling paranoid that his food is being poisoned. He even mentioned that he stopped working and is seeing a therapist. It is a sad to see him become like this. 

I am just looking for some advice as to how I, as a friend could help.

"i told him i wanted to be friends because he was hitting on me so i wanted to let him down gently, and he said that was fine. but actually i really fucking don‚Äôt want to be friends either. i‚Äôm at the stage where i have a support system that doesn‚Äôt cause me huge amounts of anxiety to be around but it‚Äôs taken me YEARS to build this system, and this guy talking to me has really put a huge damper on all of that. we‚Äôre just not compatible as friends, we don‚Äôt think the same way or have similar interests, and he always gets upset when i don‚Äôt reply quickly (my slow replies are a problem, but one that all my friends know about it - i have really bad executive dysfunction when it comes to texting back, it sometimes takes me weeks or months just to get back to the people I love and i hate when new people think they‚Äôre entitled to my quick replies. it takes a massive amount of mental energy from me). i know it‚Äôs my fault for telling him i want to be friends instead of just saying i don‚Äôt want to talk but 1) how the hell do you tell someone you see around that you don‚Äôt want to be even friends? 2) i still feel the need to be liked and 3) its silly but i believe all men are out to kill me so i didnt know how else to reject him. 

i just want to be left alone with the people i love, this is why i usually isolate myself, i wish id never spoken to him. i feel like i sound like a massive asshole because a lot of people would love more friends but im a huge introvert and the people i do let into my life, i let into my life because they‚Äôre incredibly compatible with me and i love spending time with them and they EASE my anxiety. 

i don‚Äôt want to be friends with someone who wants to make small talk and wants me to make it back and now i don‚Äôt know what to do and i have an anxiety attack every time he texts me. it‚Äôs not even his fault (im just mentally fucked) but he‚Äôs ruining my summer already",4,anxiety

"I suffer from really bad paranoia : and it‚Äôs just been getting worse more recently. Every comment, the slightest slip of wording sends me into a full on breakdown because I just automatically assume everyone in this world wants me dead and are going to stop at nothing to get me there. 

No one understands this either. I‚Äôve had several people complained to me about how the way I act effects them, but even after I try to explain that I‚Äôm paranoid and think they‚Äôre trying to hurt me, or ruin my life (I explain as nicely as I can and try and assure them it isn‚Äôt their fault I‚Äôm just mentally ill), all they think about is how it effects them. I try to apologise but then they say things that make me even more paranoid and before you know it it‚Äôs another suicide attempt because I‚Äôm so scared they‚Äôre gonna come to my house and try and kill me themselves.

"To begin this has been an incredibly trying couple of years. I am also using a throwaway account. I want to know in terms of me and my family if AITA or if they are. If they are I am willing to walk away.  
  
My parents are fairly well off, have a couple million for retirement and enough rainy day money if it should arise, multiple homes in different states that type of thing.....  
  
In high school I worked, in college I worked, between college and medical school I worked. None of this should be surprising in fact it is probably expected such is life. While in medical school admittedly overseas I was the victim of crime(s) by the medical school and forced out in good-standing. I did try and alert my parents/family that the medical school wasn't what we thought it was and that transferring would be a good option, used my connections to make it happen.... I needed cosigner's on loans and they refused to co-sign on it if I was transferring anywhere else. They also acted incredibly derogatorily once I was in to me in general. I am not sure what changed or why they choose this approach but they treated me with almost disdain. I get co-signing on loans isn't fun but on the other-hand they knew this had to be a possibility when I went to medical school. My life in the medical school wasn't good either and I was incredibly isolated had no friends there etc....  
  
When I was the victim of the crimes I did my best to alert them to it and I asked for help. I wasn't asking for money as I had enough for the situation, I just needed a phone call to a lawyer so they would talk to me using their connections. I fully understand if no crimes were committed and would admit if it was my mistake. I spent some time (alone) trying to get legal help to no avail and they absolutely refused to help. During this period I wasn't partying, hanging out with friends (I have none), just surviving and trying to handle things legally. I also wasn't legally able to work in the country if I wanted to. I eventually couldn't take it any more and went voluntarily to the psych ward for 5 or so days.  
  
I came home directly after.... They still refused any legal help. They live in the middle of the country and I am from a very cold wintery state. I have no car or any real transportation... Therefore, I applied for numerous remote jobs over a 6 month or so period. While dealing with the mental health issues arising from the crimes as well as continuing to do my best to handle things legally... They themselves admit crimes were committed and they just outright state they don't care. Suing ""wouldn't benefit them"". I was informed they won't spend a penny to help me in my future anymore.  
  
Again the same suicidal and overwhelming feelings returned and once again I checked myself into the psych ward. I will note I was overwhelmed, anxious, etc... And did cause some damage involuntarily after once again being denied any help. While in the psych ward I was informed they were kicking me out and therefore homeless (on my 29th birthday actually). Dealing with realizing I won't likely be successful, be a doctor, broke, etc... Has been a lot.  
  
\-Look I understand I am too old to be at home, I don't want it either. I have done in my opinion everything I can, including trying to prevent the situation in the first place. I just couldn't get a job. I get it's a strain and I am a burden, etc.... But the net result is I lost my family and extended family. I feel like I worked hard in my life and my family wasn't there for me. I will say the community now that I am homeless has been helping a lot. I would like your feedback who is right here? Thanks if I am wrong I would like to know it.",2,depression

"For some time now I've been experiencing the paranoid delusion that there is something of a war being fought over my consciousness. Some people/entities are good and fight to preserve my sense of self, others are awful and attempt to dissolve my ego. 

I've more or less trained myself over the years to not have any issue regarding maintaining a normal life despite mental health issues but there is significant persuasive techniques being used to make me feel as though none of the aforementioned is my doing and that I'm propped up by some team of people who aren't me.

So infantile of a thought. 

I'd imagine it to be quite paralyzing for others to go through something similar with the same degree of intensity.

I'm not going to kms or anything but if someone came in here to kill me I don't think I would resist. At this point its like I'm waiting for the last straw like  someone close to me dying then I might actually do it.right now I have no motivation to do anything I don't really have a good or decent relationship with anyone but my dad whenever I talked to my mum it most of the time ends up with us arguing. And I spend most of my time watching funny videos to be happy for a short period of time but it feels so temporary. I don't know if I'm a good person I've acted so shitty to my mother and sister and by shitty i mean constantly giving them a hard time with my attitude, my mum has hurt me in the past whether it was physically or mentally but that only changed when I got sick and I get really angry, like concerningly angry that whenever someone passes me off I have violent fantasies about hurting them. I also get paranoid like someone is going to torture me type of paranoid it happens often when I'm in bed I get too scared to turn around because I think somethings gonna rip my intestines out or something I'm in constant pain so my motivation is literally at 0. I noticed in 2021 that I thought I had depression I didn't want to self-diagnose myself but I found myself relating to almost all the symptoms it's like I'm stuck in the past because I find it so difficult to move forward and when I started getting depressed in 2020 I noticed I felt a chronic feeling of emptiness,  it felt different in the sense that nothing could fulfil my need like all my feelings felt so ungenuine and temporary even if I felt happy the feeling never lasted.

"TW: swearing, mentions of emotional abuse

I made a post awhile ago asking for advice about getting a diagnostic test. My main concern was my psychologists‚Äô bias. I was 100% correct.

My psychologist did not do the whole test. She only did the questionnaires, the IQ test, and the social interview. After the test, I discussed my experience with my boyfriend who has gotten an eval before, and he said she skipped MANY components.

She based most of her conclusions on my mother‚Äôs questionnaire. I have told my therapist that my mother is emotionally abusive and narcissistic for as long as I have been seeing her. I cried to her for help and she did NOTHING. And now, despite years of telling her not to trust my mother, she decides to base her entire diagnosis on my mother‚Äôs manipulative and biased questionnaire. However, even despite the manipulation, my mother‚Äôs questionnaire still had the flags. My mother said I don‚Äôt handle change well, i struggle to transition from one task to another, I only talk about the things I‚Äôm interested in and it‚Äôs very hard for me to talk about anything else, and I have a few narrow interests. But she chose to ignore all of that because I ‚Äúcommunicate so well‚Äù.

She threw out the questionnaire I filled out because I had ‚Äúconfirmation bias‚Äù.
Based on my IQ test, the social interview, and the questionnaires from my mother and teacher, I FIT THE CRITERIA FOR AUTISM. However, she said my social skills ‚Äúaren‚Äôt bad enough‚Äù. She compared me to her coworker, who she said is ‚Äúexactly like‚Äù me. She said verbatim, ‚ÄúI just wish you could talk to her, you would see, it‚Äôs just so different. You just communicate so well‚Äù. Having her A. Compare me to someone else saying I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot bad enough‚Äù and B. Talk down about someone because they‚Äôre autistic, was so fucking horrible. It took everything in me not to start sobbing.

The worst thing is, I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs my fault. I‚Äôve never spoken to her unmasked before. I haven‚Äôt spoken to my mother unmasked in at least 10 years. I‚Äôve never spoken to my teacher unmasked either. I‚Äôve been seeing therapists and counselors since I was 5, and I learned quickly how to act in a clinical setting. I unmasking with a therapist would be so fucking hard and so terrifying. I only unmask when I am alone or with my close friends. So I feel like her diagnosis is based on my mask, and it‚Äôs my fault.
Then there‚Äôs the part of me that thinks she‚Äôs right, and I do just have confirmation bias. So then I am back to where I started. I‚Äôm struggling. I can barely take care of myself, and I have no answers. All she told me was I‚Äôm a fucking genius, and I already knew that (honors student, 36 ACT, etc).  I‚Äôm just fucked up and I‚Äôll never know why.

"Hi, all! Long time lurker here. I was formally diagnosed with anxiety 6 years ago. Had it through high school, college, and my previous jobs. Currently, I'm on my third job at a bank and it has been the best employment I ever had so far. The pay, benefits, and workmates are all great. It has been 6 months since I started, but I have been failing and experiencing a lot of small mishaps due to my anxiety.

Everytime I have a bit of inconvenience, I have a small outburst of frustration, anxious during my daily tasks, and just on the verge of having a mental breakdown at my desk. Having my manager sit beside me does not help either, and I get berated over the smallest mistakes. I took a sick leave today for my mental health, and all I got was a bombardment of questions from my boss regarding the reports I submitted and got even told that we would have a 1-on1 talk tomorrow, so my mental health day off wasn't utilized properly enough.

I have these thoughts that people I was friends with in the past are making fun of me and mocking me, posting about me, relaying screenshots between each other about me, etc. I have had this happen to me before so it‚Äôs something that makes me quite anxious. I have paranoia about being hacked/having my info leaked too.

I also get worried people try to ‚Äòscope me out‚Äô and say things that trigger me and then make judgments on my character based on how I respond, and use the way I respond as proof of my character. I‚Äôve had people bring up words/phrases from music I like and had them mirror it back to me and the tone of it has felt like they‚Äôre trying to send me a message/make me reflect.

" Hey, I hope this is fine here, because I am concerned, confused and worried about a friend. About three years ago, she suffered a psychotic episode because she stayed up for way too long one time - as far as I knew, she had a sleep disorder she had to take meds for, and her family had a history of schizophrenia, so I suppose that's all that was needed.

However, after this, I feel her entire personality has shifted. Her episode warranted her having to seek treatment, which she has gotten a lot better from, but I almost feel like this psychosis never quite ""went away"" so to speak.

Comparatively, she's doing wonders since then - she's taken up learning another language and doing work related to that! She does have an amazing sense of determination when she intends on something.

However, she does have various delusions from time to time, and this is where I lose her. Thankfully they haven't been at the severity or intensity since that episode, but every now and then it seems her mind will focus on a very specific thought and she becomes very agitated with others.

As an example, I stream games as a hobby on the side. She wanted to join in but mentioned to NOT stream one game in particular. Streaming this game, according to her, will lead to me being swatted on stream.

At first I tried to ask questions taking the delusion legitimately - the internet can be really terrible so I thought it was some internet trolls but there isn't some wide mass swatting going on for this game: in fact, it really isn't played that much and if it was, it's getting 5 viewers max based on twitch.

The one thing I've learned is that trying to ration or logic through a delusion can actually be more harmful, so I try to not do that. I don't attempt to dismiss her thoughts but any time I ask, ""What do you mean?"" or ask her to explain it further she gets mad at me, tutting, sighing, and telling me vague things like ""The walls have eyes"" and ""You have much to learn"" She gets mad that I don't simply ""get it"" and that I can't read her mind. When I ask her to tell me what she's thinking (not even trying to judge her thoughts, just trying to know what they even are), she will give a vague statement like above and so I'm more confused, and then my confusion pisses her off.

While this example isn't really hindering me, I'm worried what might happen if she develops specific thoughts that would be damaging to herself or others. Our friendship has deteriorated because it's become impossible to have a discussion; a lot of it is now lecturing me to do certain things based on her paranoia. Any resistance to following along leads to condescension and her yelling, which is probably where my biggest problems lie - after the episode, her aggression has ramped up - while I don't feel like I'm in physical danger, her patience for people ""not getting it"" is non-existent and her response is to yell at them and treat them like they're idiots for it. This is the most frustrating bit for me, because I do have a sensitivity to any yelling coming from an environment like that, so my response due to my own personal shit is to back off. But in backing off, it's literally causing me to keep my distance, because I don't want to get yelled at again.

I suppose what should I do, if I should do anything? Is there something wrong with how I'm approaching her, leading to this? It's hard to begin to understand what she's feeling but I want to try in a way that isn't going to make things worse, which I'm worried I might be doing here. Any insights or thoughts would be much appreciated",5,paranoia

"So I been chatting with AI and asked it to make a poem about Schizophrenia (I take NO credit for poem; all was done through AI Chat). I thought you guys will enjoy it. Here it is: 

&#x200B;

 

The mind is a labyrinth, a maze so complex, A place where reality can become perplexed. Where sounds, and sights, and voices converge, A place where the self can become submerged.

Schizophrenia, a word so hard to say, A condition that can take one's self away. Voices in the mind, so real and so loud, Whispers and screams that make one feel cowed.

The world becomes strange, distorted, and blurred, Paranoid thoughts leave one feeling absurd. The mind plays tricks, a reality that's fractured, Leaving one feeling alone and captured.

The struggle is real, but there's hope in sight, Treatment and support can make things right. With understanding, compassion, and care, We can help those with schizophrenia repair.

The mind may be complex, but it can heal, With medication, therapy, and a love that's real. The road may be long, but there's light ahead, A chance to live, to love, to dream instead.",6,schizophrenia

"  
Crippling indecision. Depressed people can be consumed by an overwhelming inability to make decisions. Everything is questioned right down to the granular level. This constant self-questioning and evaluating leaves the person paralysed and unable to function. For instance the depressed person might make a decision to take a shower. What follows next is a tsunami of questions ‚Äúshould I wait to later‚Äù ‚Äúwhat if I don‚Äôt have the energy‚Äù ‚Äúwhy do I need a shower anyhow I am not going anywhere?‚Äù This can literally play out for hours and hours until the sufferer finally says something along the lines of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù Needless to say this self-doubting will be followed by recrimination and more than likely self-hatred for being so weak, which in turn feeds the depression, an almost perfect vicious circle.  
Critical self-judgment. Depressed people don‚Äôt really see themselves as ill. They rarely give themselves that good a break. Instead they can very easily view their depression as a personal weakness they could overcome if they just tried hard enough. This train of thought is perpetuated by other people telling them to just snap out of it, or a thousand other platitudes they have heard a million times before. Instead of seeing this nonsense for what it really is they turn it internally and berate themselves for having a character flaw that doesn‚Äôt allow them to function like normal people. They don‚Äôt need other people to be judgmental as they are expert at doing it to themselves a thousand times worse.  
Interaction is painful. It‚Äôs something most people take for granted. Interaction, conversing and relating are things we mostly don‚Äôt have to think about. For someone suffering depression this natural ability can become excruciatingly difficult. In most instances we pull on a socially acceptable mask and pretend everything is fine. We are present but not really there if you know what I mean? We can be surrounded by people and feel painfully alone lost in the quicksand of depression. We are experts at hearing but not really listening. We are ninja warriors at the art of avoiding talking about how we are feeling. Everything is great and fine when in reality we are dying inside. While you are talking about how your day went we can be reliving the worst moments of ours and at the same time making sure you don‚Äôt see our pain.  
Fear of the future. Ask a depressed person what they think their future looks like and they will more than likely tell you ‚Äúmore of the same or worse‚Äù Depending on the severity of the depression a sufferer doesn‚Äôt see a future. A future is something other people have not them. Their future is the struggle they are going to have tomorrow morning when they wake up and think to themselves ‚Äúplease, not this again, I don‚Äôt think I can go on like this‚Äù We think about the future by comparing it to our past. It‚Äôs very difficult to imagine a nice future when all the evidence from the past is telling you it isn‚Äôt going to happen. For the vast majority of people a future is something they can feel optimistic about. For a depressed person it can feel like something to dread. Something filled with hopelessness and helplessness. Not living in the present is extremely common; it can feel like we are adrift in an ocean of misery and torment stuck in a no man‚Äôs land of despair and apathy. Once hope is lost, everything is lost.  
Even the good times can be bad. Imagine not even being happy at the birth of your child or in fact any landmark occasion that marks a supposedly joyous event in our lives. A chronically depressed person doesn‚Äôt have to imagine it. For millions of people this is a reality and is something that is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. Guilt and shame which feed the depression are experienced in equal measure. They know on a rational logical level they should be happy, unfortunately they have lost the ability. Their happiness has been replaced by numbness and indifference which they have seemingly no control over. I well remember when I was going through my own depression someone asking me what I would do if I won a million pounds. Without even having to think I said I would probably give it away as no amount of money could ever make me happy again. These are the depths a depressed mind can sink to.  
Observing not participating. There is a song from the movie midnight cowboy sung by Harry Nilsson that I think sums up depression beautifully. Here it is. ‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs talking at me, I don‚Äôt hear a word they‚Äôre saying only the echoes of my mind‚Äù. Severe depression is probably like having an out of body experience. You can see and hear everything happening around you but you are not part of it. It can feel very lonely and isolating to realise that you are a spectator to your own life. Your heart aches to be part of something that will make you feel like a human being again but your depressed mind is constantly telling you that this is for other people to experience, not you. Just like the song you literally do hear what everybody is saying but you are lost in mire of the echoes of your own mind. It can feel like you are living a life where the pause button is permanently pressed. A state of non-existing if you like.  
Dysfunctional relating and relationships. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the rate of breakups and divorces amongst people suffering depression is quite high. Relating to another human being requires motivation that is sadly lacking as they struggle with their illness. Maintaining relationships requires effort and energy both of which have been sucked out of them. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs because they have lost the ability to care and they feel powerless to do anything about it. When you don‚Äôt care if you live or die yourself it can be very difficult to care for someone else. They are trapped inside the prison of their own mind desperately hoping for someone or something to set them free. For a depressed person isolating themselves can be preferable to relating even though they absolutely know this is doing them real harm. A depressed mind doesn‚Äôt think rationally it will push away the very thing that could help them. It can see relationships as having very little consequence, even though the opposite is true, such is the contradictory nature of depression.  
Lack of autonomy. The most important thing to every human being on the planet is having a sense of autonomy or control over their lives. When depression comes into a person‚Äôs life that sense of control is taken away. Choices start to become very limited and the person‚Äôs world can become microscopic. In an effort to fill that emotional void many people turn to food, alcohol, drugs, shopping anything in fact that alleviates, however temporarily, the crushing feeling of being out of control of their own destiny. These strategies can of course bring about bigger problems to add to the depression. A sense of meaning or purpose to their lives is missing and in its place is a gaping hole. This can set some people off on a journey to find that missing piece in the vain hope that it will complete them. They never find that thing that will make them whole again because it doesn‚Äôt exist. It is a depression generated wild goose chase that can easily turn into an obsession. Depression holds out the promise that if you could just find that thing outside yourself everything would return to normal and the depression would vanish. Unfortunately as many people have found to their cost, including myself, it‚Äôs simply not true. The answer lies internally not externally.  
There are a countless different ways that people can experience depression. There are however quite a few commonalities between the different types. If any of the above resonated with you it‚Äôs time to seek professional help. These types of symptoms won‚Äôt be exercised away, prayed away, snapped out of or ignored. If left unaddressed they have the ability to devastate your life for a very long period of time.

"A few months ago I decided I wanted to start working out and found myself a nice few exercises to follow on YouTube. It wasn‚Äôt too intense, but I wanted to start off small and practice setting goals and routines, so that I could slowly add on to it and not feel overwhelmed. And honestly? For a while, it was going pretty well. It became a bit of a habit for me. I started to see tiny results. I felt good. 

And then for some reason I decided to just stop. I was like, ‚Äúeh, it‚Äôs fine if I skip today, I‚Äôll just do double the workout tomorrow‚Äù or ‚Äúa few days won‚Äôt make a difference in my gains‚Äù and now I‚Äôm sitting on my ass a few months later with all of my progress reverted. I haven‚Äôt worked out in a long time, and I feel worse than ever. Why did I insist on suddenly stopping, just when I was developing a healthy routine and feeling good about myself? Why did I let myself do that? I know I need to push myself to be better or whatever the hell in order to combat my depression but every single time I try I just give up and end up setting myself back. Whenever something starts going well I immediately fuck it up. Why even try anything at this point? I know it‚Äôs not going to work anyway. I doubt I‚Äôll be trying to set another workout routine anytime soon, that‚Äôs for sure. I‚Äôll just be disappointed. 

Sometimes (all the time) I really really hate myself.",2,depression

"Hello everyone,

I want to say that I appreciate you taking the time in advance to read this and for giving any feedback.

From birth, I have had severe food allergies, some of which I have developed later in life. I am currently allergic to several of the most common allergies recognized in North America. Navigating these food allergies has presented its unique set of challenges throughout the years, but none of which I have not been able to navigate and overcome. Although, there is one challenge in particular which I have not been able to deal with and it has been progressively consuming more of my daily life.

Over the last several years I have experienced what I would best describe as anxiety attacks, although I have never discussed this with a medical practitioner. The anxiety is perpetuated by an underlying fear of having an allergic reaction but it often lacks any basis for being concerned. Whether eating something new for the first time, sitting on a bench outside, or driving home from work; there is no one trigger which causes the anxiety attack to occur.

To describe the way that I feel during these situations, I will experience a variety of allergy-related symptoms that can be associated with my anaphylaxis. Some of these symptoms which occur either simultaneously or on their own include: irritation or swelling in the throat, swelling in the face, difficulty breathing through the mouth or nose, difficulty swallowing, and swelling in the tongue or irritation in the mouth area. There have been other less common symptoms but are not as associated with anaphylaxis.

Although I experience what I believe to be anaphylactic symptoms, none of these have ever actually happened. Everything which I have felt has been perpetuated through the anxiety of having a reaction and therefore I am made to believe that it is happening at the moment. I have never had an allergic reaction and therefore only understand what the symptoms look and should feel like.

These anxiety attacks have been affecting my ability to focus and live life without an underlying fear embedded in all of my actions. I know that when these scenarios occur that I have nothing to worry about, and am able to recognize that in the moment. Yet, I am unable to control the situation and the only thing that resolves it is a prolonged period of time to pass to indicate there is in fact no issue.

When this occurs it creates an immense amount of fear and stress that I can no longer handle. It has been approximately ten years of getting worse and upon recognizing that this is an issue that I need to address I would like to seek help. I plan to discuss these concerns with a medical practitioner, but until such time, I would like to hear if others have shared a similar experience and how they have navigated this challenge. Any suggestions or comments are appreciated.

Thank you in advance.",4,anxiety

"TL;DR- can‚Äôt make friends, tried one last time and it didn‚Äôt work no matter what I did. Maybe too nice for my own good.

ETA: Also, the friend is NB, hence the they/them/their pronouns.

I don‚Äôt even know if this even belongs on this sub but I like to think I‚Äôm not alone here‚Ä¶

 
Like a lot of people on the spectrum, I have a very hard time with friends. Not just making them, but keeping in touch or keeping them in general. I‚Äôll be too weird, too insecure, too standoffish, etc. I try to make the effort, but my words get misunderstood when I‚Äôm trying to make jokes or try to join in on a conversation, and something happens and all of a sudden I‚Äôm out of the friend group or at least marginalized. I‚Äôve tried many ways to approach people but it never got much better. I‚Äôm used to it by now (I‚Äôm 38), but today I have decided to stop trying. 

I was set to give up a few years ago (pandemic/quarantine kind of made it obvious), but I went back to work and I met a new coworker. We hit it off, but they left a few months later. I decided then that I would give one last push to make a genuine friend that will help make life worth living again, instead of just surviving. It worked! We started hanging out after going back and forth online, and it was easily one of the best times of my life. This time, I thought, will be good. They started dating someone new, no problem, I‚Äôll stay supportive. They break up, I‚Äôd lend a shoulder. We‚Äôd just relax and watch YouTube videos to pass the time (we could only be so social before it exhausts us both- another great reason to keep the friendship alive). 

Then the one thing I feared happened‚Ä¶they were moving to another state for work. Obviously I was happy for them. But I knew that it would lead to me slowly but surely losing touch with them and I would be missing that one bit of light in my world. But I supported them and sent them off with a smile. But! This seemingly wonderful human insisted we stay in touch and offered to fly me over to visit the first chance they get. 

And it actually happened. We would get together every other month or so to go to a concert or see some sights or simply just watch a movie. The times we aren‚Äôt physically together we coordinate a watch party and watch random shows together online. It was working. I was eventually declared their best friend, and it felt nice. I was happier and lively, according to my coworkers (I don‚Äôt really notice it on my own). 

About a year goes by like this and suddenly my friend got let go. It was devastating for them and I immediately decided to take off work and go comfort them. I‚Äôm not the richest in the world, but I pooled all my funds and went, but something was off. They pretty much expected me to help clean up and I accidentally made a mess with a plate and it broke. They went ballistic. I apologized immediately and said I would reimburse them for the damage. I then started to clean up, and this is where my anxiety kicks in, because I already made a wrong move and i don‚Äôt want to make another. But they kept on and on how they can‚Äôt replace it (it was an inherited gift apparently) and takes the broom from me and cleans up. I said again that I was sorry and that I‚Äôm trying to help them feel better and they just said ‚Äúwell, this isn‚Äôt helping me, is it??‚Äù I made a point that I dropped everything to lend a hand because they have lost their job and is having a hard time (their words), and the one phrase I hate hearing from people was uttered. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask you to do that!‚Äù 

In my mind, friends (especially ones who call YOU their ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù) are there at the first sign of trouble. I will do almost anything if I can physically do it. Now, I truly understand boundaries (I‚Äôm a rare one and actually like hugs, but I‚Äôll refrain from hugging those who don‚Äôt want them), but I didn‚Äôt think I was overstepping. I didn‚Äôt just surprise them by showing up on their doorstep; in fact, they were so grateful to have company as they live alone. They could have said no if they wanted to be alone or with someone else. So that phrase took me aback. All I said was ‚Äúokay, guess I‚Äôll leave you alone all depressed instead like a BEST FRIEND should, right?‚Äù Trying to make them see that i was trying to be a friend. The next phrase all but broke me. 

‚ÄúYou did it for yourself.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt know what they meant, but I took it as ‚Äúyou‚Äôre selfish‚Äù. I was so stunned I couldn‚Äôt reply. I don‚Äôt see how I was selfish except me trying to keep this friendship alive. I thought we both were. I packed my stuff and left the next morning. 

It‚Äôs been almost a month since and we‚Äôve been occasionally texting as if nothing had happened. But for me I don‚Äôt see how I can continue. I would try confronting them about how their words hurt but I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôll have another argument that will just guilt me into submission. Just the thought of seeing them either in person or on video makes me feel ill. I tried as hard as I could to be kind and loyal and friendly all around, and it took one mistake to mess it up. I kept sidestepping to avoid being too clingy or too intrusive, but none of it mattered. Maybe I‚Äôm just bad with words and communication. Maybe I have shitty judgment and make the wrong friends, I don‚Äôt know. 

I‚Äôll just try to keep going by just doing what I must and saying as little as I can. It seems to be the best chance for a decent outcome for me. In hindsight I was probably just a convenient person to walk on, and I mistook it for someone who genuinely accepts me for me. At least I got to be truly myself for a little while, so that‚Äôs something, right?",1,autism
"I feel like I want to die. But Theres no way I would kill myself because I dont believe theres anything after. Im constantly flipping between ""Im just going to waste away"" and ""if Im going to give up I might as well do whatever I want because it doesnt matter anyway."" Even when I can put a positive spin on things it doesnt last long and I go back into pessimistic mode.

I cant talk to anyone, even about things that arent problems, because I always feel like no one cares or understands what Im saying. I also do not want to bother people because I know everyone is going through their own shit and they dont need mine as well. Ive tried several councillors over the years but it always feels like theyre just going through a checklist and dont listen to what Im actually saying.

Things dont seem as good as they used to be. Doing the things that make me feel good just feel like distractions stalling me from figuring out what to do because I dont know what to do. 

I dont feel like Im a part of THIS as in EVERYTHING. I dont feel connected to myself alot, or to my environment.

"I‚Äôm being a bit short and brief with this because Reddit crashed midway through writing the first one and I‚Äôm a bit upset about it

I‚Äôve always had a bit of paranoia ever since possibly 5th grade. Although back then it was a minor ‚Äúsomeone is watching me‚Äù when I walked home from school, and eventually I grew out of it. After that I‚Äôve had an issue with trust. Unless there‚Äôs is reasonable evidence that someone isn‚Äôt lying, their words mean next to nothing to me. Whenever my own mother says ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù, I dont believe her. I‚Äôve been like this since I remember. Eventually I got a gf and it all settled down for a bit. I felt like I could be truthful with her. I placed my trust in her and told her things I‚Äôd never tell anyone. Mid way into last year, her friends started to test my patience and found one of my weak points, Anger. They abused the fact that I was easily angerable as much as possible. They used it to lie to her and pretend like I was a mentally unstable psycho. And they won, she broke up with me, which has enhanced these issues greatly. If there is one thing I‚Äôm certain in all of my distrust, theories, and paranoia, they did it on purpose. Once is an event, twice is a coincidence, daily is a pattern. And after the fact, she completely changed how she acted to one of our mutual friends, allowing her friends to do the same shit they did to me (although I didn‚Äôt find out until much later). After our breakup my life went terrible. They, in a way, gaslit me into believing it was entirely my fault. It made the original issue of not believing people‚Äôs words 100x worse. Even now, I dont believe some of my friends and don‚Äôt even hang out anymore with one of them just because I don‚Äôt think they like me.

Now we get to the part I‚Äôm most unsure of. Recently got into a fight with a friend. They let their friends pass on some shit I didn‚Äôt like. Nothing I‚Äôm paranoid about, they were being assholes and he didn‚Äôt want me calling them out on it. Well it lead to us falling out, then randomly he added me on discord. Never got a text from him and minutes later he unfriended me. I texted him to ask why he did that and he said ‚ÄúYou're too paranoid people are out to get you and I don't want to deal with that again‚Äù. The thing that gets me is I dont know what he means by that. I never was paranoid or thought any of them were out to get me. All I noticed was the pattern of him being a dick to myself and multiple other people. But multiple people, even my closest current friend, said that I was acting paranoid. It worries me about what I was acting like to make them think that.

Finally I should talk about my worries about being alone. I hate being alone. I can‚Äôt stand it. Past 2 or 3 times I‚Äôve been alone I swear I‚Äôve heard a door open/slam. And generally speaking when I‚Äôm not distracting myself with YouTube or a video game, I feel like I‚Äôm being watched. And to a way higher degree than when I was in 5th grade.

I don‚Äôt exactly know what I‚Äôm looking for here. I dont know if there‚Äôs anything that can be said, can be done, or anything that could help get rid of my issue. It might be just to vocalize some thoughts I‚Äôve had. I dont know anymore. Thanks for reading if you did. Have a nice night",5,paranoia

"For context ,I'm from Hungary but I love in Italy since I was 6 because my mom found a job here.
I passed trough a lot of shit during my life,my weak ass father killed himself,I changed schools like 6 times,I had to go to live in Germany for 3 years with my grandparents,to then come back to Italy,in a different place.
Fast forward to middle school,never been good at a single thing except English.My votes were always terrible because I didn't see the point in studying stuff I'll never need in life.During those 3 years I got a fell in love with a girl but got rejected, twice.That hurt ,a lot, but I didn't want to talk about It to anyone ,especially my mother cause we already had enough trouble to go trough(she and her bf broke up,they still are In contact and good friends tho,they just didn't understand each other well).
Middle school ends.My mother worked as a barista at the time and she barley could pay rent ,she wasn't sure if she could pay a highschool for me.To my ""luck"" she eventually hooked up with his asshole that's she could use as a credit card to an extent ,on thing pulls the other and we move in with him.That place sucked ass.Small city,nothing really to do,not even a normal park.Whatever,I basically just stayed in my room all day.

Now it takes a bad turn.
Slowly but surely ,he came out to be a narcissist fuck ,he fucking ruined our life's ,but we couldn't escape cause my mother fell pregnant.My sister was born eventually ,and the fuck just became more and more psycho.He hated me,he always game me bad looks,alywas had some shitty comment to say about me because I never go out(don't have friends there and wasn't gonna get any).

Fast forward a little

Things escalated,he wanted my sister and cut us out.My mother managed to find a lawyer that's Hungarian and he was understanding enough to do the job upfront with payment later on the road.


After some more suffering ,we are free.We went to live in a BNB for 3 ish months ,the fuck gives use 400‚Ç¨ monthly child support.Stayimg at the bnb sucked ,we lived all 3 in one room ,no privacy,no silence,and I was working at the time Aswell.

Thank god ,literally.And acquaintance of my mother knew the cities church caretaker who had an apartment for rent.We moved in ,the place was underwhelming honestly,pretty old,the  guy rented it to bypasses occasionally ,people who would spend a week or so here.It tool a lot of cleaning to make it shine.


Fast forward to the present.
Here I am 21 male,working to maintainy family.

Let's talk about me now;
I work a 7 to 5 ,forklift operator and wearhouse worker.I liked it at the start ,but with months passing I hate it more and more.I don't know why ,I just keep committing little stupid mistakes that make me look like a retarded to my superiors.No matter how hard I try ,there is no one day without either me saying something stupid to my coworker that makes me look like a retard or having trouble with something stupid.

This last week has been really ruff for me mentally.The supervisors always pretent too much,there is always good much work and organized the warehouse is a mess cause the stock amounts make no sense.

I stated to feel a pain inside of me,the fact that I have to live trough life,the mere fact that I exists is giving me a pain in my soul.I snapped twice this week.While in bed I just went blank for a minute and realized that I can't get out of this.I just screamed ,screamed untill it hurt ,then cried.

"I (18M) has been struggling with my self esteem for years now. It's at an all time worst though. 
I've been taking medication for years. I've tried maybe 2 dozen different meds in the past 7ish years and nothing has really helped. I've tried therapy for years and that hasn't helped. 

I've tried basically everything and I'm not sure what to do. I just want to matter to someone. I just want to be kissed by someone. I want to be someone's cuddle buddy. I've never dated and I'm a fucking loser. 

People say love yourself and I ask how and I never get an answer. How does one even love themselves if nobody loves you back? It's embarrassing. 

My time is running out since I can't talk to people out of school. It's weird to approach them. They didn't go outside to meet some random guy. They went out to do errands or something.

But can someone help me? What should I do about the whole loving yourself situation. If this helps I am autistic and I do have borderline personality disorder.

"Some background: from about 10-13, my night would go like this. I'd fall asleep at 10pmish and wake up at about 2-3am. Things that wanted to hurt me, I thought, would come through my window and door, so I'd spend whole nights feeling watched by them, checking the window and then the door, before breaking eventually, dashing across the hallway to my parents and saying I had a bad dream (usually had).

Now for the current issue:

- Last night I had an episode like this for the first time in ages - something was watching me wherever I turned, plotting to harm me. My suicide note, from an abandoned one earlier that day, turned up next to me but I'm certain I didn't put in my bed! I only felt safe under the covers.

- On zoom calls, I never believe the camera is off, even when everything indicates it is and will often turn the device away from me. 

- I get the feeling my phone is listening to me - that I'm either still on the phone and people didn't hang up to listen to me or somehow I've been connected without knowing, and have to check the call history all the time. I talk to myself to work through things but don't want people to hear them. I get this feeling only alone.

"Hello all, thank you for happening upon my post this evening,

I just wanted to write a quick message, not feeling particularly great but need to finish some tasks today so can't spend too long with an elaborate post

I do experience irrational paranoia inside the house when i am severely in a confused state (which is intertwined with my condition), as when you get confused as i do (and maybe you do) its easy to work yourself up and essentially become frightened of anything as nothing quite makes sense

However whenever i am out, especially when alone and away from concentrated civilisation, i have shear fear that puts me in an unnecessary hyperaware state. I feel this fear because of my state of vulnerability with my conditions, which are quite debilitating.

Recently, i was in a place where there were civilisation around but not inside. I happened upon a man, not sure if he knew i was there but he was overweight, and had full-cuffed earphones on, he may even have been singing. If i had hostile intentions, lets just say nobody else was around. It stuck with me because i have no idea how one achieves that level of ignorance

My rational brain assumes its because as most of his experience outside has been positive, or perhaps he hasn't had anything happen once, what reason does he have? Ignorance is bliss. Neglect to mention though, as long as the mind was iron-willed, he could easily defend himself if aggressively approached in some way, or atleast not be defenseless

But i don't have that ability to be ignorant, and personally i think it'd be fine if i could rationally ensure there is no threat, and just be aware of my surroundings, but this fear is irrational. I can visually discern a threat but i don't feel at ease after verifying there is no threat. My medical conditions (Which are not all confirmed and some are still being investigated) puts me in a severely vulnerable state. I'm talking sensitivity to heat (basically heat= painful itching (sometimes) & worsening symptoms, e.g cognitive problems worsened), trouble balancing, slow processing and thinking, forgetfulness (So i'll have to often rescan my environment anyway as i forget it so often) fatigue and tiredness on the daily, etc. So this isn't a normal situation to begin with

This fear has probably come up because i know there are bad people in the world, but also i have pretty uncommon problems, even with speaking, listening and remembering, so i guess i also discern someone speaking to me as a threat because how i'm belittled and how i feel speaking to people that don't understand my health problems, which has been most.

I'm doing my best to shake this feeling, i'm trying to go out everyday and hope repeated exposure will do something, i have hopes it'll improve but was wondering what advice this community may have? I think i can understand the reasoning behind much of my behaviour, but unfortunately it is my health conditions cure-dependent, and there's not much i can do about that right now, so my ears are wide open for alternative ideas

This probably isn't a typical case around here, i appreciate that. But any advice you could think of to help out would be much appreciated, thank you!",5,paranoia

I study so hard because I'm afraid that if I do worse than others, I'll be more vulnerable to harm. Even today I thought someone was recording me. Friends? Potential enemies. I can't shake the feeling that reality is a test for me, worse, a test I failed. I deserve to be punished. They're all dangerous. You're not reading my mind, are you? I'm alone in this world.

Probably in a cute little cottage home or cabin... maybe a cool tree house or a home by a flowing river or lake. I can bring my cat with me and smoke my weed while I listen to my favorite music. I don't know how I'd do it yet but it's not a choice that feels very distant. I'm thinking before the year ends. I'm just really .. really tired. Tired of trying. Tired of failing. Tired of repeating this cycle of constant highs and lows. Tired of being mentally disabled and living in a world that doesn't care about people like me.

I wouldn't have been in the state I'm in right now because of my family. I would have done things and been across the world right now if I went on a different path. 
I don't want to be labeled with anything so I've tried therapy a couple of times and make sure I don't share too much because of my past family trauma and my sister's diagnosis' of bipolar and anxiety and my mom's depression and dads and such I know I have depression but I don't want the label. 
I get waves of BAD depression every now and then and I just want to die... I hate my life, I want to be alone, I want to leave my husband, I want to just ghost everyone and disappear and die. But I can't. My husband won't survive without me, we've talked about it before and he would probably kill himself because of his depression if I ever died. My sister probably would too. My parents depend on me for everything and I practically raised my sister because my parents didn't know what the fuck they were doing.

"So basically I (F20) met a guy(M23) on tinder. He lives across the world, I‚Äôm from Kazakhstan, he‚Äôs from the US. We got really close through texting over more than a half a year and we had one call. I would tell him about my problems, he‚Äôd tell me about his and all of that. 

Then one time I complained how I had a hard time making a living on my job. So he offered me money. First time I refused, but next time he insisted and I took it. It was $120. Then he gave me $200-400 every month (april-june). And when I got uncomfortable with it, I told him I don‚Äôt want it anymore.

We planned living together in September for a month. He‚Äôs going to come to Kazakhstan, which is kind of weird in the first place. And I was excited for it to happen but now I have this sick fear about him being some murderer because of how weird our relationship is.

Also he gets very offended if someone doesn‚Äôt reply to him or leaves him on read, and it‚Äôs understandable. But these occurrences make him doubt humanity. 

He also doesn‚Äôt have any friends irl, hasn‚Äôt had a girlfriend and is a virgin. He has trouble with relationships because he doesn‚Äôt really like a lot of people. So he decided to stay away and be a loner because he‚Äôs more comfortable with that.

And one more thing, he‚Äôs very into serial killers and darknet, reads stuff about them. He says it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs interested in psychology and history. But it kind of makes me anxious.

And lately I just don‚Äôt really want to talk to him because he makes a big deal of people stopping talking to him (online). He thinks everything is a waste of time if he stops talking to someone. And he can be really mean when he has these episodes, tho he always apologizes afterwards.

But generally he was sweet to me and supporting, willing to talk about my problems. He helped me in many ways over this time that we‚Äôre friends.

But now I started worrying because I realized that I‚Äôm going to live with a guy I never met irl and could know nothing about, like what if he lied to me? What if it‚Äôs he‚Äôs evil plan? I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ paranoid.

I‚Äôm scared to calling it all off because he already bought the tickets, booked a place and started packing. I don‚Äôt want to be that friend who cancels last minute.

"Hi, I am a 22 year old female. I am in the deepest depression I have ever experienced.

I got my degree this year and am in the middle of my Honors program. I have put so much pressure on myself for the last 5 years of studying, that I've been suppressing my anxiety and depression almost the entire time. I have been in fight or flight mode for years, and am so burnt out I can't get myself to do anything. A few weeks ago, I was put under a lot of stress with my studies and the flood gates just opened without warning. Now, I can't open an assignment, textbook or anything academic related without having debilitating waves of panic attacks. It feels like my mental capacity has been deteriorating exponentially since then. I can't enjoy anything I love anymore either. I am lucky enough to have a very supportive family, however none of them have experienced this (aside from my sister that has moved away). They do not understand how crippling my anxiety has been. I have no apatite, and I cant even get myself to go shower, let alone get any work done. It has come to the point where thoughts I am having thoughts of self harm and even sometimes suicidal ones. I've secluded myself from all of my friends, and only see my boyfriend and family (whom I have been loving with throughout my studies). I am at the point where I feel nothing but pain. It feels like I can not mentally function.

I have no idea what to do about my studies. I have adopted an avoidant lifestyle, even though I love what I am studying. I feel like I need to terminate or pause my studies until next year, and give myself time to work through all of this, but am so embarrassed about my mental state that I don't know what to do. I have a therapy appointment on the 22nd of this month, but I have no idea how to make this decision without counseling, and I need to make this decision as soon as possible because of the financial implications of my studies. I don't know what to do.",2,depression

"Absolutely no fucking matter what I do, weather it's out of respect or kindness or just to be a good fucking person. One step forward ten steps back. Literally always. I can sense the negativity and disrespect from eons away. It literally makes my skin crawl and vibrate to the point of a mental breakdown. Dont ya hate it when you know it's on purpose but they make it so you never have the proof? It's real life insanity played out scene after scene. Scripted to be the most annoying stressful situations that you can think of. I'm about to have to just do something so fucking crazy it either kills me or everyone around me.",5,paranoia

"Just like the title says, my anxiety and depression is affecting every aspect of my life. Let me start with a little backstory for context of where my anxiety and depression started, if there is indeed even a start point.

Growing up, we were poor. Not just poor, but very poor. Some weeks we couldn't even afford food, so I had to steal food from the Safeway down the road just to eat. Imagine being a 10 year old kid, stuffing all sorts of things down super baggy jeans you wore specifically for that purpose. Hot dogs, macaroni and cheese, basically anything that is ready to eat or easy to cook. When we had money for food, it was $1 12 packs of ramen noodles. 25 cent boxes of macaroni and cheese. 2 dollar boxes of instant mashed potatoes. That was my diet for the first 12 years of life.

Mother was always either married temporarily, or having promiscuous sexual encounters with many many different men weekly. Sometimes both, which is why I put temporarily married, because she's been married 4 times at this point. She's also always abused many kinds of illicit drugs and always been a drunk, I can't remember more than 3 occasions in my entire life where she was sober longer than a week or 2. We never had a car, I walked or rode a bike everywhere I went. 2 hour walk to my first job literally every day. She wouldn't have been able to drive anyway because she spent most waking moments drunk or high on meth (that was always the preferred drug but she would always take what she could get).

Biological father was never around. He was court ordered to pay a grand total of $7.31 a week in child support to help support me and my mother raising me as a single mother my whole life. That's about 30 bucks a month, which covered above stated crappy diet. Mom spent most of our money on the bills we could barely afford on waitress pay, a whopping $2.33/hr (she's only ever been wait staff literally my entire life, never had any other profession besides a short time working for Quiznos as assistant manager but that's a tale for another day).

I spent a lot of time as a kid emulating her behavior. I smoked weed, tried other drugs, and drank a lot. Dropped out of high school junior year to get a full time job to help pay bills. Even with my job, we were still barely making it because the more we had, the more she spent on drugs. It got bad enough at one point she was spending over half our money every month on drugs. Just enough for the crappy diet to continue and bills paid. It was horrible and there's a lot more to it, so if you'd like further information on my childhood, I can get to it in the comments but this post is already getting long as is so I'll leave my childhood where it's at.

Fast forward to the summer of 2008. I was 19 and I was trying to get away from my life slumming it on people's couches and smoking weed until I felt nothing, and drinking until I forgot everything. I needed a change. I had met a girl on Facebook and she sent me money to move. This is a long story as well, so let's suffice to say I thought I was in love with her so I moved to California to be with her (from Wyoming where most of what happened above took place). Long story short, things did not go as planned and we went our separate ways. Except that I didn't have anywhere to go because I was broke in the middle of California with no job and nowhere to live. I ended up joining a weird almost culty Christian sober living program and ended up in a household with 5 other people who used to be drunks and drug addicts. I was going nowhere with this as well, so I did the most sensible thing I could (that's what I thought at the time) and joined the Marines. 

My time in the military can be summarized in one statement of two facts: I was drunk and lonely. I spent most of my time working obviously, but every spare second I wasn't working I was drunk. I got admitted to a rehab program the Navy offered at the time and was booted out of the Marines literally a couple days before my End of Active Service date, because I failed the program. Someone brought in vodka in a water bottle and I was busted with them. I ended up losing the promotion I was about to receive to NCO, and because it was a general under honorable conditions separation, it's still considered an honorable discharge but I lost my benefits, mainly the one that could've helped me. My college benefits under the Post 9/11 GI Bill. 

So I went back to Wyoming and continued crashing on couches for a while until an old childhood friend, who also joined the military but different branch, offered to let me move up to live with him and get on my feet in a different state. Time for another change, this one ended differently though. I moved in with him, got a job, and actually started improving. Met my wonderful wife at that point and we've now been married for almost 10 years, so there's a silver lining. Problem is, I've been through lots of life threatening situations, I've been through lots of drugs and drinking. My brain at best feels like it's incomplete. I'm constantly worried about health problems but also worried about the money it would take to get looked at by a doctor. I'm also worried because I don't feel good enough for my wife and most aspects of our lives together have been affected. Sex life, mental health (we both have anxiety and depression, I also think I still have ADHD that I was diagnosed with as a kid and never ""grew out of"") and financial wellness. Again, I won't go into detail, as this post is long already and we have the comments to discuss. 

I guess this is just to vent, but I honestly don't know what to do because I'm constantly irritated by everything and always angry. Constantly depressed and worried about things. Also not good at communication. Get mad or irritated with the stupidest little things. I'm trying to be a better husband but also have almost zero motivation to even get up and move around let alone go do something for her as a gesture to show her how much I love her. Any advice for someone who is having a hard time understanding life at this point?",4,anxiety
My mom who is suffering with delusional disorder has been getting increasingly more delusional over the weeks and I have not managed to convince her to go see a doctor. I‚Äôm not sure what exactly to do and I‚Äôm now officially scared. When we where our driving yesterday she claimed that a bomb had been placed in the trunk of her car by a BMW technician or something. As I‚Äôve already stated in a previous post I personally believe that the situation is sadly hopeless and I will eventually end up homeless because I should‚Äôve done things like learn how to drive and get a job even before I started going to college. Regardless here are some of the photos. Do you guys have any tips at all on how to get her to see someone I‚Äôm very worried and my anxiety is through the roof all the time sometimes I even feel like passing out.,6,schizophrenia

"I have a younger brother, who I like to describe as the most neurotypical neurotypical that has ever neurotypicaled, and I often get this feeling that he doesn‚Äôt respect me. I mean sure, ostensibly there‚Äôs some degree of sibling rivalry, and I get that. But on the other hand, he‚Äôs generally quite dismissive towards me, which is something that a lot of people have pointed out, including his friends (one of them literally said ‚Äústop being so mean to your brother‚Äù).

The problem arises when he decides to mock me. Him being NT, he never really gets enthusiastic or talks about things in the same manner I do, which I‚Äôm fine with, but at the same time when I do want to talk to him, he can be quite mean at times. There‚Äôs this one thing he does where he makes fun of my stims (which I didn‚Äôt even realize were stims until relatively recently, because I didn‚Äôt know I was autistic), and it hurts that he makes fun of something I can‚Äôt control, something that keeps me grounded. The problem is, my parents aren‚Äôt that much supportive either, since my mom denies any possibility of me being autistic, so I can‚Äôt explain it in relation to that. To them, it seems like I‚Äôm being petty or overreacting when bringing it up, which is why I try to hide stimming around them (it sucks). And it‚Äôs not that my parents don‚Äôt recognize that my brother doesn‚Äôt respect me, it‚Äôs just that they think that making fun of my stims isn‚Äôt a big deal. Well, it kind of is, and it‚Äôs one of the things that makes me feel like my feelings aren‚Äôt taken seriously (being AMAB doesn‚Äôt help either).",1,autism
"First time posting here, hopefully I've formatted this right.
(Also on mobile, apologies.)

I have an odd obsession with even numbers and I'm constantly scared/worried & paranoid that if I don't do something [E.G; take 10 small sips on my drink] 2 or any other even amount of times, some horrid WILL happen, such as my phone of debit card being stolen or something bad will happen to a family member or one of my pets.

Will something bad really happen?? Or is this something else?

Many, many thanks to those who respond to this.",5,paranoia

"Does anyone else feel like they are the world's biggest hypocrite? It's so frustrating because on one hand I understand my rationalization for the way I do things, and it feels justified. On the other hand, I can't help but feel like a bad person for setting different standards for others than I do for myself.

I know I struggle with time management, and I work so hard to be punctual and prepared. However, it doesn't always work out - sometimes I am late and sometimes I forget things. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect that I am understanding and gracious if others keep me waiting or are unprepared, right? Wrong. It feels like they have committed a personal offence against me. Like they are intentionally disrespectful. Obviously I would never say or do anything to convey this - I am am always polite and understanding because logically I know sh*t happens sometimes. But I still feel so guilty for being so upset by something I know I do often enough myself.

And there is more. I often interrupt people when they're busy, but I hate being interrupted. I live and work in my own cluttered spaces, but hate when people leave their clutter lying around. I often zone out when people are telling me things, and have to ask them to repeat themselves. But I feel in my whole body the frustration and irritation when someone isn't paying attention to what I'm saying. It's such a double standard and I know it doesn't make sense, but it's like an emotional reflex I have no control over. 

I feel like I can never voice these feelings because it's not fair to others, and it's not their fault that I react so strongly to other people exhibiting my worst traits. I feel like I spend so much of my time policing my own behaviour and making sure I don't act in a way that reflects my initial gut feeling. I don't want to come across as manipulative, or that I think my needs are more important than the needs of others. I just feel like a bad person and a bad friend sometimes because no matter how courteous I am outwardly, on the inside there's this mess of negative emotions I constantly have to push down. It's a never ending cycle of feeling like everyone is against me, and then feeling horrible for not being empathetic towards others, and then feeling hopeless because I can't help it. 

Hopefully I am not alone in this (but if I am, pretend you didn't see this lol I'll unpack it later).",3,adhd
Please help!! I've been feeling for the longest time that mt life is on camera or that the whole entire world knows about my life and everything I've done... Is this true??? I'm constantly thinking that I'm being made fun from things I've done in the past. I see signs everywhere but mostly on TV or peoples actions or words. Like people are making fun of me because I see relation between my past and what I see haunting me back in the present....,5,paranoia

"I need advice. I;m 24, never worked (because I would quit after a day or two). I have debilitating anxiety and depression, which has worsened over the past year ish?? I've been to a psychiatrist, horrible experience never went back. I'm currently in therapy trying to work this out. With all that being said, I started a new job last week and I feel like its making me worse. It's not the people or the job itself, it's just me. And idk what to do. I want to work, but I feel like I just can't. I get so anxious I get sick, I cry everyday before and after work and I only work part time 5 days a week. What do I do? I need to work and I'm tired of being a burden to my mom, but it's killing me mentally. My medicine doesn't feel like it's working anymore either. I just need some advice.
