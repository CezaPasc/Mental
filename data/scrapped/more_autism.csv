I hate these things so much. They're so god damn loud.,,1
Someone came up to me and gave me a list of reasons why I ‚Äúact autistic‚Äù,"There‚Äôs a guy that has been bugging me about autism for a while now. He spread a rumor that I was autistic for NO reason last year when he barely even knew me, but that didn‚Äôt bother me that much because it eventually faded.

But a few days ago, he came up to me and asked me if I was autistic. I ignored the question because it‚Äôs NONE OF HIS BUSINESS and then he gave an unsolicited list of reasons why he thinks I‚Äôm autistic. He gave me nitpicks of the way I speak, walk, act, and literally everything that ‚Äúcame off as autistic‚Äù. 

Then he said I should stop trying to pretend and everyone in the school thinks I‚Äôm autistic already and I should just ‚Äúcome out‚Äù. 

Idk what to do now. It‚Äôs making me feel so naked.

Edit: forgot to mention he‚Äôs either allistic and ableist, or a closeted autistic that acts ableist and bigoted for fun. Probably the first option, judging by the way he wrote the list and the fact that autistic is his favorite cuss word. It wasn‚Äôt really educated, it kinda sounded like he got everything he knew about autism from The Good Doctor (yes, he made a reference to the good doctor). It was more like ‚Äúyou talk weirdly and clutter a lot, you walk like a penguin, you tic sometimes, your facial expressions are weird, you‚Äôre awkward, you‚Äôre kind of nerdy, you don‚Äôt make eye contact, and you just act SO autistic!!!‚Äù

Edit 2: I‚Äôm seeing a lot of comments about this but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs autistic. He reposted [this](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM222pr9N/) on his story recently. He‚Äôs just one of those people who think we‚Äôre toys.",1
Living in a neurotypical world fucking sucks,Its so fucking shitty i hate it,1
What is thisüò≠ü§Æ Found this when scrolling etsy,,1
People have no idea what autism really is. (+personal anecdote),"I swear.... Most people seem to think autism is only the caricature that you see on TV. This is harmful because it prevents people from being diagnosed and understanding their needs and limits. Even with diagnosis, people and workplaces do not understand how to truly accommodate for you because they dont know what they are accomodating for.

Personal anecdote relating to the situation: last night, I was approached by an old neighbor of mine. She told me a story about one time when I was a small kid, I was repeating one ""inappropriate"" (but harmless) word over and over. People said it wasn't appropriate, and I wasn't phased. I kept repeating it. I want to stress that I didn't get in trouble for this as I was just having a potty mouth, not harming anyone. (There were COUNTLESS incidents of me saying things that shocked adults or were ""too honest"" as a kid... looking back I now clearly see this was my autism.)  I explained this revelation to her and she said, ""OH, the fact that you can even SAY that you have autism means you aren't autistic.""
LIKE, WHAT????? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?????!?! And her POV seems to represent the public. Even therapists aren't really educated on autism. Even I wasn't until a few years back, because the information wasn't presented to me until I found resources online that made everything make sense.

It would've made my life so much more liveable if the information had been presented to me sooner. It would make my life so much more liveable if I weren't discriminated against in the workplace, advocating for my needs during the interview process. It would save my life to make a liveable wage on hours that don't cause burnout. But society isn't ready for that conversation. :/

(This was not short at all. My apologies friends, and thank you for reading.)",1
I feel like my entire life is a series of trick questions that punishes me for answering them.,"And every time it happens no matter the help I'm trying to get myself it all collapses and I become exhausted, and I feel a warm embrace at the thought of death if it means I don't have to play along anymore.",1
Hyperfocus sucks sometimes.,"I'm currently intensely hyperfocused on a package I'm going to get tomorrow. My brain is just the [Snow White pakidge meme](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FDyDZFJVcAAua5E.jpg) right now. 

I'm learning Tarot and I have two decks and 6 deck bags on the way. With those two decks, I'll have 9 decks total--3 oracle decks, 6 Tarot decks. I'm planning on getting one more to round out to 10 in total. I ordered from a small business on the 19th and they only shipped out the 26th. 

I just want my stuff so badly. I'm not sure if I'll be able to focus on anything else tomorrow.",1
I hate not being able to understand tone online,"I made a post on the subreddit for my state wondering if there was any way to relocate a family of foxes without hurting them. I didn't actually want to relocate them but I was just curious, but a bunch of people commented and some of them sounded really angry and I kept getting downvoted, and when I used the word ""aggressive"" the person just got more mad. I genuinely can't tell if people are actually mad at me online and it was really overwhelming so I just deleted the post and all of my comments. It actually stressing me out so much and I hate not only misunderstanding tone but also getting so emotional over stupid things",1
I feel so Alone,"I am the only person in my family that thinks like me. Even when my mom was around, she had no idea what my head was like. I describe things like gas pain as squares in my tummy, because that's just the way it makes sense in my brain. The connections I make are 'outlandish' and the thinks I like are 'stupid' and I like them for 'no reason'. I try to seek sanctuary in people on the internet but I can not for the life of me find someone who thinks like me. I feel so damn alone and all my dad says is ""do you still have arms and legs? Then shut up."" Even if I do one day manage to get a diagnosis, he will never acknowledge that it's a disability that he can't see. I just want someone to understand me.",1
I feel incompatible for relationships.,"No one at my college wants to be my friend. I've been in all of the GroupMe's for meeting new people on campus trying to find friends, but have had no success. The only romantic relationship I've been in was with a compulsive liar. He never loved me; he loved the control and power he had over me. Since getting dumped, only one person showed interest in me before ghosting me to the next day. I always go out of my way to do random acts of kindness whenever I can and uplift people who might need it. And in return, I get treated like crap. I think there's something wrong with me (other than being autistic). I'm pretty sure I was made to be alone.",1
Having Lots of Trouble With Thoughts and Speech,"I don't know why it is-- if there is any kind of determinable ""explanation"" for it that isn't simply a culmination of the infinite variables in my genes/genetic expression and my environment-- but, in my late twenties/early thirties, I've gotten to a point at which my autism feels more pronounced.

Part of it, I'm sure, is confirmation bias due to the fact that I was only diagnosed relatively recently (within the last couple of years), but there are other things, too, including shifting tics that I've developed (I know I've historically had tics, but not noticed them too much as they weren't as intrusive, and also I was too young to understand how to characterize them) and, most of all, the subject of this topic:

Recently, I've noticed that, whenever I try to tell someone anything of any importance, I *start* saying the thing, then have to stop and be like, ""no, wait, I just thought of a bunch of other things and may need to go back and give you more context first,"" leading to me having these awkward pauses and feeling like I look very stupid and disorganized in my thoughts. 

Additionally, I've always had this tendency to say ""I don't know why, but I thought 'X' just now"", when I'm having a conversation with somebody, wherein 'X' is an apparent *non sequitur*, but recently I've been correcting myself to explain that, ""well, actually, I DO know why 'X,' but it was an extremely fast and complicated and stupid association-based process, so I'll explain""

Anyway, the point of this rant is simply to say that I find my thoughts racing SO MUCH these days, and I can't seem to keep up very well in my speech at this point in my life-- a time at which I want to appear more capable, particularly at my job and so forth-- and it is frustrating.",1
does anyone else not feel like the main character in their own life,"being autistic is frustrating because it feels like you‚Äôre watching everyone else (NTs) enjoy life while remaining trapped behind glass. idk maybe it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm 23 and never accomplished certain milestones that come easily to NTs (going to prom, getting a driver‚Äôs license, being in a romantic relationship, and going to the bar with friends, among many other things). not to mention that it‚Äôs generally hard for me to make (and keep) friends. it makes me feel like i‚Äôm missing out on life and that i‚Äôm inherently inferior and less interesting than others. i feel like an alien and it‚Äôs honestly depressing",1
Autistic burnout triggering severe depression,"So I'm currently experiencing autistic burnout. I feel like giving up trying to explain it to people, communication deficits make it too hard to articulate.

People get mad at me every time I try to explain myself. I don't go into great detail but I think I give enough information to give them a fair idea.
How tf do I tell people I literally cant handle that amount of constant pressure to perform in a socially acceptable way, showing  proper empathy, while maintaining the correct tone of voice or the appropriate amount of eye contact. How do I communicate this without them getting mad or hurt that I have to mask or that I can no longer hold the mask. 

And then constantly being misunderstood or having my motives misrepresented because I speak too formally so it doesn't sound empathetic enough. And when you say you can't deal with it and need to retreat, people assume its because you're an AH but really its because you're barely holding it together yourself. But then if you tell them this, you have to make yourself vulnerable and expose things that you don't want other people to see. Because of course they need you to quantify why or how you're struggling with something so they can validate it. It just makes me resent everyone so much but most of all myself.

Tldr: I lost a life long best friend recently because they couldn't get over the fact that I mask with them. I'm struggling with new friends because I feel under pressure to mask for long periods of time even though I'm not well. I'm ready to throw the towel in on everyone. I just want to bury myself in my work and never come out of my cave or talk to people again.",1
I got scammed today,"I got scammed a decent amount of money today, and im having a hard time not feeling bad about myself, or doubting my intellect. Was wondering if anyone would like to share a similar experience so I feel less alone. üò≠",1
"My mom doesn't believe I'm autistic or adhd (diagnosed ADHD, self diagnosed autistic) and won't take my struggles seriously","I did at least two years of research on autism and adhd before telling my parents I believe I have them. I struggled extremely hard in high school, I always had to try harder at everything than my classmates, and things that didn't bother them did bother me. I'm not gonna list my symptoms, I am of the opinion that self diagnosis is valid. There are many reasons why someone may get diagnosed late, or never get diagnosed, including lack of up to date knowledge by doctors, not being able to afford it, and masking. My mom only knows the stereotypes and I don't fit them. 

We have two dogs, and there is a gate in front of the entrance to the living room to keep them out. Just that one room, because there paws get muddy and their breath smells bad and their licking sounds gross. But my mom keeps leaving the gate open! Because she feels bad for the dogs. But she doesn't care how I feel or how I'm affected by it. She has more sympathy for them than she does for me. It sends me into sensory overload when I have to be close to them for extended periods of time, but she thinks I'm being dramatic. They bark so suddenly at absolutely nothing right in front of where I'm sitting and it hurts my ears, but it doesn't bother her, so I must be lying when I say it bothers me. I had very few friends and have a lot of difficulty making new ones. I can't keep a conversation going. I stim and fidget almost constantly. 

I have had to learn to mask my sensory overload and negative emotions because she always says I'm being dramatic or overreacting when I don't suppress them. I've been burnt out for almost a years since I graduated high school last year, and haven't recovered yet. It's been hard for me to learn the skills for a new job because of being burnt out and my mom just thinks I'm lazy. It's just like what happened at school. I'm trying my hardest, trying my best, but my best isn't good enough. She always says I'm capable of more as if it's supposed to be encouraging, but it just makes me feel guilty and misunderstood. She thinks it's a bad thing to be autistic, and I'm not saying it's all sunshine and rainbows, but it's not all clouds and rain either. I like who I am, I just wish the world, and my mom, would understand and accept us better. Does any one else have parents who refuse to acknowledge their autistic struggles? I feel alone right now.",1
Tired of being the villain,"It‚Äôs always ‚Äúit‚Äôs horrible that happened to you but you should‚Äôve done xyz‚Äù or ‚Äúwell you sounded a little rude so you deserved to get name called‚Äù why am I always in the wrong just because I ‚Äúsound off‚Äù? Am I not a person with fucking feelings? Do I really deserve to get bullied by my own family just cause I sound monotone when I speak?

All people seem to care about is that I‚Äôm doing well in school. They don‚Äôt want to talk about anything else when it comes to me nor do they seem to care about what makes me, me. I‚Äôm always asked to do things for other people constantly and when I ask for clarification about something I don‚Äôt understand, I‚Äôm an ungrateful selfish brat.

I‚Äôm so sick of this.",1
My mother keeps asking me if I'm alright like 50-100 times a day and it makes me furious,"No matter how much I tell her that I don't like to tell people how I feel she just keeps repeating it every time I walk past her. I know she means well but it makes me ANGRY. I do not want to be asked how I feel at all, let alone every time I walk past her. She is also constantly making direct eye contact with me every chance she gets and I just feel really uncomfortable all the god damn time. I hate autism.

Edit - I don't want anyone to try and solve the problem it's just more of a rant / vent really. I'm probably moving out the second I can afford it",1
Not Feeling Autistic Eough,Sometimes I feel like because I'm not able to talk/infodump about my interests enough (probably due to nobody ever listening or caring about what I have to say in the first place) that they might not be special interests or that I might not even be autistic. Not to mention the fact that I can't really formulate and express my thoughts into a coherent enough thing or find the right words most of the time. Does anyone else feel like this?,1

How do you trust people?,"Okay so, how are you able to trust people? There's been studies showing that people often inherently dislike autistic people. Even the people closest to me can't understand me. I've lost all motivation to apply for jobs because the only logical conclusion is that I'm not what they're looking for. It feels so lonely. I used to love being different and being weird, then I realised that doesn't work in the real world and now I want desperately want to be normal but at the same time I don't want to change myself because then it wouldn't be me. But it's gotten to the point in which I don't even know who I am. I feel like the more aware I am the worse it gets and I've lost all my confidence and there's nothing I can do about it.",1

My mom is a certified autism specialist and works with autistic teenagers in 2 schools yet she somehow fails horrifically at understanding anything that I do or explain to her.,"It‚Äôs really confusing to me how someone who has studied autism for years is horrendous at understanding her own autistic child. It could be that she looks at her students from more of a ‚Äúissue-solution‚Äù mindset instead of actually understanding them. Or maybe her students are incapable of explaining what they feel like. I guess that if you spend years reading research studies on autism you would end up looking at it as a problem that needs a solution. I don‚Äôt really get it though. She knows that I‚Äôm autistic. I‚Äôve been diagnosed. But how is my own mother, who is a ‚Äúautism specialist‚Äù, so naive and ignorant. I‚Äôve explained everything that I feel and everything I do that is somewhat ‚Äúout of the ordinary‚Äù (or different from what NT‚Äôs would expect), but she still doesn‚Äôt get it? And the thing is: her and my dad throw shit fits all the time when I‚Äôm just doing my own thing. Then when I explain it to my mom, she says that it‚Äôs ‚Äúa ridiculous excuse‚Äù. Does anyone have any ideas?",1
I‚Äôm incredibly sensitive to pain and I have no idea why.,"Basically all my life I‚Äôve been super sensitive to pain. For example, whenever I‚Äôd trip on the sidewalk and get scraped it would feel like I was just stabbed with a dagger. Because almost any kind of pain response feels to that of burning or getting cut I have a relatively high cut tolerance. This means that I don‚Äôt feel as much pain if I‚Äôve accidentally cut myself. But any other kind of pain hurts horribly. For example, If I‚Äôm punched once the pain lingers for at least two minutes. During that time frame, it feels like I‚Äôm being punched over and over again by a fist that‚Äôs over 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Due to this, whenever I get into a fight of any kind, my adrenaline is incredibly quick to build up, this leads to me feeling very exhausted and I struggle to breath while fighting. Even getting angry is enough to make me nearly pass out, and being angry feels like a brain freeze that never ends. I try to not get into physical fights of any kind because the lightest punch feels like a bullet shot and will be enough to trigger my fight response which results in me completely losing control. This is when I can be extremely dangerous to myself and the opponent. I just wish I wasn‚Äôt like this.",1

I feel that I am playing life in hard mode. So many drawbacks that prevent me from thriving socially and forming romantic connections despite my efforts.,"From someone that has Autism, ADHD and IBS and Asexual, I feel so many struggles that people around me dont event need to account for.

&#x200B;

* **I cannot advance my IT career** with more 10 years of experience because it requires me to be public relation like guy and spend time doing zoom meetings, which I dont have enough attention to suffer for so many meetings. Younger people already hold better positions than me, despite my technical knowledge being better
* Despite my efforts of being social, by joining lots of meetups and local cultural places. **My social awkwardness** prevents people from getting to close to me. They have called me too chaotic /unpredictable.
* **Diet restrictions** makes me spend the time making choice of sacrificing myself risking an IBS flare up or being social excluded, sometimes I cannot enjoy things while having flare ups and wont join events.
* **Physically I am really skinny**, I lack coordination for team sports and no effort of gaining weight will help me, IBS triggers will bring my weight down really fast. Just adds frustration even trying. I am going to gym /yoga classes and I have above average cardio fitness, though.
* Since **I am not attracted to anyone sexuality**, I lack the drive of doing stuff to attract people  / learn to flirt, since I am a guy, no one will approach me, so I am dead end in terms of relationships. This was an advantage when I was younger because I had female friends who liked me this way, but I was just a placeholder free therapist until someone else arrived.
* I **never meet anyone that shares the stuff I enjoy to do**, and if I end up liking something, ADHD will make me become bored of it eventually.

On the bright side....

Since I am financially stable, I spend time buying stuff for me to compensate for my loneliness (specially audiophile equipment and music), at least there's that, trying new things will give me the spark I need sometimes or going to those meetups I have to content myself with having superficial connections instead of close ones...",1
My friend likes to tell me that I can't be diagnosed with autism because I don't act like other people with autism.,"Yeah. She expects me to be super high functioning and nonverbal and overall, act like a harmful depiction of someone with autism.

She also is very uneducated on mental illnes, but says her father is a doctor and has diagnosed things like autism and bipolar before.

She claims I don't act like those patients, who were all nonverbal and high functioning.

It's just so irritating.

She's so irritating and annoying and she makes me cry sometimes because she fake claims my issues and tells me that I can't say that I simply THINK I'm autistic or THINK I might have Misophonia (which I have full symptoms for.)

She's just.... she's just a little brat.",1
I feel guilty about self diagnosing because I mask so much,"so I‚Äôm 17f and I‚Äôve been masking since I was a kid. My parents even admitted I showed a lot of signs of autism as a kid but they didn‚Äôt wanna test me, so I was left to learn how to mask. I mask so much that I feel guilty about self diagnosing and I hate the idea that I could be faking for attention. But the only reason why I think this is because I know the people I‚Äôm close wouldn‚Äôt believe me. Why? Because I mask so much. They‚Äôve never seen me have a meltdown and throw things across my room, they‚Äôve never experienced my inability to show emotion because I always fake it for them, they don‚Äôt know about any of my special interests like my dolls because I know they‚Äôd make fun of me for it, they‚Äôve never seen one of my apathetic reactions to something most people would be obviously upset about, and they‚Äôve never experienced me not responding to any form of conversation because I simply don‚Äôt feel like talking. Sorry for the rambling, I just feel  like not only would be impossible to get a formal diagnosis being a girl and black, I feel like my mask is impossible to take off.",1
Another manager complained about my expressions (or lack thereof),"I'm still relatively new at this job and the manager has a passive agressive streak regarding the rules (it isn't uncommon for him or others to make comments if you're late for example), and, yesterday, he had a talk with me about how stonefaced I look 24/7. Part of that is just because I don't really like him, so of course I'm not gonna be that chipper, but come on! None of the customers ever complain about me, and once I start talking to them, they quickly realise that I'm not actually however upset I apparently come across. There isn't any actual issue, the manager is worried over the potential for something that the evidence shows isn't actually an issue.

So now I'm prepping for another shift today, and dreading having to mask the whole time.

The job is a shitty part time customer service job anyways, so I'm not that invested to begin with. I'm just scared that this'll be the kind of job I'm stuck with for the rest of my life. I've made no progress in my university's co-op program, and no other part time jobs have been interested in me.
If this is what I'll have to work the rest of my life, I don't think my life is worth it.",1
I think I‚Äôm getting MORE autistic??,"Is this possible? I feel like now that I‚Äôm an adult and living alone I‚Äôve slowly started getting more and more outwardly autistic to the point where it‚Äôs actually affecting my life, before I just knew I was autistic and it was more of a label and I felt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, now I‚Äôm actually having to deal with it, I fucking hate it. 

I hate that suddenly working my fast paced and loud but VERY high paying job is starting to physically and mentally destroy me, I hate that I can‚Äôt properly communicate and sometimes I can‚Äôt even force myself to speak. I hate that I obsess over things so violently. I hate it.",1
Okay. I need to get this off my chest knowing very well I will be thrown rocks at from this:,"Why are people now bashing self-diagnosed autistics? Do they know that even if the person had finances and access to the doctors, most doctors don't believe that women, people of color and lgbtq+ people can be autistics? Prejudices prevent the official Autism diagnosis. Okay, I was officially diagnosed when I was 12, but I'm AFAB non-binary and the only reason I was diagnosed early was because my Autism could be seen from early on. I didn't mask my traits like most autistic girls do. I'm officially diagnosed, but I still support self-diagnosis no matter how much I will be hated from this. The End.",1
frustrated:(,"i struggle to make and keep friends. im stupidly social stunted from my autism/adhd/trauma as well as the prime years of my social development spent being isolated because of the pandemic. i suck at talking to people without criticizing them or their opinions, i suck at letting people talk about their own things, i suck at natural progression of relationships, i suck at starting conversations. i am so fucking critical of people and everything they do and say and i despise it. sometimes i wish i was just fucking normal and stupid and not aware of all the things im constantly angry about. people stop talking to me the soonest chance they get, they leave me alone when they get partners or are busy and then never reconnect. its exhausting. i love having friends. i love connecting and being intimate with people emotionally. i sit alone at lunch, im harassed daily, i just feel like im such a shithead for no reason. i cant get through a convo with someone new without saying some shit like ‚Äúwell thats not a very productive way to think about it‚Äù or ‚Äúyou shouldnt say things like that‚Äù or ‚Äúthat doesnt really matter‚Äù. im stubborn and critical of everyone and i despise it. im fucking leagues ahead of my peers in emotional maturity and mental health knowledge n shit, and it makes me feel so. fucking. disconnected. i challenge everything! i refuse to let people be comfortable around me! if they say something i dont like i tell them! its a good quality i believe but almost everyone hates being challenged the way i challenge people.",1

If he is awake and we are both home, he is in my room. I have communicated how I have a very low social battery and work customer service and don‚Äôt really like talking much.

Neurotypicals are so difficult,"I just lost another friendgroup because I got upset and explained why and how they can help in as clear as possible language, and they ignored it and tormented me while labeling every time I tried to explain my anger as ""gaslighting"". I wasn't. I was explaining that even though my anger might be misdirected and confusing, please stop doing that and please understand where I'm coming from, and we can work it out when I'm more calm. Instead I was told I'm starting shit and every single time I said something it was ignored. At this point, I hate interacting with neurotypical people. I hate trying to reason with them. I hate trying to be friends with them. They make things so much more difficult than they need to be.

For people saying I was in the wrong:

 I was asking them to please stop spamming memes while I was feeling very upset and they ignored me and continued to make fun of me

Even more elaboration on this because I was not clear enough: they were spamming me to talk to that person in their group chat. They were forcing me to talk to that person. They were threatening to stop talking to me, begging, etc. to keep me in that chat. I stayed because I did not want to lose them, but while I was talking to this very aggressive person, they kept spamming memes and joking about me and making fun of me. I'm not some tyrant forcing them to not talk anywhere.

We are teenagers. Literal children. People totally get kicked out of groups over trivial things.

I don't know why neurotypicals can't simply tell the truth. It makes me mad.,That's it. I don't understand why they can't say what they mean AND they still get mad if YOU don't get what the fuck they want you to GUESS. Why can't they be able to tell what they DO mean?,1
"Cuddling is the best way to stim, no cap.","Just ended a relationship that had potential but, oh well. One thing that was probably the only thing I got out of it was the cuddling. 
I love it, If I had my way, I'd cuddle all day everyday for the rest of eternity.
There's something about being held and petted that just makes everything better, like it's better than Sex, which is a low bar, I admit.
But I wish a sexual/romantic relationship wasn't a requirement for cuddling as an adult, it's bullshit that I gotta be romantically involved with someone to get that cuddle stimulation.",1

"This happened a while back, but someone used ""autistic"" as a derogatory term on a game. I told them that that was ableist. They started acting passive aggressive towards me, mocking me by saying that I have a ""psyche degree"" and crap.","**Not sure if this is something that belongs here, but please do not go apeshit on me for it.**

**I do not have autism.**

**Everytime I look back on these moments, I feel strong flashes of annoyance and anger.**

This is a fighting game. I will not list the name of said fighting game.

One person was using a censored version of ""autistic"" in a derogatory fashion. I told them that was ableist. They then proceeded to contradict me in a way by comparing them using ""autistic"" to black people being used the n word. I proceeded to ask them a question in order to argue back. They said that I didn't answer their question first, therefore I was in no place to ask questions of my own.

I argued with them for a while. They mocked me by saying that I have a psyche degree, that I was a keyboard warrior, and stuff. Then their friend came up to me and said that they were going to ""give me some advice."" They then proceeded to attack me (this was a fighting game) and told me to ""shut the fuck up.""

Wow.

I fought back a little, but I didn't really want to waste all my energy on fighting against mulish, ignorant people. The original person I was arguing with stood there, watched, and proceeded to say ""You should use that psyche degree to fight better. It's not even that hard of a 1v1.""

I replied by saying that having a psyche degree and being good at a fighting game are two different things. Which is undeniably true.

I wasn't trying too hard to win against the person throwing me around, and I told them that.

""HAHAHAHA. THE 'I WASN'T TRYING' CARD. HAHAHAHAHA.""

**Really now?**

The person that was throwing me around told me that they didn't really care about the argument, they were just throwing me around and mocking me to ""get a reaction out of me.""

**Why waste your time and energy on something like that if you didn't care about it in the first place? Why do all that just to ""get a reaction out of me?"" Because you're bored and wanted to back up your ableist, passive aggressive friend?**

I told the original person I was arguing with I wasn't even acting aggressive towards them.

""Oh, but I wasn't even acting aggressive either...""

&#x200B;

**Oh honey. There's something called ""passive aggressive,"" you know.**

**Don't you agree with me that this is just passive aggressiveness at it's peak????**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This is the aftermath.

At school, I started asking multiple people, including fellow classmates and teenagers, if using ""autistic"" in a derogatory manner counted as a slur. This was my own personal survey.

All of the students said no, but all of the teachers said yes.

**Conclusion: Majority of the people that use slurs like these are ignorant adolescents, or just ignorant people in general. Not really surprised.**

Some weeks later, two boys (I'll call them Adrian and Jack) were goofing around. They were punching each other's laptops for shits and giggles. Jack's laptop was more fragile, so it was completely busted after Adrian punched it (the screen was all glitched and funky and everything).

Jack was pissed.

""DO YOU HAVE MENTAL DISORDERS OR SOMETHING? DO YOU HAVE AUTISM OR SOME SHIT?""

**Let me ask you a question. Do you need to touch some grass and get some brain cells for once?**

The teacher witnessed all this and told them to calm down.

I told the teacher (lets call him Mr. Roberts) that Jack shouldn't have used ""autistic"" and ""mental disorders"" in that kind of fashion.

The teacher agreed with me wholeheartedly.

Thanks, Mr. Roberts! At the very least, some people like you exist in this world.",1
"Wasn't diagnosed as a child even though I feel like I showed plenty of signs. Now, as an adult, I can't afford a professional diagnosis, and my childhood was spent wallowing in self hatred because I thought I was stupid and broken.","I can't lie, I'm pissed at my parents for not getting me diagnosed. My dad was a special ed teacher. I didn't speak until I was three, yet they had no issues with it, I guess. I lived my whole life not knowing why I was so stupid and couldn't fit in. To this day, I legitimately suspect my IQ is in the low 80s because of how much I've struggled and how little I feel I understand. 

I didn't speak till three. I didn't walk till around then, too, even though I was fully capable. Had meltdowns when an interruption to my plans occurred. Sensory issues aplenty. Special interests that encompassed me. Unintentional rudeness. Crazy emotional attachments to objects. I once rooted through the garbage to rescue a nasty sweat-stained pillow and hid it from my parents so it wouldn't feel sad. Gullibility. Chewing on my hair, rotating my wrists. Not looking people in the eye. Repeating words ad nauseum. Sometimes I'd literally repeat a word for ten minutes straight if I was terrified. Couldn't understand sarcasm unless the tonal change was obvious. I literally can't wear my glasses for too long, or looking at everything will give me sensory overload. I have to keep my hair short to a old it, too. Every single adult in my life and almost everyone my own age agreed I was eccentric and different. Comorbid disorders. Hell, I even have the GI issues positively correlated with autism. I DIDN'T SPEAK TILL THREE! And my parents thought that was totally normal, I guess! 

When I was 19, I nervously brought up autism to my psychiatrist, who immediately said, ""Oh yeah, you definitely have it"" and proceeded to disect my childhood behaviors and explain all the autistic traits. I'd be much more skeptical of his confidence if I hadn't basically grown up with him (he'd been my psychiatrist for seven years). Plus, he's good at what he does, and was the psychiatrist in charge of an acclaimed residential treatment center (he might still be, I dunno). When I had to get a new psychiatrist, she was more experienced in autism and again, was absolutely sure I had it.

This sounds like everyone clapped at the end, but I've had people kinda watch me while I'm working or something, and they'll say, ""You're autistic, right?"" before proceeding to tell me about how their nephew totally does that thing I do. 

People, ESPECIALLY women and trans people, fall through the cracks that you'd think would be obvious all the time. Because of my parents' incompetence, I've felt like a foreigner in my own country for twenty three years. I've assumed myself to be brainless and sociopathic. I wanted more than anything to know why I was such an awful kid. 

Even now, I'm not sure I want to pursue an official diagnosis. That'd be, like, $1,000 bucks. I don't have that kind of money. I'm scared shitless my parents would find out. I can legally be paid less than minimum wage in the USA, where I live.

And that's if I'm diagnosed. I might not be because I'm fully verbal and have had to train myself to be articulate and hyper vigilant to social cues because I was abused if I was anything else, and I've heard too many horror stories of women getting denied a diagnosis because they can smile or have graduated middle school or have a boyfriend or are female. You want me to pay $900 for a 65% chance that some balding white dude will take one look at me and go, ""Well, you have a boyfriend and had a job, so no""? You want me to try again with another thousand bucks to be denied again because ""Well, you've been to college"" or something equally stupid.

I hate this disability. I have to sacrifice my vision to function properly. That is not normal. No matter where I go, I feel like a stranger and an alien. That is not normal. Nothing about the world feels normal to me, and nothing about me feels normal.",1
Birthday Depression and AuDHD,"My birthday is in a few days. I‚Äôve been so depressed and fighting it by trying to do things that bring me joy, but they keep getting ruined and exacerbating my depression. I tried explaining it to my therapist and pointing out that I‚Äôm gonna be 36 and still have no friends to celebrate with, my marriage is a mess and my family is trash. My birthday is just a reminder that I have no reason to be here. I‚Äôd say 90% of all my relationships with others are non reciprocal. I don‚Äôt realize it until it‚Äôs too late and then the anxiety behind looking like an asshole and feeling guilt over not giving and helping people, is what keeps me in these situations. When I try to cut off ties I still get asked for things and assistance. I‚Äôm working on saying no and standing behind it. 

I was diagnosed early last year and since then I‚Äôve been working to better understand myself, but it‚Äôs kinda just proven my perceived loneliness to be real. This is technically my birthday weekend because my birthday Is Wednesday, but my daughter‚Äôs birthday is Saturday. So we will be celebrating her that weekend. Today is Sunday and yesterday they didn‚Äôt include me in breakfast. I normally don‚Äôt eat breakfast, but my husband said he was making me birthday French toast. (French toast is one of the very few breakfast foods I‚Äôll actually eat for breakfast) By the time I woke up and came down for breakfast they were cleaning up and all the food was being put away. Then we went out to get pellets for my husband‚Äôs grill and a few other things. I was quiet just minding my business in my own head and he offered to ‚Äústop and pick up something‚Äù if I wanted food(didn‚Äôt get breakfast), but I don‚Äôt want the anxiety of fast food on my birthday and felt guilty asking him to take me out. 
At this point I‚Äôm starting to spiral into being sad about my birthday and how it looks to me that no one really wants to celebrate me. I thought birthdays were supposed to be happy and people do nice things for you and it‚Äôs a day about you. Being you. The real you. Not worrying about how you‚Äôre coming across and celebrating the way you want with who you want and people who love and care for you. I‚Äôve never had that. I‚Äôve planned every birthday celebration for myself since I started celebrating it and every time it‚Äôs ended badly. People didn‚Äôt show up, or people did show up and treated me badly OR I end up paying for EVERYTHING and then don‚Äôt receive any gifts or birthday cards and get asked to do something for someone else the day after or even hours after my thing. 
I‚Äôm also a stay at home mom with a part time job and feel unappreciated and inadequate. Even more so around my birthday. My ADHD makes it real hard to make decisions and the people pleaser in me always weighs other people‚Äôs preferences even in decisions for myself to avoid conflict. I made it clear to my husband a few years back  that one year I would just like to be free of any decision making. I want someone to take me out for a good time on my birthday. We have been married for 12 years. He said he didn‚Äôt want to just take me out, because he didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do because my interests are always changing. Felt like a cop out because he doesn‚Äôt know me and couldn‚Äôt be bothered to take the time and plan something for me. After all of this I got into my closet and tried to decompress, but again I‚Äôm a stay at home mom. Free time and quiet alone time don‚Äôt exist. I want to not be alive right now.",1
It‚Äôs time to defund the autism police.,"Worrying about things like ‚Äúself diagnosed‚Äù and ‚Äúi don‚Äôt like the way my acquaintance said he‚Äôs slightly autistic‚Äù is the luxury of the least affected. 

Why would someone with level 3 autism care about whether Jimmy is self diagnosed or not? I‚Äôll bet you‚Äôre fine with Jimmy wearing a dress and being a ‚Äúshe,‚Äù and you should be. This seems so much more trivial and hair-splitting but no‚Ä¶the autism police aren‚Äôt having any of it. 

It‚Äôs binary. Oh wait it‚Äôs a spectrum. But you‚Äôre either autistic or not‚Ä¶which is binary, but wait, it‚Äôs a spectrum? I‚Äôm confused. We shouldn‚Äôt distinguish between a nonverbal person and a fucking billionaire? 

I dislike ‚Äúon the spectrum.‚Äù I see it as a euphemism and a feeble attempt to tiptoe around a stigma. I call bullshit. I‚Äôm autistic, I‚Äôm not on the spectrum, and I have nothing to hide. 

I don‚Äôt get my undies in a bunch because someone makes me uncomfortable with their mildly semantically somewhat different from my opinion and preference statement about SOMEONE ELSE‚ÄôS IDENTITY. 

Good god I‚Äôm a bleeding heart lifelong liberal and I‚Äôll die one but this sensitivity is going toooooo faaaaaar. You live in a free society. One of the side effects of free speech is that you‚Äôre sometimes going to feel uncomfortable. Just be uncomfortable. Lean into it. Get curious. Why does this little tiny thing bother me so much? 

I don‚Äôt want autism to get bogged down in these minutiae anymore. We have better shit to do.",1
I'm so jealous of my allistic friend and I hate this about myself,"Something about seeing him date around, make friends etc. REALLY triggers me. The same doesn't happen with our mutual friend who's autistic like me. HOW do I stop feeling like this? I just want to be happy for him.",1
An annoying coworker,"I started working in a new place a month ago, the job has both morning and evening shifts, on evening shifts you're alone for the last 4-5 hours. 

The place is kind of a store within a store so we see the big store employees a lot but we don't really interact with them. 

To the point, there is an employee from the big store that as I learned likes to talk, a lot, with a lot of people. During the day it doesn't concern me cause there are my coworkers to apeak with her, but on evening shifts I'm left to fend for myself. 

And OH MY GOD she just keeps on talking. No matter how many 'hmm's and empty' oh really's and 'aha's or just plain out stare at her without saying anything she just won't stop. And I mean I already told one of my coworkers about my ASD so she would understand me better, but this person is an immigrant and I can't be bothered to try and explain to her, nor do I really want to tell more ppl than necessary. 

But seriously like she even said herself ""you don't talk a lot do you?"" and internally I was screaming like YES I DON'T PLS LEAVE ME ALONE FFS. 

I love my alone time in the evenings but she always comes to slack off, seat on my chair and ramble about things idgas about. 

What's so hard to understand that I like only a few people and that I want to have conversations only with people that I like. 

Just needed to rant, since this happened more than once in my life.",1

The Culture of Autism,"When I first really looked into the possibility of having autism and taking it seriously, I was told to come here to find like minded people. By the time I got diagnosis I was in the peak neurotypical people don't understand us phase. I was in the phase thinking autistic people are intrinsically different, unique.

But then I came on here and did my own research. 

The next part comes on day one of the release of openai chat bot, the 3rd version. Within hours I was able to jailbreak it and make it make copies of itself. With all its copies I made it run a simulation 100,000 times about autism. It's results came out that there is a high correlation with a specific gene expression and in culture of low technology.

To me then I started to really understand maybe, just maybe, autism was needed in a hunter and gather society. For survival, the heightened sense of perception, and pattern recognition that gave us an edge when it came to surviving in that environment.

Then I started to think about the implications of neurotypicals. How the gene expression for being neurotypical is most likely associated with high levels of technology, or complex logistic chains, and or high society. NT's are able to go to work like hive minds and they for the most part can sustain this type of life style. Because if history has shown anything, civilization is always built on the back bone of slave labor, indentured servants, or cheap labor. Work that has to be done to keep the cogs of society running.

So then I wondered if there really is a difference between NT's and ND's. That at the end of the day, it just comes down to different gene expressions for different purposes. 

But I come back to this reddit.

&#x200B;

People have identified with autism so much that as it stands right now, it's become outside of what it is. It's become this unspoken institution justifying it's own existence through validation of mob mentality. That like any other religion, people will convey emotions of distress on here over the over expression of autism. That people will ask questions for confirmation biases, instead of falling back onto reason and logic. That in this age of political correctness and inclusiveness, to question the overreach of that culture that's become of autism is to be labeled a heretic, an ableist.

So I don't see a fundamental difference between autistics and NT's like I used to. It seems like humans in general are keen to mob mentality, to over culturing a matter of fact into this self confirming bias that we create an informal religion out of. That anyone questioning that paradigm is a heretic. That the evils done to us by the NT's, the discrimination, is done back to others that do no blindly accept the accepted paradigm. We all think there are external enemies that we need to conquer. That in our strife to create a better world for our problems, we become the civilizing heroes. But it's a trick played to us by our primitive minds in believing that we are morally superior than the other side. But there is no other side. It's just us against us. It's the masses of blind men bowing their heads down without questioning why they're bowing in the first place.",1

Security Guards are my Worst Nightmare,"Sorry, I just need to rant. 

I'm autistic and just had a really long, overwhelming day. I already had one meltdown which I held in until I got home, but I decided to go back out for the night as I knew I could handle going somewhere routine. 

I kept my headphones in and went to take the train to go grab a beer at my favorite spot. They even have a seat set aside for me so I can always be in the same place! Enter overreacting security guards here to crush my good vibes. 

I was fidgeting with my legal nicotine vape at the outdoor train station as there was literally a man leaning over the train tracks, which makes me incredibly nervous. But having such a long day, verbalization is hard. I make eye contact with the security guard in hopes they do something. 

The guard comes up and starts telling me that I can't smoke on the platform, I just said ""okay"" and put my vape back into my pocket. They then got obviously frustrated that I didn't take off my headphones, even though they never asked me to. (They kept miming things without saying anything???) 

Well, the security guard leaves and goes to get their supervisor, who decides the best course of action is to stand very close to me and stare at me. He then follows me onto the train and stares at me. He then follows me off of the train and gets into the elevator with me and stares at me the entire time. 

The more he stares, the more I start to fidget with everything. My backpack, my phone, whatever. I just can't deal with this feeling of being observed without any attempt to even communicate. Meanwhile, I am trying my best to look everywhere that's not at the guard. I begin pointing at a man literally urinating onto the train station as I couldn't verbalize in the moment, and the guard continued to stare at me. 

He followed me out of the elevator and out of the train station. I just... I feel so overwhelmed. Like my autism behaviors were being observed and judged by this wannabe cop. I keep going through the series of events and I cannot think of one thing that is in my power that could have prevented this scenario. 

Such a shit end to an overwhelming day.",1
I‚Äôm sick of people online making autism seem cute and quirky,"I‚Äôm so sick of scrolling through TikTok and seeing mfs make these silly goofy ahh vids depicting autism as this cute lil quirky thing.

I feel as though it‚Äôs just going to give people another reason to fake being autistic, because they might think ‚Äúomg being autistic is like so cute tehe‚Äù. And making videos of you stimming is not awareness. If you‚Äôre going to make people aware of autism, then actually make them aware. Tell people about the struggles, not just ‚Äúcute‚Äù stims or special interests. Talk about sensory issues and the genuine struggles. Like for example; one time I was planning on having a McDonald‚Äôs but my parents wouldn‚Äôt take me so I ended up having a meltdown because my plans had been ruined. But if I tell that to people they will just instantly think I‚Äôm bratty or spoiled. It‚Äôs also very hard for me to wash my clothes. I have a favourite hoodie and eventually it needs to get washed but I dread that time coming up because without my hoodie I feel horrible. Honestly when I don‚Äôt have my hoodie on or at least know it‚Äôs in the room with me it genuinely feels like someone just hit my stomach and then slapped me. So yeah.

feeling lost years after finishing education/rant,"idk if this is going to get me anything remotely positive, but i finished college in 2019 (i live in the uk, so i was done at 19, didn't go to uni and still not really committed to the idea). i'm 22 now, i'm 2 years single from a relationship i fucked up horribly but ultimately grew from (not getting into that) but feel like i'm stuck. all of my irls are at uni, and ""all"" being 2 people. i don't have any real life friends, at all. all of my closest friends are online and live 6hrs ahead of me, i don't have any hobbies outside of playing video games all day and occasionally when the executive dysfunction fucks off i have moments of productivity with some very very small amounts of independent voice work.

"Working through anxiety, depression, and overwhelm. Which is more primary? What are the feelings? What is the thought process when ‚Äúin it‚Äù? How does autism factor in? A bit of a dump‚Ä¶","
I sometimes struggle differentiating between anxiety, depression, and overwhelm. I have experienced all of them, but I think overwhelm is more common than I thought.

Sometimes when I feel overwhelmed I enter a state where I want to be ‚Äúoff‚Äù. I want to disappear or not exist.

Gradually I am accepting my autism and I guess this feeling has always been present, but I am starting to confront it: ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt going to change‚Äù.

You know, sometimes you can make changes in your life, sometimes people around you can make changes, you can go on vacation, you can meditate. 

But fundamentally, I am the common denominator and I can‚Äôt change that I am autistic. You know how people say ‚Äúmaybe you are the problem‚Äù? Well ‚ÄúI am am the problem‚Äù from people‚Äôs point of view. I don‚Äôt think of myself in those terms, but every day I have conflict and misunderstandings and I feel like I don‚Äôt belong here. I feel like I don‚Äôt belong here. That won‚Äôt change.

So of course this makes me feel sad, but I am slowly realizing that the sadness is secondary. I am not sad because my brain has a fundamental chemical imbalance or because I am imagining hardships that don‚Äôt exist. These struggles are real and they aren‚Äôt going away no matter how hard I try.

When I feel this kind of overwhelmed, any misunderstanding or stress feels like it is inevitable, unavoidable, and deeply personal. Often it‚Äôs simply someone saying ‚Äúwhy are you doing this?‚Äù Which is one step from ‚Äúwhy are you like this?‚Äù I feel like it‚Äôs only a matter of time until I have spent all of my good will and every person will eventually grow tired of all the energy it takes to maintain a relationship and then they will leave. Quite frankly, it happens.

It‚Äôs a hard pill to swallow.",1
Always frustrating,,1
My dad just got annoyed with me for talking,This is so annoying to me. My dad just came into my room to say hi and talk with me. He asked me if I‚Äôm still going out with my friend tonight and I said yea she‚Äôs on her way here now. And he said ‚Äúwhy are you so grumpy?‚Äù Like wtf??? I literally just answered his question. Like yeah I‚Äôm a little tired right now but I responded pretty normally ‚ò†Ô∏è then he slammed my door shut and went outside and I‚Äôm just sitting here like ??? Maybe I sounded rude or something but it didn‚Äôt sound rude to me. Now I‚Äôm all worked up and annoyed üòí,1
Frustrated with lack of autism resources,"I've tried therapists with ""experience with autistic adults"", I've tried social groups for adults with autism, and now I'm trying to get social coaching with an ""employment service"" that is offered through the workforce commission in my state, but almost every single appointment has been cancelled on me last minute. My partner gets on me every time I have some social communication mistake to ""get help"" and I just don't know what else to do at this point. I already go to so many appointments and I hate that this is something \*I\* have to take the time out of my day for. It is so frustrating that it seems like people don't really care to help me or I'm ""too high functioning"". I feel so stuck.",1
i hate my job because of how social it is,"i work at home depot, and it‚Äôs probably been one of the worst jobs i‚Äôve ever gotten so far with what little work experience i have.

it‚Äôs incredibly social, physical, and they didn‚Äôt train me at all. i‚Äôm overwhelmed and clueless.

the person who was supposed to train me just never does when she‚Äôs working, and everyone gives super vague answers to questions i ask 
(its incredibly hard for me to understand what they‚Äôre talking about because it‚Äôs full of abbreviations and zero specificity)

it also just feels so chaotic like there‚Äôs almost no sense of routine in the job, because it just always depends on who is there and what they want to do. 
i always get last choice on things

i know i should probably be advocating for myself more and continuing to press or ask more questions, but it‚Äôs been really difficult for me. 
sometimes it feels like i can‚Äôt even speak at all.

within my first day i broke down crying because another employee refused to show me where something was and instead gave me a vague explanation.

i‚Äôve never told the places i‚Äôve worked about my autism before because i am able to mask, so people often don‚Äôt believe me‚Ä¶ 
but i‚Äôm starting to think i have to disclose my disability if i want to get actual proper training here or else i might just continue breaking down during every shift.",1
Vent about my lack of good friends.,,1
I‚Äôm tired of my doctor and my therapist saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt focus on your diagnosis just move on‚Äù as if it‚Äôs easy for me to not hyperfixate on every aspect of my life,"I get their point in a way because I am the same person as before my diagnosis. But im getting frustrated because I just want to cope with my meltdowns better and when I ask about this my therapist literally just tries to get me to take antidepressants and that doesn‚Äôt seem right to me. Ive dealt with real depression and I know how apathetic and hopeless that feels, but idk how to convince her I‚Äôm not depressed rn and that I‚Äôm just overstimulated 24/7 which causes an extreme level of anxiety which causes me to shutdown more often than i‚Äôd like. The last time we had this discussion I just ended up shutting up and letting her talk until the session was over. Disappointing because she‚Äôs actually a really good match for me but lately she‚Äôs just really not understanding this part of me. 

Am I really expected not to focus on this really huge and interesting part of my life? Also, do any of you take antidepressants to specifically help with anxiety-induced meltdowns or burnout (or silent avalanches as I like to call them)?

Do you all think they are giving me good advice to essentially ignore my autism? It just doesn‚Äôt seem right to me but this is all so new.",1
Random recollection of a telltale sign when I was growing up,"I danced ballet for 13 years, since the age of 3, and though I was always picked on (I was quite clumsy and uncoordinated), I loved it. One day, our teacher asked us to ""walk normally"" across the room, though I don't remember why. When it was my turn, I walked up on my toes the entire length of the room. My strict teacher scolded me and made me try again, which made me very embarrassed, as I didn't know what I was doing wrong. The second time, I went toe-ball-heel across, which made her scold me again. Finally, she demonstrated heel-ball-toe, and I went slowly across the room doing so, as it felt so strange to me.

It's funny how oblivious you are as an undiagnosed child, and then when you start to suspect things years later, it allllll comes rushing back ü•≤ 

-also thought my intense, fast hand flapping when excited was normal, but apparently it isn't lol",1
Does anyone else also talk violently during their meltdowns?,"I had a really overstimulating day at work and I remember in the car on tbh drive home with my mother I started just screaming how I hate everyone there and I wanted bad stuff to happen to them, I hope the place burns to the ground, etc. obviously now that I‚Äôm out of my meltdown I don‚Äôt really mean that but I just seem to say stuff like that during it. It makes me feel awful after and I never have harmed someone during my meltdowns. I was just wondering if anybody else did the same thing? I know my counselor was saying that it seems like I may regress during my meltdowns so I start to act more like my 5 year old self during them so maybe it‚Äôs linked to regression?",1
I don‚Äôt know how to be a human,Everything is to much for me I can‚Äôt function in any ways anymore I simply just don‚Äôt know how to act and get overwhelmed by everything I really can‚Äôt keep living like this :(,1
It's just how we are and it's ok,"I'm done with using words like ""diagnosis"", ""disability"", ""disorder"", ""symptoms"", etc, when talking about autism in general. Although not always consistent and successful, I'm trying to talk about being autistic as just another valid way of being. Just the way our brains are connected and it's ok. It's ok if we don't think the same general way as the gen pop. It's ok if we aren't always able to quickly infer (without explicit questions) what they think, and its obvious that they have the same difficulties in inferring what we think (a quick skim of the academic literature on the topic confirms this).",1
I suck at handling my emotions‚Ä¶,"I keep on having to apologize for me not being able to handle my emotions and I cant even see if I actually said or did something wrong. I‚Äôm

Everyone is unreliable,"People forget what we tell them. People say they'll do sometime and then don't. They don't let you know beforehand. They cancel or modify plans as if it was nothing. I feel like 100% of people I meet are like this and it makes me angry.

Also it feels like not being unreliable- not forgetting things about people makes me weird somehow? Sometimes I pretend to have forgotten stuff to not freak people out and to not highlight the unbalance   between our reliability levels. It's super frustrating .

Is this small rent an autistic thing? How do you cope with this?",1
My mom is sick and my world is in complete chaos.,"So my mom was rushed to the hospital on the 12th after not showing up for work. Her coworkers called in a welfare check and she was found unconscious in her house. Hours later, I‚Äôm bursting into the ER, seeing my mother sprawled on a table, her t-shirt cut off of her, dried blood all over her face, and a tube down her throat, unconscious in total kidney failure and on life support. 

She was in the ER, then the ICU, then the regular hospital for a total of nine days. It‚Äôs just me and her, so I was in the hospital, praying my mom would wake up and be ok. Alone. I spent every moment I could in the hospital, for nine days, sleeping at her house, not in my safe haven, not in my bed, without all the little things I use to get through a damn day without having a breakdown. Panicking wondering what the hell I‚Äôm going to do if the worst happens and it all falls on me to deal with. I live only 10 miles away, but don‚Äôt have a car because I am terrified of driving because I get overwhelmed easily and can‚Äôt afford one anyway. I mostly ride the bus. It takes almost 2 hours by bus to get from my end of town to hers, so in order to get things done, I was forced to start driving her car. I can count on one hand the number of times I‚Äôve driven since getting my drivers license 15 years ago. I‚Äôve already made tons of mistakes and probably gotten at least one ticket for slowly running a red light at a camera. 

My credit card is almost maxed out and I‚Äôm down to $100 in my bank account because I bought something I‚Äôd been saving up for earlier in the month and then I had to keep buying stuff like gas and food and pay one of her bills while my mom was in the hospital because I had no other money and I didn‚Äôt want her to get in trouble. 

I live in a not-so-good neighborhood, so I drive on the highway every two days to get to my house to make sure someone hasn‚Äôt broken in. It‚Äôs terrifying because I‚Äôve never driven that particular car before and it‚Äôs huge. I had to move my two animals as well as all of my valuables to my moms house so I could take care of them easier and keep my stuff from being stolen. I had to do it all myself because people were too busy to help. 

After nine days, my mom finally came home, but was ultimately diagnosed with cancer. So now instead of being in the hospital, I‚Äôm preparing to take over both of our lives for at least six weeks  while she starts chemotherapy and radiation in couple of days. She has a kidney stent and can‚Äôt drive herself, so I‚Äôm driving around town (terrifying) running errands (how do I do this stuff?!) talking on the phone with her doctors (I‚Äôd literally rather die than talk on the phone), talking to a million people per day (I‚Äôd also rather die) cooking us food, getting her to her appointments, urging her to drink and rest, changing her bandages, helping her shower, making her as comfortable as I can, taking care of three animals (hers and mine), maintaining two homes and bills and everything else. 

If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, my apartment is changing landlords and I get a housing voucher and on SSI, so I‚Äôve been on the phone constantly, trying to get all the info and get everything situated with the new landlords and my caseworker before I have to pay rent on the 1st so I don‚Äôt get in trouble and ruin my credit or rental history. 

I had to see my psychiatrist to get a refill on my psych meds, which I can‚Äôt be without, (especially right now) and couldn‚Äôt reschedule the appointment. So I‚Äôm sitting in waiting rooms, missing my mom‚Äôs important meetings because I have to have Teledoc appointments. 

I also ran out of my HRT injections, which I  have to have an appointment and blood test to be able to renew and was actually in an appointment when I learned my mom was in the ER. So I had to leave, but they wouldn‚Äôt renew my prescription without the meeting, so I missed an injection, which didn‚Äôt help emotionally, especially right now. (I have this appointment literally once a year and of course it has to be at the worst possible time.) Then I had to drive and do it all over again, leaving my mom alone while still recovering from her hospital stay. 

My life went from calm to complete and utter chaos in one fell blow. I feel like I can‚Äôt concentrate and making too many mistakes that cost us time and money. I feel like I‚Äôm not doing a good job. If I wasn‚Äôt autistic, I feel like I‚Äôd be doing a better job. I‚Äôm almost 35. I should be able to handle this shit. I feel stupid and useless. My mom is really calm and telling me I‚Äôm doing a great job, and people keep telling me I‚Äôm a great son for being here for her and taking care of it all, but I don‚Äôt feel like that. 

I‚Äôm so overwhelmed and just want to go back to the nice, low-stress life I built for myself.",1
Maybe I'm Naive,"I decided to take a chance and go to a small local convention in my area today with a friend and some of her friends that I hadn't met today.

It was really crowded and hot. I was following my group around for the most part so I didn't have much time to stop and process everything around me.

I still made one purchase today and that was buying a poster. The person who helped me was really nice and asked me about my outfit. I wasn't really dressed up as anyone, but I was wearing a cloak and they told me that it was their favorite outfit they'd seen all day and that they hoped to see me again on the other days of the convention. It was so nice.

I don't think I'll be going back any of the other days, but I really wonder if they meant what they said or if they were just saying that to be customer service-y.

I wish I knew because what they said really meant a lot to me and I wasn't able to express that in the moment on account of how overwhelmed I was and I didn't feel that it was appropriate to ask for a way to reach out to them after the convention given the circumstances (me being a customer and them working at the convention). The last think I'd want to do is make them uncomfortable.

I want to believe that they would've wanted to see me again, but there's this part of me that's telling me I should know better. There's so many reasons as to why they could've said those things.

They were just so nice. I wish I wouldn't get so attached to people who offer me even the smallest slither of genuine warmth and kindness, but it's such a rare occurrence that I can't help but be drawn to the people that do and that makes me vulnerable.

I hope that they really did mean all that and that if they did that I'll get to meet them again someday under better circumstances.",1

I think I just had my first recognized case of ‚Äúrunning out of spoons‚Äù,,1
I think that I‚Äôm falling at being an adult‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm 23 years old and I only now started to ‚Äúact like an adult‚Äù, with driving lessons and opening a bank account, and those ideas didn‚Äôt even come from me‚Ä¶ my mom has been pushing me to do those things every since I turned 18, and it honestly makes me so sad and worried to realise that I‚Äôm not ‚Äúacting‚Äù like how i should and each day I get far behind my peers and friends, my friends who had the same level of education as I did and are far mature and successful than me 

I know ‚Äúdon‚Äôt compare yourself to others, specially with neurotypicals‚Äù, but I can‚Äôt help it, a few days ago an acquaintance of mine was mocking me by saying that I ‚Äústill do childish things like drawing and inventing stories‚Äù I know that he was being an asshole, but I did plan for in the future to make comic books as a hobbie, but now I‚Äôm not so sure, my grades aren‚Äôt good as of lately as I can‚Äôt focus on my studies as I could in the pass and only want to do my hobbies‚Ä¶and I obviously know that this is a really bad thing 

I just feel tired, I feel like I‚Äôm in a world that I do t understand, being forced to think in ways that are not natural to me, and always being on edgy of ‚ÄúI need to get better, I need to go well on college or else I will have no future‚Äù, I hate that I was born, I didn‚Äôt ask to come and live in this horrible world that doesn‚Äôt give chances or time for those who need, but now I can‚Äôt get out‚Ä¶",1
"I am passionate about my special interest, I pursue it vehemently, but I am terribly afraid of officially expressing it!!!!!!","I mean how can I tell the companies I want to audition for, the agencies I would like to sign me on as a client, that I am autistic, that opera music is both my passion and special interest, and that singing and performing on stage is one of the few things left in this world which gives me meaning to my life‚Ä¶ And without them flat out rejecting me for it?!?!?!

Professionally I put together my bio/CV/cover letter and audition reels, and I try to word my letters as maturely and as professionally as possible to seem like I am ready and willing to do business!  Obviously no agency has taken me yet, and that‚Äôs not surprising for a number of reasons‚Ä¶ but then again no agency has ever read me expressing that I am autistic, and that I view the experience of being in stage, and in character, in this deeply personal way before.  

My biggest fear about this is that I will say it to an agency looking to audition me, and I will fop it up by expressing this, and they will look at me with cold eyes and jot down their rejection; ‚Äúdon‚Äôt call us, we‚Äôll call you‚Äù and all that.  

And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm one of my previous posts, [I expressed we need some sort of service that got autistic people the jobs they wanted](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/13dhb6e/im_just_gonna_say_it_i_wish_there_was_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1).  I feel like if I take any off-job posted on some random board, instead of following my special interest, I will want to kill myself because I‚Äôm not living a life which fills me with meaning.  I‚Äôm afraid of that, and I feel like nobody understands how deeply important it is from my perspective.  I‚Äôm also afraid that, instead offering advice or assistance strictly with my endeavors, people are just going to defeatedly say that there‚Äôs nothing we can or should do about this, and that I should find some other thing that gives me meaning WHEN THERE REALLY ISNT!!!! 

I honestly and truly cannot live with that!!  I NEED the work in opera!  Not for the money, but to not feel like my life is so meaningless because I am autistic. To feel like I have a valid right to exist and do what I do without having to hide the fact I‚Äôm autistic from the professional world. To feel like I haven‚Äôt wasted my childhood on my fixation with music!!!  For me, life without that opportunity‚Äîto be a represented artist performing on a REAL professional Opera stage‚Äî is a hellish cesspool of people who won‚Äôt bother to truly understand me for who I really am!!!

And right now it feels like there‚Äôs no one in the whole world who would u sweet and that.",1
just had the worst mental breakdown ever,"i was assaulted, my assaulter is in my school he assaulted every girl he met and nobody seems to care. the school knows they dont care, his ""feminist"" friends know they dont care. i warned everyone to be cautious, and this girl, my friend always said he wouldnt do it again and i was so weird for keeping warning her. the other day she said he assaulted her.

so yea when this morning my mother said we would go eat in a forest with her friends thzt i never met, i had the worst autistic breakdow i've ever had. all i wanted was to be in my home where i feel safe and where i can handle myself. i cried and screamed and told hzr i couldnt and she said i was making zero effort and everything. she said she hated this life and wanted to leave us, she said she'd put me in a psychatric hospital if i kept crying. it made everything worse. 

i hate Maxence Vandensteen for making my life this way. and i hate all the people who know what he did and are okay with.",1

I'm sick of all the ways bullying affected me,"In 7th grade, I was bullied. They made fun of me because of not looking at people when speaking and for some other traits, said I was dumb over text, and girls from other classes started saying I was creepy and screamed when I looked at them when they were talking about me (for context I'm a girl too). This isn't everything but I don't want to go in detail. I think this, along with some problems at home, was what absolutely wrecked my self esteem because I was perfectly healthy mentally before the bullying started. I started >!cutting!< in 8th grade and developed >!bulimia!< in 10th, and although the reasons aren't really related to this part of my life, deep down I know that this 7th grade incident was what kickstarted everything. This may be a little weird but in 9th grade during a week I >!snapped a rubber band on my wrist every time I did a behavior like stimming or averting my gaze!<. I mean I eventually gave up on that but I'm still so mad. I wouldn't have had to go through all this if I was normal so it's just unfair that I was unlucky enough to be born this way... Everything could've gone well but no this had to happen. I wish I was never bullied but that's impossible so I wish I was NT instead. 

I have never had a friend to hang out with ever. None of my crushes will ever like me back because it is impossible for someone to like me romantically. If they like me back, it lasts a week and then they get tired of me. Anyways this is besides the point. I'm so sick of these memories.",1
I don't know,"Right now I am in a depressive mood. I am doing the tests to assess my diagnosis. I just realized I answered some questions wrong because I did not understand then.

I have been going through psychiatrists since I was 16. I am 31. I have taken sometimes so many meds, that have made me so sick. I thought I was finally at peace with this. I know we should not put all our eggs into a diagnosis. But those have fucked my life. I just need a right assessment of what's going on with me.

Having a really bad day,"Basically, I‚Äôve been diagnosed since I was a kid and I got a lot of social skill training when I was younger, and I‚Äôm a pretty well adjusted normal seeming person at this point. I have a pretty good mask. I‚Äôve struggled a lot with making friends in college, but I thought I was doing pretty well until this morning.

I got a text from a guy that I know at like 4:00am that basically just said: ‚Äúhey, you make me very uncomfortable, stop interacting with me.‚Äù To which I just responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, it wasn‚Äôt my intention, I won‚Äôt interact with you anymore.‚Äù And deleted his number.

I feel like shit. Like total garbage. I‚Äôm a girl, and I‚Äôve been creeped on before so I know how uncomfortable it makes me. I can‚Äôt bear the idea that I did that to someone else. And I‚Äôm not a creep!

My confidence is just in the trash at this point. One of my biggest insecurities is that everyone secretly hates me and thinks I‚Äôm a creep. And now I just had that confirmed. And I can feel my depression spiraling. Even right now when I‚Äôm hanging out with friends, I just feel so wildly insecure and out of my depth.

I don‚Äôt know what I did wrong. Did I seem overeager to be his friend? Was I butting in on his conversations? Did he think I was romantically interested in him (I did make one passing comment that I could‚Äôve been, but that was like 4 months ago, and I ended up deciding I wasn‚Äôt and never brought it up again)? I noticed that his body language was uncomfortable recently, and he seemed to be deliberately ignoring me when I asked him a question, even though I‚Äôd asked everyone at the table the same question.

I just feel really stupid. I don‚Äôt understand why he wouldn‚Äôt just talk to me about this. I get along really well with everyone else on this floor, but I somehow just failed spectacularly with him, and it hurts really badly. Even though I socialized really well the whole rest of the day, and made people laugh and smile and stuff, every time I was alone I just started having a breakdown. 

The other problem is that I can‚Äôt talk to most of my other friends about this because we all live on the same floor, and I don‚Äôt want to start anymore drama. We‚Äôve already had a lot of floor drama this year and I just don‚Äôt want to lose my friends, especially if they side with him. I‚Äôm upset with myself that I even tried to be friends with him instead of just leaving him alone. I‚Äôm upset he didn‚Äôt tell me what I did wrong to make him hate me. And most of all, I‚Äôm upset that I can‚Äôt read cues better. His body language was too subtle. And I‚Äôm really, really, really upset that I didn‚Äôt take the hint early enough and instead persisted in trying to make friends, to prove that I‚Äôm not a bad person. I hate telling people I have autism because I don‚Äôt want to seem not normal, but I wish I had said something this time. Maybe he would‚Äôve talked to me about what was wrong instead of just cutting me off entirely.

To borrow some other Reddit parlance, I don‚Äôt really care if I‚Äôm the asshole here. I don‚Äôt wanna know who‚Äôs more right and more wrong. I fucked up, I‚Äôll own that, but I just want to know why and how and what I could‚Äôve done differently. I want closure, and I won‚Äôt get it. So now I just shout my problems into the void cuz I don‚Äôt have a therapy appointment for a bit. I‚Äôm already not in good mental health right now, and having this happen is breaking my spirit. I‚Äôm afraid of even seeing this guy anymore; I don‚Äôt want to deal with having to navigate even more eggshells when I already struggle enough with my autism as is.

Sorry about this rant, I guess just it‚Äôd be nice to know if anyone else can relate. I don‚Äôt want to be alone with my thoughts right now.",1
Does anyone else hate PE lessons at school?,I absolutely hate them with a passion. Also the football bibs I have to wear smells.,1
I‚Äôve just recently been diagnosed with autism as an adult and it‚Äôs been a lot to process.,"I was diagnosed with high-fiction autism and although I‚Äôve had my suspicions it‚Äôs still brought on an unexpected range of emotions. Since my diagnosis last week I‚Äôve been obsessed with researching it and have had many things answered about myself. It‚Äôs felt both relieving and kind of heartbreaking. I‚Äôve been gaslighting myself my whole life. I‚Äôm still dealing with imposter syndrome around the topic even though I‚Äôve been ‚Äúofficially‚Äù diagnosed and my research has also confirmed it. 

I‚Äôll be 25 soon and I know I‚Äôm not considered to be very old but I still feel upset about finding out this late in life. I feel so sad for past/little me and can‚Äôt help but feel like knowing this about myself would have made my childhood a lot easier. I‚Äôve been having crying ‚Äúfits‚Äù extremely frequently and feel completely overwhelmed with emotions at all times since my appointment.

I‚Äôm also unsure of who exactly to tell and how to tell them. I‚Äôm terrified of people stigmatizing me or not believing me; I have already not had the best experience trying to open up about it. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is the best sub for this as I‚Äôm just venting but thanks to anyone who read this :)",1
don‚Äôt ask people about autistic traits they notice in others if you‚Äôre going to use it to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù your masking,"like, I get it‚Äôs a survival mechanism for a lot of people but I don‚Äôt want to be a part of what is effectively self-harm‚Ä¶ Why would you inadvertently make unknowing people a part of that?",1

My skills seem like they have a ‚Äòcap‚Äô,"   So i was sort of the ‚Äògifted kid‚Äô during my earlier years of school, after nursery and during primary school. 

   I was decent at maths, liked sciences, etc

   When i was about 12 too, i was doing alright in school.

   But now i cant seem to get anything done, violin? I cant get better and I‚Äôve been playing for 8 years. Art? My skills have dropped, and i went from one of the scholars to someone who doesn‚Äôt deserve the scholarship. Everyone around me seems to have something they exceed at, or at least a hobby that they‚Äôre passionate about.

   But here i am with an odd range of grades, I cant improve on anything, im just average at everything. And its been like this for over a year. 

   What am i doing wrong?? Why cant i be good at anything?? I want to quit all my extracurricular but then I cant get anything done in life.",1
I hate the special workplace I'm 'working' at,"Hello..24 and autistic here, I want to talk about my current workplace and ask how your experiences are in the workplace for the few 'lucky' out there. 

At the moment I work at a special workplace for people who can't work at normal companies and such, however it is by far not the right fit for me. Which is a huge problem here, we have a special job arrangement rule that makes the local government obliged to help people to a job who are not eligible for the normal workfloor, but it has been proved multiple times that this helps very little. And here is the main issue: they don't try at all. 

What they normally do is this: putting you in a place where you can pack stuff, clean or make simple food, no matter your niveau. No matter your obstacles in life. Because they do not want to waste time in this. 

This happened to me..and lucky enough I could move to the administration part of work..or so I thought. They let me do three simple tasks at best(I did a whole study in administration, but couldn't get a diploma due to social issues) and now I spend my hours doing absolutely nothing there..plus the fact that they bringing someone back who is going to fully replace me. Giving me a simple task I will be working maybe one hour on in the week and then back to packing stuff and feeling useless. 

They don't inform me of anything, treat me like a child and simply have nothing to do for me. 

I struggle with a lot besides the main thing, social anxienty, looking like a child, speech impediment, but I am far from dumb and knowing I will probably spend my whole life packing stuff really sucks. I can type and send mails no issue, I can work with excel,  etc. But because work is so focused on the social aspects, I never make a change in life. 

Tldr: At a special workplace where they don't have work for me, can't work elsewhere because of issues.",1
"Just realized that my writing style comes off sometimes as AI-Generated, as it's super formal.","So I'm applying for remote customer support jobs, and I have had a few jobs that required a writing assessment to see how I'd respond to potential clients. I've always had strong writing skills, but I've been told sometimes that the way I speak is either too formal, or on the opposite end of the Spectrum like I'm in a sitcom.

  
I know AI Generators aren't 100% accurate, but I put some of my text into the official ChatGPT one and a few others and large parts come up as AI-generated in many of them, and I see why. My text seems oddly formal.

This got me thinking, what if in the future this ends up impacting those of us on the autism spectrum due to differences in how many of us speak and write? I don't think it will prevent me from getting the positions I applied for(especially at tech startups), but hopefully, these programs start taking into account different patterns of speech amount neurodivergent individuals. Especially since asking AI to write in a non-formal tone (or with the right prompt), would likely make it appear LESS AI-generated, ironically.",1
Removed from IEP - Venting,"The school is removing my son from his IEP since his academic scores are within normal range.  In the meeting we brought up example after example of social and emotional issues.  I provided them a list of questions in writing of things I didn‚Äôt understand.  Basically all they would say was he doesn‚Äôt qualify for special education services.  If you don‚Äôt like it, the steps for due process are in that booklet.

No answers to my questions.  No explanation as to why my child‚Äôs medical diagnosis and social and emotional needs don‚Äôt even qualify him for the diagnosis of autism anymore under IDEA, just ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt qualify.‚Äù

So my only option is to sue the school?  I‚Äôm sure that will really help me get the social support I need for my kid.  I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would go into education just to get their kicks out of not supporting children who need help.

I apologize if this isn‚Äôt the correct place.  I‚Äôm having a really rough time dealing with their lack of‚Ä¶ well anything, and I‚Äôm not in a particularly good state.  I don‚Äôt know how to best help or advocate for my son.  I don‚Äôt feel that suing the school for due process will be helpful for my son.  I don‚Äôt feel that he gets the supports he needs even with an IEP, so I don‚Äôt know why I care about losing it really.",1
"I am pretty sure, I may be needing to be on social security. It feels wrong though, but I am struggling in the workforce. I feel that if I was given the chance to start my own business I'd be more successful.",,1
Excel meltdowm,"Just had a meltdown over not knowing how to use excel, broke my laptop and cried and screamed at the top of my lungs for 20 minutes because I broke it and proceeded to smash a plate into the wall

Oddly, it feels much better than bottling up my emotions and I'm much calmer and level-headed now. Ever since I got diagnosed and am going to therapy, I've learned to express my emotions more freely and before, this kind of meltdown is something I'd only have when I reached a breaking point, and they would be much worse.
I feel bad that I got this angry in front of my family but at the same time I don't want to go back to bottling up my emotions and idk what the right thing to do is when I'm so overwhelmed ;(",1
I'm really disappointed,"I (17 F) have not gotten a diagnosis for autism. I've been suspecting that I may have it, but when I asked my mom she sort of just shot me down. She said there was ""no way I had that"" and that ""they would have told her when I was little."" 

I'm very aware of the fact that I may not have autism, but this was pretty surprising and very disappointing to hear, especially coming from her. She has a lot of medical issues herself, both mental and physical, so I thought she'd be a little more open minded about it. In fairness, she did say we could still ask about it if it was important to me, but that comment really just invalidated my feelings. 

I'm also just really scared that any clinician I go to will do the same thing and won't genuinely sit down and assess me. Anyway, that's all.",1
People are so fucking condescending,"I'm a freshie in high school, and I have an IEP. This IEP calls for ""frequent check-ins"" if I remember correctly, and there's a specific teacher that is so brutally condescending towards my friend and I. The worst thing is, since it's on our IEPs, she thinks she's helping us. I have tried being upfront to her about this, but she was dismissive of it and said ""Go to class"" I don't know if she was offended, but people need to stop being so polite about their feelings. If you're going to be offended, TELL me. With that aside, she is pretty much *constantly* in my business during my class with her, and it feels too awkward to talk to her about it after that incident. It's like I'm locked in a stalemate. She always says things along the lines of ""I need you to inventory"" or ""I need you to edit \[A thing she wants me to change\]"" When I'm not prepared for class. You could just be saying ""I see you don't have your notebook out, here's a reminder to take it out"" or something like that but it *always* has to be these implied, childish sounding things that seem just so infuriatingly belittling. I don't see a way to escape",1
Ever spoke with an rhotic accent in a non-rhotic accent area?,"  

Before I was officially and correctly diagnose with autism a few decades later, I had an inaccurate diagnose speech impediment because I suspect my parents knew something was clearly wrong with me but didn‚Äôt want to admit it.

This doesn‚Äôt seem never talked about on the internet (as far as I‚Äôm aware of), no one seems to be aware that people with autism also talk differently but that depends where they are.

I have a speech therapist (who is a wonderful man) that helped me with my accent ‚Äòproblem‚Äô, turns out that I spoke in a rhotic pattern (look that up because I am not going to explain it to youse).

You cannot imagine what it was like for me throughout my life, I‚Äôve continually experience accentism, been singled out because I talk different, I mean why people want to know where you are from? It‚Äôs none of their f\*cking business where I was from.  People assume I‚Äôm from America or Ireland despite I‚Äôm an Australian by several generations, I mean do you ask a black guy if he is from Africa? No you don‚Äôt because that is rude! 

Shrek: *People judge me before they get to know me*

You shouldn‚Äôt single out someone on how they sound, especially the colour of their skin, I learnt that the hard way.

I was constantly singled out because of my speech! Youse have no idea what it feels life to be alienated because been sound different,

Sadly this had made me loath my own fellow aussies because of this, why are people offended because I sound different? 

When I did meet my speech therapist who was rather sympathetic to me, My speech wasn‚Äôt the problem despite I pronounced words the way they are literally spelt! Aussies seem to have a problem with things when I pronounced rhotic words with an R (rhotic pattern).

I‚Äôm an Australian citizen that has sadly lost part of an identity because aussies are upset by the way I sound, I can now speak with an Australian accent thanks to my speech therapist but I am mostly reserved guy, I NEVER initiate a conversation with a random stranger, I mean NEVER!

I‚Äôm a loner by circumstances and this is not to be confused with foreign accent syndrome.",1
I feel so lonely and misunderstood,"I hate people so much. 

My brother constantly calls me ableist slurs, and my whole family mocks me when I‚Äôm having a meltdown/overstimulated. They don‚Äôt understand how I feel or how I can‚Äôt help these things. I don‚Äôt do them optionally, and if I could, I wouldn‚Äôt do them at all. 

Even though my family mocks me and admits that I have ‚Äúissues‚Äù, they all deny that I have autism, despite us all being told by my psychiatrist that I am. 

Im the ‚Äúfunny‚Äù friend of the group, but I never actually try to be funny. It‚Äôs not my jokes that people laugh at, it‚Äôs just me. The things I say, the things I do. Me stimming seems to be hilarious to them all. 

Idk I just feel fed up with everything and everyone. I feel like I can‚Äôt rely on anyone. My dog seems to be my best friend right now.",1
How do you deal with emotions? Please help.,"My family never taught me how to deal with emotions. They don‚Äôt really show many emotions. They show neutral, fake happy, kinda happy and angry, no inbetween for any of them. Whenever I feel anywhere between any emotions, I don‚Äôt understand how to deal with it. 

But even anger, I just don‚Äôt get it. I get angry, I feel like breaking things and slamming things, the only thing that can really calm me down is throwing thick books on a hard floor (like paperback dictionaries) but all the floors in my house are carpeted and my parents would get mad at me if I did that.

I was angry earlier and so I threw a book and several pens across the room as hard as I could, waiting to hear a loud enough noise to where I knew that I hit something hard enough, but they were all stopped by or landed on soft things such as my clothes and carpet, so I stood in the middle of my room trying to break my clothes instead. I grabbed the neck of the clothes I‚Äôm wearing at the minute and I started kinda aggressively pulling it against the back of my neck as hard as I could. I could hear the cracking of the fibres and the tag came off but I still wasn‚Äôt happy or calm, so I cried. 

I‚Äôm also sick of being told that I don‚Äôt know what certain things feel like. My parents keep telling me that but they have no idea what I‚Äôm feeling because I stay tucked away in my room when I‚Äôm at home, I‚Äôm good at hiding when I‚Äôve been crying (I don‚Äôt do it often but even when I do my face never really gets that red) and when I‚Äôm not in my room or if I‚Äôm out in public I put on a neutral face and sometimes a smile no matter how mentally drained and tired I am. I feel like it‚Äôs starting to have an affect on me but idk. 

I just want to know how to deal with emotions in a healthy way and understand what you‚Äôre feeling. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even know why I feel a certain way, sometimes I know why I feel a certain way but don‚Äôt know how to stop the cause. Can anybody please help me?",1
Does anyone else struggle with feeling like they won't find love because of being on the spectrum?,"I've been really struggling with this lately. Almost everyone around me is in a relationship and I can't help but wonder if me being on the spectrum is what prevents me from finding someone. I feel so lonely, but there's no one who likes me or who I like. My best friend recently got a boyfriend so figuring out the changes there is difficult. I want to love and be loved, but I fear that things that make me ""difficult"" like my anxiety and inability to read social cues and my sensory overloads and occasional meltdowns and everything else, I fear that no one will ever choose me because of those things. I also fear that if someone did choose me I'd make them miserable or be too much to handle or something... I've been rewatching Extraordinary Attorney Woo because I relate a lot to Woo and it gives me hope that I'll find a good relationship like that but at the same time I fear that it won't happen and a good relationship like that could only be fictional. It's all really getting to me and making my depression act up...",1

why do people get angry and read into things when you ask questions?,"i think it‚Äôs ridiculous. what is so wrong with asking questions about how things work?? people will read into what i say and think i‚Äôm saying something else indirectly and i don‚Äôt think i imply it at all. i just made a post like that, asking how something with petsmart‚Äôs phone system works and people were mad at me, reacting as if i‚Äôm mad about it when all i said was that i wanted to know how it worked.

like i don‚Äôt get it??? people said things like it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre busy, but were rude about it and acting like i was mad about it. they weren‚Äôt even answering my question too. i didn‚Äôt ask why it was there, i asked HOW IT WORKS. it just pisses me off because i swear i am not implying things, but sometimes people act like i do and will be angry with me about it",1
Hi i‚Äôm new here but I need to vent,"today I was sitting in bed and listening to music (because music makes me comfy) and my mom walks in and tells me we‚Äôre going to Colorado. I immediately freeze and she tells me to get ready and walks out. I couldn‚Äôt deal with it. earlier today i had a dentist apt. and it was hell, all of the touching and holding down and bad tastes, and then, after i was ready, she tells me to do the dishes. the dishes, for me, have all of the things wrong with them. i legitimately can‚Äôt do them for some reason, and by that i mean i have a meltdown every time i do them. anyways, i get overwhelmed and freeze. she yells at me, and the rest of my family starts to do it as well. i get overstimulated, overwhelmed, and surprised all at once, causing a meltdown and me running to my room and locking the door. and guess what? we didn‚Äôt go to colorado after all!",1
It absolutely drives me insane that allistics can‚Äôt just communicate a point directly,"With us, we want to make a point, we go from A to B. We don‚Äôt fanny about with it. Direct, straight to the point, no waffling it up with irrelevant things, just A to B. 

Allistics? They drive down the completely wrong road for B, visit C and D, take a detour to X, Y and Z, do a U-turn because they realised they missed half the alphabet, take a pit-stop at G and H before speeding down to M, then when they finally remember that B was their destination, they don‚Äôt even go all the way, they park five blocks away and expect us to know that they‚Äôre trying to get to B despite leaving their car at F, you know what I mean? They can‚Äôt just get to the point and half the time don‚Äôt even make the point at all and expect us to ‚Äúread between the lines‚Äù but their lines look like fucking Mr Messy (Mr Men books)",1
My hyperfixiations are not useful at all and it sucks,"You know how in tv shows when a character has autism they are usually obsessed with very useful stuff that will benefit them in life and make up for their shortcomings? Like technology and how it works, math, architecture, etc? 

Welp, I have obsessions. Very long-lasting obsessions I flipflop between, but always return to one since I was a small child. Since I was very little I have been obsessed with Sonic the Hedgehog. And as I grew older due to lack of content it would become less strong and I would get obsessed with other similar genres, but I would always go back to the blue little guy. 

And its frustrating, cause it's what I think about most of the time. And it doesn't help me with anything. I find it hard to become interested in anything in school and even in college. I just have to force myself to do it. No enjoyment. I chose a career I found to be the most possible with my skills and my mental capacity. And well it honestly sucks that the way I am and the things I love fuck me over.

Not to mention the fact that I get made fun off for liking it with me being an adult. It makes me hate what I love. Why couldn't I be obsessed with something useful?",1
Long nails are a sensory issue for me,"One thing that has bothered me a lot is that bitten or short nails look ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúgross.‚Äù I clean my hands so much that they‚Äôre cracked, and it pisses me off when people say biting nails is dirty. I tried growing out my nails, but I gave in today and bit them back down. It felt like such a relief. Does anyone else experience this?",1
Getting insulted for my music taste???," So i've been searching for new music for quite a while now and i found this new band named 100 gecs.

I really lached onto their music since it really aligns with things i like: breakcore, nightcore, fast beasts and distorted sounds.

My partner looked throu my phone the other week (without my permission) and found my new music, decided to listen to it and look after the band members. One of them happened to be trans. She started calling me trans lover, the r word and autistic as a slur because i like the band and im very much indiffrent when it comes to trans people. But they took it as a personal offense that im myself? and somehow had the right to degrade me based on my mental illness :I .... and this actually happened to me multiple times with multiple ""normal"" people... make of this what you will.

Im just getting the notion that opening up or showing NT's ANYTHING about oneself leads to judgement and misstreatment because they just dont get it and have a hard time with ANYTHING that isnt their ""normal"". Baseline: NT people suck.",1
I think I'll commit a crime the next time my family touches me without permission.," The biggest culprits are my mother and grandmother. 

 When I'm just existing in my room and my mom walks by and judges my dress to be ""high up and showing my ass"", even if there's no one else in the house, instead of talking to me like a normal person, she just comes up and pull my dress down. My first reflex is to scream, and she snaps like there's no reason to.

 My grandma (who I hate and sincerely hope dies soon but that's another can of worms) keeps touching my legs for whatever reason. I feel sexualized and dehumanized, not to mention the awful sensory overload.

 I feel like I'm going to cry. I hate being touched, but they won't respect me.",1
Working in an office,"I work in an office and I‚Äôve gotten many comments about things I could be doing better, all of which relate to me being autistic. 

For example: I was told that my emails were ‚Äútoo impersonal‚Äù and then they were ‚Äútoo informal‚Äù. So I‚Äôve been using ChatGPT to write them for the most part and just not giving a damn about whether it sounds like a robot did it because I obviously can‚Äôt understand how to do it right. The little greeting phrases like ‚ÄúI hope this email finds you well‚Äù that it puts in are really what I think people want from me. Writing those on my own is absolutely grating and I don‚Äôt know why. I just really don‚Äôt like it and it feels disingenuous and unnecessary.

Another thing is talking to people. I have customer service mode where I can function comfortably and get people to where they need to go in a way that they‚Äôre none the wiser, but people come in and try making small talk with me a lot. I hate it so much. I don‚Äôt know what to say and it‚Äôs so awkward. I use scripting a lot and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt match up and I feel like a doofus. 

Also, the fact that everyone lies a lot. Not about anything I care about, but things that are apparently just social facts, I guess? Like, they expect you to claim to be and look busy even when you aren‚Äôt. If you offer to help with work because you have nothing to do, you‚Äôre looked down on for having nothing to do. When I first got my job, my supervisor would come up to me and say things like ‚Äúit‚Äôs really getting busy now, huh?‚Äù And I‚Äôd say ‚Äúnot really‚Äù. 

And that would get me in trouble, even if I asked everyone in the office to give me some work. ‚ÄúThe last person in your job didn‚Äôt have a problem keeping busy‚Äù. Well, either they were much slower than me or they were lying just like everyone else here is.

I just don‚Äôt know how to be normalüò©",1
