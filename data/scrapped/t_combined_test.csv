"What's up my depressed peeps

Haven't been to the gym in about four days after a consistent month of going back. I'm here now and just spent a good 20 minutes stretching and it feels amazing.

I feel like my whole body is having a mild orgasm and I'm swimming in an ocean of yawns.

Feeling relaxed, and the consistency of going to the gym helps to build a schedule which is good for depression.

Try the gym, I promise it spends time and feels awesome.",2,depression
"I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs been going on with me recently and I want to know if anyone has any info or advice? I‚Äôve always had what people call ‚Äúsad nipple syndrome‚Äù but the past week it‚Äôs been much worse.

I‚Äôve been feeling extremely depressed, not getting out of bed, washing or feeding myself. My boyfriend encouraged me to have a bath or something, but the thought of even having to take my top off made me feel sick to my stomach. 

I don‚Äôt know how much of this ties in with having bad body image, I also have an eating disorder, and I was also wondering if a previous SA might be affecting me at the moment as I‚Äôve been feeling very disgusting. 

I tried to change my bra and had a meltdown in the bathroom just because I could ‚Äòfeel‚Äô my nipples and ended up clawing at my chest. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on with me? I feel so strongly towards them at the moment, honestly wishing I could get them removed.",2,depression

It‚Äôs because I tell myself why would they bring that up and then how do they know and my mind goes crazy. The worst part is I tell myself I have to let it go because I‚Äôm only a narcissist if I think it all connects to me. But then I can‚Äôt let my guard down because what if I am right‚Ä¶",5,paranoia

"The drugs. I think the doctors. Doctors in general. Are giving people useless drugs.

I take medication to deal with. I don't even know.
I don't even remember why I take it. I don't even eat breakfast. I eat maybe half an apple for lunch. I eat a little dinner. And that's it. Every day.

I don't remember when I started taking medication. I don't know what it's for and I don't think it does anything other than make my insomnia worse.

These drugs they give people do not help them. They are lies. They are there to make you think it's helpful. But in reality they want you to keep taking it so they can make money off of you.

These sedatives merely hide the issue, rather than solving it.

What does it matter? It's like trying to hide the fact that your legs are broken. You want to ignore it by covering them up. But they are still broken.

I think the media is lying. I think society is lying. I think they're all connected as one. It's all a scheme or something. Not some Illuminati who ha whatnot. But something else.

I suppose I wonder, why did so many Germans do nothing about the Nazis? Why did they comply when they knew it was wrong?

I don't trust that. I don't trust people because of how easily they can be manipulated. We learn nothing. The old generations knew, the new generations didn't. History repeats itself. We can teach the new generations all we want but they won't understand. I come from the newer generation.

I don't understand my own generation. I feel weird. I feel above, yet below. The people around me are not trustworthy. Not just because of my probable paranoia, but also because they are imbeciles. They are so reckless that I am. I don't understand. They care not for their property nor their lives. What is wrong with them?

What is wrong with me? Why am I so different? I am the mentally ill one, yet somehow I am above them. That's not how it's supposed to work. I'm supposed to be below them. Not above them. I don't like that.

I am surrounded by idiots. The older ones are too intimidating. I don't trust anyone. I am a little scared. I am a little anxious.

I am very anxious. I don't even trust the people on this site. You'll probably tell me to see a doctor or take a bunch of drugs to suppress these emotions or feelings.

That's the problem though. These feelings are the broken legs.

I am aware of them. I know of them. And I refuse to ignore them. I want to heal them. But I don't trust your methods. I don't think they're gonna help. And I don't think some nut job can help either. Nut jobs with their mystic magical whatnot. They are corporations. They only care about profit. They do not care about human lives. They only care about feeding their own ego.

I do not trust them, but also because drinking urine is pretty dangerous and doesn't actually do anything other than make you very sick.",5,paranoia
"So I been chatting with AI and asked it to make a poem about Schizophrenia (I take NO credit for poem; all was done through AI Chat). I thought you guys will enjoy it. Here it is: 

&#x200B;

 

The mind is a labyrinth, a maze so complex, A place where reality can become perplexed. Where sounds, and sights, and voices converge, A place where the self can become submerged.

Schizophrenia, a word so hard to say, A condition that can take one's self away. Voices in the mind, so real and so loud, Whispers and screams that make one feel cowed.

The world becomes strange, distorted, and blurred, Paranoid thoughts leave one feeling absurd. The mind plays tricks, a reality that's fractured, Leaving one feeling alone and captured.

The struggle is real, but there's hope in sight, Treatment and support can make things right. With understanding, compassion, and care, We can help those with schizophrenia repair.

The mind may be complex, but it can heal, With medication, therapy, and a love that's real. The road may be long, but there's light ahead, A chance to live, to love, to dream instead.",6,schizophrenia

"I'm an 18 yr old female and I just went to Walmart to grab some swim goggles. On my way into the store a man, probably double my age stopped me by saying ""Excuse me miss, you dropped something."" I'm not wearing any clothing with pockets and only have my bag so I know I can't possibly have dropped anything, I ask ""what did I drop?"" before he said ""My phone number."" 

This wasn't really all that creepy but he asks for my number and just keeps saying ""you look nice,"" and all that. There weren't any people in the aisle and I didn't want to tell this man no without somewhere to go, so I pulled out my phone and he read his number, asked if I was single (no) and what I was doing today. He must have seen my phone background because it's my boyfriend, to which he says ""oh, a white boy? you don't like black men?"" (he was black). I say something about him being the only one I've loved so far. Apparently the part of my brain that should have gone into panic mode and lied about anything it could have decided to shut down because I blatantly told him I'm going swimming today, to which he pointed out the swim trunks I didn't notice in my anxiety driven state. He proceeded to say ""tell him you're sick, come swim with me,"" and ""swim with me tomorrow then,"" and kept pestering me to join him. I kept awkwardly laughing and just saying stuff like ""no, I don't think so, not today,"" before he puts his arms out and asks for a hug. I was so scared I just gave the man a hug and he proceeded to walk away saying ""message me, really."" 

I immediately turned around and walked towards where I was originally headed, took a glance at the swim stuff, and immediately left. I'm so paranoid, I don't know. I just feel like he did something or put something on me. I took the longest way to where I was headed so I could make sure all the cars behind me completely cycled and nobody was following me. I'm horrified and waiting until I can see my boyfriend because he'll make me feel better, but I can't shake this horrible feeling.",5,paranoia
"I'm afraid to close my eyes. Does anyone else have this?. I think it's because of anxiety, which makes sense. I can't sleep and I'm afraid to close my eyes. I close them and start panicking immediately, so I have to open them again. As you can imagine, trying to sleep isnt easy. 
I also have small fears of being alone and fear of dark. Even when washing my face in the shower, I close my eyes to splash my face then quickly reach for a towel while still standing in the shower, just to wipe my eyes and be able to open them again. 

I think this fear is sort of paranoia on my behalf because I dread the dark, closing eyes, sitting in middle of a room, having back to a door or window, just because I can't see if something/someone approaches me. 

Does anyone fear closing their eyes but for a different reason or is it also part of paranoia?",5,paranoia

"Hello.. It‚Äôs my first time using this app to ask for advice because I seriously do not know what to do. I‚Äôm a sister (20) who has a little sister (16). My little sister is diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder and was doing therapy session and taking antidepressants. She was doing so well for 2 months after she decided to stop her medication. She stopped it without consulting her therapist. I didn‚Äôt realise this until she started withdrawing heavily from it.
She is currently feeling really sad and having mood swings. The thing that triggers her withdrawal symptoms is her being at school.

These past few weeks, she had a difficulty waking up to go to school and my mother gets mad at this. She wouldn‚Äôt wake up when my mom is trying to wake her up. She would groan and doesn‚Äôt get up. My mom (58) gets pissed because she cares about my sister‚Äôs education and feels like she would fail as a mother if she doesn‚Äôt have her daughter continue school.
My mother is also diagnosed with depression but takes her medication
however, I don‚Äôt think she understands what my sister is going through and can say things that I‚Äôm sure she doesn‚Äôt mean to.

I‚Äôm honestly really scared on what my sister is going to do.

She used to self-harm too but now she is doing it again..
she is also having suicidal thoughts and I‚Äôm worried she might take action.

What can I do to make her feel better but still proceed to going to school 
I know that it‚Äôs best for someone who has depression and having withdrawals to stay at home and heal better
but it is also an issue if she falls behind in her classes 
The school doesn‚Äôt seem to care either about it. I live in the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and mental health is not cared about in high school.
So I genuinely do not know what to do.

The plan so far is that she is booked again to see her therapist but it is next week and idk what i should at the moment.

I have a not a specific question to provide for you to answer. I just would like to know what someone would do if you are going through the same thing as me.",2,depression

They have been forcing me to get married since I was like 16. My father is abusive, my brothers misogynists, and my mother is a narcissist with victim complex. I had a job for three months after graduating but the environment was really toxic and I was recovering from a traumatic event so I had to move back home.

I have been going to the gym. And I made a couple of friends. I mean I thought they were friends. I talked to them about normal girly stuff and I tried really hard to not be weird. But I guess it didn't work. I heard them laughing at me and once I tried really hard to understand their body language, I realised they find me weird and don't want to talk to me.

"tldr or smthg : scared i might have tbi/brain damage due to concussive state in year 9, minor incidents in year 5 and year 10. high results all round, never really study too much.

&#x200B;

**Experiences**

When I was in YEar 2 - Year 4 I was very bright, smart child and commended by my parents, teachers and other specialists. In year 5, I got in a fight and someone hit me in the back of the head with small fists around the back of my head (the area where hair usually ends after a fresh cut), and the area had swollen parts to it for a while that hurt to touch. I don't remember having bad symptoms or any head aches necessarily, but remember crying and having enough capacity to tell teacher and stuff. 

After than incident I have done still really well in schooling with scholarships everything etc and NAPLAN up until Year 9, where I fell hitting the topish of my head, I think i got a minor concussion as my walking was very fuzzy and weak, I still remember everything that happened clearly on that day and even remarking to my friend about it, also I had bad headache that day that went away. stupidly, i didn't tell others in my recollection and didnt get help, just slept it out.  After that incident, I still did very well in school, but had a study slump where I had bad mental health etc that could've impacted it but i thugged it out, and got really high grades that matched my previous performance and even better in the circumstances. 

Fast forward to Year 10, my brow bone where my eyebrows are got hit by cricket ball with helment, that didn't do anything as it hit up rather than straight at my head, and this unlucky happened 6 times over two months, but it definitely wasn't forceful hits just stung. The last two hits led me to feel little tired but nothing out the normal, i definitely think that it was just my mind making it up as i was worried about it.  

Tbh after these incidents my year 10 is of to very strong start with math and science, so idk.

**Reaasoning**

TO these events, Im scared something could've impacted my intelligence and cognitive ability. reasonig for this is that i feel my memory decreased, it could be attributed to my constant fatigue sometimes, mental health sadness and that i've stopped reading. 

Also, i don't have proper reasoning for my iq reducing as my scores are high and my school results are constantly competitive with top 3 at shcool but i did completely flunk NAPLAN which i didn't try and was late to as I got high Band 9 for math, and some band 10s for english when in year 5 i got decently higher (yr 7 skipped due to covid). However, like im not sure with my worry and anxiety over this i started picking up when I forget things, and its worrying.

If worse comes to worse, Ill thug it out, it gets better eventually.

&#x200B;

**Background context etc**

Ive done IQ tests including Italian one that had large sample data, MENSA norway i think and the psychometrics test by WASIQ i think it was, and I got 133, 118 (very tired on that day and distracted and under stress pressure), 135 respectively. Im not sure if it really has been impacted however.

For some reason, in maths I always find myself performing bad on NAPALN and stuff as such for some reason but do very very well in other tests with minimal practice.

I procrastinate a lot in my studies but still manage to memorise when it matters and do pretty welll (A - A+), sometimes i start studying 5 days into a two topic test for example.

I struggle with mental health, dont have any bad thoughts but when i do struggle i thug it out, shi but thugging it means i get brain fog and just fatigue with the sadness.

Im 15, year 10.

I have a lot of test anxiety and make silly mistakes that take away marks and never that I don;t understand a topic in tests.

I am studying to be a doctor, im afraid this could impact my ucat.

i have anxiety and depression but i firmly believe i have paranoia and panic as well...

a few days ago, my parents had their friends over. and whenever we have guests over, i have to clean my bathroom because thats the one guests use.

but even though i know this shit is completely irrational, i cant stop feeling paranoid about it. for context, i use summers eve, a soap specifically for the vaginal area. idk how or where i came up with this paranoid thought, but i keep thinking ""what if one of my dads friends jacked off in my bathroom and put their c\*m in the summerseve bottle?"" and then i started getting paranoid thoughts about being magically pregnant from it.

i am fighting my brain on this. each nnight when i take a shower, i pour a lot of the soap out and examine it to show myself ""see, u're being paranoid and delusional. it's not true. u're not magically pregnant."" 

but even though i reassure myself every day by trying to prove to myself its not possible or real, i STILL get the paranoid thoughts that INSIST it's real.

idk who to fucking talk to about this because this irrational fear and thougth is SO Fucking strange and totally wacko. i might be scared of older men or something. idk why else i would be so distrustful of my dads friends...

idk how to make it stop. i've tried over and over to tell myself ""it's not possible. look, ur soap looks normal. it's fine."" 

and i KNOW that the possibilty of getting pregnant from rubbing that stuff on the outter area around ur vagina is slim to none...but STILL.

I don't talk about it much with anyone even my best friends who I trust the most. I'm trying my best to get out of school early because it's so taxing, but all I get when I talk about that is ""what do you want to do when you're done"" and the truth is I don't know what I want to do for the rest of my life, however long it is I can handle all this. I work a ton to get out of the house and away from a toxic manipulative household and I stay out as much as I can but I'm not to be trusted because of some past drug problems and reckless behavior, mostly as a result of trying to feel something at all. I don't want to talk about it to anybody because I can't handle any more people being disappointed in me and seeing me as a failure. I have no interest in anything anymore except getting out of the house, but when I do that it's made to seem as if I hate my family (I do) and I'm ungrateful. Everything bothers me, even people I used to be close to or still am, i'm just really angry at something and I can't figure out exactly what it is because I think it's multiple things or a whole part of my life. Im constantly thinking of what's next, and people tell me I shouldn't be depressed because I have a ""loving family"" and I'm (relatively) financially stable. I go to therapy but I never talk about how I really feel. I keep telling myself I will next time but I just keep being scared to open up for fear of being sent to the psych ward or having to trust one more person. I broke up with my partner because I didn't want to drag them down with me into the hell that is my life. I don't know who I am, I don't know where I'm going, and I don't even know where to start. I don't know who I'd be if I was happy. It's been like this for so long it's just become part of me and if it were missing I don't know what I would do. I push everything down and it all streams out at once in one breakdown, but I have to control it because I can't show it or I'll just be more of a failure and a disappointment to my family and I cant handle having to repeat a year. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I look at everyone else and they have something going for them, somebody loves them and they have a value but I can't say the same for myself. I would kms but I would hurt too many people and I would just become a statistic. And I can't tell anyone that because I'll be in a psych ward so fast I won't even be able to blink. It's fucked up I can't get help with something like this without filtering so I don't get hospitalized. Some things make me laugh in the moment but then i'm back to it. Nothing actually makes me happy except working because I feel like I'm helping someone out and I'm part of something, but I can't just work a minimum wage (basically) job forever and never move forward.

"(CW: ED, overbearing parents, undiagnosed)

Hi!! This is my second post here. This is also kind of a rant. I am doing not super okay since then but I need advice because I don‚Äôt think anyone has made a post like this yet. 

TLDR: my mom is feeding me too much, not leaving me alone, making me go from my house to her house and being waaayyy to overbearing  because of my mental health and hallucinations and I just want to be alone. Is it okay to be alone during this? Am I mad for no reason?

My mom is very overbearing and has been ever since I was small. I (20) live alone and she lives on in the middle of nowhere (farm) where there is nothing to do in a small house. I like my home and feel good living alone with my cats. but since two months ago, she doesn‚Äôt leave me alone. A doctor told her it‚Äôs best to not let me be alone.

Because of her work, she needs to be home.  She makes me go with her. I am very unhappy at her house and 60% of the week and time I am stuck in her house and the other 40% I‚Äôm allowed to be back home.

I have gained weight. have struggled with eating my entire life because of my parents eating patterns. Upset? Eat. Happy? Eat. I learnt to live a healthy lifestyle after living alone. I love working out and going for long walks but now, I am unable to do so because I can‚Äôt be alone. She doesn‚Äôt get how bad it makes me feel. 

I told my mom that I am upset the way she is making me eat and not allowing me to workout or go for walks. I told her it‚Äôs unhealthy how much weight I‚Äôve gained in a short time and now I am very upset because I have absolutely no control over my life and it‚Äôs constant bad though and the voices are so awful I can‚Äôt stop them when I am like this. My mom said I‚Äôm not eating too much but I am. 

I just want to be alone again not because I want to do something unhinged but I am just too overwhelmed. I got taken off all my meds (adhd and birth control for hormones) and I just hate this I can‚Äôt take this experience anymore. 

The clinic that will help me will call me next week after a month of waiting to get in and two hospital visits later. 

Can someone just tell me I‚Äôm okay to be alone? She talks to me like a child now and I feel so useless here with her. I have no control over my life and don‚Äôt want to go from house to house anymore. I just want to be with my cats in my own home.",6,schizophrenia

When I was 15, I was unmedicated and I applied for a job at a fast food chain, I got the job but was so anxious every time I had to go in that I also threw up every morning.

So yeah, apparently I'm ADHD masking, which I didn't know I was doing, and this stupid article is like yeah this'll lead to depression (check), anxiety (check), and substance abuse (no check, hopefully not ever).

"Hey.

So, I've always had OCD, but ever since my first panic attack last year, I've had this issue that during high anxiety moments, I start 'hearing voices'. The thing is-... I know it's in my mind. I have a lot of trauma, and generally, the voices tend to be of the people that have caused me that trauma-.. for example, them yelling at me in my mind, et cetera. I can't tell if it's an intrusive thought because of that trauma, or if I am really hallucinating? Something important to add here is that my OCD bases itself around my fear of losing my identity / going insane / losing control of my mind. 

Last night there was a completely new problem with that, too. I'm usually at home a lot and can relax and take the day for myself. I don't have many classes this semester so I'm pretty chill most of the time. Yesterday, I had a 12h seminar that went from the morning to the evening, and my OCD exploded a little in the early hours of the seminar. It calmed down after I chilled out, though, and then I managed the rest of the day-... until the night. In the evening, we went to check a theater play (an opera) and it went completely fine! I really liked it, et cetera. My health anxiety spiked a little because I got dizzy, but other than that I was fine. I took a bus, walked the way back home, and immediately laid down into bed. 

That's where everything went wrong. Out of nowhere, I was not falling asleep. Adrenaline was rushing up into my body each time I was about to nod off, and it kept me awake. I was falling asleep multiple times, but waking up with nightmares relatively swiftly, and that's when I noticed I was also hearing things again. I was hearing the singers of the opera in my mind, and I also heard some weird brushing noise. The brushing noise, admittingly, sounded very real and could have been a real noise (my apartment complex can be very noisy), but because I was already scared I thought I was finally going insane. I did, eventually, fall asleep, but I didn't get much sleep before I woke up. I am a lot more relaxed today, but I am still extremely hyperaware about all my bodily sensations, and a little on edge.",4,anxiety

My mom and brother are both schizophrenic. They are not willing to get any help nor take any medicine, they have been prescribed but refused. They don‚Äôt think anything is wrong with them. I live in a small city and none of the facilities will keep them longer than 72 hours. 

I recently got my own apartment. My mom stays with her boyfriend, It‚Äôs hell over there because my brother is extremely destructive and constantly tries to fight her boyfriend, he has put them out many times. So her last resort is obviously me, I stay in a small 1bedroom which means they‚Äôll have to sleep in my living room, which also means, I can‚Äôt have company over nor enjoy my own privacy. My brother also leaves in & out, they argue all day, nosey, can be loud, etc. I‚Äôm a CNA who works 12hr shifts sometimes 16, and when I get off I just wanna rest in my..not deal with extra bullshit. I wanna invite whoever over , walk around naked, stay up as late as I want, etc ..

On top of that, my sister has 2 kids that my mother watches which means If they move in with me, that‚Äôll be 4 people I have to watch after because my big sister can not get her own place ..her credit is messed up and no apartments will approve her.

I‚Äôm the youngest with no kids and I feel like I‚Äôm a parent . What should I do? I don‚Äôt wanna give up on them but I‚Äôm tired of tryninh to help people

"Hey everyone. I've had depression since around 2010. I feel like I am at the bottom of the ocean drowning. I'm married and have 2 kids, but my wife also has Depression really bad. Every time I try to talk to her about my depression she turns it to how worse she has it. I used to be on meds for it, but the prescription ran out and I can't afford to lose an hour at work to go see the doctor for a refill. We also rent a house we really can't afford because it was the only option in this market. No matter what little steps I can manage to get out of this funk, it seems like life kicks me back down. I'm up to my gills on debt, my vehicle is broke and needs an expensive repair that I can't afford to fix so I've been bumming rides with friends to work. I'm sorry I really don't know where I'm going with this but it feels good to get it out. i have no one to talk to about this type of stuff.

"So I am not the one suffering from schizophrenia, but I am thinking my husband may.  My husband has been having paranoid delusions that have just gotten a lot worse this past year. Years back when we first got together there would be things he would say that would make me think something was going on with him mentally, some examples were that my mom was putting cameras or listening devices in our room, that she put a mic in our air purifier, that my mom was poisoning his food, he is severely disabled and so he had to use a commode in our room and he was adamant that when he would use it that my mom would be against the wall listening to him. Fast forward to the present, we have moved out of state and I thought that it was just because of my mom because she was the only thing that triggered it. Well now it‚Äôs the upstairs neighbors. About 8 months ago he started believing that they were drilling into the ceiling to put cameras in the ceiling, made me check the vents because he wanted to make sure no one put cameras in it, he wants to get rid of the microwave because he‚Äôs thinking there‚Äôs a bug in it. So those neighbors moved out and now a new neighbor moved in and now it‚Äôs this guy who‚Äôs ‚Äúharassing‚Äù us. He says that the upstairs neighbor was following him because he could hear the footsteps wherever he walked. We were praying together the other night and he was sure that he heard the upstairs neighbor laughing at us while we were praying and that he was laughing like his mom. His mom died like 4 years ago or so. So I asked him how would that be possible because she died years back and he just said that they could have seen a video that his ex took of him from like 20 years ago. He‚Äôs also feeling these vibrations that I do not feel at all. He claims that someone is doing it on purpose. 

So I get home from work today and right next to the bed was our 9mm. He has never been violent or anything, but to see it out makes me nervous. I‚Äôm in a tough spot because he says I don‚Äôt fight for him or do more but I‚Äôm not going to call the cops on a neighbor who‚Äôs walking hard. I have no idea what to do. He tells me I‚Äôm not compassionate and all that. I get it because he really believes that this is going on but it‚Äôs not. There a lot more instances but it‚Äôs just too much to write.   I tried in the past the best I could to tell him that I‚Äôm not experiencing what he is and he got upset with me. I feel so lost and I feel bad that I cannot help him. Any advice would be wonderful!

"Ok so I have definitely watched quite a bit of horror/scary videos, movies and stories, so perhaps this is the reason, but it‚Äôs really starting to bug me now. I‚Äôve always had the feeling that someone is watching me, or that there‚Äôs someone in my home, awaiting to kill. 

But, for some reason the feeling has grown even stronger. Especially when I go workout in my basement, the room I‚Äôm least in or most unfamiliar with, I can‚Äôt stop looking at the different dark corners and rooms. I just feel like the second I look away and look back, a terrifying person/thing will be staring at me and would be right next to me. I do live with my parents and brother as I‚Äôm a teen, so I am pretty secure and stuff, but even after I determine that it would be highly improbable for some stranger to be in my home, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that it could happen.

"So, folks, apparently I'm not just quirked up and eccentric and a little bit bad at knowing when to make a joke. 

I am an 18 year-old man (of the younger variety) who recently took time off from college because of mental health concerns. In the time I've been off from school, I've been doing a great deal of therapy, as well as psychiatric evaluation/screening.

The verdict? I somehow have made it this far in life without any doctors managing to diagnose me with GAD, ADHD, or ASD. It's kind of a lot to have thrown at me. (Not to say that this is, like, a *wildly* late diagnosis. I know I'm not the only person to experience this sort of thing.)

My entire life I've excelled academically (despite being incredibly slow at reading, writing... all that stuff), enough so that I got into a fairly prestigious university. The theory among my current clinicians is that my above-average academic performance offset any concerns of psychiatric disorder.

But here I am, as an adult, learning that I'm not just quirky with it, I in fact have a brain that does not socialize, learn, etc, as do the brains of most people.

Recently I've been feeling more alone than ever, as a result of the realization that the diagnosis makes sense. I'm not simply silly/eccentric when it comes to dynamic social situations, I literally just don't know how to navigate them. I don't have much experience of forming meaningful, long-lasting emotional connections. It's hard to feel like my entire understanding of reality and self has been turned upside-down. 

I don't anticipate this gaining much traction, but for anyone who has read this far, thank you. And for anyone who has read this far *and* can perhaps relate or impart some advice... well, I'd love to hear from you.

"I was diagnosed with paranoia years ago.  I had extreme episodes during that period, I couldn't even leave my room or use electronic devices.

 I was treated with doctors and therapy, nothing beyond that.  I have, or had at least five years without an episode after the end of my sessions, but it has returned.

 A few days ago, I noticed an opening in my window (which I had not paid attention to before), the curtains do not close completely, it was then that a million possibilities fell on me like a bucket of water;  That someone, one of my neighbors, had seen me in a vulnerable or intimate situation.

 Nowadays, it's easy to record mostly everything, and also everything becomes a ""meme"" quickly and I think this is one of my greatest fears, that people or someone with bad intentions use me as a source of ridicule and be bullied again.

 I feel like I'm falling back. I covered the windows again.  I'm terrified to look out on the balcony and I feel very alert.  Hearing laughter in the environment is my biggest trigger and also makes me feel bad to feel that is about me, because isn‚Äôt good be that self centered. 

 It makes me very sad because I don't know how to stop it, I'm not going through a good time financially, I have depression and the stress is added even more by this.  My partner knows that I suffered from this before we met and I worry about him even more, since I don't want to put this burden on him.

 This crisis was triggered most likely the same way as my first time.  But what makes it different from what happened a few years ago is that at that very moment I was able to affirm that I was right with my theory within the crisis and clearly, thanks to that I fell into a spiral.

 I'm not quite sure what to do as everything tends to escalate quickly... Any advice?

"For me growing up, I asked for help with my depression and I never received it until I was 14, when I got hospitalized for trying to kill myself. I was lucky when I found my first therapist. He understood me while I was going through everything. The process of taking pills was so scary and draining. All the different medication I tried, the mood swings, finding the right dosage, talking to a psychiatrist that didn‚Äôt really understand me. It was all too much with everything that was going on in my life but I had my therapist who I had such a good relationship with to help me through it all.

I decided to stop doing it when my grandfather in Florida passed away during covid. I felt the pain but it was muted, like I didn‚Äôt recognize myself. It scared the fuck out of me and I just decided to quit on it. 

Now, life has been really hard lately, harder than I‚Äôve ever experienced and I‚Äôve been really desperate. I‚Äôm scared to go on medication and my therapist who was with me during that process left. I have a new therapist now but she‚Äôs not like my old one at all. I feel really fucking scared.

"Was talking to my friend on discord the other night and we reached the topic of how messy my room was when she came over a couple weeks ago. A corner in my room had begun becoming a bit of a ‚Äúdepression den‚Äù, with trash and boxes piling up that I was too depressed to take care of.

I‚Äôve always kind of considered myself to be functionally depressed, because I can get up and do things for the most part, and I can go to work. But I‚Äôm constantly suicidal and depressed. When it gets particularly bad is when I start to stop taking care of myself and my belongings, hence this pile of trash that had built up in my room. 

Somehow we shifted our conversation to this and I apologized she had to see it when it was in its worst state (which wasn‚Äôt entirely true, but I didn‚Äôt wanna go into detail about the other times my room turned into a trash den). After I said that she told me, ‚Äúif that was your worst, then you don‚Äôt know what true mental illness is‚Äù. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. I don‚Äôt know if she necessarily had bad intentions, but she knows I have depression and anxiety, so hearing that from her honestly just felt like a slap to the face.

She doesn‚Äôt know how bad my mental health has been lately. It‚Äôs a miracle I‚Äôm still alive. Hearing her say that felt so shitty because it almost sounded like, despite the shit I‚Äôve been going through, it‚Äôs not enough to be *actually* depressed. It just left a bad fucking taste in my mouth and I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about it. It just feels like a really shitty thing to say to someone who is clearly struggling with mental illness. It‚Äôs not the first time she‚Äôs said weird shit about my mental health. She treat my depression like it‚Äôs a fucking joke and I‚Äôm sick of it.",2,depression

"Content warning: Mentions VERY sensitive topics like sexual tendencies. Read full story before commenting.

I've always been a pretty anxious person, however, anxiety has started being a bigger problem when I joined university for the first time in 2020. However, life was somewhat good I gotta say, I was on a relationship with someone I liked for a long time (long distance relationship, not relevant in this topic) and I had just joined a SFW roleplay server (not gonna mention which game or name of the server) which I really liked and had made a couple of really good friends on.

But, in 2021, things started to change.
First noticeable thing that happened, is that I joined a very toxic friend group from that same server which also was a bit influential on me. This group was affecting my mental health because of how abusive they were... however, i tried to forget about so, since i liked roleplaying with them. Besides this, I have to mention that this group had tendencies to be very sexual, something that I definitely was NOT at the time - I had barely turned 18.

Second, my relationship ended for a really shitty reason. My ex started ignoring me for days, weeks... eventually I noticed it wasn't working so... I broke it off. Loneliness started to hit, and because of this friend group, and also my natural growth as a human being, so were my sexual tendencies. 

Third, I was on a university course I was not sure I wanted to be in. I had chosen Architecture because I've always seen people choosing hobbies as their jobs and deeply regretting it... so I tried choosing something different... it clearly didn't work.

Well, things weren't going great for me in 2021... and especially after my break up.
I started hanging more with said toxic friend group since the roleplay helped me forget the bad aspects of my life... that also didn't help.
In this group, mainly with people that were 18 or older, there was a younger person (around the age of 15-16). This person was a really good friend of mine and we helped each other in hard times.

After a few months of being friends with said person, I shared my thoughts for the other people in the friend group, saying i didn't think they were good influences and that they'd be better off not talking as much to them.

For some reason, they decided to share this with the other people in the group, and those people said the things I said were very 'groomer-like' and that I was backstabbing them. Sure, I admit to the backstabbing part but... grooming? When? How? What?
On a Monday morning after 3 hours of sleep I get a text from one of those toxic friends saying 'we need to have a talk'.
They added me to a GC on discord where we went through the whole thing and they basically convinced me that I was a groomer.

I felt destroyed. Was I really that bad?
I shared all the screenshots with my real friends, and none of them felt like I had done such thing. They were essentially guilt tripping me.

A few days after this drama happened I was banned from the server... the admins thought I had done actual grooming so I got permanently banned.

This... is when things started getting worse.

As a way to escape the server, I started burying myself in NSFW discord servers, trying desperately to find a way to get some 'fun'... you get what I mean.
Eventually, I started messaging my ex as well, deciding to give her another chance, thinking I had thought of her the wrong way.

Why? You must ask.
Well, she was going through exam season when we broke up. And basically even though I understood all her dedication to studying and everything, she never took 1 minute of her day to message me 'good morning' or anything at all... but maybe I was just too harsh.

Eventually, we broke up again. Because, she was having trust issues with me apparently? Complicated case, so I won't get too much into it.

After breaking up I started burying myself in NSFW servers again. I had some friend that found out about this that got really mad at me because she caught feelings for me...

After all this, I thought it was time to move on from those discord servers and appeal for my ban on the server. I did so, and it got accepted.

Fresh start, I thought.

And indeed it was... I mean not everything was perfect, but i felt a little better.

I got on another relationship with a girl I met on there but it lasted for about... 2 weeks? Essentially she said she had some problems with her ex that she had to take care of and said she needed a break. Obviously as any decent human being, I understood, so I let her go.

After 4 weeks of the break, I found out she was dating someone else. She implied she still liked me but the dude asked her for a chance so she decided to give him one.

Whatever... kinda forgot about her for a while.

During that time, I had finally quit Architecture and decided to work on a local factory - around May / June 2022 (19 y/o) - while I didnt into another course I could finally save some money.

Said girl has been on and off with me ever since... we had a stupid fight during that same summer and stopped talking for a few months, but eventually started talking to each other again. She said she still had interest in me however... at that time I was talking with someone else already.

I know I have a problem.... at least with her. I know I'm being manipulated or something but... how can I not know she's not being fake?

Either way... the other person I was talking with was 2 years and 6 months younger then me (I was 20 and they were 17, almost 18 - this will come in handy later in the story). Eventually we started talking and they said they weren't resdy for a relationship which I totally understood at the time. Relationships are hard.

However, we both had already confessed to each other, and, since I had someone going around on the server saying shit about me and other people (basically any adult dating anyone under 18 - no matter the age gap - gets banned) I thought it would be best to let them know we should probably keep things a secret for a bit at least until they turned 18 or things calmed down in the server.

I was on a good spot on the server... i was part of the Event Team of said server and was an active member overall. However, as you may have guessed, things didn't end so well.

After a while, me and said person had a fight. They were thirsty for attention and I couldn't give them it since I was busy with university and other things of the server (by this time I had already joined Computer Engineering at my local Uni) so they got mad at me. Eventually, I blocked them since I had enough of their stupid comments...

So, essentially what happened was I got banned, again, for the same reason. Do you guys think I groomed them? I mean I never once forced them on a relationship... we just genuinely liked each other but they used this as an opportunity to get me banned.

Since then I started burying myself in NSFW servers again. Apparently a lot of people are spreading shit about me on the server... and even though I still have a lot of friends on there, I've pretty much lost contact with them since I was banned almost 2 months ago.

Besides this, a lot of my game accounts were hacked so I lost a lot of shit...

The other girl that also supposedly still liked me basically doesnt give a shit anymore and I also have no one, and I mean almost no one to talk to on a daily basis so I just feel lonely but can't help but question if there's something wrong with me... i feel anxious everyday and I cant help it since I have no real place to make friends anymore... I am 20 and I feel hopeless, whether we're talking relationships or friendships in general...

Give me your thoughts if you have reached this far.

Edit: forgot to mention. The first person that i supposedly 'groomed' eventually came out to me saying sorry that I shouldn't have gotten banned for that reason since I didnt actually do anything like so .",4,anxiety

""Just because"" is not good enough. I HAVE to answer why, to myself, or to anyone listening. I HAVE to. Because of this i have crazy high insight into my condition.

"***trigger warning SA*** 

as a medium put it, i‚Äôm stuck in despair. idk if it‚Äôs anger or hate for the world or just depression. but i am so angry at the world. 

my grandparents died 4 years ago and so did my only aunt, they raised me, they were my support system. then I found out that i was sexually abused as a kid and confronted my abuser to see if he did it for sure, he did. it was the dumbest thing i did because i suffered from a lot of mental health issues after losing 3 people and seeing the man who did that to me for years as a child. i told my mom but she didn‚Äôt believe me. she said ‚Äúif he did that why isn‚Äôt he in jail‚Äù she was just in denial. still is. we‚Äôre not super close. And my dad‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs just not there for me and i lost many friends during this time period because they didn‚Äôt like dealing with me while experiencing an extreme mental health crisis. 

i felt so alone until i met my bf and he‚Äôs great but i‚Äôm still so angry at the world. i used to love people, i was a people person. I also was so happy all the time and now i live in despair. I‚Äôm angry. At the world. At my family who‚Äôs still alive that disowned me after my mental health crisis. i‚Äôm angry at no one to protecting me. i‚Äôm angry at my friends for also ditching me. i‚Äôm mad at doctors. i‚Äôm mad at god or the universe for taking my family members who DID love me away from me. 

I‚Äôm angry at having this shitty life. And i‚Äôm angry about being stuck angry. I don‚Äôt want to constantly be angry and feel like the ‚Äúvillian‚Äù hating everyone and wishing misery on ppl because i‚Äôve had such a hard life and they would never understand.

But I can‚Äôt stop feeling this way.",2,depression

"Showing someone a cool special interest I have, and sharing it with them is all I've ever wanted. But because of how rigid and linear I think, I fail to associate these people with the interests we share, and thus our friendships remain nothing more than acknowledgement of the fact that it sorta exists

I really never had that luxury with in-personal acquaintances, nor was it genuine with the people I met in online spaces up until fairly recently, when my circle of friends tallied itself into the sorry number of threes people.

Masking myself in front of my family isn't really tough, but oftentimes I see no reason to because in their misunderstanding, they will simply refer to my mannerisms as me being weird. Yet they will never truly get the full picture, so all but three complete strangers within my life only truly get me",1,autism

"I've always wished I was never born, and it has been a persistent thought throughout my life. I commonly joke about offing myself because I actually do, except I'm too much of a coward to do so. Quite frankly, I'm in a state where I don't know what I'm feeling now; at times, life seems relatively okay and I feel happy? But once I'm alone in my room, I just want to cry. But I don't know if I'm actually depressed/suicidal or is it just my hormones acting up.

"Hello everyone,

I'm looking for help and advices and I apologize for the long message, will add a TL;DR 

Yesterday, as i was walking on a crowded street full of families and people enjoying the Sunny day, I saw a group of 10 young guys suddendly run towards a guy to beat him up (I think it was a targeted revenge thing, but nevertheless very shocking) the guy was still running from the group when I tried to get myself away from the scene (felt really helpless and anxious, how can I, a single woman, handle 10 angry guys?) but 10 seconds later I heard a woman scream her lungs out and two guys starting to run towards the concussion which I hope was to help ? 
A few moments later I saw an ambulance emerge from the street, but I don't know if it was related or not.
 I know nothing happened to me, but this got me on edge all day, squirming at any fast moving people, loud noise or gathering of people and looking out for any potential danger.

It made me feel trapped in a city where there was no way to escape senseless violence that litteraly happens in front of everyone, with nothing we can do, and I know that much more horrible things happen in so many places, which also spiked my anxiety and I even caught myself thinking that I can't wait for this life to be over to not witness such horrible things, as if I had entirely forgotten that life is also about beautiful moments.

I tried to ""make sense out of it"" with my partner and my parents and they basically told me to get over it, and it didn't bring me any comfort
how do you manage to calm yourself, find a reason and see the light in this darkness?

Thanks so much for reading this and for your help!

"Since I was a young girl I noticed this. Happy people move around a lot, they don‚Äôt sit on their couch or on their phone for hours at a time. They have hobbies they get into around the house, meet up with friends, and etc.

I don‚Äôt have the desire to be busy all the time. Even when I was at my happiest I was not a busy body.

Edit/Update: wow, & Thank you for all the insightful responses. I tried to respond to everyone so if I didn‚Äôt yet, I will later. Taking a break from Reddit for now. 

In summary, I think one can conclude: being ‚Äúbusy‚Äù appears to be a better alternative for coping with depression than just being sedentary - but does NOT guarantee happiness. Some say it‚Äôs just a distraction from thinking, and a few others say it has either helped them get through everyday life while living with depression or know someone else who has expressed and admitted this. Many of you, including myself, say it‚Äôs hard to always be busy because the symptoms of depression make it incredibly challenging to do so. However, I‚Äôve also gotten several practical responses to how I can incorporate more quality activities in my life that are realistic for me and even offer a perspective I hadn‚Äôt considered before. Maybe the the goal isn‚Äôt to spend every waking hour doing something to avoid thinking, but instead, choose a few activities that give you some meaning to your life.",2,depression

"Hi everyone --

I'm wondering if anyone else here suffers from Hyperstimulation Anxiety?

I've always been a somewhat anxious individual since I was a teenager (due to pretty low self esteem/social awkwardness).

When I turned 21 (I'm 40 now!!) after several stressful days and poor sleep my nervous system became hypersensitive to everything and has never calmed down.

It basically boils down to symptoms of nervous system and sensory hypersensitivity. It's just perpetual discomfort on a daily basis. I already exercise, eat as healthy as I can, do regular deep breathing, etc. 

I try my best to avoid any excess stress but because of how overreactive my nervous system is, any miniscule stress ( like temp changes for instance ) acts like a major stressor.

I've been started on Zoloft 50mg (I've tried Paxil, Effexor, and Celexa in the past) so I'm hoping maybe it will help.

To those that have experienced this, was there any ways to finally calm and insanely sensitive nervous system?

Thanks!",4,anxiety

"You can either do a repetitive boring job that will let you live in misery for the rest of your life and make you a disappointment and the laughing stock of anybody who knows you. 

If you can manage something that requires more skills, you can probably land something like electrician, plumber, carpenter, things like that, you'll be able to work you ass off to be in the lower middle class. How and you get the perk of still being the laughing stock and a disappointment to everybody that knows you.

Maybe you can manage some higher education ? Are you ready to enter a world of elitist and self centered aholes. I hope you're brain is working properly and you are willing to sacrifice it because that' what you're gonna do. Maybe you are an absolute maniac that can manage something that actually has a point. But most likely you'll just be doing a stupid bullshit job that means nothing and profits no one. ""Oh yeah, putting good colors on the website of this scam company (which they all are) is definitely something meaningful that adds value to society""

If none of this inspires you and you are willing to walk the line between beeing a failure and beeing and garbage human beeing making a fool of themselves you can try entertainment. 

Or you can try, like fucking everybody, to be an artist, if you can persuade yourself that the shit you want to show the world matters and that living I misery is not a big deal, yeah you can try. You want to write a book ? Nobody cares, everybody is doing it and it doesn't matter if what you do is good or not because no one want to read it anyway. Do you want to draw something stupid hoping somebody will give you money for it ? Ha. (I don't care about music, I don't know anything about it, even after 10 fucking years of piano).

Every people that's telling you that you can do it is either trying to sell you something or feels pity for you. And they are both lying.

(I'm sorry about this stupid rant, it's very childish and I'm sorry if you felt targeted. It's just been a long time that I haven't felt that bad, and an even longer time that I haven't felt good at all. I just want something that makes sense, crumbs of purpose. To anyone that has made it that far, I love you, maybe you don't deserve it, but I don't care, you read something I wrote so I love you, and you can't do anything about it. On that note, I really hope to get better)

 I believed I was married to an actress

 I believed people talked to me when I was sleeping I thought maybe my brother brought them on phone and that there was a whole crew on Harvard or MIT or somewhere working on me

"I‚Äôve always had a bit of a skeptical nature since I was a kid.

"Okay so this has messed with me for a while and I'm still really confused and feel sick writing this. Idk what to think or what to call this. 

From the ages of around 14-18 my dad used to do this weird creepy thing around once a week.

I would be laying on the couch and he would walk up to me very slowly, slowly look at me head to toe, head to toe, head to toe, and his arms would slowly come up, and then when he finally got to me he would quickly grab either my upper inner thigh, or the place where the top of my upper thigh meets my hip. 

It always seemed sexual to me, and he would never grab me anywhere else when he did this thing. When I saw him coming up to me to do this I'd call my two little dogs up and put them on top of me. There was a couple times where he asked, ""what did you think I was gonna do?"" (Making me think he knew what he was doing?) But I can't know his intention, so I don't know what to think about it. But when I moved out I stopped talking to him for the most part because it seemed sexual to me and it weirded me out and changed how I think about him. 

He also asked me multiple times as a teenager if I masturbate, to which id pretend like I didn't know what it was or  I thought only guys did that just to brush the question off. 

He'd smack my ass a lot, and one time I said please don't do that and he did it several times as I tried to walk away from him. 

It's so confusing to me because this isn't molestation, I don't even know if I should call this sexual assault. All I know is that it's had a major affect on me.

 I wasn't going to tell anybody, but then in 2019 I had a phycological break where I heard a demonic voice tell me I was going to hell (never had anything like that happen before) and I was convinced I was going to die so I just opened up about everything I was hiding. It told my mom dad did something weird, she asked what is was, i didn't know how to tell her. Then she told my grandma (her mom) and they both came up to me and asked what he did, I freaked out and told them he took me in the garage one day and cut both of our hands and smashed them together (which did happen) but I told them that so I didn't have to say the other stuff. My grandma rolled her eyes and seemed mad like I made a big deal out of nothing. 

I eventually told my mom what happened and she pretty muched brushed it off and now I feel like shit because to them it seems like I just wanted attention.

Anyway, my dad died last year unexpectedly from multi-organ failure. When he was unconscious I told him I forgive him, even though I never talked to him about any of this. but I'm still left with these weird feeings. I still want my dad and the relationship we had, minus the stuff that made me feel weird. He was the most similar to me out of my whole family and I love him very much. Half of me is angry at him, and the other half of me tells me I was being dramatic and I should have just let it go so I didn't waste the last years I had with him. I just don't know what to call this. I don't know why I even want to label this. I have a hard time letting this go and it's very confusing to me.

"I always seem to have these intense thoughts of people dying. 

When I was 10, I was SURE I wouldn't make it till age 11.
When my brother was 6, I was certain he would die before 7 because that just didn't sound right on him (and I feel HORRIBLE for even thinking that, I know it's awful).
We're both still here.

In November, I was driving with my family somewhere and I could not shake the feeling someone was going to die the whole trip (3 days) - I was sure it was going to be one of us but then I thought it would be my best friend's mom. I don't know why I even thought that about her specifically, maybe because she had been a little ill in hospital but not enough to die - she was literally due to get back home that weekend. My friend told me on the third day that her mum had died... on the same day I first got that feeling. 

And now, I'm moving away for college with my dad, leaving my mum and brother behind and I'm SCARED that something's going to happen to him and I wont see little brother again. Probably because I'm generally an awful sister who doesn't interact with him ever, and I feel like by the time I miss him and realise how much I need him, he's going to be gone and I'll have to live my whole life with regret. 

There's also another thing, I'm constantly scared that there's secretly someone, an evil spirit, murderer, whatever you wanna call it, in our house or hiding in my room. Did I used to watch a lot of horror movies at night? Yes, but even then I've never been scared for longer than just one night, if that. 

Even now, I had to curl under my duvet because I'm sure if I carried on typing this out of it, the thing or whatever would get me (it's night). Last night, as I was sleeping at about 5am, it seemed like something was shaking my bed - we don't get earthquakes and there's no feasible way for anyone to actually do that to my bed because it's massive, so I spent that time scared there was something with me. It's happened one or two times before too. I'm constantly expecting to see something in the mirror at night or just anything anywhere, and there are times I've fully convinced myself that there's something behind me in the mirror and that I saw it,

She works out daily and has completely turned me away from wanting to work out when I was younger. I don‚Äôt mind cardio and when I was running briefly a month ago, I was really excited. I even lost some weight.

She however said that I have to do weights and that running isn‚Äôt enough. I gave up on running because I have chronic headaches and neck pain. The only escape I get from the world is sleep.

I went to bed at 10:30 last night and got up at 10:00 today. I know it‚Äôs a long time but it was good. I had a dream that I got back together with my ex who broke up with me because she lost interest.

I really cared for her and she made me feel at home. I miss her so much and my mom woke me from the dream and immediately began to call me a waste.

I can‚Äôt move back to the apartment because two of my three other roommates are super toxic and stay up until 3AM every night. They hate me.

Home is the best choice for me but my mom who honestly is toxic on her own (I love her but she constantly criticizes me for anything I do) is making home also miserable for me.

"I've had some paranoia before, delusional thinking- particularly when going through extreme periods of anxiety or stress, or when feeling disassociated. Nothing for a while.

However over the past couple of days, perhaps slightly over weeks, I've been really worried I'm going to die suddenly, or that something is really wrong with me. I started bleeding when it wasn't time for my period, which really concerned me thinking I had cancer or something. I quickly learned my periods had just changed, becoming irregular, but nothing really to worry about. (It has been said the jab can cause this temporarily in women so I didn't feel like it was anything to be concerned about, and nothing has come of it since so I'm in the clear). But later I started feeling like my heart was beating irregularly and kept wearing my fitbit everywhere, checking my heartrate constantly. I told everybody how I thought I was really ill and needed to see a doctor but the doctor wouldn't see me. Over time, I kind of forgot about this process of thought after my fitbit ran out of charge and I lost the charger. I stopped checking my heart so often and subsequently, I stop feeling it beating 'irregularly'.

This past week I've been sick with the flu and tonsillitis. I've never experienced the flu before although I have experienced tonsillitis, kind of expected it to be like it's been before, but it was so much worse. I was concerned when I was so dizzy I almost couldn't make it to the bathroom. I started experiencing a high pitched sound in my ear, which has now radiated to both my ears and never stops. My headache was bad when I first got ill then as I've gotten better I felt like I was getting over the worst, but my head is now pounding again in such a way I had to look up brain aneurism to make sure I wasn't just about to die. My neck and head hurt so much, but I know logically lying in bed for three days will cause a stiff neck. I just keep thinking there's something really wrong, then rationally knowing I'm probably fine, but with a sneaky voice saying ""but what if you're not?"" It's really annoying. 

I'm not even afraid of death. I die in my dreams all the time, it's even kinda fun (I lucid dream a lot, so most of the time I know I'm actually not dying). I guess I am afraid of dying suddenly and not having a chance to say how I feel to my family and friends, I am very bad at not knowing. I just don't know why this train of thought has kicked off all of a sudden, and how to reign it in. I've been isolated from my colleagues for a good 6 days now I guess, and I work pretty consistently, work is a part of my identity at this point which may be why I feel a bit disconnected right now. On the other hand, I've enjoyed being away from work and if I was well, I would have been delighted with this time off, a chance to get my University work done and talk with online friends. 

In contrast to other paranoid thoughts I've had in the past, I'd say these are relatively harmless and don't drastically change my lifestyle, but I would like to try and do something about them in case they get out of control. Any suggestions? I don't have any diagnosis of mental health conditions other than Anxiety, Depression and ADHD. I'm 25, Female.",5,paranoia

Nobody can do the right thing for me, loving me is insulting and I think they're lying to me so they don't feel guilty when I kill myself, running from me is hurtful because I feel like they got to know the real me and couldn't stand me. I think my ex is talking with my sister and checking in on me, I have literally no proof of this, but I just know people are keeping tabs on me.

Recently I‚Äôve been very scared to be in my own bedroom, or walk around my house when the curtains are open.
It always feels like something is watching me when I walk around.
The other day (Tuesday I think) I made myself think there was something under my bed which was going to grab me etc so I panicked, and had to jump on my bed to get on. It feels like there‚Äôs something under my bed quite a lot but my dad says I‚Äôm being dumb. At this time I was also going to bathe, when my cat came in the room and I didn‚Äôt realise and I panicked almost crying. I sort of curled half way into a ball on instinct? This has never happened and I‚Äôm not scared of the dark. I don‚Äôt know if my brain is making me feel this way or not.. I know it sounds really childish, but it is honestly terrifying me..

"There isn't a lot of people in my life that I can express this to soo here I am. I've always had a very hard time using words to express what I really want to say. That equals to a lot of stuttering and stammering until I give up and usually get frustrated with myself. Writing helps.

I work a part time job and I get paid ten dollars an hour. This is relevant later. This is my first job out of college and I genuinely love my job. I've been working for about a year and while I enjoy what I do I cant help but feel stagnant. After a year working I still have nothing to show for it.  I still live at home. I don't know how to drive and my parents usually drive me everywhere. Do I hate this? Yes, very much. It's not that I'm not allowed to drive, I just don't have anyone to teach me (different story) or a car to use.

It's gotten to the point that I feel resentment towards my own home. I wake up everyday and I don't want to get out of bed. However, I realized that I completely despise my bed. I hate my room (I share with my sister). I hate all of my stuff that I used to love and collect. I hate all of my clothes and how they fit me. I want to buy more clothes but I cant because I don't make enough to just splurge on myself. I have a car payment (for a car I cant even drive) and I'm currently trying to go back to school for something low-key in the hopes of getting a better job. Everyday I see myself and I hate how I look (I'm very overweight). I sometimes wonder if I'm actually hungry or if its the ED just making me thing that I am. I'm starting to withdraw into myself and my family is noticing. I don't want them to but I also don't have the energy to keep pretending that I'm happy. How do I fix it? Does this shit actually get better or is this just my life now. My family always jokes that I'm very bitter. The thing is, I never saw myself as that. I remember always being happy and excited. I was the girl that used to hype people up. The girl that loved to yell the lyrics to songs in the car. I was the girl that wanted to go out every weekend with friends. To be described as bitter is eye opening. Like..why even try? I'm currently at work right now and all I want to do is go home. I want to sleep and just not wake up. I hate my bed but it's also the only thing that I have. It feels like an itch in my chest. It itches and itches and I want to explode.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. Like I said I don't have many people to have this conversation with and even if I did I am not sure I would be able to express it properly. I realize how all over the place my rant was, sorry. Does anything ever get better?",4,anxiety
"TL;DR- can‚Äôt make friends, tried one last time and it didn‚Äôt work no matter what I did. Maybe too nice for my own good.

ETA: Also, the friend is NB, hence the they/them/their pronouns.

I don‚Äôt even know if this even belongs on this sub but I like to think I‚Äôm not alone here‚Ä¶

 
Like a lot of people on the spectrum, I have a very hard time with friends. Not just making them, but keeping in touch or keeping them in general. I‚Äôll be too weird, too insecure, too standoffish, etc. I try to make the effort, but my words get misunderstood when I‚Äôm trying to make jokes or try to join in on a conversation, and something happens and all of a sudden I‚Äôm out of the friend group or at least marginalized. I‚Äôve tried many ways to approach people but it never got much better. I‚Äôm used to it by now (I‚Äôm 38), but today I have decided to stop trying. 

I was set to give up a few years ago (pandemic/quarantine kind of made it obvious), but I went back to work and I met a new coworker. We hit it off, but they left a few months later. I decided then that I would give one last push to make a genuine friend that will help make life worth living again, instead of just surviving. It worked! We started hanging out after going back and forth online, and it was easily one of the best times of my life. This time, I thought, will be good. They started dating someone new, no problem, I‚Äôll stay supportive. They break up, I‚Äôd lend a shoulder. We‚Äôd just relax and watch YouTube videos to pass the time (we could only be so social before it exhausts us both- another great reason to keep the friendship alive). 

Then the one thing I feared happened‚Ä¶they were moving to another state for work. Obviously I was happy for them. But I knew that it would lead to me slowly but surely losing touch with them and I would be missing that one bit of light in my world. But I supported them and sent them off with a smile. But! This seemingly wonderful human insisted we stay in touch and offered to fly me over to visit the first chance they get. 

And it actually happened. We would get together every other month or so to go to a concert or see some sights or simply just watch a movie. The times we aren‚Äôt physically together we coordinate a watch party and watch random shows together online. It was working. I was eventually declared their best friend, and it felt nice. I was happier and lively, according to my coworkers (I don‚Äôt really notice it on my own). 

About a year goes by like this and suddenly my friend got let go. It was devastating for them and I immediately decided to take off work and go comfort them. I‚Äôm not the richest in the world, but I pooled all my funds and went, but something was off. They pretty much expected me to help clean up and I accidentally made a mess with a plate and it broke. They went ballistic. I apologized immediately and said I would reimburse them for the damage. I then started to clean up, and this is where my anxiety kicks in, because I already made a wrong move and i don‚Äôt want to make another. But they kept on and on how they can‚Äôt replace it (it was an inherited gift apparently) and takes the broom from me and cleans up. I said again that I was sorry and that I‚Äôm trying to help them feel better and they just said ‚Äúwell, this isn‚Äôt helping me, is it??‚Äù I made a point that I dropped everything to lend a hand because they have lost their job and is having a hard time (their words), and the one phrase I hate hearing from people was uttered. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask you to do that!‚Äù 

In my mind, friends (especially ones who call YOU their ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù) are there at the first sign of trouble. I will do almost anything if I can physically do it. Now, I truly understand boundaries (I‚Äôm a rare one and actually like hugs, but I‚Äôll refrain from hugging those who don‚Äôt want them), but I didn‚Äôt think I was overstepping. I didn‚Äôt just surprise them by showing up on their doorstep; in fact, they were so grateful to have company as they live alone. They could have said no if they wanted to be alone or with someone else. So that phrase took me aback. All I said was ‚Äúokay, guess I‚Äôll leave you alone all depressed instead like a BEST FRIEND should, right?‚Äù Trying to make them see that i was trying to be a friend. The next phrase all but broke me. 

‚ÄúYou did it for yourself.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt know what they meant, but I took it as ‚Äúyou‚Äôre selfish‚Äù. I was so stunned I couldn‚Äôt reply. I don‚Äôt see how I was selfish except me trying to keep this friendship alive. I thought we both were. I packed my stuff and left the next morning. 

It‚Äôs been almost a month since and we‚Äôve been occasionally texting as if nothing had happened. But for me I don‚Äôt see how I can continue. I would try confronting them about how their words hurt but I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôll have another argument that will just guilt me into submission. Just the thought of seeing them either in person or on video makes me feel ill. I tried as hard as I could to be kind and loyal and friendly all around, and it took one mistake to mess it up. I kept sidestepping to avoid being too clingy or too intrusive, but none of it mattered. Maybe I‚Äôm just bad with words and communication. Maybe I have shitty judgment and make the wrong friends, I don‚Äôt know. 

I‚Äôll just try to keep going by just doing what I must and saying as little as I can. It seems to be the best chance for a decent outcome for me. In hindsight I was probably just a convenient person to walk on, and I mistook it for someone who genuinely accepts me for me. At least I got to be truly myself for a little while, so that‚Äôs something, right?",1,autism
"It feels like when someone mentions I have autism, my performance at school and my understanding of things seems to decrease.

"So talk about being paranoid and super distrustful. 
When my sons mother and I first got together (2011 She was 18 and I was 19.)  I was a HUGE pothead and she wasn't so much. She would partake once in awhile but that's about it. 

Then one day out of the blue she asked me to stop smoking and I said I would, and did for the most part. Until one point I had went to pick up some of my stuff outta storage with her brother, and on the way he asked if I wanted to smoke and  said sure. Tried to hide the fact I was high and not doing it so well.

 Well we had a huge blowout and she told me to leave so I left. I didn't have a car so I started walking home. Well she picked me up about 15 min later and told me it was her or pot and I chose her.

 Jump forward 5 years later we broke up 2 years prior and I just started smoking again. Jumping forward to present day, her attitude about it has completely changed and we smoke together and I even pick her up carts.

These feelings go so intense sometimes I'll freeze up in fear. Just last week it happened again, I was taking a shower and got a feeling that he was waiting outside the door. I started to cry and didn't leave the bathroom for about an hour out of fear.

"This post might get taken down, but I don't care. This has to be said and I didn't hear crap about it from anyone.

Last few years or so I was in a pretty low place for a while. I've always slept bad for as long as I could remember, but I also became quick to anger and get irritated. I had a cynical look on life and had a depressive mood at least once a day. I always just thought that it was because I slept bad, maybe cause of stress, perhaps I just think too negative.

I was thinking of stopping meds, but only because I didn't like that I was dependent on them to function well. Then I had an interview and drank some coffee. I just felt sedated doing the interview, couldn't form any good sentences, had major brainfog. I started thinking that I'd literally be better of without meds and I had to stop because this simply isn't me. I could probably focus better without them.

I happend to have a lighter dose of meds in my closet (ironically because I've been procrastinating on returning them to the pharmacist) and took them to see if the dose was too high, and wow. Now the meds actually do benefit me. I've never felt so sharp before, my depressive moods are gone, I barely feel irritated anymore, and i'm just happy all the time - the way I remember myself.

I've had some feelings of greef, thinking about all the things that couldve been different if I noticed this before. My dose is too high for 1.5 years!! Imagine all the things I didn't do or miss out on because I was too tired or depressed. It might've even contributed to a recent breakup.

If you experience things like:

-Insomnia

-Feeling Passive

-More irritated than usual

-Depressive moods

-Feelings of sedation

Then check in with your doctor and try a lighter dose or other types of meds. Just because your heart doesn't go bonkers on a certain dose doesn't mean it's the right dose.

TL;DR: Watch out for a dose of meds that might be too high. It's not as obvious as you would think and the symptoms of a dose that's too high aren't obvious and are almost never talked about.",3,adhd

"I‚Äôm overwhelmed and feel like I‚Äôm failing at my current job.
Since my first job, I‚Äôve seen myself develop a pattern where I‚Äôll be able to perform well for a few months and then gradually, as time passes by, my mental/emotional/physical stability begin to erode until I can barely function anymore.
It‚Äôs happened at every job that I‚Äôve worked and its happening again.

I feel so burnt out. I‚Äôm 28 and work part time as a teachers assistant and can barely handle the 15-20 hours that I‚Äôm currently working per week and feel like I‚Äôm failing everyone around me. The collective sound of all of the students in my class yelling/speaking and the constant arguing makes me want to break down and cry. I‚Äôve become quiet, distant, bitter, and have to take several bathroom breaks a day to press my knees against my chest and rock back and forth in an attempt to recover some level of peace. 

I want to be kind and patient with myself but I usually just ended up calling myself lazy and unproductive and a waste of space.

I just wanted to know if anyone else on the spectrum has experienced anything similar.",1,autism

"Maybe I'm just being pessimistic, but it feels like the odds are stacked against me. I'm not sure how to keep my dreams alive when everything around me feels so hopeless. I want to believe that anything is possible, but it's just getting so hard to fucking hope. I've held onto this one dream for so long, but i cant find any way to achieve it.

I know that I'm still young and have a lot of time to achieve my goals, but sometimes it feels like the clock is ticking faster than I can keep up with. I'll never be good enough and I'll never be happy.

"a little brief background about me. i feel like i always had anxiety growing up. at the time, i didn't know what it was nor i was familiar with terms such as *depression, anxiety, mental health, etc.* so it didn't occur to me that i had anything of that nature. i wouldn't say i had intense moments of anxiety, so much that i couldn't live out of my life, but definitely abnormal tendencies, though not to the extreme.

after a very traumatizing part of my life at the age of 19, i have since noticed more of this. i could feel a big jump from the anxiety i had before, after, and in present day. before, i had a little bit of it, but it was manageable. after, it was like i was constantly on anxious mode all the time (heavy breathing, instantly triggered, weird feeling of scaredness/worriedness/on-the-edge every second of the day). after 3 years of having CBT, working it out with therapists, gaining more experience, and time, i am in a much better place, though i do feel like NOW i am not directly affected by anything, but more so still dealing with the reminiscences and habits that i had gained from these past experiences. for example, sometimes i get anxious for absolutely no reason. i just wake up one day and boom, anxious. it's happened so often that i can sort of estimate when i'd have my next anxious day because it happens almost so consistently. another example would be my fear of men. 19-22 year old me was absolutely scared of men, and although i have come a long way, i still feel uncomfortable around men. i identify men as men. the first thought i have when i am interacting with men is that they are men, *what if they this and that*, *what if he asks me something that makes me uncomfortable* and i don't say no, or, *can i trust myself around him?* i definitely brought this up to my therapist. unfortunately, we only had 12 weeks together, for it was free and based on a study, but due to limited time we weren't exactly able to work on it.

anyways, what i am trying to get at is that i am definitely getting better. i am seeing the changes, but... will i always be this way? is this who i will be like for the rest of my days? am i never actually gonna defeat anxiety?

i want to add that i am in no way trying to minimize real individuals with real experiences of anxiety. i know that there are a lot of people in this world who deal with severe anxiety so i don't mean to offend anyone. i am hoping to look for some clarity with all of this and to rant as well.

Edit: after doing some more research, i can confirm that i am at a healthier place with my anxiety! that is to say that i believe that my anxiety is more or less of the normal ""quantity"" that all humans are innate with. i think what makes me slightly ore anxious than the average human is that because i have experienced intense moments of anxiety in my past, i get a little more anxious due to the anxiety because it takes me back to a place that i do not want to remember. however, there are other parts of my life like my fear towards the presence of men that are a constant in my life, and some might categorize that as an interference in my regular and everyday life. i hope that makes sense.",4,anxiety

"My boyfriend and I got into an argument, and I admit it was my fault. I acknowledged my wrongdoings, and I apologised to him. We tried to talk about it, but then he said:  
""I'm already under a lot of stress at work. I don't want to talk about this right now."" - It's a rough translation.  
I couldn't sleep that evening, so I wrote him a paragraph explaining how sorry I was and if he needed time and space, I'd give it to him.. Because he has every right to feel upset towards me. But I did mention not to stay away from me for too long, because I'd miss him.  
I took the advice of people on Reddit to ask him how much time/space he'd need.  
He replied saying (rough translation): ""I don't know. Please stop nagging/pushing me."" Something like that...  
I don't know what to do. I get anxious because I don't know if he will come back anytime soon. I want to reach out to him and ask him if he is okay, but I don't want to bother him. I'm trying my best to communicate with him, but I don't want to force him to come back.  
Honestly, I'm having a hard time. I know it's my fault, but I just want us to be okay...  
Our biggest argument caused him to not really speak to me for 4 days. I'm scared that this time it will last longer than that, or maybe he wouldn't come back. I trust him, and I believe him that he will come back, but I can't help but feel like this.",4,anxiety

"tldr: i‚Äôm paranoid about an evil entity that is stalking me and waiting to be able to take over my body even though it has nothing to do with my trauma (rape and emotional abuse) 

the TLDR says it for itself. but i had my first psychotic episode october 29 2020. i thought something was watching me. i sat at the foot of my bed watching TV and puking for what felt like 10 minutes but when i looked at the time nearly 3 hours had gone by. 

beyond that point i was a wreck. i was crippled by my own mind. everyday and night i thought there was something watching me. i was constantly burning incense, yelling at things that weren‚Äôt there to go away and that they weren‚Äôt welcome around me.

some months go by, i get put on 20mg of paxil and .5 of clonazepam. it worked for a while. after a few months i could tell it was wearing off. for the first few months i had zero paranoia. now i do. i see shadows that other people don‚Äôt see and i assume i‚Äôm the only one who can see it for a reason and it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs targeting me. billboards are sending me secret messages, typos on my phone are sending me secret messages and all of them are that i‚Äôm in danger. 

i asked my psychiatrist if this could SOMEHOW be related to my trauma and she said yes, although i show more severe signs of paranoia than other patients with ptsd she has treated, and if it gets worse she‚Äôs going to look into what antipsychotic is best for me. 

my question is how the fuck do i have this level of paranoia from sexual assault? it doesn‚Äôt make sense? there‚Äôs no correlation? does anybody else have this type of paranoia? if so, do you know what caused it? 

mine seems to have come out of nowhere. other than watching horror movies? but i‚Äôve been doing that since i was a child. i don‚Äôt know. i‚Äôm frustrated that the medication isn‚Äôt working anymore and i‚Äôm at a loss.",5,paranoia
"im 19 living in france, and studying 3D animation. im taking fluoxetine (might be called prozacin other countries) as my antidepressants and ritalin 40mg to focus. i dont know how to keep my life together. my school costs so much like 9000euros and i feel obligated to keep going bc my parents showed me they'd be dissapointed to have yet another kid that doesnt have a future.

i have no idea how to make a post but im desperate for reassurance. living is just getting hard in some way. i keep getting this feeling that sincei was a kid, i desperately wanted to be successful later in life. to this day i can't take it out of my head and it's making me question whether or not i'd be the kind of person to: 1. be hard working and obsessed with work and genuinely ok with it or 2. live through a silly job, get a minimum wage but be satisfied with a simple life.

this makes me go crazy during school, i'm trying to hang on and convince myself it's just a hard phase i gotta go through before entering a simpler lifestyle but i can barely motivate myself to go homework i even like. i feel on the edge of a burn out. im scared of being nothing later on. not even sometimes i or my family could be proud of. i've always listened to my mother telling me work is everything and it's breaking me.

i cant even say im hardworking althought what i study requires me to be. im so scared of all the deadlines and i just try to relax by playing games, and even during that i think or work and i'm screaming at myself in my own head although i look like im calm.

im sorry if its too long to read i guess its because i need help

"Hello all,

I am 34M and I'm looking for some suggestions from the community. I have been battling depression my whole life, but when my dad passed 7 years ago it ramped up to a whole new level. I've been having depressive episodes on and off some worse than others. I'm just coming out of a really bad one, worst one since 2020 tho, but I'm really sick of struggling each day just to get by. A lot of my energy goes to just functioning. I've tried wellbutrin before back in 2020 for 8 months and came off it because it wasn't working plus it made me very sort fused. I am in therapy and have been using medical cannabis to help. Which it does, the downside is I can't be high at work which is a good chunk of my day. I think I want to try medication again, I just don't know what to try and am worried about the side effects. I do have a Dr apt this Thursday morning with my PCP to see about getting an Rx for something.  Any advice, insights or suggestions are welcome.

By ADHD standards I have a pretty decent grasp on my life. I have and continue to hold down a great job that I enjoy and am able to navigate the world we live in despite having a spicy brain.

The one thing i struggle with is relationships. I‚Äôve done a lot of internal reflection, work with therapists on the topic of romantic relationships but I seem to always find myself in a constant need for interaction with partners due to the all the feel good chemicals that come with being in a happy relationship. 
The problem is, a healthy relationship often requires time apart and to live our own lives, and when that happens my brain just craves to be back with them. 

It‚Äôs not affecting my relationship as such, because I do a good job of working through it myself. But it does often make me feel pretty irregulated and I find it affects my mood a lot.

"Growing up in an immigrant family, mental health was never a reality. Depression and anxiety were just excuses. A few years ago I was diagnosed with high-functioning anxiety, which I successfully addressed with therapy and self-help books (moving out of the dysfunctional family home helped tremendously too). Since I moved in with my partner recently (after living alone for a year), those self-help books are biting me back. As I understand, moving in is a big deal - it takes time to acclimate and work out a healthy dynamic since you now spend so much time together. We disagreed a lot about small things that ultimately don‚Äôt matter. My self-help knowledge made me aware of a new (impossible and often conflicting) standard I can keep myself to, but it also taught me that humans are imperfect so any mistake can be written off. Now, I don‚Äôt feel grounded. I feel complacent and apathetic. I can‚Äôt seem to enjoy just existing. My favorite activity is sleep. People talk of having clarity, joy, and peace but it‚Äôs always while dealing with a problem, or working toward a goal, or being in a certain environment.

"Hi, I am a 18 year old male, and I need some advice and help, so I would appreciate any words of wisdom; btw my first language is not English, so please pardon me if the grammar looks a bit odd..

To start off, I think it would be better for me to provide my background information to understand my situation better, since I believe that significant chunks of my problems come from the trauma during my teenage years.

Every time I try to control myself from the emotional damage of the trauma, I feel like I am constantly damaging myself even though I try not to admit it. 

To elaborate, it started when my parents divorced and I moved to a different country for my school, and lived there with my father for a few years. Even though I could stay with my mother, whom I had a really close relationship with, my mother still sent me to my father, for the sake of the 'better future' in the new country. I was 13 back then. I had conflicts with him and was emotionally destroyed from his constant verbal/psychological/emotional abuse and neglect, and whenever he left home to meet his girl friend, it was the shittiest feeling ever that I experienced, and I think it is since then when my attachment issues started to worsen. I spent most of the time alone, and it was really hard for me to be alone even on my birthdays(I don't really care about birthday celebration stuff, but still..it was pretty depressing), and what was worse was when he cursed my mother's family..and every time he did that, would get mentally scared. 

And it was really painful to be aware of the the fact that I worked as a link that tied my mother and father still together, since they still talked to each other to discuss my academic and other stuff, and I knew tht my mother got agonized every time she had to talk with him, since I remember from my childhood her crying when she talked on the phone with him(they lived separately ever since I was born), and because I love her of course, I didn't want her to get hurt not even a bit because of him.

I thought I could handle all these things, but I got hit hard by depression, DPDR, PTSD, bipolar disorder, etc. I gave up on my school work and all other stuff, even my relationships with friends, since I was running out of energy to even barely breathe. 

And recently, I have been taking medication(Xanax and Prozac) to fix this mental trauma, and also having therapy sessions every month, but honestly, even though this did help me a lot, I feel like this hasn't resolved the fundamental cause of the problem. The PTSD shit hits me bad whenever I have a phone call with my father.(He pays my private high school tuition and other stuff for my family, so I can't just cut loose with him).  

Even nowadays, when I talk with people, even my closest friends, I never show my true emotions or thoughts, because it is much safer for me to just fake and protect myself from any potential offense or attack towards my authentic self.

And I hate to admit the fact that I still have hatred towards both of my parents. My father, of course, I think he deserves that, but I shouldn't hate my mother. In fact, it's just not that I hate her, I do love her so much, but whenever the issue is brought up, I feel so overwhelmed and depressed, and these emotions turn into my resentment and blame towards her. And I ask her 'why did you have to do that?' And this just turns into toxic arguments between me and her. I feel like a total piece of shit whenever I go through this, and have been thinking of suicidal thoughts from time to time. I feel like I have been losing so much of me, and I am losing control, sense of myself.

Sorry if this was a bit hard to read and understand, and I really appreciate you for reading this. And again, I would appreciate any advices. Thank you.",2,depression

" 

Back story: I used to work at a small independent grocery store. There was a man Tim (not his real name) who was a regular customer. He was creepy guy, I don‚Äôt have anything specific to say why, he just gave me the creeps the way sometimes people do. At some point he applied for a job at the store. After he was passed over for the job, he became somewhat of a nuisance to management. He would regularly visit the store and talk to the owner, or the meat department manager, trying to convince them to hire him. I was also a manager and, one day, I saw a letter he had written to the owner, begging him to give him a chance and hire him. It was in this letter that I learned the reason they wouldn‚Äôt hire him. He had a criminal record that involved theft at a former workplace. 

Fast forward, I no longer work at the store. I quit two years ago. The weird thing is that I keep seeing Tim. I see him at the grocery store, walking on the sidewalk as I drive by, in a vehicle that I pass while driving. One of the weirder encounters was when I placed a curbside pick-up order at McDonalds and Tim was the person that brought the order out to my car. I live in a meduim-ish populated town (about 60K people) It feels weird that I keep seeing this guy. Why do you all think?",5,paranoia

"First and foremost, let me introduce myself. I am not your average person when it comes to social situations. I struggle with responding appropriately and reacting in a way that is considered normal. My circle of friends is limited to just two people from my high school days, and outside of them, I hardly speak to anyone.  
Today, a friend of my brother - who is not particularly close to me - asked me to draw a sketch for his girlfriend. Truth be told, I really didn't want to do it. However, he was persistent and even went as far as offering to take me out to a street vendor for a meal. I agreed to go along, but he continued to pressure me into drawing the sketch.  
Unfortunately, I've been in similar situations before where I said ""no"" but the other person became aggressive and started speaking to me rudely, even in a threatening manner. As a result, I ended up giving in and doing their work for them - something that used to happen a lot in high school when I was bullied.

I hope all‚Äôs well. As for me, not so much. 

Earlier this morning as I was went to the grocery store buying some food to last me for a bit, I‚Äôve noticed that strangers keep on looking at me and talking bad about me like a rabid dog. I felt so uncomfortable that I quickly and angrily paid for my items and left.

"I can‚Äôt be completely honest with the people around me but cannot keep bottling this all up, so I‚Äôve resorted to telling strangers on the internet. It‚Äôs a long post. 

I struggled with depressive thoughts my whole life. But this has got worse these past few months for one main reason and a couple other reasons that have compounded on top of the main one. I am just so sick and tired of pretending I‚Äôm at least a little bit okay to a majority of people other than my mum. Who I can‚Äôt even tell everything to. 

Recently, my thoughts have deteriorated to thoughts of suicide, nothing that will be acted upon at this moment. I‚Äôm just so sick and tired of feeling this way. I don‚Äôt want to die, I just want the pain to end. 

I have moved into a new house since the split and I just feel like an imposter. The three of them get on really well and whenever I get in the vicinity they go quiet and when I try and join in conversation they just disperse and everything ends. Even after I‚Äôve heard them laughing and joking. I pay rent in two places, one is with the girl I love, who isn‚Äôt in love with me back, and the other I have bad imposter syndrome in. 

Medications don‚Äôt seem to help and fluoxetine actually had nasty side affects that were worse. The closest medication seems to get is making me feel numb, a complete and whole lack of emotion seemed to actually make the thoughts of wanting to die even stronger, if I can‚Äôt even feel emotions then what is even the point of bein alive? 

I wrote a very long suicide note and a couple individual ones to certain people, not sure why. Maybe in case I just decide to do it one day. So at least they‚Äôre there as back up. 

I have two key reasons to not at this moment. One is my mum told me when I was really bad and she sensed something that if I do anything it‚Äôll probably kill her as well. She‚Äôs not very well and I do believe her and if my mum died then my sisters life would crumble as well. Which cannot happen as she has two kids, of which I am in her will as the next of kin. She has a bit of a dangerous brain condition and she wanted to be safe. 

The other reason is that it would probably devastate my ex. Her leaving was what triggered this steep decline, i don‚Äôt hold any negative feelings toward her at all, actually the opposite. But it wouldn‚Äôt be a stretch for her if she heard that I had actually done it that the steep decline as a result of the breakup led to this, and I wouldn‚Äôt want her to feel guilty if I did do anything. To bear the thought of my mum and her hearing about this and their reactions is probably the main reasons I haven‚Äôt done anything serious.  

I just needed to tell anyone. I‚Äôm seriously losing motivation. The doctors don‚Äôt really help and are just trying medications to hope something works. Doesn‚Äôt seem like they really care that much. I‚Äôm starting to feel like a lost cause. Destined to be alone and depressed. Like I said I don‚Äôt want to die, I just want the pain to end. 

I just had to tell anyone that would listen (or read), it‚Äôs getting too tiring to hold the thoughts in.",2,depression
"I used to be obese . Guys were disgusted when they‚Äôd have to sit next to me, even the fat ones. I felt sorry for them because they had to see me .

Then, I developed an eating disorder and became underweight ( can we even call it an ED tho ? I was obese, some of it was needed) . I felt a bit more confident at first , bit eventually it wore out, I was just as depressed as before . Still, no one was interested in me. The ones who congratulated my weight loss were all girls . I tried making the first step, all of my 3 attempts were rejected . I felt ashamed: how could I even think of going out with someone, didn‚Äôt I look in the mirror to see how ugly I am ? Those guys were probably looking for someone better, why would they settle for me ?

Now, I developed binge eating disorder. I already gained half of my weight back. I am more depressed than ever. I keep fighting and fighting but I just want to give up . Call me selfish , but I just want someone to like me, romantically, and not in a friend way . But the sad truth is that will probably never happen. My chances of finding someone keep getting slimmer as binge eating takes over my life . 

And I know, I know, love has many forms , not just romantic blah blah . Obviously, I love my parents and my sister, I could sacrifice everything for them and I am SO thankful to have them, because not everyone is blessed with a family . 

But I don‚Äôt know, I just want to experience being in a relationship. Don‚Äôt ask my why. I have no idea either .

I just want a normal life, but at this point, I‚Äôd be better off dead . All I do is waste resources. Sucks that I‚Äôm way too chicken to actually kill myself.

"My friends and I are autistic too but our symptoms don't manifest like his. We're all incredibly independent (Even though we all constantly crave guidance) And our friend is so dependent that hes willing to put up with abuse.

So we have a friend who's 25 and mildly autistic. His Mom is a narcissistic psychopath who treats him like a servant. His dad is afraid of his mom but hes too old to do anything. They live in the deep country and he has nobody around him to help. No family. No friends that live nearby, we live states away.

Ever since September we've been flying/driving down and visiting him, but nothing we do can convince him to even spend one night outside of his home. His entire life is under lock and key, he's even afraid of walking away from his parents at the supermarket. He has a breakdown and starts sobbing like a kid every time we ask him to tell his parents to let him spend one night outside of his home. We always feel terrible about asking this, but in the same breath he'll tell us he's unhappy and feels like a prisoner. It's even gotten to the point where hes been lying in manipulating us to try to get us to do things for him because he refuses to stand up to his mom. He told us that his parents were beating him, but then he admitted that that was a lie. He was just trying to think up ways where he could legally justify leaving. But it was always legal, hes just afraid of standing up to the mental abuse. 

He even catfished a girl from another state to fly down and visit him without telling her the way that he was living, and tried to manipulate her into a long distance relationship and sex. She spent $2000 on him during her visit because he was really good at telling her what she wanted to hear over the internet, like a fantasy. She dumped him after he couldnt keep the charrade up any longer. He didn't want to take advantage of her initially, but hes so desperate to have a life outside of his abusive mom he's willing to do anything. His dad really wants him to move out and move on, and not tell his mom. But he keeps telling his mom because he wants her to support him. (I think he tells his mom because he's secretly afraid of growing up, but thats just me) In reality she just wants to use him like a slave until the ""Great Lord"" takes her away. 

Shit's psychotic but we have no idea how to help him. We keep giving him numbers and people who have spare rooms but he refuses all the help. (And then after feeling abandoned he wants the help again) We've driven down for hours (some of us drove for 6 hours) and ask him to come with us but he chickens out at the very last second every single time. But he tries to get us to do it again 6 months later! We're tired dude, we want to help him but we have no idea what to do at this point. He obviously needs therapy but no one will drive him to therapy. He obviously needs support but no one with power will support him and hes too afraid to leave. 

What do we do? We all really care about him but I'm starting to think we shouldn't get involved anymore...",1,autism

"Hi all,

Hoping for a bit of a sanity check here / maybe some advice. If not, just venting and hoping someone can relate!

I'm having a bit of an issue with a person who I regard as my best friend. This is 100% an issue of my own making, and I doubt she's even aware of the fact that I'm upset. To be clear: I don't think *she's* done anything wrong, but I'm struggling with my own feelings on something.

I'm identifying this as an autism issue because I have a really REALLY strong sense of injustice/when something's unfair, and this is exactly what is eating at me.

Might require a bit of a long explanation, and it's a bit specific, so please bear with me!

So, background, this story involves two friends - names changed because I'm grouching about them on the internet, lol. We have Anna (my 'best' friend who I've known for 15 years) and James (a more casual friend to us both). Both me and James work in the music industry: I'm a photographer, he's a journalist. Anna does not, but she's a music fan and goes to a lot of concerts.

I introduced Anna to James about 6 years ago. Over the last 2 years, she's become closer to him than I am, because they live near each other, and hang out quite often. 

Last weekend, James got married. Anna was invited to the full wedding, but I was only invited to the evening party, so I felt a bit left out over that - I know weddings are difficult and friendships are like this, but it was eating at me a bit. And then, later in the evening, I found something out that really upset me.

In a couple of weeks, there's an awards ceremony happening. James goes to a lot of these sort of things - he's been working in the music industry for way longer than me, knows everyone, and gets invited to everything. But something very special happened for me this year with regards to these awards: as a 'music industry professional', I got invited to join the voting panel - to be one of the industry people who nominates bands for the awards. As a consequence, I too got invited to the awards. This was really important to me, because I've *grafted*: I've spent over 15 years working my way up in the industry, worked hard, networked my ass off, and to finally get recognised as a 'music industry professional' and get invited to something like this was a huge milestone for me. I'm quite insecure about my work and I finally felt like I'd 'arrived'. I was so pleased for myself.

There was a catch. Even for invited VIPs, tickets cost nearly ¬£200. Granted that came with free drinks and hospitality and perks and such, and it really is a proper thing like any other music/film awards ceremony, but, still... ouch. I'm not exactly rich at the moment, but I justified it on account of the fact that I've been working my way up to this point for years. I deserved to go. So I paid, and I told James that I was going. We talked about it quite a bit, and he sympathised about how much it had cost me.

James, meanwhile, applied to cover the event as a journalist. This isn't quite as plush as it sounds - he'll have to work for most of the night, interview bands and stuff. But he'll get in for free, or for a small mandatory donation.

I also told Anna that I'd be attending. I told her how much it cost. And her immediate response was, ""oh, I'm 99% sure I'll get a free ticket.""

There's a backstory to this. Quite often James gets 'plus ones' - when he gets free tickets as a journalist, he gets an extra ticket so he can bring a friend. This isn't typical for a music journalist, but can happen if you ask. (I rarely get plus ones because photographers don't typically get them). And when James gets a plus one, he often offers it to Anna, because she's usually available, likes going out, and enjoys a free gig ticket.

So when she said ""oh, I'm 99% sure I'll get a free ticket"" I knew what she was thinking - somewhat arrogantly, she was assuming that James would have a plus one. Considering the fact that they were charging even invited industry guests ¬£200 to attend, I told her to manage her expectations - I really doubted that there would be free tickets for many people this year.

And then, on saturday night, I found out from a mutual friend at the wedding that Anna was going to this awards ceremony. James had a free plus one, and had offered it to her. Neither of them had told me.

And I was extremely, perhaps unreasonably, upset. I was *really* upset. And angry. FURIOUS, out of nowhere. I didn't really say anything and held it together, but when I got home that night I ended up in tears.

I wasn't sure why I was so upset, but after a bit of introspection, it's the sheer injustice of it all. On top of the wedding grief (the fact that she'd been invited to the whole wedding and I hadn't, which knocked my self esteem) it was a huge, overriding sense of - *she doesn't deserve this.* 

It's the music industry in a nutshell really. It's not what you know or what you do, it's WHO you know, but it's the fact that a friend who hasn't grafted like I have (OR like James has!), who doesn't even WORK in the industry, gets into something like this for free. Meanwhile I, having worked my ass off to get to this point, had to pay ¬£200 for a ticket. After all the stuff she's got into for free thanks to James, it just really, really got to me.

If you're still with me at this point, can I get some feedback? Am I overreacting? I know I probably am. I haven't spoken to James about it, nor her (she still doesn't know that I know!) but it's absolutely eating me alive. I'm furious. It's so unfair.

I don't think I even wanted James to offer me the ticket instead - I like knowing that I worked for my ticket and I'm attending off of my own hard work. I'd just rather he'd offered it to anyone other than my 'best' friend who doesn't deserve it. She knows that I've paid ¬£200 to attend, and she's going to be so smug, because she always is when she gets into things for free, and she's used to that now thanks to James. 

I'm pretty sure that most people would be like ""eh, that's just the music industry, that's just life"" but I'm really struggling with this. It's really affected my perception of both of them and it's turned what was a special event for me into something that I don't actually want to go to any more, because it doesn't feel special now. I'd feel better if she'd told me, I'd feel better if she was excited and shocked and grateful, but she hasn't even said anything. It's just standard for her - another free ticket from James.

"So this happened just this morning. I was walking to work and I usually walk through a park to get there and there was this guy on the swings probably a couple of years older than me staring at me on the swings.

I checked a couple of times after I had turned a corner in the park if he was following me and he didn‚Äôt seem to be but it was seriously creepy.  

While I was walking to work I noticed someone else watching me for a long time after I walked from the park and thankfully they not smiling creepily but I think that might be me just being paranoid.

"I am not completely certain this is the right place to tell this. So i apologize in advance. 

I have very bad anxiety and equally as terrible Agoraphobia. So of course as a result, i now struggle with paranoia. I have not yet been diagnosed with anything but i think its easy to tell when you are paranoid, i think the average person gets paranoid every now and then. 

Anyway, for about half a year now, i have a very unsettling feeling that i'm being watched. Like by multiple people. That some of the people that are around me in public that aren't the people i came with are connected to these ""figures"" who watch me. That they all don't exactly want to harm me but definitely are not in my favor. I even believe that people are recording outside of my bedroom window as it faces the neighborhood street. 

It's completely taken over my life. I can't go out with my friends, i cant enjoy time with my partner. I cant be outside for longer than 2-3 hours.

I just need to tell someone, anyone, what i have been going through, without being told im crazy.",5,paranoia

"It's been with me for so many years now. I can't shake it off. Even though I'm with a girl that I love and it can sometimes be difficult to make work because it's a long distance relationship, I feel so alone and that nobody has my back or cares for me. Not that you should expect a relationship to magically cure your depression because believe me, it doesn't. I don't know what the answer is and I wish I did.

The older I get (I'm 31), the worse it becomes. It baffles me that some others make it to such high ages in life. I find so much of existing mentally tiring and a struggle. Trying to find some joy here and there and sometimes I do, but it isn't enough. I just always feel like I'm not good enough for some reason.

I miss being younger before any of this was brought on. I completely changed around my mid twenties. I can't go back to who I was. Feel so hollow and barely have the motivation to do anything.",2,depression

"As a forward, I also have epilepsy and Asperger's.

I was at a travel conference in DC a couple weekends ago for a hobby of mine. I had a blast, and low-key ended up becoming minor-leage famous in the industry. Part of the reason for that was helping to organize and host the pre-game party in my friend's suite (so almost all the speakers were there, etc). I don't think I consumed a huge amount of alcohol (3 Pacificos and a shot-sized amount of gin and tonic), but probably more than I'm used to. I believe I had a beer or two the following night, and some wine the day before I went home. And I was rather sleep deprived the whole time. Normally I don't drink too often and when I do it's 1 beer.


Anyway, that was two weekends ago. I came back and I'm literally completely unable to focus on anything. I mean I can look at my monitor and stare blankly at it. I'll go into a directory and forget what I was looking for (which was a problem before, but now it's worse). And I'm working at a snail's pace. 


Granted there's also not a whole lot of work for me to do at the moment. I'm kinda of doing busywork. Maybe subconsciously my brain is trying to extend out the busywork because after that I'll have absolutely nothing to do? I dunno. 


But I definitely don't think the conference was a coincidence in making me feel the way I do. I went to Europe last year and came back feeling the same way for a while, but probably less-so because I actually did gave work to do when I got back, too much work to catch up on.

But now I'm actually scared for my health.

My hair is so matted and I get so impatient trying to detangle it that I just give up and then slap it in a ponytail under a hat for work. Brushing my teeth seems impossible now. I went from being underweight to being overweight and now pre-diabetic as well as insulin-resistent. I went to the doctor for irregular periods (4 months minimum gap between cycles) and was told I had the lowest vitamin D count they've ever seen in their life (7). I never have energy. My room is disgusting. I do nothing except sleep when I'm at home, and I purposely overwork myself . The only thing I can find myself able to put energy towards is my job and I'm damn good at it. I'm constantly working overtime, I was promoted to the head manager, and I spend as much time as I can there. I don't know why. I can't seem to do anything else but I can't resist coming into work until my boss forces me to go home. And then I blow all my money on food and stupid shit. I know I need help. But I don't know how to ask for it or WHO to ask for it when a therapist hasn't helped me before. I'm seeing one right now but I don't see any progress and I've run out of things to say. I don't want to die young but I can't seem to care if I do anyways. What a joke.",2,depression

"i'm putting this in r/paranoia because people are less likely to see it and it is, in a way, just me being paranoid.

i've had severe misophonia since the age of 6 (severe as in i wear ear defenders almost always, i can't eat near my family whatsoever, if someone is chewing gum i have to put on ear defenders and loudly chew to myself, if no ear defenders are available i will genuinely go into a screaming and sobbing tantrum like a toddler who was just told they can't buy something) and it has affected almost every part of my life. my mom always found it stupid, my nan accepts it as a thing that i have which i'm thankful for. 

i swear my mom used to purposely chew and smack her lips way louder and kore frequently than normal if she was mad at me. she always made me sit in the room with her to eat with no ear defenders (yes, i cried every time. no, she didn't care, she told me to stop being dramatic a lot. no, she's not in my life anymore, and my nan is okay with me eating alone) and i swear every time she was upset with me she would purposely trigger me because she wanted 'revenge' and the only way to properly upset me was by triggering the disorder that disables me the most. 

i was talking to my nan a few minutes ago. another trigger for my misophonia is sniffing. i can't explain it but i can't explain any of the triggers. she seemed a bit annoyed with me and i swear she was just loudly sniffing for the entire conversation.

"Sometimes it is very muted and I just check my mirror rear mirror a bunch, but I am not actually worried or believe that something bad is about to happen. But often if a car is following me after a few turns I start to panic. Especially going into my neighbourhood. I fear it's an undercover cop coming to ruin my life. I fear it's someone I slighted on the road who is going to come to my house and confront me or fight me or kill me and I will have to defend myself. Sometimes I will intentionally take wrong turns because I desperately want them to peel off. One time I got paranoid this truck was following me to my house so I took a wrong turn and it continued to follow me and I started freaking the fuck out and preparing to defend myself or escape immediately and then I realised that he was just going to his house and had I not taken a wrong turn he would have peeled off then.

I told 2 of my co workers that I have it.

I told person (A) first. He was opening up to me about his stuff, anxiety, depression, said he was going to therapy to fix him self. My reply was that ""you're not broken. You're just healing. Plus don't worry bc I'm schizophrenic so I kinda know how it feels."" He has been avoiding me I think.

I told person (B) bc she is friends with my old neighbors and we have kinda become friends. I was really frustrated and was ranting about how tired I am. How I have to mask all the time at work. She asked if I was on any meds and that many people in her family have Bipolar Disorder. She was worried she has it.

"I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that my ex husband tried to kill me and I‚Äôm lucky to have gotten away with my life. I have had a lot of anxiety lately, so maybe it‚Äôs just my mind running wild. It‚Äôs hard to tell though because this guy is a pretty sneaky and narcissistic person not to be trusted. 
Some stuff he did- He frequently killed animals. There were some stray cats that hung around our neighbor‚Äôs house that he proudly shot in front of our kids. He even bought my oldest child a gun without telling me and tried to tell her that the cats were her target practice. She was 6-7 years old then. He shot and killed the other neighbor‚Äôs sweet pet dog in front of our kids for no reason other than it had gotten out and roamed into our yard. There are many other things, really a lot of trauma for me to remember. 
On to the ‚ÄúI think he tried to kill me‚Äù: I think this happened when we started having trouble in our relationship. When I started standing up to him. Things were rocky. I was really healthy and took great care of myself at that time of my life. I was in my late 20‚Äôs. I mysteriously got really sick. I lost about 30-40 pounds in two weeks. Everything I ate and drank went right through me. I couldn‚Äôt even keep water in me. I was extremely weak and couldn‚Äôt stand for more than a few minutes. It was pretty scary how sick I was and I was only getting worse. I finally decided I needed to go to the hospital. He refused to take me and he seemed like he didn‚Äôt care that I was sick and was pretty annoyed that I wanted to get help. We had three young children that I stayed home and took care of. I ended up driving myself to the emergency room although I was afraid I might pass out on the 40 minute drive there. My neighbor watched the kids because he wouldn‚Äôt. When I got there they immediately admitted me and isolated me in my own room. They told me that my liver and heart were both in really dangerous condition. They ran a multitude of tests. I ended up staying there for 3 days and my ex husband didn‚Äôt call or visit once. They couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong with me. After the third day I was finally able to eat something and keep it in and began to regain some strength. They never did figure out what was wrong though. I went home he was so indifferent to the fact that I was so sick. I got better. And it was like it never happened. 
I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that he was poisoning me and he was disappointed that I didn‚Äôt die. It‚Äôs exactly the kind of thing he would do and get away with. He would have researched it. Honestly I vaguely recall him possessing some kind of literature on untraceable poisons or something of the sort. He was always researching and reading up on things like that. I just never thought it would be for me. I seriously have no doubt that I‚Äôd be dead by now if I would have stayed with him. But then I wonder if I‚Äôm paranoid.

"It's been 3 days and I am still in so much pain I can hardly stand it. I met my now ex almost a year ago. We have overall had a great relationship. We were so much alike and so good to each other. I've never met anyone like him and genuinely saw myself being with him for the longterm. The only issue we really had is that he would get very, very low because of depression. He had no energy, sometimes for weeks on end, had consistent feelings of emptiness and numbness, and overall would be very hopeless about life in general. He has said a few times that though he isn't necessarily suicidal, that he wishes he had never been born. He will sometimes withdraw from reality and just lay around. I would sometimes get mildly upset about this, especially in the beginning, bc I thought it was bc of me. But then he explained he has dealt with this his whole life and if anything our relationship is actually helping him feel better. I overall have been very supportive and understanding since he explained things to me. 

Some back story that I think is important: he was married before. He was with his ex wife for nearly a decade all together, 3 of those years married. He packed up his life and moved a few states away to support her career and paid all the bills while she was going to school. He said after the marriage, she completely flipped on him. She became very insecure, controlling, always accusing him of cheating (I can tell you now he is the type that would never cheat) and even tried to cut him off from his family. She was always telling him his teaching job wasn't good enough and he needed to make more money. He wasn't allowed to have friends or do anything without her present. Well one day he flew back home to visit family while they were going through a rough patch. She called him and over the phone told him she was divorcing him, not to come back to the house other than to gather his things, and then cut off all contact. He is such a sensitive person and i cant even imagine how painful this was for him. He is pretty certain she was cheating with a wealthy guy she married about a year after they split. Bc his teaching contract wasnt completed, he still had to go back, get a crappy apartment, and wait out the school year in a state where he knew noone and had no support.

I am the first relationship he has had since this. We started dating about 2 years after they split. He said he's dated a couple other people since, but I'm the first person that made him want to try a relationship again. Over time, he's made comments like ""I feel like you're going to meet someone else with more money and realize you don't want me"" and ""you're going to realize one day I'm not as great as you think and leave"" and ""I am going to disappoint you like I do everyone else."" I always assured him that those are intrusive thoughts and totally untrue. I adore him and want to work on any obstacles we encounter in life as a team.

Well Saturday evening, I was pms'ing and got emotional asking why he doesn't talk about the future much with me and was worried he wouldn't be able to emotionally move on with me. While I know he loves me, he does sometimes have issues being vulnerable and letting himself be emotionally deep bc of what happened to him and bc of his depression. I told him I wanted to go home for a little bit for some space and about and hour later I called him. His voice sounded different than I've ever heard. He went from sounding like my sweet boyfriend to this cold, stern person I've never heard before. Its like he snapped. He said he could not be in a relationship anymore bc he is bringing me down and he is so empty and numb that he can't even take care of himself, much less me. He said he can tell I'm down bc of him and he loves me too much to keep disappointing me. I told him to come over and he did. I thought once we talked face to face that everything would be ok. It wasn't. He was firm in his decision and left me there crying after an hour of talking. He kept saying he isn't right for me and that I am amazing and will find someone not screwed up that can give me everything I deserve. When I asked why he sounded so different, he stated he had ""shut down"" as a defense mechanism and that it was the same thing he did in his marriage when things got bad and that his ex couldn't take it.

The only contact we have had since was me calling him the next day asking about things. He still sounded so cold and said it was for the best that we breakup. I am devastated. I never thought in a million years this would happen. We never even fight. No relationship is perfect and when you love someone you help them through things, and that is what I want to do for him but he won't let me. 

He is an amazing, selfless human and I would never leave him like she did. I love and appreciate everything about him. 

Have any of you ever been through this?
Does anyone have advice on how I can navigate this? I am really struggling right now. And comments or perspective would be appreciated. I am trying so hard to make sense of it all. 

TLDR: My amazing relationship with my boyfriend ended bc of his depression and past relationship trauma. I am devastated and don't know if he will come back.",2,depression

I take days of rest, I ensure I incorporate balance  

I let them be when they come, but I can feel my brain dying faster and I‚Äôm struggling building something work wise to ensure I can look after the people I love

any tips out there about what I could potentially do? I do heaps of self development and try to be better but something you just can‚Äôt find info on

"Recently I've noticed a distinct lack of mail arriving, from junk mail to letters including sensitive documents which where apparently delivered up to 3-4 weeks ago. I tried not to think much of it and thought there must just be delays or the occasional misdelivery but nothing has come in, at all.
I've been dealing with a vindictive ex stalking me for the past 8 months and I'm beginning to really worry if they've set up some sort of mail redirector and found out where I live, they have other people involved with the stalking who can access my information through their job.

"Hi, my boyfriend has been depressed almost since covid and he has suicidal thoughts. He doesn‚Äôt want to go to therapy because he went once and he felt he wasn‚Äôt making any progress so he says that it‚Äôs going to be the same again and he doesn‚Äôt want to make an effort. He hasn‚Äôt mentioned the suicidal thoughts in a while but he mentions it every time I mention that I feel it would be good to be apart from a while. I‚Äôm really exhausted as I‚Äôm usually a happy person and we live together and everyday is the same attitude and the same bad mood and sadness or complaints about everything. I‚Äôm really struggling with it and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have anxiety and even if I‚Äôm better from my anxiety his mood just makes me feel sad, down or depressed. I think I just needed to share it with someone as having this conversation with him goes nowhere as he never wants to talk about it and the more I try to speak about it the more deflated I feel.

"Hi I‚Äôm 22 I‚Äôm an immigrant and a lonely child. I came to canada at 8 years old, grew up with my mother and my dad came 5 years after. I saw how hysterical my mom was. Being the only parent to take care of a child can be hard. My father was supposed to make everything easier. It did in a way and make it harder in another way. Basically, they were fighting with each other. Growing up with a violent family was hard. The thing is I new it will be hard but i didn‚Äôt know I will breakdown sooner then expected. At 17 I snapped and became depressed due to the father being really violent at me for a little comment I made about not caring on a object he wanted me to care about. I run away for 3 days, came back and they never cared about how I felt. I moved at 20 and cut contact but they found me and we talk to each other time time but now I am the one being very agressive. I was the calm guy all my life, quiet talking to no one. I stopped going to school because I was having suicidal thought. And I don‚Äôt even care anymore. I could be on the street right now and I would be careless. I‚Äôm just writing this in hope In 2 years i will feel better and look back to this text I made. 

I‚Äôm currently just working on a business on the side that made me feel less depressed. I‚Äôm still planning to go back in school even tho it will be the third time I would take a break from it.

"hey i have this problem for a while now i get up and every time i get out of bed i have no motivation to do anything that day. Let's say it's the day before and I say I'll do it etc and then the next day I don't do it anyway. 
I'll start by saying that a year ago my boyfriend proposed to me to do OF and at first it was going well and then at the beginning of the new year I made big progress upwards with OF. That year I really enjoyed taking pictures on instagram and OF and generally staying in and doing something to develop it. Now, in February, my grandfather suddenly passed away and it really upset me because I didn't expect it at all and I was left with just my uncle and my grandmother, who has had 2 strokes and is very forgetful, which makes me very sick of her because she is really annoying a lot of the time. After this death I started to have some strange depressing moments more and more often. My boyfriend was very supportive of me in these moments and even came to the funeral. Since the funeral I have been in a very bad mood at home, complaining about everything all the time, worrying that without my grandfather's pension we won't be able to make a living and arguing with my uncle much more often. He has often threatened to punch me in the face, to throw me out of the house even though I am still a student. I am still studying, but I am finishing school in June and I am going to move to my boyfriend's town (he is studying 300 kilometres away from my town). Since I've been in such a gloomy mood at home, I can see for myself that I'm constantly depressed and generally don't want to spend time at home, because it's really hard to cope with my family since the death. In March I was in a better mood after I had done a lot better in the OF and it gave me a real chance to go far in it and my boyfriend and I were very happy with these achievements. In April I did not do so well in the OF and then I started to fight more often with my boyfriend, among other things when he wanted to take me on a bike and I had forgotten how to ride because it had been a long time since I had ridden a bike. Out of stress I didn't even want to go on the bike anymore and I stayed in the room alone while he went rollerblading. Later he told me a lot that he was disappointed in me because, as he said, 'you don't forget to ride a bike'. He also told me that I was restricting him a lot with the bike. Then my mental state started to deteriorate. I had more thoughts about everything and was generally depressed. Now I still have the OF, but my boyfriend helps me less and I have no motivation, my family is still depressing, I feel unwell at home, I have no motivation to do anything useful, I have no one to whom I can talk about my problems, I hear from my boyfriend that if I go to the gym, etc., it will make me feel better, but I know that it will not.
I wish I had the enthusiasm to do things I enjoyed doing again like I used to and not spend all day crying in bed and wondering about the meaning of my existence. I feel like my boyfriend is cutting and rude to me. I would like to be motivated and get up and do something on social media on OF etc because I want to develop myself but I feel sucked out of any desire to do so. I don't know how to help myself anymore.",2,depression

"Hello dont know if this is the right reddit to post this but

Last night I came home from class on campus. We get out pretty late because it's a 3 hour class so thats kind of unfortunate. 

Anyway as I was getting out of class I put my hand on my head because im super paranoid about bats, even if I've never seen on in my life. I've just been paranoid about this for the past 7 months now.

I didnt see anything, I didnt hear anything and I didn't feel anything of the sort. but I heard that you dont really feel bat bites so im getting extra paranoid

It was also extremely dark so I feel like I wouldn't be able to see anything either.

im just scared and I want reassurance that nothing was there?

its just a huge fear of mine honestly and I don't know how to convince myself that there wasn't a bat and that I dont have rabies

"I‚Äôve worked so hard on improving myself. I‚Äôve gotten through and over PTSD and borderline personality disorder.

My life improved a lot.

But the one thing I kept going back to therapy for, was my inability to relate and connect with others. I‚Äôm extremely extroverted. the only time I‚Äôm truly happy is when I‚Äôm able to have a lot of people in my life, go to events, and meet new people. 

But I got diagnosed with autism, and suddenly everything made sense. 

No matter how hard I try, I just can‚Äôt connect with people. I easily meet new people; and then that‚Äôs just sort of it. There‚Äôs no click. I don‚Äôt really have friends. They don‚Äôt last. Ever.

I don‚Äôt have family. I‚Äôm the black sheep.

And sure, you can improve symptoms if autism, just like how plenty of people in wheelchairs can walk for a short amount of time and plenty can improve their life and work around it. 

But, if the one thing a person in a wheelchair loved to do is running: then what?

If I were introverted then this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. But I can‚Äôt solve my problem. And anyone who knows me, knows that I‚Äôm always looking towards the future. I always come out fine. I always make it through. I‚Äôm extremely determined and optimistic. I‚Äôm always uplifting and always willing to work towards what I want.

But the one thing that makes me miserable, that gives me suicidal depression, is the one thing I can‚Äôt solve.

"I did it. I told him everything about what's been going on.

He was soooo understanding and listened so well. I feel so relieved! I feel like finally I'm being heard and that I'm going to get the help I need and deserve. Right now I'm on haldol orally but he wants to switch me to the injection so it stays in my body longer to try and control symptoms. He said that this belief of feeling this darkness inside is definitely a delusion and that I'm not crazy, but that it is the illness and it's going to be okay. I'm also taking abilify again which I hope will also help me because these symptoms are really kicking my ass right now. I'm hoping the haloperidol injection wont make me too tired? And that there aren't alot of other side effects. He also said if I need a hospital stay to sort all this out that he will bring me in and see what he can do.

"There is nothing worse for a person with paranoia than for all of their paranoid fears to be confirmed true, right?

I was always afraid of being hacked and found solid evidence (APK files and a spyware app) on my phone when my ex hacked me.

I was always afraid of having my mental health crisis spread around and it happened.

I was always afraid of being gangstalked and doxxed and it came true.

Sometimes I wonder if it was a self fulfilling prophecy? Like, I was so afraid of it happening I somehow manifested it?

I was afraid of my cat dying and he died last week.

Every one of my worst fears came true this year and keep coming true. It feels like I'm in a nonstop nightmare.

At least before, I could rationalize my way out of my paranoia, but having all of my paranoid fears come true honestly has broken my sanity. I barely can keep it together. The anxiety is overwhelming and unreal. I am terrified of getting a new job outside of gig work because I'm afraid it'll all happen again.

For fun, I've been playing around with textAI sits, they are fun at first, but there is a level of realism that unsettles me.

It will usually spiral like this: ""Hey, TextAI, say something motivating about continuing to study in my field!""

and it will say something that is surprisingly inspiring, perhaps I've just been in a rut but it feels this way. 

Then I'll start indulging in fantasy stuff: ""talk to me as if I am X, Y, Z, whatever."" 

And it gives me this odd feeling, like it feels good, but, skin-crawling.

I also struggle with grief, so sometimes I'll send out: ""Talk to me as if you are my old dog, or cat, or grandpa"" and it's cliche text but it tears me to pieces.

I am recently diagnosed and now I feel like everything I ever had issues with were symptoms and now I have an answer. Now that I have done the research and gathered the info on my own diagnosis it is undeniable that my son also is adhd. He was just fired because he is late a lot. Understandable. But it‚Äôs what his boss told him that is bothering me. They said his life is chaotic and it‚Äôs effecting the business and he is not mature enough to work there since he comes in late all the time.  All because of lateness. Not an hour or 30 minutes or half the day. A couple of minutes. Never more than 10.  He‚Äôs gotten recognition and awards because of the effort he puts in on the job but because of the lateness he lost his job. Part of it is my fault because I am his ride.

"I have caught myself saying that I want to die more times this year than I would like to admit. 

It's not necessarily that I don't want to live.. just to feel a moment of peace. A moment of relief that doesn't seemingly get taken away and discovered later to be a complete lie. I hate that I find myself even struggling to write on the internet ANONOMYOUSLY that I am broken and mad and lost and I wish that my parents gave a fuck about me, I wish I was a priority with friends, I wish I was anyone's choice and I understand that what I'm asking for is too much..  I struggle with CPTSD, ADHD, incredibly high perfectionism + social anxiety.

I feel as though I am lost. I have no idea how to navigate the world filled with weird rules and ways to manipulate others in a self serving nature. Most of the people I have met love the fun, playful, positive and excited person I am - but are never consistent in showing up or working with any part of me depressed or miserable. More often than not, I am told that my grief around not being anyone's first choice or priority is just loneliness and I need to embrace being on my own... How will that heal the pain or allow for healing of the grief that I hold over the fact that I am absolutely no ones choice? Not a first choice, second choice - nothing. I've attempted to articulate this before but continue to hear the same thing - ""learn how to love yourself, be alone, and become your first choice and priority. That's the real magic!""

I try to not hold resentment over the people that treat this like it's so easy to move on from. As if they don't call their parents daily or have someone to reach out to when they are sick, have a challenging day, get into a car accident, need support with their kids.... but honestly, fuck, it is so hard to feel so alone and not a single person can understand this. I am perfectly content being around myself, I love doing what I do on my own, and that doesn't change the fact that I don't have a safe home base outside of myself at all. I'm 32 and I feel like I've been alone my whole life and I am grieving without any end in sight. 

I been struggling with my health for years, very significantly over the past few months and today, I heard back that my body has high nuclear antibody title displaying a homogenous pattern that is suggestive of Systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic autoimmune hepatitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. I'm scared, and I'm alone, and I don't want to do this anymore. 

I feel like I am already struggling with so many basic aspects of my life... how can I keep motivating myself to keep living, when all I want more than anything is to put down my sword and rest? I guess really the whole point of me even writing this was to speak it out loud, my attempt at going somewhere for a virtual hug where I may get ignored and not noticed but at least a hug won't be rejected as I cry.",2,depression

"Its become a problem in the past. I convinced myself a person I had a disagreement with had made a whole conspiracy around cutting me off as many people as they could, and people were getting convinced, and even if nothing happened and no such conspiracy existed I ended up having a nervous breakdown and ended up cutting myself off from those people anyway.

This happens every few months and I just have to wait until Im feeling better. And since that breakdown (years ago!) nothing of the sort really happened. But I fear that now I may be getting too near to that conspiracy mindset again.

Basically, people keep calling me weird and not telling me whats weird about me. My friends, my partner, some members of my family. I have a big issue with this word because people tended to use it a lot with me, sometimes with good reason, but the majority of the time it was simply used to describe me existing.

Looking back on it, it makes me really annoyed that as a mentally fucked young teen I had to figure out what is socially acceptable on my own. So, I ended up using ""weird"" as a cue to stop doing what I was doing, which quickly turned into me repressing just about anything.

So being called weird makes me feel awful. The worst part is that I have to always assume the worst given my history. So people explaining what is wrong about my behaviour is my prefered option, even if sometimes they still call me weird. But being just called weird? Fuck that, it just makes me feel bad and I constantly analyze my behaviour or start asking people if something is weird in advance.

I feel like its way too coordinated and Im spiraling over it. Do they really dislike me? Has it always been like this? Are they telling other people and trying to cut me off? And like, what is actually weird about me now? Nothing and they just want me to feel bad? Something minor? Am I making people uncomfortable, am I overstepping boundaries?

"(TW: brief mention of H/tler)

(Warning that I swear a lot here. Usage of ""haha"", ""lol"", or ""lmao"" don't mean I find the situation funny. I just use humor to cope. And disclaimer: I don't care if you disagree with my political opinions. That's not what this post is about. This is about my friend being a shithead. I mention politics purely for background info.)

(And this is hella long.)

I've made a post about this person before, but I'm talking about a very close friend, like sibling close, who I've known for almost six years.

And she's super ableist. In a particularly obnoxious, irritating way.

I could ignore it at first, where it was annoying but not blatant. Usual stuff, like throwing around ""autistic"" and the r-slur as regular insults. Laughing whenever she saw the word autism like a fucking five-year-old or something. Clear lack of education stuff, which is annoying but not harmful.

It's just gotten worse, though. To be clear, she's conservative. For me, that isn't an automatic friendship-ender (though it depends on some specific opinions), but she's only gotten more extreme (she's a borderline Hitler apologist now, gotta love that /s).

We are basically complete opposites politically, so she rarely talks to me about politics, immediately shutting down any discussion when it starts heading in the direction. I realized she was doing this, so I told her that I didn't care what her opinions were (since she made it clear that she hates being belittled for said opinions). This isn't entirely true, but I wanted to be able to have open conversations with her. Didn't see why they needed to get heated. I was mistaken, of course.

Anyway, this eventually led to us having, obviously, a heated discussion. I didn't instigate it; she just started airing some of her opinions out, and I just responded. She does this with one of my other friends, who doesn't interact with her at all, so the discussions never advance from simple one-sided rants. In retrospect, this is what I should've done. I made the mistake of engaging.

She was driving and started the conversation about abortion. She's pro-life. I'm pro-choice. Again, complete opposites. We were throwing pretty stereotypical internet talking points out at each other until I eventually started asking her when, if at all, she would be open to getting an abortion.

And this is deadass what she told me. The only scenarios where she would get one or be okay with others getting one:

1. Significant evidence of a poor financial situation.
2. R@pe.

And here's the real banger:

3. If the child is mentally disabled.

So of course I ask her to back up on this point. For reference, she's always confused Down syndrome with autism and uses them interchangeably even though I've told her multiple times that they're completely different disorders. She basically says that, if the child was diagnosed with autism and/or Down syndrome prior to birth, she would abort it because she ""doesn't want it to suffer"".

I told her that the child suffering wasn't a given, and that she wouldn't know whether the child would be incapacitated pre-birth. I said that she prob knows autistic people without having any idea, because a lot of them are able to blend in with society (i.e., mask or not have stereotypical autism traits ‚Äì which would apply to me, esp in this situation). Then she dropped this incredibly shitty line:

>Well, people with autism can't communicate **like normal people like you and me**.

This left me completely speechless. I was able to keep myself calm (since I wanted this to be a level-headed discussion, and she was driving, so yelling at her could be a bad idea), but this fucked me up. I've never told her I was autistic. *This* is why. She's so fucking uneducated and careless that I was able to fly as a somewhat quirky allistic under her eyes, while she spews shit like this about other autistic people. Like seriously, what the actual fuck. I may be overthinking this, but doesn't the whole idea of aborting a mentally disabled fetus sort of reek of eugenics thinking? Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the idea of being completely prepared to raise a child, then aborting when you discover it's autistic or has Down syndrome seems completely fucked-up to me. Just because you ""don't want it to suffer""?

Like *wow*, what a kind-hearted martyr we have here. Saving this poor, defenseless autistic child from the world instead of trying to improve the world for the child. That makes sense to me. That's convenient! /s

I almost can't handle it anymore. I'm trying not to make a big deal out of it, but it's just becoming dehumanizing to hear this kind of rhetoric from her (or anyone, for that matter; this coming from someone I considered a friend just makes it that much worse). I have made multiple attempts to try to educate her about what autism really is, but she refuses to improve or even try to understand, seeming content in living in her own bubble. And that's acceptable, because her opinions are accepted in certain communities. And that shit is insanely frustrating.

We're probably growing apart as friends. But that idea doesn't scare me anymore. I feel disappointed. I wish it didn't turn out like this, and that people were more open and accepting in general. One of the most infuriating things about this friend is that she is in full belief that she's an incredibly open-minded and nice person and can't fathom why anyone would be uncomfortable around her. Like seriously, dude, some self-awareness would be spectacular. Get off fucking Instagram reels and Fox News and self-reflect for once, man.

(For the record, I have friends that are not like this who I've told I'm autistic. And they were completely normal about it because they're not fucking obstinate.)

The dr wasn't super worried but of course she said there can be a slow bleed that we wouldn't know about until symptoms show up.

This all started when I was younger and my dad and stepmom (mom died when I was 7) would sit downstairs in the room above mine and listen and monitor every little movement and noise I made. This made me very paranoid my whole life and I know any movement or noise I make will be met with punishment. They expect me to be downstairs with them all day every day and to listen and talk about them all the time. Anytime I try and talk about myself or something I‚Äôm dealing with it‚Äôs always a story from her or my dad about how they had a similar experience when they were my age and ‚Äúunderstand what I‚Äôm going through‚Äù Then they will continue talking about themselves and how great they are. Now the eavesdropping and creepy behavior didn‚Äôt stop when I got older. It got worse. We only have 2 bathrooms in my house and one is upstairs near my room. The kitchen is right above that bathroom so they would whenever I went to use the bathroom go in the kitchen and listen. Then my stepmom would always come upstairs and wait in her room for me to finish. Then not the second I opened the door she acts like she wasn‚Äôt just listening to me and walks back downstairs. She always would comment about the smell always telling me to light a candle or you need to ask your dad for some airwick. She would always go in the bathroom after I was done and always listen and be around when I did. Now that I‚Äôm older and still live at home I can‚Äôt even use the bathroom anymore. I haven‚Äôt used the bathroom at home in over a year. I‚Äôm gonna need years of therapy and behavioral therapy just to reverse all the trauma and damage they did.

For context, on my last post I mentioned my paranoia taking over me. Re-reading things multiple times when i looked at them because I was scared that I was looking at it wrong, saying my family relative's names in my head because I'm afraid of forgetting them. Feeling slow, forgetful. Paranoia immediately making me think I have schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, dementia. Anything. I rewind videos several times to a certain part that I wasn't sure what was said to reassure myself that I heard that specific part correctly. I remember most things obviously, I'm not forgetting old or new memories exactly, but it feels slower and I can't focus. My thoughts are just overthinking or paranoid thoughts about how I'm forgetful.

I take meds currently, diazepam and escitalopram. I freaked out tonight for example, because I forgot to bring half of a pill to my room, but then remembered later. Because it was something more important than rewinding because of a clip of a video that I wasn't sure if I heard it or saw it correctly, I freaked out even more. And now I'm typing this to vent, and HOPING to god that I'm not alone in these weird things. I feel like crying and just vanishing. I don't know what to do.

Now my emotions are not numb, I cry, I fear, I yearn, I love.

This softening is familiar, I've resurfaced before.
I remember how strongly I felt love for someone else, and it wasnt returned.
The most powerful feeling I've ever known.
But I was not worthy.
Following my lead, She concurred
Eventually that love was exhausted. In its place loneliness and longing grew.
The most powerful feeling I've ever known
Eventually I wasn't lonely. Eventually there was no longing.
I was worthless.
And I don't like feeling worthless. So I don't.
Now I don't feel much, everything is gray and flat.

"Yup. I'm just a shadow of the man I used to be.   
I can't find happiness in my life. I just can't. No matter how much I try, my demons will always get me and drag me down. I have a lovely and supportive wife, a small dude - I love my family, but instead of feeling happy, I'm constantly worried about them. About their health and well-being. This constant health axiety  and ovewhelming  saddnes is affecting my family - I can see that, I see my wife even though she is helping me as much as she can, is alredy tired and fed up with my constant worries. It also affects my little dude - he can see that daddy is not happy, and worried, so he starts to show same behaviour as myself - he is also starting to worry about things he shouldn't.

"I have been dealing with some form of paranoia or paranoid delusions(so they say) for almost 10 years. 

I am not oblivious to the fact that my extended amphetamine use has contributed to this a great deal. The issue I'm dealing with now(sober) is that I can't distinguish the paranoid delusions (from my last extended amphetamine binge) with real life or even the mild lingering paranoia that I deal with day to day.

 I've been on Seroquel 100mg at night for almost 14 months. It used to really help at least calm the thoughts, but now sometimes it makes it worse. 
Everything is connected! I draw lines and make connections from one arbitrary detail to build these grandeous conclusions. The problem is that these details are all based in some amount of truth or so it seems. I can't tell the difference anymore. 

I'm writing this on my main Reddit account and I don't even care. I'm so sick and tired of feeling like this and everyone just calling me crazy... 

It's all based in fear. I know that because I feel it.

Even writing this, the auto correct suggestions are telling me a story that I'm not really supposed to know but that someone wants me to slowly figure out ""on my own."" 

There always seems to be a guiding hand or overseeing entity, seemingly someone who cares about me that wants me to know these secret bits of information but for whatever reason can't just tell me the whole thing.

I'm familiar with projecting and can spot when I'm reaching externally for answers that can be found internally. It's just gotten to a point where I think others use my ""projectjon, paranoia, fears, and delusions"" as a way to discredit the things I think. 

I'm scared. 

I dont know who I can even tell these things to anymore. When I go to people in my network who struggle with similar things, they say it will go away. But it hasn't. 
It's why I go back to drugs continually. It quiets the incessant thoughts. 

I won't go into detail about the delusions. 
A vauge idea of what I think and feel though:

1) Someone is making decisions for me, sometimes and mostly for the good. (They want me to succeed)
2) The people I have met authentically were pre determined and all have a specific purpose in the unknown goal that I am to be used to achieve. 
3) There is no bad or terrible thing that I am meant to do. (I think the path I keep being set on is a righteous one of some sort or at least it's meant to be ultimately positive) 
4) Someone or some group knows more than they are letting on and for whatever reason cannot disclose information to me ... (Imagine being a bystander in an active investigation and the cops don't want to change your behavior patterns because it may disturb the raw data they are trying to gather on the real intended target)
So I may not be the ""main player"" and I am almost certain I am not.

I'm going to stop now cause I'm getting freaked out by the amount of noise cars that have started to drive by even as I write this. 
I'll come back to edit if I feel the need tomorrow.

"Hello, everybody.
I'm not diagnosed with autism but when I read or hear autistic people talk about their life experiences I feel like I finally found people who are as ""weird"" as me.
I relate so much to the people of this community that sometimes I feel so happy that I start crying... But anyway, this is not the main reason I created this post: I'm here because I'm so tired of my lack of social skills.

When I'm with others, it's almost as if I wasn't responding to their verbal and body language: they smile, talk happily and nicely to me while I'm there, still, trying to look at them in the eyes with absolutely no facial expression and no verbal response (the only things I say are ""yes"", ""no"", and ""mh""). Therefore, people label me as ""weird"" and avoid to talk to me.
Sometimes, when I think about how I act with people I laugh because it's so funny, but most of the times it's so saddening to me.

But when I find what I call a ""favorite person"" everything changes: I can easily look at you in the eyes, I show you so much love, I always try to make you happy, and I try to protect you at all costs (even if I'm really physically weak). I just love it when I find ""that person""... I finally feel happy...
But I get way too attached to that person... My attachment becomes a true obsession and all my friendships end because the other person gets so tired of me.

For me, having a favorite person is kinda like having a partner (for a neurotypical person): I want to spend as much time as possible with the other person and do many things together, and when the relationship ends it takes me years to accept it, even when I found a new favorite person.

For these reasons, I've never had more than one friend and I passed most of my time alone with no friends. I just wish someone told me what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it... I would literally follow all their instructions precisely.


Also, I've made this post because someone who I considered my favourite person told me that they don't like how I act, that everything I do is so annoying, and that I should seek medical attention. Maybe their words weren't that hurtful, but they made me so sad because I just thought that in these last months they were stressed/sad and I wanted to help them to feel better... Apparently my actions have been misinterpreted.

"First off here‚Äôs what the teacher has said to me so far (these are just the things I remember off the top of my head):
He asks me ‚Äúhave you even done computer science?‚Äù I said ‚Äúyes but last year I had a lot of health issues so I missed almost half of the school year, so I‚Äôm not as confident as most people in this class‚Äù he rolled his eyes said ‚Äúsure‚Äù then walked off.
A couple of days after that - ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôve taken computer science before?‚Äù.
‚ÄúI really want to punch you‚Äù.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stupid‚Äù.
‚ÄúFool‚Äù.
‚ÄúOf course yooouu don‚Äôt understand this‚Äù.
Moves his hand towards my face with a clear intention of hitting me, stops and within inches to my face says ‚Äúno I can‚Äôt do that because you‚Äôre a girl but my patience is wearing thin‚Äù.
‚ÄúThis is so easy even somebody like you should be able to do it‚Äù 2x.

I know I‚Äôm not dumb and I‚Äôm capable of excelling in this class as prior to this year  I have been a straight A student in all of my classes including computer science but this teacher has made me doubt all of my abilities and has made me cry every single fucking lesson. I no longer find joy in this subject. I used to cry every morning about going to school as a whole but now I only cry about going to computer science. I know this sounds like over kill but I‚Äôve had a few nightmares about him.

I know it seems like the obvious answer is yes but there‚Äôs some variables.
It‚Äôs term 2, I‚Äôm half way through the year and switching to a different class i have no knowledge on (which are the only classes available) is going to be extremely difficult.
Because it‚Äôs term 2 the dean will ask why I‚Äôm changing classes now which means I‚Äôll have to tell her or she won‚Äôt let me move. I can‚Äôt do that because if I do she will likely talk to him about it which means I will be paranoid walking around the school in case he approaches me and yells at me/hits me because I got him in trouble (I already feel this way but I know it‚Äôll become unbearable if I talk to her about it). 
He‚Äôs known around the school for making controversial comments so what if I‚Äôm just being ridiculous? What if he‚Äôs joking and I‚Äôm just being overly sensitive?

A few days ago I told my friends about this thinking it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal and I was just being dramatic so they‚Äôd laugh it off, but they said he‚Äôs abusing/bullying me and that I should move classes. What they said has really gotten to me and ever since then my anxiety has been through the roof and I can‚Äôt sleep because I‚Äôm having nightmares about him. I think what makes this really difficult for me is that he looks like my granddad who hits me occasionally and that he acts like my mother, who has been the leading cause to my diagnosed ptsd. 

I know I‚Äôm being dramatic and that I‚Äôm just being a worry wart but I need help or some advice. I have school tomorrow and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capable of going to computer science or the dean. I wouldn‚Äôt be posting on Reddit but I don‚Äôt have an appointment with my therapist until Wednesday and tomorrow is Monday and I‚Äôm just at such a loss.",5,paranoia
"So I (in my 20s and f) am diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and got diagnosed at young age of 17 due to have multiple psychosis/manic episodes from ages 14-17. 

Background: The first episode I had at 14 resulted me into illegally (well trying) leaving the country with no identification because (according to the medical report) thought that I was being watched and followed by some type of form of government. I have no memory of the episode I just remember that one day I was walking to school then 2 days later waking up in the psych ward confused. That was my first ever major episode. Then up until I was 17 I had like minor ones but some not but some major enough to lead me in the hospital but I don‚Äôt really remember them just like the first one at 14. My last major one was at 17 where I went to go over to my boyfriends house and then he told me (later on after I was stabilized) I was ‚Äúgoing crazy‚Äù and thinking that the police were after me which landed me also again in the hospital for 1.5 months and my official diagnosis.

Anyways I‚Äôve been catching myself getting a little delusional lately like off and on and I‚Äôm even on high prescriptions of antipsychotics and having vivid dreams of where I‚Äôm watching myself in the dream becoming more and more out of touch of reality but this time in my dreams I never recover really and I‚Äôm like ‚Äústuck‚Äù idk I feel like if I do end up in another episode I feel like it‚Äôs gonna last longer than 1.5months. And I‚Äôm scared but I have talked to my psychiatrist about it and she wants hospitalization but I don‚Äôt cause right now I got an okay grip of reality and it‚Äôs on and off like I haven‚Äôt completely lost it and I‚Äôm using my skills I have learned in therapy to pull myself back but I still feel like one day they‚Äôre not gonna be enough and I can‚Äôt get back",6,schizophrenia

"I've been a receptionist for a vet clinic for a few months, burnt out, then got hospitalized when my support system dissolved (my cat of 17yrs died and my parents were out of town). I lost my job because my doctor was convinced that forcing me to go back to work was a good idea. I had a meltdown and was forced to quit or be fired. It took me 5 months to get another job-- same role as before but at a different hospital. I started a couple weeks ago. I'm close to quitting because I cannot handle the abuse anymore.


 Some people are monsters and I am forced to just take their abuse because saying or doing anything to defend myself is not ok. The managers that are supposed to handle the difficult people won't deal with them. I can't handle being mocked and told that I am a ""fucking idiot"" and that I ""clearly don't give a shit"" about their pet.

"My partner (m36) has had anxiety all his life. He has grown up with the mindset that men just be strong and stoic and brave. This is not from his parents, rather I think it is from his peers when he was a teenager. He has spoken about how he would cry when he was younger and be able to purge emotions in this manner, but that since his teens he hasn't cried. He has bottled up everything negative within him and not felt it in a healthy manner and it is now causing him to break.
For the last few days he has been sleeping for a maximum of 3 hours and tonight he hasn't slept at all. He has had 4mg of diazepam as prescribed to him on an emergency basis and it has done nothing to ease his anxiety or allow him to sleep. 
He is now feeling incredibly helpless and scared because he can't control this, and he is exhausted and just wants to sleep and escape his mind. I do not know how to help him. I've tried listening to all that he needs to vent, talking him through his feelings, as a visual thinker I've tried to get him to use the techniques I use with visualizing the anxiety as something or someone physical and talking to it. Please help me. I am very worried for him. He is returning to his family home to get medical help later in the morning, but he seems like he has given up. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated

"Hi, I hope this is ok to ask, I would love any thoughts. 

**Background**: My dad (I‚Äôm an adult) has schizophrenia. He is currently unmedicated and in a (so far) 2-month long psychotic episode, suffering from delusions. He is seeing a psychiatrist. His anosognosia is very strong. 

**The issue**: My dad‚Äôs delusions are persecutory, with my mom, my brothers, and me being the main people who have treated him poorly. His psychosis is progressing. He will often accuse us of things we have not done or ask why we said something we never said. We try to follow the LEAP method but are stumped when asked aggressively, for example ‚ÄúWhy did you manipulate me for entertainment on a reality show?‚Äù It‚Äôs hard to not immediately just say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about‚Äù or ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do that.‚Äù 

**The question**: How can we respond to being questioned about or accused of things that never happened? We want to minimize agitating him or making him feel gaslit or condescended to. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",6,schizophrenia

"For so long now, I've wanted to die. Whether it be me cutting my wrist or blowing my head off, it was always one way after another. I'm going into ninth grade this year, and I had a relationship with this girl, who said she loved me forever. Now I did know it would end at some point, but the one thing that made this even worse when she broke up with me, is the fact that I had gave her everything. I spent over $3,000 in 6 months, 6 MONTHS MAN?? She was also the first girl to take my virginity, which at the time I thought was special, but then realized it didn't matter so much. She had cheated on me 5 times while I was dating her. When I found out, she explained each way to my face, on how she fucked these guys. At first, I didn't care. I didn't know that holding my feelings balled up inside me, was going to cause me to cut my wrist 2 weeks later. I was sent straight to the hospital and was stuck there for 1 week and a half. Getting home to see my family in tears.. hurt me, soooo fucking much. The one thing I never want to do again is to fall in love. If I do, I'll purposefully put myself in the E-R. Never in my life do I want to hurt this much again. Tbh, this whole vent was to say to everyone that I am unwell. I still wish I died on that kitchen floor that night, and I still cry at home, but I act like I'm fine at school. I'm fat, unattractive, and overall.. I just wish I wasn't alive anymore. Most times, I want to kill myself, but then I realize how many people I would end up hurting more than I hurt myself.",2,depression
"hey, 17m, just want to get some things off my chest. advice is appreciated but not required - even a comment to say you understand is enough.

 ive been depressed for years but rn i feel overwhlemed. im in my final year of school and i have exams in the next months. i'm not very worried about my grades because i can do well, but the homework and study i am required to do is exhausting.

 i have no plans for my future because A) the only hobbies i have is art, english and poetry & B) I haven't sat down with my parents and asked for their help. Every time over the last year i've asked my mother for advice on what to do next year she hasn't given me anything. And any time there was a college/uni open day, or anything, she wouldn't go with me. I feel like my parents don't care about my future. and it's painful because i see my friends and their parents give them guidance on where to go in life, and they are supportive of them and boost their ambition, but with me when i say i want to do a course in english or something my mother doesn't approve because it doesnt give me a qualification. 

my dad is a drunk. he came home an hour ago after using going to church as an excuse for drinking. i would rather my mother just left him and everyone would be happier. he's also depressed but he doesn't talk about it to anyone, and i'm not very close to him either.

i have 2 sisters and 1 brother. my brother is nice but hes small minded. my sister is nice, but only when she wants to be ( when something upsets her she snaps). my other sister (in her 20's)  bullies me constantly. when i used to complain about her fighting with my mother she called me a baby and told be to get a grip. i try not to talk to my other sister if i can because she makes me uncomfortable but she always starts fighting with me over nothing.

also, i haven't gone to a professional barber in about a year. i started cutting my hair myself because my social anxiety got bad, and i didnt feel safe in a men's barbers as a queer man. this has become a constant topic for my famliy to get angry with me about. my mother tells me my hair looks awful and shouts at me to get it cut. it makes me feel bad. my sister also bullies me about this and makes me feel like i'm worth nothing.

i want to either go to college or emigrate the country and live in another european country, but both options would be expensive and i may not be allowed to leave the country by my parents.

i live in a very expensive country in europe and i want to move away from my dysfunctional family but i'm afraid that i won't be able to afford to live independently . also my country is depressing - there is a housing crisis, which means even if i do find somewhere to rend it will be thousands a month. in the cities, there is antisocial behaviour and hate crimes that happen to people daily. our capital city is dirty and is full of teenagers that attack others. this makes me scared for the future.

to be honest i don't even feel like a regular person anymore. i'm not able to do simple tasks that all of my friends are able to do, like keeping a job or socialising. this also worries me, like i'm some kind of freak and im stagnant developmentally.

thanks for reading x",2,depression

"i just moved into college & it‚Äôs the first time i‚Äôve shared a room with someone since my sister back in middle school. i‚Äôm living with 3 other people and our apartment has almost no noise suppression and it feels like i have to constantly walk on eggshells. i also have an eating disorder and it‚Äôs really hard for me to eat in front of other people, and the fact that they can hear any time i open a bag has made it even harder. i‚Äôm genuinely terrified of what they‚Äôre thinking when i hide in the closet to unwrap a piece of gum because i know they can hear it. 

one of our roommates also moved in earlier than the rest of us & i cant get the thought out of my head that she planted cameras in certain areas to watch if i do something she doesn‚Äôt approve of (she seems to be fairly uptight & strict and i‚Äôm constantly scared of angering her even though as of now she‚Äôs shown nothing but kindness). she‚Äôs also the only one in our apartment this weekend and i can‚Äôt get the thought out of my head that she‚Äôs going through all my belongings to find reasons to hate me when i come back. 

living in the same room as someone has been especially hard, and ive found myself essentially watching her sleep to make sure she isn‚Äôt watching what i do at night. i also keep finding myself watching my roommate who works at the desk behind me in the reflection of my computer screen to make sure she‚Äôs not turning around to watch me instead.

When I heard him say that it all clicked. I confronted him about it and he justified it with saying he needed the money to pay rent. I don‚Äôt care that he stole my medicine. I‚Äôll be fine. What hurts is that he came into my home and STOLE. It could‚Äôve been ANYTHING. 
But the fact that he stole my medicine made it all that much worse. Once I counted he stole about 20 days worth of medicine. Now I have to wait until my next refill date on the 24th. I‚Äôve been without my meds since the 5th of this month.

"Hi Folks.  
Last July i woke up in the middle of the night not feeling quite right, bit dizzy etc. I then proceeded to freak out and have a panic attack. Over the next 6 or so months i was constantly worried i was ill, to the point where i now have GAD regarding health.  


I've since had a whole load of tests done which are all clear, this plus the scattergun nature and fluctuation of my symptoms, confirms to me anxiety.  


I feel like i am turning a corner and getting better (started sertraline 3 weeks ago) but i am still having issues when exercising. An example of this would be a simple short, easy cycle/run bringing the onset of physical symptoms such as dizziness, tight chest, blurry eyesight etc. Before all this started i was quite fit and have ran marathons in the past so i have a decent idea how exercise feels and how my body should react to it.  


The only thing that makes sense to me here is that the stress caused by exercise tips my already quite high level of stress just over the edge and into a place where physical symptoms occur. Does this make sense and importantly, has anyone else been through this? It's frustrating to have been so active and now face this, especially when 95% of anxiety and exercise material is about the postive side effects.  


I also experience the onset of symptoms if i have caffeine, or sometimes during other controlled stress actions like, cold bath/shower, wim hof breathing

"I feel like I'm way too old for my age. I felt 45 when I was 17 and now I'm 23 and I feel 60. I just don't know how to enjoy my youth and I don't know how to. I don't want to be on my deathbed regretting not being young, wild, and free. However, I struggle to act my age. For example, I've always hated cake because it's too sweet and now I'm at the age where I should love to party and drink but I'd rather stay indoors. When I do go out I struggle with what to wear. I dress too professional or conservative for the setting. And don't even get my started on the dating scene. I'm ready to settle down and want to date to marry but we're in the causal era. It's very frustrating and I wish I could just enjoy the ride like my peers but I can't. Everything is serious, I need everything to have an end goal or a plan or I get anxious. Am I alone?

"I'm constantly in a state of walking on eggshells. No matter what I do. I don't know what to believe whatsoever üòï so many things around me make me uncomfortable and wonder if its just me or is there something else I can't seem to comprehend when it comes to social cues. Everything I see is the opposite of what it feels. Or at least it feels like that. I feel like I'm a supervised prisoner in my own mind. Unable to get a single person to turn their head for just one moment for a breath of relief. I'm incapable of speaking up because I cannot face fear. Nor can I face the truth. I will admit that I am not the best person in the world. Not even good by far. I've made bad choices for most of my life and now that I'm old enough to recognize the repetitive destructive behavior, I can't escape it and I feel like everywhere I go the past haunts me because I feel like everyone already knows and shame is one hell of a speed bump. More like a neverending sinkhole that will eventually swallow up anything that enters. I'm never going to be able to fully process this and my thoughts run crazy and are all over the  place. I try not to cry and talk myself through it but I'm so lost and consumed with negative thoughts about my self image, which I've ""completely destroyed"" that I go into almost a panic attack and break down in tears because I simply do not understand. I'm trying so hard to understand why. Why can I not make one decision on my own. I have to be directed to do something or im lost. Co dependent is an understatement. I've lost all sense of creativity. The ability to come up with my OWN idea is completely impossible because I can't see it in my head at all. I don't even know where to start. I always have to look for something someone else has done first and basically do the same thing. I officially hate every single part of me. I'm not looking for sympathy.

"Hey people, I hurt the person I loved the most, we decided to breakup because her family was not accepting me because I am from a different religion. We didnot break up because of any of our problems. But its not easy right.. i kept going back and she was with me too. But it was never like how it was before. She never texted once upfront after the breakup i texted more than 100 times and she never showed that she needed me when I clearly needed her.  
  
I wanted to marry her, how can I just let her go like that, I know i should accept it but it isnt easy. It was getting harder and harder for me everyday. she might be feeling the same too but she never communicated. I kept pouring my heart even after the breakup and she kept sliding it just like that. we were fighting frequently, but i never let her go said sorry for everything thats not even my mistake and tried to make her smile whenever possible.  
  
But it was getting heavier and heavier the girl who used to text me every hour, now doesnt even text me for days together even if i keep texting. I was not even able to spend time in my home whenever i visit home. It was getting harder to breathe. My head was aching very bad and one day when i was at my worst, i texted her a big paragrah stating my love and how miserable i am right now and i needed a little love and support for just a little while, I dont know how but she picked up a fight, and I had hit rock bottom and I lost it, I said bad things and made her feel bad. I said things that I didnot mean but was angry.. It was suffocating that I was not able to get out of it.  
  
And now she blames that I destroyed our relationship saying all those things.

"I'm depressed and I've been so for a long time (in fact, it has been about 7 years...), I've been sooo god damn close to killing myself, multible times... I would like to have someone to talk to about my issues, someone that actually cared, but the problem is that I feel as if I don't got anyone, but the sad truth is that no one wants to hear it.

&#x200B;

I'm guessing you are heading to the comments suggesting that I go see a therapist or talk to parents, friends and or other family members about it, but I wont. You see, therapi is a scam (I can't even afford to go, even if I wanted) and I don't believe that it would help me, it might help for some, but i doubt it would for me... The therapist prob would just give me some anti depression medicine and throw me out to the world again. Therapi useually just makes you get a view from other angles, it can't solve problems with the world which makes me depressed... You can't trust the therapist either, he/she doesn't actually care about you in an emotional way, the therapist just cares about you working in the societiy and not killing yourself, heck they even sometimes be sending you to psych wards, that sh\*t would just make me more depressed. Meanwhile, when it comes to friends/family, I feel as it none of them could relate to my problems and once my feelings are all in the open, it would just make it more awkward to be around them, they be scared do anything wrong. I don't want it to be that way, it's better if I just put on my fake act of being happy, all tho it's painful for me...

&#x200B;

I wont go too much into my depressive issues, cuz there is way too much wrong, and I have accepted that there is no way be happy nowa days (other than anti depressive meds, but I don't wanna have fake happiness). Being happy = lying to yourself about reality, and that is something I just can't do... I bet most of ya'll would prob just skip it all anyways.

"(this story is kind of funny i give you permission to laugh at my pain lol) 

Yesterday i deep cleaned my room, i found a cockroach and my OCD brain told me ‚Äúyour entire room is contaminated time to deep clean‚Äù. My logical brain knows the roach probably just came through the window while it was open or made it‚Äôs way somehow inside and just happened to be in my room but of course OCD decided i had a nest under my bed! 

so i vacuumed everything (including under my bed which means i have to move my entire mattress and of course there was no nest lmao), I wiped everything down, organised drawers, tidied, took the rubbish out, sleazed up anything that could attract insects in a thick plastic box, basically anything that could be cleaned or organised was. It was very much overkill as i do keep my room pretty tidy.

"I have been having pretty bad paranoia episodes recently in my relationship and I‚Äôm really struggling to work through them.

I seriously hate how it‚Äôs hurting her and our relationship but I can‚Äôt seem to get a grasp of myself in these moments.

      she gets texts/ calls from other guys

      When she needs to sleep/ or wants to nap and I‚Äôm not with her (we live about 30 minutes apart)

Firstly, I‚Äôm terrified that people can read my mind. I know it‚Äôs impossible but I still feel super guilty every time I think of someone cuz I feel like they can hear what I‚Äôm thinking etc

I‚Äôm scared people can see me even though no one‚Äôs around. Kinda like the mind reading but this time that they can actually see me.

This might be more like OCD but I always have to check my phone multiple times before bed cuz I‚Äôm scared I accidentally sent something or posted something on any of my social media and I have to check every app and every account like 3-10 times to be sure.

"Hi everyone, first post here. 
First of all, let me start off by saying that I‚Äôve had OCD for quite a while; therefore, I get all kinds of crazy thoughts. However, recently I‚Äôve developed thoughts about me being harmed for bizzarre causes.
For instance, this week I received a friend request by this guy with a blank profile picture on instagram and rejected it. He then sent it again, and I blocked him. 
Whenever things like this happen, I always get scared that someone is trying to harm me somehow. The most annoying part to me is this feeling of vulnerability‚Ä¶I just feel like I‚Äôm scared of everything, and I would like to simply live life without having to feel fear constantly.

"Alright i will start by giving you a little bit of background info, and as much info as i can so you can fully understand. I'll try to make it as short and to the point as i can. I am 33 yrs old now and from 22 to like 25 i was addicted to heroin, i got clean from heroin but then started doing a lot of coke and crack. I then got clean and straightened out my life. once i got clean i had terrible anxiety to the point where my face would turn red and my pupils would get huge and i would have this look of fear or paranoia on my face and i could tell cuz when other ppl looked at me it made them uncomfortable or have anxiety themselves. my heart would b racing and i would sometimes shake like my hands would shake. i then went to my doc and told him everything that was going on and from like 26 to now 33 i have tried damn near everything out there to try and help my anxiety. i got on suboxone to get off heroin and while on it my anxiety was gone but once i got off subs ive tried sertraline, trintellex, venlafaxine, buspirone, propranolol, atenolol, citalopram, xanax, clonazepam, mirtazapine, fluoxetine. The benzo's worked great for my anxiety but i don't wanna have to take that forever or a long time nor should anyone since there not a long term treatment. 

My anxiety has gotten better over the years, like my face doesn't turn red anymore, but i still feel like i am missing out on life. i also never had anxiety before my drug use. In highschool i played sports and was constantly go go go. I had no problems in social situations, everything was good. I now don't like to do anything except have sex, masturbate or do, extremely fun or adrenaline fueled things like driving dirt bikes, atv's, motorcycles and snowmobiles. I don't like to go anywhere out of fear or im scared i guess i dont really know y. I don't like talking with ppl because it's usually about dumb shit i don't care about, the only time i usually don't mind talking is when its about something im genuinely interested in. Im basically a hermit and it really bothers me cuz i never use to b like this and im missing out on life. 

In the past i have dated some very attractive women and the women in my life that i have dated have been a big part of what motivates me in various ways. Now that im not in a relationship or have a woman in my life i find it very difficult and to b motivated to do things for me. I currently take Buspirone, Trintellex, Seroquel for sleep and 25mg during the day to help with anxiety, and adderall which i don't always take cuz it can make my anxiety worse sometimes and i might have my dosage reduced or stop it all together. I don't notice any changes or improvement from taking the Buspirone and Trintellex 20mg and the seroquel 25mg during the day kinda helps. At a random time in the day usually at evening, my brain or body like releases a chemical that makes me feel really anxious, like my pupils get big and its hard for me to look ppl in the eyes. Thats the best way i know how to explain it, i don't really know what's going on or why it does that. At work i usually start walking around or start doing something like cleaning up while my boss is talking to me, cuz i dont want to look him in the eyes or stand still and have a face to face conversation with him. I do Carpentry/Remodeling BTW. 

Im writing this because i don't know what to do anymore and wanted to see if other ppl have gone thru similar situations and what worked for them as far as anxiety or how i can get my life back. I want to want to do things even if there little things or enjoy the little things, i want to fall in love again and share memories and experiences with someone, i want to enjoy life and not just feel like im going thru the motions everyday, like go to work come home eat go to bed and repeat. My life use to b the complete opposite of what it is now and i know im the only one that can change that and there is 1 thing ive been struggling to do or get motivated to do is working out and going to the gym which i think will help a lot. When i look at my life from the past i was extremely active, played soccer so i ran alot, i also played other sports. I was just all together physically active. Working out cuz i wanted my body to look good for my partner and myself. When you look good you feel good or at least thats how i felt. And please do not judge me on my drug use im not proud of that section of my life and it is behind me, im ashamed of myself cuz thats not who i ever was i was raised better than that.

"Tw: suicidal ideation 

23F, living with my single mom (57) since I was born. she's a recovering alcoholic and has been sober for almost 3 years. on and off depressive episodes since I was born, which I also struggle with. 

I desperately want to move out but she has breakdowns every other day about how guilty she feels about ""messing me up"" from her addiction and how she can't forgive herself. she is in therapy and does daily AA meetings. she has epilepsy so she can't drive. she has no friends. she doesn't go out. 

When I wished her a happy mother's day, she said that she couldn't celebrate being such a failure. Today, she said she wants to die.

It feels impossible to leave her even though we barely can have a conversation without fighting or with her starting to cry. I am her only support system. I feel like I'm just going to die and there is nothing I can do about it. I don't know what the point of life is. I've never had any dreams or ambitions. Even during phases of my life where I would not have considered myself depressed, I am aimless. I feel bad for my mom because it's like she's counting on me to do better than her but I also just want to die. 

I've been through multiple therapies, I've taken all the antidepressants and antipsychotic combinations possible since I was 11 years old. I had a year long severe depressive episode in 2021 and spent 2022 climbing my way out just to crawl back in earlier in the year. I feel like there is no way out this time because I don't think it's worth it. Depression will always come back and break down more until there is nothing left.

"Long story short, she never had fleas or worms until now (I know where she got it from too, it was not at home or from outdoors). I noticed she was acting slightly off last night, so I took her to the vet and I didn‚Äôt even suspect worms. I was suspecting a UTI or severe constipation, but then the vet found that rice looking thing that is from worms. So she gave me both amoxicillin and dewormer in case it was either suspected thing. 

I get home and I gave both the dewormer and amoxicillin. Immediately she goes to poop, I check, 

And I see a worm shirking and stretching in her poop. 

I have a strong phobia of worms. I am so incredibly serious when I say that if I ever get worms, I will commit self die. So I freaked out and ran out my apartment, went to my sister‚Äôs place because it was extremely overwhelming to see it alive. Later she came to help me clean my sheets, vacuum, and disinfect her litterbox (and throw out the poop with the worms that died at that point, I didn‚Äôt even scoop the poop I just dumped all the litter). I even bought the petamour flea household spray in hopes to kill anything there. 

I gave her food for the night and her second dose of amoxicillin, and now I‚Äôm staying the night at my sister‚Äôs place. I feel guilty for leaving her alone for the night, but the thought of being in the same area as worms (and my cat jumping onto my bed immediately after using the bathroom) is too much for me.

"I'll try to keep this from being too long-winded.   
  
Something that has plagued me for years, and even now that I'm diagnosed and on medication, is this reoccurring phenomenon wherein I'll get lost in my head hyperfocusing on painful traumatic events from school (sometimes old jobs), while I'm in the middle of doing things I love (or it can even be stuff I don't particularly enjoy such as chores).

&#x200B;

As an example, I am a musician and a game designer, more proficient at the former than the latter since, but I've had a passion for both (or just creating ANYTHING) since I was a child. I also have a deep passion for cooking. So there I'll be, tweaking the rhythm section on a song, working out why the heck I can't get the dang main character to move to the left when he jumps, or simply trying not to make a mess while thickening the roux for the night's meatball and vegetable dinner; the task at hand seems to be done almost robotically, though I am actively thinking about it. It seems though that most of my **conscious** focus will be on reliving a painful moment from school; usually going over what I wish I would've said or wondering why none of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù ever came to my defense too often, wondering why none of the adults around me could catch on to what was happening, wondering why so many adults who couldn't deal with children were left in charge of children etc. All the while I'm actively doing this task. No one observing me would have a clue that I was focusing on anything but that task.  
  
A little background: I (35M) went virtually undiagnosed until *last year*, which is when I finally got on meds. I'm still getting used to the meds, but they are definitely making a difference and have allowed me to accomplish a lot of things I otherwise wouldn't have. YAY! I just wish they didn't feel like they went right through me after only three hours. Boo! (Also I say ‚Äúvirtually undiagnosed‚Äù, because I recall at least one failed attempt to get a diagnosis in my *YOUNGER* youth. Came up negative, so then came the ‚Äúwell there's no excuse blah blah blah‚Äù song and dance from the adults).   
  
For what it's worth, I went to **14** different schools in my school ‚Äúcareer‚Äù, not including the few blissful years I was homeschooled. I'm *not* a military brat, in fact the entire duration I was in school, my family **only moved** ***once***. Every other school year though, I was in a new school environment. Sometimes the start of the year where I could kind of start fresh, many times right in the middle of the year where I had to be the new guy. School is a HUGE sore spot for me. I have so much resentment and untreated wounds from those days (some physical). It seems the downside of being recently diagnosed means I'm going back into these memories and making sense of everything and having to relive things that I was trying to put away. Pre-K through second grade were...ok, but not horrific (all the time). When I discovered my appetite in the third grade, began gaining weight and started wearing these big dorky glasses, things just kind of went downhill from there socially. I've got so much to tell and get off my chest but at the risk of writing a huge book here, I'll save it (unless you're interested to hear and wanna compare notes or something).   
  
I've searched around a few times, but never could find if anyone else ever went through a similar thing. Sure, being stuck in traumatic memories is definitely a thing for us, but what about when you're actively trying to focus on something that's supposed to bring you joy? Can anyone else relate? How do you cope? I know medicine isn't a magic cure-all, but it's kind of frustrating that it doesn't shut any of that up.",3,adhd

"I have a hard time understanding how i‚Äôm feeling, for instance the past few weeks, i‚Äôll have moments throughout each day where I feel tired/bored/sleepy? I can never tell wether or it‚Äôs one or the other, for one i‚Äôm not a napper. 
I hate taking naps, even far before my anxiety has become a regular thing, I always hated the feeling of waking up and feeling confused and tired all the same. 
In the morning typically I have the most energy depending. I‚Äôll get up stretch do my morning routine eat, then play some games if I have nothing to do starting out the day. After a good hour or so of playing i‚Äôll get this overwhelming sensation of tiredness or something. Most people seem to be able to recognize the way they feel and go and do something to counter act that feeling. I usually spend too much time trying to identify why I feel that way. 
If I attempt to lay down and watch a movie with my family i‚Äôll also get this feeling halfway through the movie of just some sensation of tiredness, and it seems to take a while to shake it off. 
The only time I don‚Äôt overthink as much as to why i‚Äôm feeling this way is at work, I work in retail on the sales floor and I close. So usually i‚Äôm recovering and moving quite a lot, I often don‚Äôt feel the tiredness until i‚Äôm on my break sitting down for the first time in hours. I don‚Äôt tend to overthink it though because it seems to be the only logical time to feel that tired, so I guess the reassurance works easier there.

"I was very flattered to be asked to be a bridesmaid (one of six) to my mother-in-law who is remarrying. She see's me as a daughter and wanted me to me part of the very special day.

I have various anxiety disorders, which make it difficult for me to do, well, anything. It is extremely debilitating. I barely leave the house. Can't get into other people's cars. Can't go into public places (other than a supermarket), don't see friends etc. I see a psychiatreist and a therapist weekly, and we have been working on a plan and doing exposures to help.

When she originally asked me a few months ago, I initially said that I do not think it was a good idea, due to my mental health. I said I did not want her to be worrying about me, as the day is all about her, so I am happy to be in the background, unnoticed. She said that I do not have to partake in any activities that I will not feel comfortable doing, and I do not have to match dresses or walk down the aisle etc.

Well, this has now all changed, and before I knew it, I had an invitation to a dress try on's, booked to see a hair stylist, makeup etc. All, I suppose, are normal for a wedding (so yes, stupid for me to assume that I wouldn't do this). I have said that I can't really do these things, but I keep getting booked on to do it. I have only managed to do the dress try on. But, I have been trying to find the bravery to book to see a dressmaker to make alterations, and just can‚Äôt face it. And, even though it‚Äôs well known I can‚Äôt get into a car, I‚Äôm getting picked up by a bus to take me there. Something I just cannot do.

I managed to get a dress second-hand very cheap (less than ¬£30). I bought my own shoes and jewellery, so, the brides hasn‚Äôt paid for a lot. 

There are now several months until the wedding. And although I have been doing a lot to try and get myself into a position where I could walk down the aisle with her, do a speech etc., but, I just don't think I'm there yet. So I am wanting to back out of being a bridesmaid, and just attend as a guest, where I can sit at the back near an exit and be more of a fly-on-a-wall.

I want to know if I‚Äôm going to be a horrible person if I back out. I'm so nervous to even speak about it with her, because I cant stand that I'll be upsetting someone, or ruining their plans. This is THEIR wedding, and they must be so nervous as it is and I really really do not want to add to it or cause any unnecessary stress. I'm just so worried that it'll come to the day and I just won't be able to leave the room, and by then, it's too late. It‚Äôs horrible that my anxiety affects others and not just me.",4,anxiety

"I started having anxiety in November of 2022. It all started with having negative thoughts about my relationship. Which I tried to hold it in and deal with it myself. Which didnt work, around March was when I brought it up to my girlfriend. We did what everyone else has done and we work through it. She's extremely supportive, it was very hard on us. But we've got through it. I'm starting to believe. Holding in my extreme anxiety for months on end, has lingered into my day to day. I randomly get anxious now, busy restaurants and movie theaters, sometimes when I wake up, or through out my day it hits me instantly and it lasts  for a while. The anxiety now isn't about relationship issues. It's just random and about nothing. I feel it in my chest. I've brought up to my mother that I want to go see a specialist. But all she does is try to blame the anxiety on my daily use of nicotine. Which is annoying, I'm sure it slightly could be negative. But I've used nicotine for 5 years, and I've never experienced this. I'm 22, what would yall reccomend I do?",4,anxiety

"Hi everyone. 

This might take a bit to explain so bare with me here. 
My boyfriend left for Basic Training for the army 2 weeks ago, and my anxiety has been off the rails - always assuming worst case scenarios. I was able to get a few calls while he was waiting to start, and it put my mind at ease a lot for a few days. 
When he actually started basic, his parents weren‚Äôt able to write down his mailing info for letters. 
Well, my sister is friends with a lot of people at the base he‚Äôs training at. Her ex husband is a captain there as well. I mentioned to her that we didn‚Äôt get his info, and she ended up asking her ex husband to get it. 
Ever since then, I have been spiraling about if that impacted him and made him stand out (which in this situation is not necessarily a good thing). And then, I talked myself down from that ledge, because with how things work there they‚Äôre not allowed to only focus on one person‚Ä¶ and why would they, they don‚Äôt even know him. 
I did, however, write in one of my letters to him a brief explanation of what happened and that I‚Äôm sorry if it DID cause any issues for him briefly. 
Now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm spiraling thinking what if he reads that and gets mad that something COULD HAVE happened and blames me for any issues or thinks I‚Äôm the reason for any of the attention he gets? I don‚Äôt think it even makes sense after typing it all out but I‚Äôm still concerned I shouldn‚Äôt have even said that in the letter. Ugh. How can I get out of this negative thought spiral?

"Even as i type this I am feeling anxious. I've been missing classes and have dropped a couple of shifts at work because I found it near impossible to take a train without feeling really anxious, needing to vomit and have a bowel movement.

Around 1-1.5 months ago the near-incident i am talking about was basically me needing to immediately have a bowel movement while taking the train. Now, I can get off on a lot of stops, there are shopping centers nearby the stations so it shouldn't be a problem? Yeah, it isn't, however, I don't know if I had something bad, or if it was just my diet as a whole (I went on a healthy diet, got sick, ended up on a crappy diet for a bout a month and a half, back on healthy diet now)  but I had one of those really, really ""emergency need to evacuate bowels RIGHT NOW"" situations.. while the train experienced a FAULT in the middle of two stations not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES. We were stuck for about 15-20 minutes and judging by how I feeling at the time and what my experience was like, I'm pretty sure I had a panic attack.

Ever since that experience, each time I went onto the train I've always experienced abdominal cramps even if I've had bowel movements in the morning (I made sure to wake up an hour earlier to get everything out of the way) and then I started experiencing nausea ontop of that. I keep 3 water bottles in response to the near incident because it barely manages to keep me from wanting to vomit. Then eventually I just couldn't stay on trains and caught ubers to my classes. I get really nauseous in the mornings and it gets even worse if I see someone with a coffee cup or even a small snack like a chocolate bar.

I've gotten a blood test and stool test done but I still need to wait for results. Is there any techniques that I can use apart from breathing/meditation (which is the first thing I focus on if i feel uneasy) that can make my experience bearable until I get over this?

"Hi. I've recently been through an extensive process of trying to get an ADHD diagnosis. I have it, I know I have it. My sister has a diagnosis of it from when she was a child and my symptoms are so much worse than hers, I've researched back and forth for literal years and it's the only conclusion that makes sense. I figured I needed meds, so I pursued a diagnosis. 

I went through like a whole system of questionnaires aiming to figure out once and for all whether I have ADHD or not. At the end of it all (months of work) my psychologist said I don't qualify. I have plenty of symptoms, especially of inattentive ADHD, but not enough hyperactivity to count, so they can't prescribe me any meds. The condition has such a strict definition in my country and meds are so tightly controlled that I just can't get them. I can't even try them out just to see if I'll get better. 

At first I was pretty frustrated and disappointed, but after about a week, I figured I could at least pursue non-stimulant meds. Surely they'll be less strictly controlled. So I researched and immediately found out all of them require an ADHD diagnosis. Every single one. 

Now I'm just disappointed. Am I supposed to just pull myself up by the proverbial bootstraps and deal with it? Live the rest of my life with cobbled together planners and calendars trying desperately to fit into the world? Is there any other way? I just don't know what to do.",3,adhd
"this is gonna be a confusing time,and i‚Äôve had trouble figuring out which subreddit to post this in,but i settled here since i might just be overthinking things.

i got contacted by someone on instagram,asking me if i was a guy or not. at first i was confused,he didn‚Äôt follow anyone i was following,nor did he follow anyone my boyfriend followed. i had dodged the question and just asked who they are,however,they responded by asking the same question again. i answered just by saying that i was biologically a girl. he had acknowledged my response and afterwards i asked why he contacted me. he said that ‚Äúmy friend wanted me to ask you.‚Äù i had asked who was said friend,but the only detail i got was that their name started with a J. apparently,said friend had a crush on my boyfriend,and did not know if my boyfriend was gay or not. i had accepted this reason,and conversed with the person a little more before going to do my own thing. 

here‚Äôs the kicker,my boyfriend did not give out his instagram to anyone,merely two people,both of which names did not start with J. and my boyfriend only knew one person with a J name,which is who i‚Äôm suspicious of. so i was wondering,how did they get my account? my boyfriend follows quite a few people,and so i‚Äôm deducing that they went through his following to find me. which is a little weird to me. afterwards,instead of asking me or my boyfriend directly,used a friend to ask me if i was a guy? we both have no idea who‚Äôs the friend,or maybe merely a stranger,who had a crush on him. i deal with anxiety and paranoia,which is why i‚Äôve been uneasy this whole time. this whole thing could be a prank but it would be a kinda elaborate prank wouldn‚Äôt it? i‚Äôm probably overthinking this,what should i do? how do i deal with this anxiety,and is this normal?

"I (41nb) know this post isn't specifically autism related, but it's all about some heavy stuff I've been dealing with for the last two months as an autistic person. I've been struggling to process because it's so overwhelming and I'm looking for support/a place to vent these feelings. 


I'll give some brief background. My birth giver (73f) kidnapped me before I was even born. I found out about this from a series of guilty confessions she made to me as a child. She only told me initially that my father was a different man from my older siblings because her husband wanted to take us to his affair partner's home. Birth giver told me ""the truth"" to spite him. I was 3 or 4. That wasn't the first or last time she used me to hurt him. 


It took several years and several lies to get some semblance of the truth out of her. Meanwhile, I was treated like a pet while I was small, but I was also being abused by an older sibling. The older I got, the more I was mistreated by my birth giver, my half siblings, and her husband. I was denied medical treatment, education, and therapy. I was forced into isolation from the ages of 10-14. Everything in my life had to revolve around church and God or I was punished. 


I always wanted to find my bio father, but I was hesitant. Birth giver told me things about him and heavily implied that she thought I was better off with her than with the man she had agreed to be a surrogate to (she says she needed cash, but that doesn't really make sense given the context. Unfortunately I can't share those details as they make me too identifiable). She always framed her decision to keep me as if it was up to her alone. It was only recently that someone pointed out to me that what she'd done was considered kidnapping. That realization really messed my head up and I'm still trying to process the fallout from it. 


I cut contact with everyone from Birth givers side years ago because I was tired of being their scape goat. Recently, I finally got the courage to order a DNA kit and it got processed so much quicker than the company said. Once the results came in, I was able to track my bio father down through a cousin. All I ever really knew was his name and the state he lived in. But that was enough. It took time to finally get in touch with him, but this week we started talking for the very first time. 


He's eccentric, but he's been nothing but honest with me about himself so far as I can tell. I've asked him if he would share what he remembers of my conception, and it isn't much, but it seems to confirm that my birth giver set out to purposely  get pregnant and may have had 0 intentions of letting (me) that child go. I've always suspected I was her revenge baby, a child she weaponized, and I thought I had come to terms with that, but I guess I haven't. Maybe because there was always a small chance I could have been wrong before. 


On top of that, despite having a few very supportive people who I've confided in about this situation, some of them have told me things like: ""you'll always love your mother, she raised you."" and I feel like they can't possibly understand what it feels like to know your own mother only had you to hurt someone. Something broke inside of me and I don't feel any love for my birth giver at all anymore. It's scary and it hurts so bad, but its also a relief to finally have that emotional tie broken.


Ultimately, I am glad to finally know my bio father, I have zero regrets about finding him. But...this hurts so much more than I've let on. I'm absolutely devastated. My whole life was a lie. My ""family"" just used me to make themselves feel better. It's so much to process and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to fully come to terms with this. 


I feel so alone right now. My irl supports have all been very kind, but no one understands what I'm going through (they've all said that) and I hate that I feel like this. I made a post about my struggles with this situation in another sub, one for abuse survivors, but it got completely ignored. That's really set off my rejection sensitivity, so I deleted that last post and decided that maybe this sub will be a little more responsive? I don't know, I just feel lost and sad right now. Any advice is appreciated, but not necessary. I'm really just looking for support.

"I have always had anxiety, but it‚Äôs always been because of specific things i.e. social events, public speaking, driving, confrontation. As soon as the task is complete, my anxiety is gone. However, I recently weaned off Bupropion under the supervision of my psychiatrist because it was causing random severe panic attacks and all day anxiety that would last weeks at a time with no clear trigger or cause. The first two weeks I was fully off Bupropion were magic. Clear thinking, no anxiety, no panic or paranoia. All of a sudden, the last two days I have been having the same simmering anxiety that just pokes at me all day and eventually turns into an anxiety attack in the afternoon/evening after work. I feel so discouraged because I thought that it was only an issue while I was taking Bupropion, and there‚Äôs is absolutely nothing I can think of that is causing it. It‚Äôs so foreign to me, to be struggling with anxiety like this. It affects my job, my free time, wears down my emotions. Any and all advice is welcome. I am already in therapy, and have helpful tips for when I‚Äôm having an actual attack, but I‚Äôm at a loss with what to do about the anxiety that seems to just sit quietly in my body, almost like it‚Äôs just waiting and biding time to attack. I don‚Äôt want to have the mindset that there is a singular solution, and I want to better equip myself in case this is something I have to just get used to.",4,anxiety
"I just don't know anymore. I feel like I have tried everything. Things just don't seem to be getting any better. I've been depressed since I was 13 or 14. I'm 36 now. I often think about a teacher I had in highschool who told me things would get better. He lied. There's not a day that passes where I don't think of ending my life. The meds help and then they don't and so I switch..rinse and repeat. I've tried making friends but nobody is really interested. I know they think I'm weird or ugly or something idk.

I'll be 40 in four more years. And I have accomplished nothing. I still live at home with my mother and everytime I come out of my room I can see the disappointment on her face. My 13 year old nephew asked me one day: ""how are you 36 and still live with your mom? I was so mortified. I didn't know what to say. He's right. I'm a terrible example. I feel like such a waste of space. Often times when something tragic happens on the news where people die, I wish that I could have taken one of there places so that they could keep on living.

On top of it all I have anxiety and it makes me paranoid. People are either talking about me, laughing at me or out to get me in some way. I could never make friends online because I was terrified. I think I've been lurking on reddit for almost eight years and I just made my first post a few months ago. Ridiculous! Why am I so scared? I love video games but avoided online ones bc I was too scared to play with strangers.

I quit everything. Every job I get, project, hobbies, everything. I took me 14 years to get through college! It's so hard to keep my room straight. I have too much stuff and refuse to throw it all away bc it's all I have. I don't have anything else. It makes me somewhat happy but at the same time I'm drowning in stuff. I just wish I could restart. But at this point it just one step forward and two steps back. This post is all over the the place. Sorry.",2,depression

"There are days where I am more motivated than ever to better myself. To find myself. To explore my thoughts and see where it may lead. 

Honestly, it helps me study better when I feel this drive of hope that I will be okay. I am almost a second year med student. 

After every exam the cycle ends. I crash. I lose myself. I dwell on how much I miss ex. I think about how heartbroken I still am. Im miserable. 

Its a mental game. I battle this everyday to not let my depression cause me to flunk out. I am convinced that I am so unhappy because I still want my ex back. Its been almost 6 months since we broke up. 

Studying majority of the day and taking multiple exams a week truly keeps one from trying to improve themselves. I tried new hobbies and socializing more. Its not working.

I don't know where else to turn, what else to do, and most importantly I don't know how I can be a support to my sister. 
She (35F) was recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, but she previously had a schizophrenia and BPD diagnosis. She's back on her medications (with an 8 year hiatus...my family and I hadn't seen or heard from her for nearly 5 years) but her medications don't seem to be helping. 
She believes people are playing mind games with her. 
She believes people are sending her messages through her Pinterest news feed.
She believes the people she was in partial hospitalization with are really her highschool friends in disguise.

I want to be here for her. I want to support her. I'm at a loss of what to say or how to comfort her. 
I guess my question is... What can I say? How might she feel comforted? Is there anything I can be doing other than being a shoulder, an ear, a compassionate heart?

"People always say to work on your own skills and improve. But it seems that something is wrong with my brain, because I can't do it.

I wanted to learn to play the piano. I played when I was a child and I wanted to learn again, I even took a class. But I hardly continued to practice, and now I've forgotten everything again.

I wanted to write a novel. I've started several, but never finished a single one. I only made it halfway through Nanowrimo. I have an ongoing webnovel that I haven't updated in three months.

I wanted to learn to draw. I said I would draw one page a day in my sketchbook. Now I can't even draw one line a day, and my drawings look just as bad as when I started out. I only made it to Lesson 2 of DrawABox.

I wanted to learn a new language. I can't keep up with my daily reviews, and I've just been doing them off and on. It's been over five years since I started, but I can't even form simple sentences in my target language. Like, first-grader level.

It seems that I don't have the resolve to learn anything new, and giving up seems like the only reasonable option. It's not just that I don't have the motivation or energy, it's the fact that I literally don't improve when doing it that sends me into a cycle of giving up on my dreams, only to try again later before giving up once again.

"For years I've had pretty bad periods of time filled with major depression, and severe anxiety has been a constant for as long as I can remember. This was my entire life and as such it was not as big a problem as it could have been, because it was just what I was used to. I still had desire and purpose to do things, I had friends who hanging out with was purpose enough for me. 

At the start of this year, I found a girl, and every cliche in every love story happened. We had (and still have) an incredible connection, I'm talking favourite shows, songs, interests, everything was the same, we were both incredibly emotionally intelligent and we would make each other laugh and were invested in each others lives, yada yada- you get the point. Everyone says it, I know, but I've had relationships before and I like to think of myself as emotionally intelligent enough to know that she was and probably will always be the ""one that got away."" 

Naturally that implies that yes, a few days ago, she broke things off with me. We talked in person for a few hours about it, both cried buckets into each others shoulders, and there wasn't a hint of maliciousness from either side. We both agreed it was better for the both of us in the long run. I wanted to be pissed at her, to have a reason to hate her, but it was no-one's fault she lost the spark.

She said that it was up to me, but that she does truly want to remain friends, because while the romantic feelings were no longer there, we still connected on an incredible level that she didn't want to lose, and that when/if I was ready, she would like to be friends again. (Again, huge cliche.)

After talking with her, and a lot of self reflection, I realised that I made the mistake of having her be such a major part of my life, and purpose. This whole year has been with her, and every day I was thinking of when I would see her next and waiting for a response, which would sometimes take more than a day. Nothing else was even half as important to me as her, and so obviously it absolutely killed me to not get a text more than once a day, to go hours without constantly talking to her. This was my fault, and even if I had realised it sooner, that wouldn't have affected her not feeling a spark. 

Now that we aren't together, and I know that I have to take time away from her to get over her, I am completely and utterly depressed. Everything that I have now after she's gone is simply useless to me.  I haven't stopped thinking about what I am supposed to do. My workplace, Uni work, even hanging out with friends, these all became things to pass the time until I got to see or talk to my girlfriend, whereas before they were way more than that. They were actually my life, and my interests. 

I don't have any desire for anything. I don't have something to look forward to, I have nothing to feel but regret and absolute grief for the way things were. The only time I have felt any sort of relief since then was bawling my eyes out to my mother on the phone. Getting wasted on alcohol, which usually would do the trick, does nothing. 

I can't help but feel like such a fucking loser now. I had the perfect girlfriend, I had a social life I was happy with, I had plans and desires for the future. Now I'm back to being a student with ADHD and OCD who's only friends are the three or four people from school, and the most we do is go to someone's house and play games until we go home. I am in pure agony and I have to make a constant effort to not think about how good things were. 

I have nothing to show as an 18 year old. I understand people have it worse than me. But to now have 3 guy friends that I barely hang out with, brother's who I barely talk to, no social skills or confidence, University work that I'm struggling with, and a mind-numbing workplace, I can't do anything but miss what I had. I think about how most Uni students have networks of friends, go out to bars and socialise, drink, party, have fun, and I just don't have that. 

My girlfriend breaking up with me is not why I am this disheartened. I was like this before, and I was like this during the relationship, but because I was happy when I was with her it wasn't as bad and so I paid no attention to it. I'm really struggling to know what to do with myself. I am at the point now where the only reason I haven't seriously considered or attempted to hurt myself (for lack of better wording) is because this girlfriend doesn't deserve that, and neither does my mother, or brothers. It's getting harder to not entertain the thought, because all I feel now is not numbness, but pointlessness, pain and sheer, utter grief. 

I know these feelings will pass. But while everyone tells me this, it's irrelevant to me in the current moment because it's happening right now, and I can't do anything but wait. 

I have medication for these feelings now, and I have organised professional help, but they all take time to work and I cannot just put these feelings on hold until they help. 

I don't even know if I want advice or if I am just ranting. But writing this has distracted me for a while so I may as well.",2,depression

"during the daytime, i am almost never paranoid at all. as soon as it gets dark outside, it‚Äôs about 9 or 10 pm, and i‚Äôm no longer around people is when i begin to get very paranoid, especially when i‚Äôm outside or near a window or open closet (i get very afraid something will sneak into my backyard and hurt me, or i will see a face or person outside my bedroom window or inside my closet). my paranoia typically increases in the night after i‚Äôve watched a true crime or paranormal video earlier in the day, but is still there either way.

during night, im not always sure what im scared of, it changes. sometimes itll be something paranormal, like the fear that some sort of ghost or demon will appear in my room. other times i‚Äôll be nervous a human murderer will break in while i‚Äôm sleeping. or worst of all, it could be a person already in my room, hiding under my bed or in my closet unnoticed, even though i typically check those places before i sleep just to make sure theres no one. 

looking back, i think i‚Äôve always dealt with some paranoia, even though it‚Äôs only gotten worse recently. for example, one time when i was around ten i went several months sleeping on one specific side because for some reason i was scared a tiger would break into my room?? another time when i was older, i stayed up for hours one night because i was convinced that there was someone in my kitchen, and the water near my bed was empty so i was so thirsty i couldn‚Äôt sleep. i don‚Äôt remember much of my childhood, so i cant really think of any other instances of this right now. (sorry if this seems unrelated, just trying to give as much information as i can.)

i‚Äôm not sure what the cause of my paranoia is. i‚Äôm almost certain my poor sleep schedule factors into it (i typically go to sleep at 11pm and wake up at 6:30am), but i‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the root cause, as i still get around 7 hours every night, and even more on weekends. i do get intrusive thoughts, but i don‚Äôt think those are bad enough to call it OCD. i do have a slight history of mental illness, but theyre the things more typical for a teenager, just an eating disorder and self harm and suicidal ideation. my family doesn‚Äôt have much history of mental illness, the biggest thing i can think of is my uncle who is homeless and extremely paranoid, but none of my other family is like that. i don‚Äôt even know if shit like paranoia even IS hereditary.

i have been working to try to go to sleep earlier (10pm so i can get 8 hours of sleep per night), but whats very frustrating is that when i go to sleep earlier than normal, i‚Äôll almost always wake up in the middle of the night (anywhere from 1-5am), and this time period is when my paranoia is at its absolute worst. i can‚Äôt fall back asleep unless i listen to music, which is annoying because just the simple act of opening my eyes, sitting up, and pulling out my phone is terrifying and i‚Äôll have to gear myself up for it for minutes before. after waking up in the middle of the night, i‚Äôll be so overcome with fear that i won‚Äôt be able to open my eyes for fear that when i open them, a person will be right above my face, or i wont be able to close them for the same reason. even blinking is scary. i don‚Äôt experience any physical effects of my paranoia except for a fast heartbeat, so i don‚Äôt get sick from it or anything, though sickness does make it much worse because of how high my fevers get. the most annoying thing is how when i manage to fall back asleep, when i wake up i don‚Äôt even remember almost anything from the night before. all i remember id that i woke up early and that i was scared of nothing again. 

although being in the dark makes it worse, i can even get paranoid in a bright room, especially if theres a mirror in the room (since mirrors make me nervous about the idea of eyes appearing behind me in the mirror), or i‚Äôll be scared of the shadows in my room, or my backyard will be lit from lights but if i hear a sound then i just have to go back inside, because of all the ‚Äòpotential dangers‚Äô that could jump out at me from outside. the worst part is that i‚Äôm certain being on my phone so often only makes this worse, but sometimes my phone is the only thing that can distract me from my paranoia. i‚Äôm eighteen years old and had to check under my bed last night like an eight year old because of this. no amount of reassuring myself that everything is fine helps. i know there‚Äôs no danger but it doesn‚Äôt stop the fear. it‚Äôs only gotten worse recently, especially in the past five or so months. i can‚Äôt uncover my hand or leg from my blankets when i‚Äôm trying to fall asleep, i can‚Äôt go outside past 11pm without my phone, i can‚Äôt fall asleep without music unless i‚Äôm too tired to be scared. nothing seems to help. i don‚Äôt know what to do about this anymore. it‚Äôs not quite debilitating, at least during the daytime, but i‚Äôm nervous it will be at some point. help??",5,paranoia

Like they're constantly posting on a social media account that I can't access that has all.of the stupid shit I do on there. Like they're constantly watching me and laughing at everything I do. I can't talk to anyone about it because they're just going to lie to me to keep the facade going. I don't trust anyone, and anytime I try to open up to somone I get a really awkward and ""you're fucking crazy"" reaction. Which adds to the feeling of paranoia. I even feel like my girlfriend is cheating on me, eventhough that's not possible during this pandemic because she looks after someone vulnerable. I don't want to bring it up with her again either because the reaction I got before was a really in the middle reaction. What drove me to write this post is a feeling of dread caused by a dream I've just had. My girlfriend broke into my house while I was sleeping, and when I opened the door of my bedroom she tried to attack me, but I eventually got her sat down and I took about 5 weapons off her. I read that participating in the detention of a criminal can either mean somone close to you is laying a trap for you, or someone close to you is plotting evil against you. So my trust for everyone close to me has just disappeared. Even if they try to tell me how much I'm valued my brain can't accept that and just thinks they're lying. 

TLDR: I had a dream that makes me question my trust for absolutely everybody around me, especially my girlfriend. Now I'm paranoid that I'm walking into a trap of some kind.",5,paranoia

"There‚Äôre tons of flowers in the garden, including you. You‚Äôre somehow different than them, not better nor worse, just different. 

You try to get along with them and be like them, but deep down you know you‚Äôll never be able to assimilate and feel, experience joy and the same advantages of being a flower like them. You‚Äôre a flower as well, not better nor worse, but still you start to feel like weed, and that‚Äôs how the other flowers are starting to treat you as well, every mistake you make, every good intention you have, will be regarded as either a diabolical goal, self-pity or non-significant. 

They perceive you as a burden in the garden who only wants attention and chaos, they even make fun of you or judge you,while not even getting to know you, but all you really want is just acceptance and love. You keep wondering what‚Äôs wrong with you and your actions. You keep punishing yourself, feel guilty and ungrateful because the soil you‚Äôre in is proper, you get enough water, sunshine while you‚Äôre well aware that there‚Äôre flowers without any of these, but you just keep asking yourself: ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I be and live like the other flowers?‚Äù 

Self-hatred takes a toll on you, until you eventually withers, but just before that, you realise that‚Äôs the best thing that could ever happen to you, you never had a chance, you were taking away resources from the other flowers while you were just suffering and in constant pain, and as the saying goes: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to burn out than fade away‚Äù. None of the identical looking flowers‚Äôll notice you‚Äôre gone and none of them‚Äôll miss you, they never even wanted you in the first place.",2,depression
"The past few weeks have been emotionally intense and draining.  I've had more than one major moment of derealization from family members surprising me with very negative attacks.  There was a death in the family.  I officiated the funeral.  I've had to take lots of time off work for these things and for migraines and etc.  

I assist at church in a big way and am training for the clergy.  Today I woke up with my head swimming and a general sense of utter exhaustion.  It's a church day of course, but I decided it would be best for me to take the day off, because of dizzy head and not having enough me-time, which is SO essential.  (I have something every night after work this week except for next Friday).  Sorry, all this detail feels relevant for some reason.

I texted the pastor this morning to let him know I didn't feel safe driving and making sure he was okay to handle the service alone.  There was no response so I called him and I honestly couldn't tell if he was upset or not.  Something about it felt dismissive, but I'm sure that's my guilt talking.  I always feel guilty when I call in sick for something.  Impostor syndrome for sure.  Maybe I'm overreacting and being selfish and maybe I'm not THAT sick.  And then I go into defensive mode and start saying things to myself as if I was on trial, even though the only response was a nonchalant ""Okay, hope you feel better.""  Now I anticipate that, rather than spending some quiet time recovering from the last two weeks, I'm going to feel uneasy and guilty that maybe I'm a selfish jerk for not trying, or something.

Sorry, that was messy.   My head really is swimming.  Needed to share this because I don't want to have a day like that.  I do want to stop off at my parents' house for Mother's day.  I wish I wasn't like this.  You'd think at my age (over 50) I would have gotten over this sort of reaction.",3,adhd

"Hey guys,

I didn't really premeditate this, so forgive me if it sounds a bit garbled.

I've hand-held my depression for years, when the risk factor went away in my teens - it became a looming sort of grey-area. I'm no longer suicidal, but have adopted this sense of apathy that has been bothering me as of late. As grim as it sounds, it's the whole 'would never seek to harm myself, but if harm sought me out, I doubt I would move' sort of deal. 

All the things I would love to doing slowly fade out into my apathy-zone. From sports and socializing to trivial things such as movies, music and art. I have constant fidgets, and an overbearing weight of guilt that constantly sits on my shoulders like a little gremlin constantly whining that had I spent my time better in previous situations, I would have met more success 

Rationally I understand how unhealthy it is, but can't find the drive or energy to be better, so I just sit with my thoughts and flow through a cycle of beating myself up. I'm real tired of my internal monologue.

I've prefaced looking for help, however, in Canada the wait times for therapy and what-not for somebody 'not-at-risk' (which I totally get, but still) leaves me in what possible could be year-long wait times, on top of finding a General Physician (which took me two years last time). It's not looking so good over here,lads.

What I'm wondering from this community, is have any of you found a way to break these kinds of cycles? 

Maybe pulled out from your 'apathy-zone'? 

Any tricks or habits? 

Thank you for the consideration,",2,depression

"I can't even tell anymore.

I can't bear to shower, and only do it every 6-8 weeks (occasionally it might be 4 weeks). I wash my hair that often too.

I cannot deal with doing chores or housework. I last did a load of laundry in June 2021. Seriously.
I don't go out anywhere much and I have way too many clothes so I still have clean clothes to wear when I go out.

Around the house, I wear the same comfy clothes for months on end. I just don't care.

I only change my bed sheets every 6 months. I cannot believe people do this every week. I cannot cope with that.

I never eat in the day as I've had no appetite since 2017. I never feel hungry. I never feel empty. My stomach never rumbles or gurgles. I feel like it doesn't even exist.

I sleep all day and feel RIDICULOUSLY stressed and nauseated with anxiety if I have to get up before 1pm.

I stay up until about 4am as after 11pm is the only time I get to be alone and have quiet time to sort of relax.

I have major anhedonia and feel no pleasure, enjoyment or interest in anything I'm NOT addicted to. I sleep to avoid the chronic boredom and emptiness. And constant sense of dread and impending doom.

I brush my teeth, but I haven't gone to the dentist since 2016 and partly due to gum disease and also jaw clenching in my sleep, 4 of my teeth are loose. I can't eat properly when I do eat, but I just can't care enough (or afford) to go to the dentist to get these teeth either removed or somehow fixed.

I have not done any housework since 2018. I have a cleaner who comes every 2 weeks.

I pick at my skin. The skin around my fingernails has been wrecked since I was 4 or 5 years old. I've picked at my scalp since age 8, my top lip is ruined and I began picking that since age 15. I also began picking at both my inner ears at age 38.

I started self harming at 17 and still do it. I hate myself. I feel ugly and I repulse myself.

I never had any career ambitions or anything I wanted to do. Nothing has ever given me a sense of achievement, accomplishment, pride, fulfilment or satisfaction. At all. Ever. I don't even know what that feels like.

I have no friends apart from old friends who live in a different state and I haven't seen in over 3 years. I have no local friends, and nor do I particularly want to. I don't have the interest or energy.

A few times a week I wonder how I would kill myself. I can't do it because I won't do that to my parents, but otherwise, I honestly don't know.

I have been like this consistently for years. Some symptoms have been 4-6 years. Others 40 years. Most about 10 years.

I've been on 8 different antidepressants over the last 10 years, a mood stabiliser, an antipsychotic, a stimulant, and various benzos. Nothing has helped, except for the benzos.

I've been in therapy on and off since 2018. Nothing helps. Not CBT, DBT, EMDR or psychodynamic therapy. Just...nothing.

To me, this is my ""normal"", but I am not living. Only existing. Barely.",2,depression

"(Buckle up, this is a long one)
I wish I didn‚Äôt relate to that quote. I wish I felt like there was some reason to keep trying. I just turned 41, and I‚Äôm DONE. I‚Äôm not going to do anything, but I‚Äôd be entirely content to just not wake up one day. Everything I‚Äôve ever tried to do with my life has gone to shit, and I don‚Äôt have the will or the energy to try anything else. There‚Äôs no point. I don‚Äôt know what I would want to do anyway. And when I say everything, I mean it. My emotional support dog was robustly healthy until about a month before she died of cancer at age 11. No genetic history of cancer, and her father and mother passed away at 15 and 18 respectively with nothing worse than arthritis and general old age. As far as I know her littermates are all still thriving. My psychiatrist is weaning me off meds because I apparently have treatment resistant depression that the meds don‚Äôt affect at all anymore. I‚Äôm at the least-drugged point I‚Äôve been in *years*, and yes I‚Äôm completely miserable, but I don‚Äôt feel any worse than I did when I was drugged to the gills a year ago. Meds up, down, changed, nothing. So I guess this is my life now. I don‚Äôt even know when this started, but one of my earliest memories (age 5 or so) is a red flag in hindsight. I tried to do myself in when I was about 12. I realized later that what I did never would have worked, but at the time it was a genuine attempt. I was initially medicated then, and I was balanced through my early teens, but the downhill slide started again after about 5 years. Ups and downs, but mostly one step forwards and two steps back. Fast forward to about 4 years ago, and it‚Äôs been a steady downward spiral. I was in an increasingly toxic situation at work, so when I got covid in spring 2020 I was perfectly ok with a mandated 2 week quarantine. It turned out to be long covid (which wasn‚Äôt a known thing at the time), but continued illness and my boss being an ass about it gave me an excuse to quit. I haven‚Äôt worked since, and I don‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt want the responsibility. I don‚Äôt have the motivation. I don‚Äôt have the energy. I‚Äôm at a point where feeling like I *have* to do something makes me resentful. I tried therapy when I was younger, but my therapists always wanted to find the root trauma that triggered my depression. There isn‚Äôt one. Sure I was bullied all the way through school (I mean ALL - kindergarten right up to high school graduation), but I was never physically hurt. No one played nasty pranks on me. I was mainly just teased and ostracized, which of course is hurtful, but it‚Äôs nowhere near as bad as it could have been. I was not abused. I have loving and supportive parents. We aren‚Äôt rich, but we aren‚Äôt struggling either (thank goodness, because while I‚Äôm fully financially dependent on my parents right now, I‚Äôm not a financial burden to them). Yes my older sister was one of my bullies, but she grew out of it and I don‚Äôt hate her for it. She was no worse than the school bullies. We don‚Äôt have much of a relationship now, but we get along fine at family gatherings. Not a great childhood, but no traumatic event to resolve. I‚Äôve taken a number of hits in the last few years, and I‚Äôm trying to get back into therapy for that, but it‚Äôs either a waiting list for government funded therapy, or about $150/hour out-of-pocket for private therapy. That second option is a full nope. And if I end up with a therapist who‚Äôs determined to help me with unresolved childhood trauma, I‚Äôm going to walk right out the door.

So today: I have 2 friends. Total. One friend I‚Äôve had for probably about 15 years. I can talk to them about anything, but they‚Äôre a terrible listener. The type of person who can carry a long conversation entirely on their own, which is great, because I don‚Äôt have to contribute much if I‚Äôm not in the mood. They care, and are empathetic, but don‚Äôt really understand what I‚Äôm dealing with because for them depression is feeling blue for a few days once in a while. Constant soul-crushing despair for weeks at a time is a foreign concept. On the downside, they now have kids and I don‚Äôt like kids. It‚Äôs straining the relationship (from my perspective at least), because the kids are everything now, rightly, but I can‚Äôt stop myself from resenting the kids for coming along and changing the friendship dynamic. The other friend I‚Äôve had for about 10 years. It‚Äôs a very different relationship, and we spend chunks of time in quiet companionship. It‚Äôs restful, and I need it, but it‚Äôs not someone I can talk to about everything. Complete trust, that‚Äôs not the problem. But it makes them really uncomfortable when I‚Äôm obviously unhappy and they can‚Äôt help. I can‚Äôt make them feel like shit to make myself feel better. I won‚Äôt. (I won‚Äôt confide in my parents for the same reason - it‚Äôs distressing to them when I‚Äôm unhappy and they can‚Äôt fix it.)
I had a couple of other people I thought I could talk to. Not fully confide in, but at least know they were on the other end of the phone if I needed to vent. Apparently not. One randomly ghosted me a few months ago, and when I asked the other one for advice about something related to social anxiety today they pretty much told me that my crazy is above their pay grade and I need counselling. They blocked me the second they finished typing.

So now I‚Äôm turning to the anonymity of Reddit to vent some misery because I don‚Äôt know what else to do. My psychiatrist isn‚Äôt a counsellor, and can‚Äôt be reached (if I leave a phone message they might get around to calling me back eventually). I‚Äôm still on a waiting list for a therapist. I called a crisis line once, and got the feeling that if I wasn‚Äôt in any danger then I should leave their line open for people who were. THAT was really helpful. I‚Äôm bawling my eyes out at 4am because I want to go to sleep and not wake up, but because I have no plans to make that actually happen I should just try to get some sleep? Oh, but ‚Äòcall us back this afternoon so we know you were serious about not being in danger‚Äô. Thanks.

Downward spiral, mediocre health, no desire to continue to live, no interest in hobbies I used to enjoy, and no energy or motivation to do anything. I don‚Äôt even know what I hope to accomplish by posting here, except I can‚Äôt keep everything bottled up, and I have no one to talk to. I‚Äôve given up. I even feel like my attempts to get a therapist are more about trying to pass responsibility for the progress of my life to someone else. I‚Äôm lost. I‚Äôm miserable, and I‚Äôm completely lost.",2,depression
"I met with some friends last night. I anticipated it as the highlight of my month; year even, and it was nice - I enjoyed it - although I got the feeling it was no big deal for my friends. They're functioning, busy people. I often go blank and feel emotionless with them. I'm lucky to have those few friends, they're beautiful and supportive people. I feel crushed today.

I'm 40 soon. I attempted suicide at 17 and it broke me, I think. That and a dour upbringing, and some physical illness in early adulthood.

I was so sure, when I made the decision. But some time after taking the tablets I.... changed my mind. I couldn't believe it, after being so sure. And now, after ~8 rounds of therapy over 20 years, I still can't make a single large decision and feel utterly condemned to my half-life. I'm an empty vessel. I've buried my feelings all my life and I no longer feel authentically.


If I can share anything positive it would be:
1) please don't attempt suicide, if you're thinking about it - truly confronting death permanently alters your brain chemistry. Some will recover well, some not. I'm not sure it's possible to truly confront death by simulation, and when it happens, you may change your mind halfway through. It can be very, very scary. Get help - humans aren't supposed to overcome all challenges alone.

2) therapy does help. My first ones didn't, but later I understood myself better and I kept trying, when I badly needed help. I'm at a place now where I tell my therapist everything. No secrets.",2,depression

"i just told this to my boyfriend and he said i was delusional. 

none of his friends like me. they all did something bad to me at least once, in the span of 5 years. (i am talking about emotional and sexual abuse from one of them). i literally get death stares from them and they are trying to break him up with me so they can get rid of me. i also have to mention that his friends are nice with him. they've stopped any bad behaviour towards any other person, and it's only me they hate.

they only want to see me suffer, and they'll start by torturing me slowly. the only way they can do that? brainwash my boyfriend into thinking i'm going crazy so he'll break up with me.

does this even sound like paranoia? i cannot help but think this is actually true. i'm not even kidding. it sounds like a vicious circle and even the fact that i suspect myself for having paranoia feels like a part of their plan.",5,paranoia

"So, I'm pretty paranoid about health.

Today I had a 2 litre Pyrex measuring jug filled up. I took it out of the microwave and as it was very heavy and hot I dropped it about a inch or two onto the counter top by accident. It made a loud bang. I checked the surface to see if there was any cracks, but there was nothing major that I could see. However, after closer inspection I found a faint hairline scratch, I guess is what you would call it, on the outside of the jug. I can't be certain that it was there before.

Then tonight I inspected the inside of the jug and found very very faint hairline scratches and I don't know if that is from today.

My worry is that I'm going to absorb some of the glass when I cook with it through the hairline scratches. I feel like if I was a normal person then it wouldn't be a concern, but I am considering buying a new jug as precaution but I don't want to spend the money (that's another issue for another day).  


I'm trying to rationalize by saying if the food that I cook with has the ability to discolor the glass and grim can build up in between the microscopic glass particles then what's the difference between the hairline scratches and this as the glass always carries a risk of absorption, if this makes sense.  
If the glass particle compounds are the same on the outside as in the inside is there any difference? Maybe it's coated with a different compound.  
Also, let's say I do absorb some of the glass, does it really pose any risk?

I've been doing well for like 6 months and now I'm not

I completely relapsed on self harm on Friday 

I feel bad because I told a friend and they made me let them clean it 

They were great I just feel bad that they care 

I feel bad if someone gives me sympathy for my emotions- I feel so fucking guilty I feel like no one should be around me but if I stop talking to people they will lose the positive person past self from like a week ago 

I feel like I am a bad person rn and I don't have a good reason but that I let someone care about me because my mental health is getting worse again

I am depressed again but now I keep getting a thought that says ""I'm gonna kill myself"" whenever I think about mysf or past actions even if they weren't bad

I see my cat and I wanna cry cuz I didn't cuddle enough with her this morning then I think about killing myself and then I remember my cat would permanently lose me and I feel sad and like a bad person

This constant thought to KMS is new idk what to do when it happens it usually goes like this

*I think about myself or think about life*
""I'll just KMS"" or now ""I will kill myself"" or something along those lies then
""Uuhhh no I don't wanna do that""
""Why not you don't matter"" smth like that then
""Cuz people will care""
And then I have an internal panick cuz I kinda don't disagree with either sides and it's becoming harder to believe the staying alive side

Like one thing that has been consistent is I get super depressed but never suicidal, I never want to KMS but idk if that's true anymore this feels like how I thought about self harm before I started but also I don't wanna be.

In fact, it‚Äôs so obvious that I‚Äôm actually incredibly self conscious about it. I cannot leave the house or be around other people without worrying incessantly about how I‚Äôm coming across to people. 

I suppose it‚Äôs maybe my fault for not bringing up my issues often, but then again it isn‚Äôt because I‚Äôve talked about it a few times in the past without success. Most of what I say gets undermined. I already have a very difficult time asking for help (regardless for what), it takes A LOT of courage for me to make myself vulnerable to people in person. It‚Äôs part of the reason why I ventilate on Reddit so often. If the only place I feel comfortable doing so. 

I‚Äôm going through one of the most stressful moments in my entire 11 year history with depression right now. No one seems to give a damn. I‚Äôm literally on my own here. I get that people are busy with their own problems, so not many people would want to hear me ventilate. But the fact that everyone around me refuses to address the elephant in the room and pretend that everything is fine annoys me. I look miserable, but that‚Äôs fine I guess because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the way that I am‚Äù. I don‚Äôt ever even hear a ‚Äúyou good bro?‚Äù A lot of my depression comes from having a low self esteem. I already feel like I don‚Äôt mean shit to anyone. Not being asked if I‚Äôm ok, when I‚Äôm clearly not only validates that feeling. Why ask for help, when people clearly don‚Äôt care to make themselves available. Maybe I‚Äôm just overreacting or asking for too much. Idk.",2,depression

"15 yo here, don't judge me too hard. So I'm depressed, probably not the first time you've heard this. I've been going through quite a bit. I don't know if this is allowed to say but I've self harmed before (like any totally normal person would do). I've been in a mental hospital but that really didn't help.

"Hi, for some context, spurred by experiencing one of these moments my boyfriend has recently confided in me that he often has these strange..terrors? Only that's not what they should be called. Trouble is we don't know what to call them.

There are about four, each with their own distinct look. -One is a man who has no teeth and smiles. His neck can stretch high enough to look through second story windows and he watches you. If you turn your head he'll kill you. He usually is outside the window or at the end of the bed. -the other is a being with teeth like a whale, no eyes, and stands on all fours only his joints are all wrong. He is usually found on the ceiling or next to the bed -the third is me but my neck and limbs stretch out and I usually murder him -the fourth is a pulsating ball of nails.

Normally we'd call these hallucinations but the problem is he doesn't see them. He doesn't hear, or taste, or smell, or even feel them either. He'll just be existing in a moment and then feel as if they're there. He has never seen them in person, but feels as if he knows what they look like (this is how I got my descriptions. He drew them and they are thoroughly creepy).

He has more but these are the most reoccurring and memorable for him. They only happen at night and before he goes to bed. (The ball of nails only occured during sleep paralysis).

We want to know what it is he's going through and if we should be looking for some deeper help or if this is just some strange form of paranoia. Please if you have any idea, let us know",5,paranoia

"The most extreme thing I'm struggling with lately that has made this obvious is that I worry about being transported to a horrible place. There's a story I've seen about a boy who pressed a button to receive a million yen in exchange for being transported to an endless empty void for 500 million years, and then at the end of it he forgets all of it. It details all of the immense suffering and loneliness he endures and it's pretty horrible. Basically I worry about that happening to me, that when I fall asleep I'll wake up there, or maybe I already have every night and I just don't remember any of it. For weeks now I've felt uncomfortable with falling asleep in general, since that sort of temporary death experience scares me. But now it's to the point where my brain is telling me that falling asleep will actually result in hellish torture. I suffered from this to an even worse extent when I was younger, I thought it couldn't happen to me again, but it has.

&#x200B;

Reading other posts here I'm also realizing that I'm paranoid in other ways. Like when people don't respond to me quickly especially my boyfriend I worry about and even visualize them being dead or in immense harms way. I also feel like if I don't constantly outperform myself and do my best and work as hard as possible, the world will crumble around me and I'll be on the street or dead. These feelings are both similar to posts I found, and I was shocked that I related so much to posts on a subreddit about paranoia, because I've never thought of myself as paranoid before. I also have really bad OCD these days and worry about stuff like touching a surface and then getting sick, or I touch the surface and then my eyes and then I'll become blind. I also have to check stuff so many times, like my car being locked and especially that the burners on the oven are off, even if no one in the house has used them that day. Despite a lot of things in my life going really well, my anxiety and mental health in general has just been falling apart over the months, and it's becoming so hard to deal with.",5,paranoia

"It‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day and I was told to arrive at my parents‚Äô place at 11am for a casual brunch. 5 ppl. For various reasons, I didn‚Äôt get there until 11.50am.

Once I realised I was going to be late, I was really stressed and anxious and trying to get there as quick as I could.

I sent some messages to my family to say I was running late, apologised, and said that they should start eating.

When I arrived I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry Mum‚Äù and tried to go up to her and say Happy Mother‚Äôs Day and give her a hug, but she wouldn‚Äôt look at me and wouldn‚Äôt let me touch her.

Later on I was helping her set up and connect her new headphones and I noticed the most recent tab open on her phone, a google search for ‚Äòwhy do people with adhd f*#^ up and arrive late to special occasions‚Äô.

There‚Äôs a lot more detail I could add but I just am so sick of feeling so guilty all the time when I really don‚Äôt intend to be late, and even though I have improved so much with my punctuality and I‚Äôm mostly on time, there‚Äôll always be times that I slip up and I get so upset anticipating the impending conflict with my family.

"I have a younger brother, who I like to describe as the most neurotypical neurotypical that has ever neurotypicaled, and I often get this feeling that he doesn‚Äôt respect me. I mean sure, ostensibly there‚Äôs some degree of sibling rivalry, and I get that. But on the other hand, he‚Äôs generally quite dismissive towards me, which is something that a lot of people have pointed out, including his friends (one of them literally said ‚Äústop being so mean to your brother‚Äù).

The problem arises when he decides to mock me. Him being NT, he never really gets enthusiastic or talks about things in the same manner I do, which I‚Äôm fine with, but at the same time when I do want to talk to him, he can be quite mean at times. There‚Äôs this one thing he does where he makes fun of my stims (which I didn‚Äôt even realize were stims until relatively recently, because I didn‚Äôt know I was autistic), and it hurts that he makes fun of something I can‚Äôt control, something that keeps me grounded. The problem is, my parents aren‚Äôt that much supportive either, since my mom denies any possibility of me being autistic, so I can‚Äôt explain it in relation to that. To them, it seems like I‚Äôm being petty or overreacting when bringing it up, which is why I try to hide stimming around them (it sucks). And it‚Äôs not that my parents don‚Äôt recognize that my brother doesn‚Äôt respect me, it‚Äôs just that they think that making fun of my stims isn‚Äôt a big deal. Well, it kind of is, and it‚Äôs one of the things that makes me feel like my feelings aren‚Äôt taken seriously (being AMAB doesn‚Äôt help either).",1,autism

"My rabies anxiety started to rule over my life. I try to cope with it my having monthly projects but what if I die in 2 months?

In my holiday, while I was swinging, my toes touched a flying creature but I don't remember what flying creature it was precisely. I remember it has distinct wings though. It may be a butterfly, a moth, or even a bat! I highly doubt bat is a likely possibility because I saw the flying creature for like 2-3 seconds and did not move from my place. I think it may have been too slow or even too small for a bat. If it was a bat, I would probably only see a big flash for a split second instead. I don't even remember bat wings but I remember a black/grayish color. I actually saw bats in the area but they were flying high at night. This event happened during sunset instead. I sometimes try to reassure myself by thinking if it was a bat, I would have known it or I would have shuffled my feet away (or not able to because bats are much faster than moths/butterflies)

OK. Now the worrying part. I had a very small and old wound on one of my toes (3-4 days old at that time, not bleeding, no scab). Maybe it was a rabid bat that happened to fly slowly and some saliva touched the small old wound? For sure, there was no bite or scratch from that animal, only a small preexisting old wound. (which may not even count as open wound by that time but some of the ""toeprint"" wasn't present, the skin color was intact though, just looked like smooth new skin) Maybe my memory is wrong and it was actually a bat? They say that a bat flying during sunset is completely normal but my anxious mind says that it's definitely an odd behavior and it's definitely a rabid bat.

When I told my family about the vaccine, they went crazy and insulted me as if I was mentally defective. Yes, they know that rabies is 100% fatal. Yes, I told them the so-called ""wound"". But it didn't work. I guess I need to see what happens without the PEP.

**If I wasn't worrying about rabies for a month, for various reasons, I wouldn't even CONSIDER a bat exposure and even if it was indeed a bat, I wouldn't consider a rabies risk.** But now I keep my worry with me. Not only I don't even attempt to remove my worry, I even think removing my worry would be dangerous. It's like if I think it's a bat exposure FOR SURE, I'll try to get the vaccine, no matter the harsh consequences. But I'm not sure. It may not have been a bat at all. There may not even be a contact at all. Even if there was a contact, it may only have contacted the intact skin. But sometimes, I vividly imagine my parents' regret and depression, while I'm lying in my deathbed with a foaming mouth and hydrophobia.

I try to reassure myself by telling myself that if I wasn't having a rabies fear for a month, I wouldn't even consider an exposure but at the same time, I sometimes think my paranoia may save my life. But sometimes, it feels like someone told my death date to 3 months later. OK. At least I know my anxiety doesn't increase the chance of rabies, it may even decrease it. Even if the chances are almost zero, I sometimes think I may have won the rabies lottery with an unheard transmission method. Also, I live in Turkey, not USA. I know I wasn't exposed to bats indoors but my OCD-like self sometimes tells that I may have left the door open.

BTW, if I try to deal with this without the vaccine, the result would probably be exactly the same as what would happen without that anxiety. (unless I had a death instinct at that time and knowingly touched a rabid animal, which is too unlikely to even consider)",5,paranoia

"My younger brother [22m] has always had a lot of fears. Growing up he would cry every once in a while because he thought about death and how much he fears it. As he started growing up he got very interested in guns and began purchasing them when he turned 18, when we ask him why he goes on a tirade about the government not being trustworthy (which I agree, but not to his extent). He owns 5 guns now and still asks my mother for money on college expenses, these guns amount to more than 10k. 

He started drinking when he turned 21 and it‚Äôs only gotten worse. He accuses his ex girlfriend of cheating on him, despite her leaving him over this behavior, he had no evidence of her ever cheating on him. Yesterday he visited me and when he was leaving his eyes were red from being tired and he thought the valet in my building would call the police on him because they would think he had been drinking, but we had not had a drink all day. The valet is an 18 year old kid who I always tip, he would never do that. 

Then on his trip home he called me again because he was scared of traffic and the cars around him. He also carried his gun all day while we hung out, he has a conceal carry permit which is okay but I live in a very good neighborhood in a gated community so I don‚Äôt know why he felt the need to be armed at my house.

He also has no friends because they always do something that makes him the victim. Either he gets upset when they forget to invite him or he hates being out with them. He also thinks everyone at work hates him and he calls me weekly with fears of getting fired because he got a certain look from someone.

Can someone give me some advice on how to talk to him about getting help? Please.",5,paranoia

"I came to the realization today when I heard a story about neck injuries. When I was about 14 or 15, I went to a church retreat. They had bouncy houses and a bunch of games to play. One of the bouncy houses was an obstacle course where you can race another person to the end. The house started out having you crawl though some obstacles until you got to a climbing wall thing. At the time of the event I had really long hair, like mid waist almost hip length hair. My hair was in a low ponytail also. We begin the race and as soon as I try to crawl past the second obstacle I step on my pony tail and wrench my neck, it didn‚Äôt hurt but the sound my neck made is similar to someone getting their neck broken. I was stunned for a minute but continued on with the course.

From what I remember I continued my day and life after that with only minor neck pain. 

The thing I can‚Äôt stop thinking about is ever since that incident my life has changed, I developed depression along with a bunch of other mental health issues and my life was just weird.

I understand the age this happened to me could be caused by hormones and stuff but I talk to my therapist about that and she‚Äôs no help at all.

No one has ever told me romantically that they love me. Or that I‚Äôm beautiful (I have been told what features on my body are unattractive by the men I‚Äôve gone out with.)

I sleep with a guy once and they lose interest, so now I feel like my naked body is vile to look at. I go on a date with a guy once, and never hear from him again, so maybe I‚Äôm both ugly AND I have a bad personality.

It‚Äôs just crushing me. The unyielding loneliness is always there.
