(sorry, that got really long. but thank all of you wonderful people for being exactly that - wonderful! you're all brilliant, don't give up hope. ❤️❤️) (also, as another side note, isn't it funny that i have the same birthday as kurt cobain, and now i have the same diagnosis as him. oh life.)",bipolar,2

4958f5ae-67fd-46a6-831c-5841a3ca2ffe,"travelling off-the-beaten-path can be good for many reasons; “unspoiled” nature or charm, peace and quiet, photo opportunities without people getting in the way, more chances to talk to locals instead of staying within foreigner circles, cheaper entrance fees or restaurants, less touristy souvenirs and junk shops… but i’ll start off by saying that **this is not an “attack” on the-beaten-path travel**. there's a reason why there’s a beaten path, maybe because those monuments or sites have a lot of history and were important before international tourism was a thing, sometimes a place is simply very cool and everyone wants to go there, sometimes because it’s easy to access from the capital or along the way between sites, and it can be very good to visit the known places because it has signs in your language if the language barrier is something that makes you nervous, you don’t have to worry about getting lost, it’s your first time abroad or in that country and you aren’t ready to go off-the-beaten-path yet… and many of us just want to see machu picchu and the eiffel tower regardless of crowds or how “typical” it is. **there is no one right way of travelling**. my reason for making this post is simply because many times it can feel like we’ll be spending our time surrounded by crowds, or we’re questioning whether that cultural theme park is really our best option to get to know a country’s culture, or the sites just seem really expensive and there *has* to be a cheaper option, and sometimes it can be hard to know where to look to find these alternatives. here are some ideas on how to find some new spots: ## **discovering new places** **1. use google maps** i use google maps for everything. when i say “use google maps”, i mean this in many different ways: - **create a world map** and continuously add places to it, regardless of whether you’re planning a trip there. for example, i see a photo of the [csav in chile and i think “i’d like to see that!”. but by the time i actually go to chile, possibly many years from now, i’ll have forgotten the csav even exists. this is why, when i hear or see something i like, i put it on the map and it makes sure i remember them when the time comes to visit that area. [this is my current world - if you’ve already started planning a trip, **know where the places you’ll be visiting are**. “i was thinking of sleeping in tokyo and doing day trips to kyoto and nara from there”, as a japan travel consultant i hear things like this all the time, it’s because people haven’t really looked at a map. this can be helpful not only for understanding the geography and locations of the sites you’ll be going to, grouping sites together by areas so it’ll be easier and quicker to move around between them, but also to find other places along the way. say you’re going from beijing to shanghai, they’re far away, there’s probably something interesting to do along the way! what other stops does the bullet train do? do any names stand out on the map? is there a strange colour or water formation that looks interesting? sometimes you can simply ask someone who knows the country well: “hey, are there any worthwhile stops between shanghai and beijing?” - **look at the icons on google maps**. i was adding the notre dame in paris to my map and i realised there are so many things to do in the area, just by [looking at the i hadn’t heard of le palais du luxembourg, place dauphine, institut du monde arabe, musée carnavalet… these may not be off-the-beaten-path, but it’s still a quick and easy way to discover things. &amp;nbsp; **2. let images guide you** - the first thing i always do when starting to plan a trip to a new destination is open google images and type in “(country) tourism”. so if i’m planning a trip to slovenia, is what’ll come out. lake bled, piran, skocjan caves, ljubljana, styria’s wine fields, postojna cave and kamnik are places that i hear about first of all. now that i know something about the country, i can add these to my map if the photos look interesting (i don’t research anything about them yet, i’ll do that later, this is purely judging from an image search) and i’ll have enough for the next steps. - look up the places individually. often when you google a place, other suggestions will come up. for example, [here i am searching for the viti and, as you can see, at the top there are other recommendations: hrossaborg horse city, hverarönd namafjall […], myvatn nature baths… these are sometimes things that others have searched for when looking up the viti crater, sometimes they can be nearby spots, sometimes it’s places that aren’t even in the same country but are similar… open them all! [the can be used similarly. - related to above is another google images feature, [“related when you click on an image. make sure to look at the different images featured and often the title or description will have the name of the other place. it’s a good way to find similar places often at the other side of the country or simply cheaper / lesser known. after about an hour of doing these two things, is what my map of iceland looked like, pink the places i thought were really cool, they’ll be my must-sees, and brown the regular-cool places to visit if i have spare time. - **search for abstract places**. “vietnam waterfall”, “algeria caves”, “germany modern statues”… whatever! you know what you like, so search for that thing specifically. i always search for ruins and caves and history museums. many of these sites may not appear in guide books but they are often worth a visit because you’ve searched for that thing knowing it was something you’d enjoy. - not just sites, but **restaurants and/or hotels too**! just search “tanzania restaurants” and you can find some amazing for foodies especially, sometimes making a visit to a town or city especially so you can eat at that specific place can make the trip much more worthwhile than if you’re simply going with what you find next to the museum. - **use the local language**! if you’re going to france you can search for “cave”, but searching for “grotte” may give you some different options. - **get lost in pinterest**. once you’ve found a cool image on pinterest about the country you’re going to, just let yourself wander around looking at the other images and places you’ll find there. i especially like pinterest because they are images posted by people who have no clue about the place (and i say this with all the respect in the world, it’s an advantage!). even though pinterest is full of this image, nobody who goes to japan would actually go to the [spiral simply because it’s in the middle of *nowhere* and many people (who don’t use pinterest) don’t know it exists. because people of pinterest haven’t been to the places they post, they are not suggestions “tainted” by how easy or difficult it is to visit them, how close or far away they are, how expensive it is, etc. they are purely suggestions based on how good they look. if that’s what you’re looking for, not biased opinions but simply *places*, then this is one of the best options to look. &amp;nbsp; **3. just ask people!** this may seem very obvious, but i think sometimes many of us forget to do this, simply ask people who know the place well or live there what their favourite places are. i live in barcelona and every autumn i make a trip to i also really like [la fageda d'en i don’t know if foreign visitors go there often, but i really think they should if they like nature. people who know the country will know about places that tourists don’t. &amp;nbsp; ## **making the most of your trip** **1. determining your must-sees** what i like: traditional architecture and history (especially prehistory), volcanoes, caves and rocks, temples (bonus points if secluded), ruins and castles, listening to people speak other languages (actual interaction not required). some will think that once you visit one castle then you’ve kind of seen them all; some will visit some ruins and stay there for under an hour because “there wasn’t much to see”; some will prefer to simply read the pamphlet at the entrance instead of building family trees and timelines before their trip; some will get frustrated about the lack of communication and signs they don’t understand or not having anyone to talk to when they travel alone to a foreign country where nobody speaks your language. i don’t like bars and pubs because i don’t drink, amusement parks are terrible because they’re expensive and i’m scared of heights. i don’t want to waste my time at beaches abroad considering i’m from spain and spend almost half the year at the beach anyway. that’s okay! other people’s tastes will be different, that’s the whole point, *people’s tastes are different*. don’t be afraid or embarrassed to say “nah, i’ll pass and do something cooler for me”. **you have limited time on your trip** and you should spend that time doing something you really enjoy. don’t add places that people say are “must-sees” to your list simply because they’re *supposed* to be really good, go to that place that you thought was interesting, even if others will shrug at it. i think this is the most important thing about travelling: **do what you love above anything else**. i made this mistake many times on my first solo trip, and sometimes i still think “well, it’s really famous, so i should go there”, but i can confidently say that my favourite places are the ones that i went out of my way to see simply because *i* was excited about them. this doesn’t mean going off the beaten track is best, sometimes what you’ll want to do is visit a very common place, and that’s a good option too, just make sure you’re visiting that place because *you* want to, and not because other people say it’s really good. **there are no universal must-sees, only personal ones**, you can’t do everything so choose what you love. somewhat related to this is another point: **people have different budgets when travelling**. i’m a backpacker. i’m not going to pay 29,000 yen for a jr pass to ride the bullet train up and down in japan, that’s about the amount of money i spend for 11-12 nights in a hostel. i’ll use the night bus and arrive to kyoto at 5am with a crick in my neck but *for me* it will be worth it, what a bargain! others wouldn’t dream of travelling like this. it all boils down to **people having different priorities**. think about what your priorities are. &amp;nbsp; **2. avoiding crowds** people-watching can be entertaining, but sometimes we just really want a place to ourselves. there are many ways to go about this, even for the most famous sites. - the easiest way is simply to **wake up early**. if it’s a museum, residence, castle or any other place with an opening time, you’ll want to be there as soon as it opens. if it doesn’t have an opening time because it’s outside, it’s a building, observation decks and scenic views, etc., go even earlier. many people don’t like waking up early when they’re on holiday and tour buses tend to arrive around 10-11am. sometimes this will work and sometimes it won’t, but i’ve found that it is generally the most successful way. - **go when nobody else wants to go**. is it raining? fantastic! few tourists go outside in the rain, make the most of it and go to all the outdoor sites then. - **backstreets exist too, go for a walk!** i often walk to a site if it’s around or under 30min instead of taking the bus, sometimes that’s more interesting than the actual site itself. - **the closer to the capital, the more popular it will be**. i say capital, but really any popular destination city works. for example, everyone goes to the blue lagoon in iceland, but there are similar alternatives for hot spring bathing around the country. if that’s an option for you, perhaps simply go out a bit further. &amp;nbsp; **3. travel isn’t only about which places you want to see, but also about experiences** do you have a bucket list? perhaps you should. many people don’t like them, but i personally do, this is just a suggestion. a bucket list isn’t supposed to be a checklist, it’s a reminder. it doesn’t even have to be in the form of a list, it can be a folder on your computer full of images or ideas, it can be a folder of newspaper cutouts, a blog where you repost interesting things you want to do, etc. i mean things such as “use a pottery wheel; learn how to snowboard; meet a nun”. something i’ve always wanted to do is throw a message in a bottle into the sea. i took the ferry from italy back home and i realised later on that it would’ve been a perfect opportunity to try it out, but i didn’t remember at the time! doing these things in a different country can be more exciting than doing them at home, because it’s a moment in which you have the time to try new things. when you travel, think of things you want to try and do, not just see. &amp;nbsp; **4. travel ethically** i won’t get into this too much because everyone draws the line in different places when it comes to morality, this isn’t supposed to be a controversial post. but i want to at least mention it because i think it’s quite important. nothing is going to ruin your trip more than coming to spain to see bullfighting and ending up upset because you didn’t know exactly what bullfighting in spain is like, or riding an elephant in thailand and later learning about what happens behind-the-scenes. are you buying your souvenirs from someone who is harming the local community or economy by importing products or underpaying their workers? are you visiting an aquarium that gets its dolphins from the same people who kill and eat dolphins? are you going to shifen in taiwan to release paper lanterns without having in mind the serious environmental problems that these lanterns suppose? it’s impossible to know about everything, many times you have to look this up yourself because nobody is going to tell you, but especially when it comes to animals; try to know before you go. &amp;nbsp; well then, this is where i end my monologue. i hope this has helped any of you who may have been having trouble planning a trip, or at the very least start an interesting discussion in the comments. if you feel i missed anything important, feel free to add below!",none,5

8cfcfd73-a313-490b-909c-67a54de2e9f8,"the recent discussion about posts from people who've just started meds made me realize that it has been a year since i made my own [""i just started meds!!"" the last year has been quite a journey finding a med that worked well for me, but now that i have, it has definitely changed my life for the better. here is some of what i have learned from the experience: *finding the right med* * **don't assume what works best for other people will work best for you.** from reading here, i had gotten the impression that adderall was more effective than ritalin, and either was more effective than strattera. but once i started taking them, the opposite turned out to be true: strattera was very effective (but gave me bad side effects), ritalin also worked well (it's what i'm still on now), and i *hated* adderall (made me feel not-myself, somehow angry and emotionless at the same time). * **allow yourself time to acclimate to the meds before judging how they work.** the first time i took ritalin it was horrible, like my brain was a car trying to drive with the parking brake stuck on. by the third or forth time i took it, my reaction to it changed, and it started to be more helpful. * **what extended release format you have matters.** concerta and ritalin la have exactly the same active ingredient, they only differ in the release system. but the release system can make a huge difference in how fast the drug enters your system, and what dose you get throughout the day. for me concerta was ineffective in the morning (too low) and made me feel really stressed out in the afternoon (too much), but ritalin la felt like a good even dose throughout the day. * **too high of a dose can be as bad as too low.** on too high of a dose, i feel stressed out and overwhelmed - that stress reaction makes my focus and procrastination worse instead of better. *things that affect how your meds work* * **if you've just stopped taking something else, be aware that that may be affecting you too.** my psychiatrist told me to quit caffeine before starting meds, and dealing with caffeine withdrawal symptoms made my meds seem less effective at first. the same thing can apply when switching classes of meds - med b may not work so well for you while your brain is still adjusting to being off of med a. * **if you have other mental health problems, they need to be treated too.** my adhd meds are much more effective when my antidepressants are working well. sometimes it seems like my wellbutrin and my ritalin are working together to pick me up off the couch -- ""ok, you take her feet, i'll get her shoulders..."" * **sleep, mood, and exercise can all affect your meds. if you do not sleep enough, your meds are way less effective.** other things like being in a bad mood can also affect how well your meds work. and i've found that if i exercise intensely one day, my meds are more effective the following day. * **if you are female, your hormones can affect your meds.** i found meds did almost nothing during the luteal phase of my monthly cycle. getting on birth control pills helped even that out for me and make them effective all month long (but ymmv, some people find birth control pills make their meds less effective instead of helping). *what to expect from meds* * **meds can be subtle, you may not ""feel"" them.** when i take ritalin, i don't feel like i'm on something, i just feel like my normal self - but when i try to do something, it's easier to make myself do it and i'm less likely to get distracted or overwhelmed. * **if you have other mental health problems, treating the adhd may help with them.** having my adhd properly medicated has definitely reduced my depression and anxiety. * **meds will not turn you into someone that you're not.** if you don't like chess, then taking meds and sitting down at a chess board is not going to give you the motivation and focus to become a chess grandmaster. * **your achievements on meds are yours -- meds may have reduced the obstacles, but you are still the one who made it happen.** if you got an a on your math exam, that's *your* a. lots of other people could have taken the same meds and still not gotten an a. your talent and your effort are what got you the a once the meds reduced some of the obstacles. * **sometimes meds don't help as much as you'd hoped.** they improve my symptoms, but they don't make my symptoms totally go away. there are still things i struggle a lot with. it doesn't mean i don't care about these things - i want to do better on all of them and it upsets me that i don't - but i still have a brain disorder that makes me struggle with these things, and while it can be somewhat improved, it will never be ""fixed"". * **meds make you *able* to improve your life, but you still need behavioral strategies to help them work.** before meds, i had tried many systems for productivity and organization, but they always fell apart. it wasn't until i was medicated that i was able to start sticking to that kind of thing and making it work. and i do really *really* need my behavioral and organizational strategies for managing adhd - if i use my strategies my meds are a tremendous help, if i don't then my meds just make me slightly more alert while i read reddit, watch tv, and procrastinate. one year on, meds are still a huge improvement in my life. ritalin is just as effective for me now as it was the first time i felt it helping. if anything it's more effective, because i have learned how to work with it to optimize how it works in my life, and it has made me able to make some long-term changes like keeping a daily schedule. meds have not fixed everything in my life - my apartment is still a mess, i still procrastinate (although not as much), i still forget to do things, and i still lose my keys multiple times per week. but meds have helped me to improve so many things, to the point that ***i no longer feel like a hopeless fuck-up and i actually feel hope and confidence about the future*** (most of the time, anyway…). when i look back at [where i was i really can say meds really have been an amazing, life-changing difference.",adhd,0

d3f97ed1-e4e8-43a4-b245-06dcd28e555e,"hey guys, i wanted to share my story — not to brag or boast, but to offer a bit of hope for anyone else who might be in a similar situation. so for the last 7 years i’ve worked from home as a freelance writer, mainly covering music. it allowed me to work at my own pace, in my own comfort zone, and not have to deal with day-to-day situations that triggered my social anxiety (save for the occasional interview or gig, which always turned me into a nervous, overly-self-conscious mess). dream job, right? however, last summer i found myself desperately unhappy. like, crying-while-making-breakfast unhappy. i realised that as much as working from home sheltered me from anxious situations, i’d actually been hiding away from the world, from people/relationships, and from the chance to grow into the person i want to be (not to mention the opportunity to make a decent living lol). as “cool” as being a music journalist may have sounded to some people, the reality was that i was living a lonely, unhappy and unhealthy existence. something needed to change. it took me over a year to work up the courage, but last month i finally applied for new writing jobs. even reading through the job descriptions filled me with anxiety and dread. *must be able to work to tight deadlines under pressure. ""*ohhhh fuck 😰,"" i thought. but i was determined to fight through it. last week i got my first interview for a copywriting job at a digital marketing agency. my first real job interview *ever*. my heart was pounding out of my chest from the minute i woke up to when i arrived at the office. i was absolutely terrified of blushing during the interview, stumbling over my words and the manager noticing i was clearly not a confident or capable candidate. it’s the most nervous i’ve been in a long time. somehow, i managed to get through the interview (which lasted 1 hour and 30 mins!) and make a good impression. a *really* good impression, in fact. the manager called me yesterday and offered me the job! 😁 he liked that i even remembered peoples' names, which i generally make an effort to do, if only to avoid looking like a forgetful clutz. i guess anxiety *can* be a good thing! i start the job next month and i’m already super nervous, but i’m also really proud of myself. a few years ago i would be too anxious to even google “job search” for fear of being taken out of my comfort zone. these last few weeks i've learned that that fear *is* conquerable, these fears are mostly a fabrication of anxiety anyway, and there are far better emotions and feelings to be found beyond that fear. life is too short to live miserably in the shadows. i don’t think i would’ve had the courage to make this change if it wasn’t for a few things: &amp;#x200b; * meditation. i like to use the [calm which has a whole range of emotion-specific sessions and series (calming anxiety, boosting self-esteem etc). the one about confronting difficult emotions was especially helpful on those days i *really* didn’t want to think about job hunting. * mood board. make a photo album of things that make you happy — people, places, possessions, memories, movies etc. i’m most anxious in the morning, so looking through my mood board (while listening to feel-good songs) every morning really helped to lift my mood and confidence to start the day. * make a list. write down things you’ve done in the past that you’re proud of, things you’ve achieved, challenges you’ve overcome, no matter how silly or small. remind yourself that you *can* be confident, you *are* capable, and you *do* have value. * find inspirational people. for me, learning that bill hader (the super funny and seemingly self-assured actor/comedian/director) has struggled with anxiety all his life — to the point where he’d get physically ill in the days leading up to *snl* — but has still been able to find success in life, is totally inspiring, in a weird way. if you do one thing today, watch [this video of him talking about his * [owning it: the anxiety a super insightful, relatable and inspiring podcast on all things anxiety, hosted by irish author caroline foran. i only discovered it a few weeks ago, but it has already given me so much useful information on how to manage and overcome anxiety. thank you to anyone who has read this far. however bad your anxiety may be, there is always hope.",anxiety,1

(i mean, then it gets worse, then better, then worse than before, but then better again.) so last year i got hit by a worst episode of depression so far. i dropped out of university, i quit my job (it was shitty anyway), i stopped leaving the house. after a few months i was getting up just once a week to go to therapy and the therapy wasn't helping one bit. by the end of the year i was suicidal. it just seemed like a logical next step. but i am a single parent of a 4-year old malinois and i wanted him taken care of, so i decided to stage an accident. the money from my life insurance would be more than enough to rehome him and keep him well-fed for the rest of his life. so i told my family i'm going camping as usual, waited for the worst snowstorm to hit and then went to the woods. when the temperature dropped to -20 c, in the middle of the night i tucked my dog in and went out to lie down on the snow. but my dog didn't want to stay in the tent by himself. he kept whining, barking, scratching, finally got out and laid down next to me. him surviving was the hole point of this undertaking, so i kept dragging him back into the tent, wrapping him in a sleeping bag and getting back to dying, but he's a stubborn little shit. i didn't die that night. i tried again on the following night with the same outcome. i was too resigned to keep trying. it took all the energy i had to get back home, then go to therapy as usual because i still intended to die accidentally as soon as possible. when my therapist saw me, she called the psychiatrist in and i was put on a massive dose of antidepressants and mood stabilizers immiedately. within few weeks i felt a little better, enough to put off my death until spring. i don't know how i made it to today, but i did. i cleaned myself up. i cleaned the house. i started leaving my bed again. i threw out the 'depression sweatpants'. i got a haircut. i met a boy. i fell in love. i got a great job offer. then i got the job. i moved to the new city. i fixed my diet. i fixed my sleep. i moved in with the boy. i'm here now. and i'm really fucking glad i'm still here. i'm gonna enjoy the shit out of it while it lasts.",bipolar,2

225e2ef0-32d2-4e08-bfc7-b8fe591e334c,"a family member has had a long history being drawn to pyramid schemes. this is the latest iteration. because math sadly isn’t quite my forte, i thought it might be interesting to offer it up to reddit and see what other people’s take is on it. i guess i’m curious to see the scheme unveiled a little more thoroughly than i could unveil it on my own. it’s called ‘the triangle’. *chuckles* here’s how it works: x xx xxxx xxxxxxxx let’s call each x an investor. there are four levels and 15 investors in total. let’s refer to the topmost level as level one, and the bottom as level four. the theory is that all of the money contained within this pyramid is gifted to the investor who has reached level one. that is 75k (5k x 15). alternately, if the investor reaching level one does not contribute, which makes more sense, that total comes down to 70k (5k x 14). therefore, 70k is the total contained within the pyramid every time a payout is granted. so let’s take that as our total moving forward; 70k is paid out to the investor at level one. upon reaching level one, every investor will have been in the pyramid 4 times. each will have contributed 3 times; once for each of levels four, three, and two. each investor contributes 15k (5k x 3) and walk away with a 55k gain after reaching level one (70k - 15k). sounds pretty good, right? in order for the pyramid to keep its shape, for there to be only 1 benefactor at level one, 2 at level two, and 4 at level three, this pyramid must help build more pyramids. so how does that work? let’s call them turns. each turn (each time people move up the pyramid), 1 of the 2 investors at level two reaches level one in a different pyramid, 2 of the investors at level three join a different pyramid (reaching level two), and 4 of the investors at level four join a different pyramid (reaching level three). this means that every turn, 7 people move to a new pyramid. and that’s ok, so long as every empty spot is filled, the pyramid keeps its shape and always holds 70k. so that is our final number: 55k (70k - 15k). that is the maximum gain one can make. that’s if the investor walks away; if they decide to no longer partake in the pyramid (the idea, though, is that they’d ideally like to see you invest anew). given that it takes 14 investors in order for 1 to get the jackpot, it naturally follows that it takes 210 investors in order for all 15 investors present in the first pyramid to get the same. and in the midst of this process, some 14 more pyramids have been created, 8 new investors walking in each time at level four. so by the time each of the 15 souls in the first pyramid has won its share, 112 more (8 x 14) are hoping for the same, and because it takes 14 investors in order for 1 to see that dream come true, it’ll take 1568 investors (112 x 14) for them to ever reach the top. and on and on, forever. so aside from the obvious (that the only way to sustain these pyramids is by constantly dragging more people into the fold), i’m curious to see if any of you can shine a light on other potential problems with this pyramid scheme.",none,5

b1b7599c-e02a-4de3-b35e-1bbc0c7832af,i was recently diagnosed with ptsd from bullying i experienced my entire freshman year of high school. ever since freshman year i have at least 5+ flashbacks of it every single day and i can't go to certain parts of my city because i am likely to see the people from that chapter of my life and it will trigger even more flashbacks. it has been three years since freshman year and it still tortures me daily. a couple months before quarantine i was doing much better and only had like 1-3 flashbacks everyday but now that im in quarantine and have more time to myself even more of the trauma has resurfaced and sometimes on really bad days i will have 10 plus flashbacks a day. on top of this i feel so guilty for having ptsd because i feel like me having ptsd from bullying is an insult to people who have ptsd from actual life threatening situations like war and assault and abusive relationships etc. i feel like i can't open up to anyone about it other than my therapist because for many people not familiar with ptsd it might sound absurd to have ptsd from a year of bullying from fellow 14 year olds. i am in so much pain. not a single day has passed where i don't think about my trauma. i am in so much pain i want this to end. im sorry this is so long,ptsd,4

because... and you knew this was gonna happen... but nana died. you won't find out for another three days when you read the obituaries online. fucking pathetic way to find out, huh? this woman took you in and raised you and your sister as her own (grand)kids, and you won't so much as see a picture of her ever again. but she will visit you in your dreams, where you once again find yourself in your childhood ""home"" surrounded by all the love and comfort that you won't really find again. you'll be lucky. not cause it's gone, but that you had it in the first place. i know you had a rough week in the hospital, staying overnight for the first time (the only time you'll ever do that again is in a psych ward!) but the red sox won the world series for the second time (spoiler alert: they win again in 2013! you'll be working an overnight shift at target when that happens.) your roommate is an asshole. it'll take you two room switches before you end up with a decent one. and that guy will smoke pot all day and eat peanuts and throw the shells all over the floor. but you take what you can get, i guess. you're on your own now, my dude. and i hate to tell you this, but it's gonna get a hell of a lot harder. in just a few months, you'll start researching bipolar disorder. you definitely thought you had that at some point, right? it'll be another several years before you're formally diagnosed with it, but you'll be living it hardcore. you know how with celexa and lexapro you didn't get better, you got louder and weirder and dumber? that's why. you're not going to have an easy time with psychiatrists, so you'll experiment with a bunch of drugs... not all of which will be from doctors. oh yeah, future you is a huge fucking stoner. he also chain smokes cigarettes, but just switched to vaping (oh you don't know what that is yet, right? yeah, you'll find out.) eventually, wellbutrin and lamictal will work well. klonopin too, but there's a high risk for addiction (you're going to learn is a thing from peanut-eating future roommate.) now, for some good news. the college you want to transfer to? you got in. you did pretty well for a while. you struggled to make friends at first. not just cause you're... we're... kinda weird, but you weren't rich like these kids were. eventually you'll find your crew. yeah, my dude, future reaper has an actual real life friend group. dudes from all over the world. you'll meet some locals, too, who you'll also become friends with. these guys will teach you a lot - specifically that you don't need to have a college degree to have a fulfilling life. they'll help you ""find yourself"", as they say. but here's where i'm warning you. you'll fuck up a lot in school. you'll do a few too many drugs. you'll get in with some fucked up people. several of your friends will be arrested. a few of them will end up being heroin addicts (that's the one drug you won't do.) a few of them will serve time in prison. you'll come one class away from graduating, and run out of money. you'll fall into depression, then go back into mania when you think you've figured it out again. and you'll look at her, the woman who gave birth to you, and start to notice some of the same things... she's dead now. she finally drank herself to death. you knew it was coming, right? they didn't divorce like you thought they would. but long gone is the comfortable middle class status you grew up with. she blew through all her money. you were right all along - she was trying to take advantage of you. but you shouldn't have cared so much, because just because you're diagnosed with a mental disorder... doesn't mean you'll have to be dependent on the government for the rest of your life. it doesn't mean you can't do this or that. sure some things might be a bit harder for you, but you'll get to do a lot of things most people don't get to do. so what have you done? you've interviewed some famous musicians for your college newspaper. you somehow managed an entire semester in college while you were technically homeless. you've made friends with the local music scene (and lived with) a semi-famous band. fuck, you even had a stint as a commercial fisherman with cousin (spoiler: he's even creepier than you already think.) oh, and you have six tattoos now, including a full sleeve. didn't expect that one, did you? so yeah, lil reaper, i'm writing to you today because this was the *real* day you became an orphan. and so much of your sadness will stem from the fact that no one will love you like that woman did. not your parents. not your sisters. not your extended family. no girl you ever try to date (don't even ask about that...) no one from your hometown. yeah, your hometown, this semi-idyllic 1950s neighborhood of split levels and cape cods, where you could always run a few streets away to her house when things got bad. then grandma's about a mile down the road, where your mother's family carried 60+ years of alcoholism and general dysfunction. so you're leaving all the shit behind. you will spend this day ten years from now throwing away everything in the house as your dad prepares to move into a guest room at the house that belonged to his mother, nearly half an hour from here. and you go... somewhere. yeah homie, you're finally on your own. i'll tell you, though. wherever i (we) go, i still have hope. we're losing everything right now, so you might think i'm delusional. but those external measures of success that you're so obsessed with... those things you thought you had to accomplish to be ""worthwhile""... you'll realize how little they actually matter once they basically disappear. your place in society will completely change. yet you'll find a life that's so much simpler and... happiness will just be so much simpler. and someone will find you, and learn to love you (as you are, not the way they want you to be.) i mean, i still haven't found her yet... but i know we will. much love lil bro, ~reaper o'souls, 11/3/2017 (oh and just so you know, soulja boy ended up being a one-hit wonder. thank fucking god.)",bipolar,2

1d89e132-e2c8-4db6-a660-1d446935d982,"urgent read! please spread the words... while the media of the country have been deeply engrossed to make us mourn for the death of a superstar, some of us could not even relate to (some might though), they totally ignored the protests staged by thousands of youths of the country on the roads of national capital territory of delhi. i am shocked, sad and burning in aghast to see such do-not-give-a-damn attitude of the mainstream media towards this issue. while the wire at least did a live reporting of the incident, i could not see a single report from any of the leading media houses, whom i rely on for courageous journalism. to you all, who have no clue what i am talking about, let me give you a brief intro to this long rant. from 17-22 february 2018 ssc cgl tier 2 was conducted across the whole country. around 1,84,000 students sat for the said exam. to your knowledge this is on online exam and the exam happens in different shifts. after the commencement of the exam students got to know that the question papers of all the shifts were already leaked on internet before the commencement of the exam. when students approached ssc, they did not take any action against it. rather, people who disclosed this scam and protested against this mayhem, were debarred from the exam. according to students who are on road, protesting against this intentional ‘error’, the question paper leak is nothing but a deliberate incident, happened in exchange of huge monetary benefits. ssc officials are involved. around 3 to 4k students are protesting in front of cgo complex, lodhi road and for past 2 nights they are sleeping on the road. they have all come from different parts of the country. they are demanding cbi enquiry against this entire scam, and unless ssc agrees to take any positive stand, they would continue this protest. why this silence from media’s end, i am clueless. are we so deeply mourned by the sudden demise of sridevi that we have lost our conscience of honest reporting? or are we not reporting this protest because it has not sparked any uproar in our mind? while ndtv’s ravish kumar is speaking on this issue, where is the watchdogs of the country? are we waiting for some mishaps to happen? is it because unless some protestors are injured or killed in fake encounters, it does not make a news? if anyone of my media friends is reading this post, please be there to at least see what’s happening. police are continuously provoking students to take law and order in their hands, students have not lost their patience. but, if this continues to happen, they might just lose control of their mind. because, it is heard that police are not allowing the food and water supplying coaching institutes to support this protest. please peek into your conscience and play the role of at least an honest reporter. please spread the word. thousands of students need our help. the youth of the country need our help. please help them in any way in this fight against corruption. edit: thank you guys for your support and wishes. your support is all we need to make this protest successful and to save the future of our youth. the congress has picked this up now and after trending at number 1 on twitter, many politicians have also tweeted about it. shashi tharoor has written a letter to the chairman of ssc. the national student's union have also come out in support of the protest. mr. surjewala and yogendra yadav have visited the scene. india today and times now have also reported this protest. i also wanted to clarify one thing. to everyone saying that the exam which was conducted on 21st february 2018 was cancelled and rescheduled on march, well, the exam of 21st was supposed to start at 10:30 am but after 15 minutes ie at 10:45 am, ssc cancelled the exam and delayed it to 12:30 pm on the same day. actually, the question paper and the answer key were leaked on facebook at 9:30 am but ssc denied this and instead cited technical glitch as the reason for delay. then on 23rd feb, they issued a notification saying that due to technical glitch the exam of 21st feb has been cancelled and will now be held on 9 march 2018. ssc has been denying the incident of cheating or paper leak and have been giving nonsensical reasons for this inconvenience. they have also blamed the coaching institutions for instigating the students. this is completely unacceptable. edit: guys, please follow toprankers on facebook. they are providing live coverage of the event. share it as much as you can. ssc is again playing its delay game by saying that their server is in chennai and they have to there to verify the documents. police have brought water tanks and tear gas and are preparing for lathi charge. please help the students.",none,5

9293bcfd-ff84-44aa-bdce-262bafaf6831,"i was diagnosed in 2nd grade and adhd was described to me as the reason why i couldn’t stop moving and wouldn’t pay attention in class. i have been on and off medication for treating those symptoms for most of my life. some medications allow me to sit still and to focus on things (typically the wrong thing to be focusing on like youtube or video games). all of this time i thought that if the medication made me stop moving and allowed me to focus, then it “relieved” my adhd and my inability to now go and do what i needed to do was my fault, and that i wasn’t disciplined enough, or i was lazy. because i had adhd for so long, i never really looked into literature about it, because i thought i knew what it was and that the symptoms weren’t that bad. i thought to myself, “moving around all the time and jumping from idea to idea isn’t so bad, my real problem is i can’t get the things i need to do done”, which i thought was separate from the adhd. last night, during an extended roaming quest around the internet, i made the impulsive purchase of a book (which i do all the time) on adhd (which i have never done before). in the book (the adult adhd tool kit), it described adhd being a disorder characterized by an impairment of the executive thought system causing a reduction in the ability to motivate yourself to do things that do not result in short term gain. this caused me to go completely nuts, because this describes me perfectly, i am an addict of short term rewards over long term benefits. i, and my parents, and my teachers, always attributed this to some character flaw in myself whereas i accepted my hyperactivity and attention problems as a characteristic of my disorder. this completely changes how i view my actions, as well as my treatment of those i know with adhd, and feels very life changing for me as i can actually seek out treatment options to help the executive system problems rather than the hyperactivity and in attention. i feel stupid for not finding this out sooner and like i was overly proud for so long (i felt i didn’t need to read someone else’s definition of adhd, i “know what it is, i have it”) thanks for reading my rant.",adhd,0

dbcadeaa-915b-4899-9cc0-9ddd8e62c3c6,"i really wanted to avoid a wall of text but now that i'm at the bottom, i realize that i've written this post and that's exactly what it is. i hope you stick with me through the whole thing! for some backstory, i was diagnosed with adhd 6 months ago at age 26 at the end of a very serious depression that occurred after college. i've read a similar story on this subreddit a few times now, and i'm among that group as well of individuals who had symptoms, might have joked about having adhd with my friends, but never was tested because i didn't have any seemingly noticeable/disruptive symptoms and my grades were fine so my parents were happy. honestly i think it was a combination of me just being interested in a lot of learning material taught at school (read: i'm a nerd) and being a 4 season athlete (cross country, indoor track, outdoor track, off-season training). arbitrary bonus points that don't give you anything if you know why i mentioned specifically those two things! we all have experienced how hard it can be to have an adhd brain in a world that is predominantly run by people without an adhd brain and they have created systems that work best for them. consequently, sometimes they don't work very well for us. i won't try to tell you in this post that i found this ""1 trick to *defeat* adhd. doctors hate him!"" that's not true, nor is adhd something that i want to live without anymore. learning about adhd can be an empowering and extremely stimulating topic and the science behind it makes me go ""wow... that makes so much sense, i didn't know that is associated with adhd."" while trying to learn about adhd, just a reminder that a best practice is to use multiple reputable sources to form your knowledge base. even doctors and experts have opinions, since they're people too. i won't lecture you though, because i'm not qualified, nor is my level of understanding to the point where i feel confident that i can explain all of it without making any small mistakes, and i don't want to misguide anyone. here are some questions to get you started! do you know what adhd is? do you know what neurotransmitter ""deficiencies,"" it's commonly associated with? do you know what the primary impact that those neurotransmitters have on your ability to function? do you know the difference between ritalin based medications and adderall based medications? do you know how your medication is ""supposed,"" to work (at a chemical level)? do you know what common ways, without medicine, you can influence the neurotransmitter levels associated with adhd? do you know the common ""super powers"" that adhd brains have over non-adhd brains? do you know how to use them to your advantage? do you know the common weaknesses? do you know if there are jobs that might be better suited for an adhd brain? if there are what might they be? do you know how others cope with adhd? with that, i hope that you take some time to learn more about this wonderful little thing that we have! sure it might have it's daily frustrations, but it adds a depth to my life that i wouldn't want to live without. plus, i love trying to figure out how i can better improve my ability to tap into my adhd superpowers.",adhd,0

a50c63d7-7bfa-4979-ba96-31940e733555,"my ptsd is a result of being trafficked as a child. my mom sold me and i was brought from my country to the us when i was about 2 years old. i was used for sex stuff there until i got out when i was about 16. the whole experience was pretty horrific and still can't/won't talk about like 90% of the time i spent there. i'm 24 now, and i've worked really, really hard to try and build a life that kind of looks normal from the outside. i studied super hard and learned english well enough to get my ged and enter college at 18. i got my 4 year degree. i'm relatively successful and super happy at my job. i've really been doing the best i possibly can. but, i still struggle with a lot of things. i have an eating disorder that has gotten progressively worse over the years. when i was in college, i picked up the habit of having a lot of casual sex with people i picked up at bars. i honestly have no idea why i even want to do this. i don't enjoy sex and i dissociate through almost all of my encounters, but for some reason i'm totally drawn to it. i can't stop. its like, my body feels like its made to do this. its weird. i just recently left an inpatient treatment facility for my eating disorder, and while i was there i had to see a therapist very frequently. he was horrible! the worst. he made me talk about a lot of things from my childhood that i really, really didn't want to discuss. i felt like i had to. it's hard to explain i guess. but one of the things he was super fixated on was the casual sex situation. he kept on and on about how there is no way that all of that sex had been consensual on my end. and at first, i was like 'that's absolutely ridiculous. i went out looking for sex and got it and so it's obviously consensual' but the more we unpacked it, the more it became unclear to me. there's this one time, specifically, that i think i might have changed my mind on. so, i went to this frat party my freshman year (i had just turned 19) and i started drinking. i blacked out very early into the party and woke up about 14 hours later on the floor in the living room of a different frat house missing a few items of clothing and covered in bunches of bruises. honestly not that unusual for me at that time. but when i got up, i realized that something was seriously wrong with my hip. i had 9 surgeries to replace my hips and pin my pelvis and stuff back together right after i escaped my traffickers, so i've had tons of problems with them since. i knew i probably broke a pin or something, so i immediately went to the hospital to have it replaced. at the hospital, they immediately told me that i had been drugged and assaulted by numerous people and they urged me to press charges against the fraternity, but i told them i definitely wasn't assaulted and that it was chill. they put another pin in and i was on my merry way and found myself in a ton of similar situations in the years to follow. i never thought about this incident again and it never bothered me, until this therapist uncovered it again. whenever i start to feel overwhelmed or when i see someone that looked like one of my abusers i always tell myself ""you've been safe for 8 years. nothing bad is going to happen to you."" apparently that phrase bothered my therapist because he was very set on explaining to me all the ways i've most definitely not been safe in the past 8 years since i've been out. he told me i was ""very likely"" to be forced into prostitution again if i didn't stop having reckless sex and that i ""had been assaulted"" more times than he can count in the last 8 years. i feel devastated and overwhelmed. before this, i felt like i had been doing a really good job of taking care of myself and trying to get it together, but now i feel like i'm starting from square 1 and i haven't done anything. like i just got out of my trafficking situation and have to learn how to be a normal person all over again. i feel like 16 year old me all over again and its horrible. i'm overwhelmed and i wish i could go back to believing that all those things were consensual. my brain is real upset with this new information. i don't know why i felt the need to share this stuff with yall. has anyone gone through anything similar?",ptsd,4

caa71704-8f68-40d2-b49f-277a4fb63e75,"hi everyone, so to give a little background i was diagnosed with severe ptsd almost two years ago and heavily recommended a service dog (not a therapy dog, a service dog *see google for difference*) to help assist with my daily functioning, being that i was not functioning nor able to function normally at that time. my options were to shell out upwards to $20,000 for a service dog (if i could find one,) go thru an organization (non-profit that trains ptsd service dogs), or obtain my own dog and train it myself in hopes that it is well-tempered, intelligent, and driven to work as an adult dog. i did not have $8,000, nonetheless $20,000 at that time, nor was i able to hold a job or receiving any sort of financial assistance (even from family.) so i then went ahead and filled out numerous applications to various organizations in hopes to be approved and then put on a waitlist for a service dog. unfortunately i was turned down by every single organization because they only catered to veterans. this was extremely defeating being how severe my trauma was and how much i was struggling to even attempt to function at this point. so i spent months looking for the right dog/breed/temperament/circumstance/etc... and i finally found the right little man last october. i have been training him with the help of private trainers and obedience classes, and let me tell you this is hard work. but without him i don't even know if i would still be around- he has changed my life in ways that i wasn't even able to consider or imagine 8 months ago. everyone who is struggling with debilitating ptsd, i strongly encourage to get a ptsd service dog. so here is where i need advice: (if you are still reading- thank you!..) i still am unable to work, however i hope it is not like this forever. since having gone through being turned down by so many organizations to the point that i have almost given up, and then to have experienced the incredible benefits first-hand of having a service dog i have been wanting to do something... i have had this idea in the works for almost 9 months now. i want to start an organization that provides service dogs (not therapy dogs) to those diagnosed with severe ptsd dealing with severe domestic and sexual violence that has left them unable to function normally as a young woman/man or adult. i have tossed the idea around to a few peers but i think their obliged to support me on any goal i have being that i have barely been able to think about the week ahead- nonetheless long-term goals. the organization would be fronted by a business (potentially an online clothing/apparel store) that the revenue goes toward funding this organization (along with donations) so that the service dogs can be offered free of charge to these victims. i went from taking 4-6 medications/day (8mg of xanax, 2mg ambien, trazadone, celexa, 50mg seroquel...etc...) to now only having xanax with me as a back-up that i use maybe once or twice a week as needed. that may seem like a drastic change but it totally happened organically. the incredible safety, love, and support (emotional and physical) that my service dog has and continues to give me has surpassed any medication or therapy i have been able to find or try. i want young women/men to be able to feel, see, and experience that hope again the way i have. although my life and ptsd is something i continue to struggle with daily, my sd has made it so i can at least manage my symptoms constructively and i am able to channel my energy and love toward him and his training. i really feel passionate about this and.. i want you to tell me what you think! i can take constructive criticism, so please voice pros and cons of this concept, and how/if you think it would be beneficial for our fellow souls suffering from this debilitating illness. thank you so much!",ptsd,4

8fa69fa3-46a0-43a8-93e9-2b3e721794f8,"my life story; so i developed pretty late. from grades 6-11 i was ugly, i had a chubbyish face, wasn't fat but was very untoned, and was very awkward looking. i got bullied a lot back then and i remember i used to hide sometimes in toilets to avoid getting picked on. i only remember how much i was bullied when one of my highschool friends brings it up as a joke when are meeting up. i used to feel inherently uncool, like i could never have good friends, that no chill person would want to be my friend. in about 11th grade my face shed of its fat, my jawline came through, and i became really good looking. i was still bullied in grade 11 because i had become a target almost, people said i was easy to target because it was like after the years of bullying, my balls were gone, i became a bitch, they had bullied my confidence/self esteem right out of me. then i went to college and tried to be a completely different person, tried to get my mental/outlook frame to and on par with the other good looking people. it worked on the odd times and people used to treat me much differently to school. but i could never make moves properly on girls/was kind of awkward and couldn't talk well and confidently with people even tho it was starting to piece togather. i realised these good looking people around me had been like that since they were so young, but for me it was like being born again, i didn't know how to act/do things, i always felt no one really liked me and always felt i was being used in some way or form. i smoked weed and that made me even more paranoid, i used to feel i was ugly and my good looks were an illusion, that everyone was making fun of me and i was worthless. in college i made quite a few friends but ofc never ever spoke about my past. to them i was this good looking guy who seemed to be a bit arrogant even, and quiet, and even not that smart. my looks were there, but the personality was lacking far far behind. how could i make up in 1-2 years for what others spent their entire youth mastering? i read everything i could, how to win friends and influence people etc.. i became better with girls quite a lot but i still am awkward in person a lot of the time, they just dont percieve me as an awkward guy because of how i look. i just come across as someone who is a bit full of himself or something. i've been called an asshole quite a few times for that. sophomore year i became better, i began to realise weed was no good for me, i realised that my friends liked me for who i was, and that the silliness i had from highschool, was still there, i began to study more and showed my intelligent side (i go to a highly ranked university). i began to smile, appreciate others, care to make good friends. the fear of people no liking me based on how i look is going. i am still pretty self conscious which is something i need to erradicate as soon as possible. i'm entering my junior year at college, with set goals. i need to 1) lose my virginity 2) get a beautiful girl as my girlfriend. i've never had a girlfriend, the thought of rejection would have buried me with my low self esteem and extreme boughts of anxiety. the anxiety tells me i am worthless, that i will never get a girlfriend, that such things are not for people like me, its terrible, i can often not sleep and toss and turn a lot. im still very insecure about my looks, i look in the mirror a lot to check if i look half decent. many people think i am a narcissist or something because of it. i wish i could download all the experiences other guys had during highschool, and college, and be able to feel that different mental/frame outlook. it must feel so great to believe so many girls are into you, to have that mental outlook of confidence, to know u can always do and achieve, and get beautiful girlfriends. i know this is impossible, and i will have to have these experiences. wisdom/experience cannot be derived from books, and only experience. i know i must fail a bunch more times with girls quickly before i succeed. the anxiety bouts i have at times are severe. i don't take any medications tho nor do i want to ever. i get depressed and look around my room or wherever i am to things i can use or where i can hang myself. end my poor little life. i have to convince myself i am good looking again, i am worth a lot, its my own mental frame that is fucking me over, crippling me, that i have so many friends who are very cool at university who i could be even better friends with, i could play less games with girls and be open/honest and genuine with them. i just fucked it up with a girl i had a huuuge crush on and that is killing me rn, and has been for the last few days. i feel so shit, the anxiety is ruining me. i have a shredded/muscluar body, i'm a pretty short guy at 5'8 but i've learned that is inconsequential as it is the confidence that comes with height that is so attractive (tho i know height is much sexier). i have a face like a less hot more cute version of zayn malik. but this past month i stopped working out, began smoking a lot when the anxiety trips were high. my diet got shit. i still look the same, i haven't lost any of my gains/look very fit, but i am weaker. i've stopped smoking so much now only like a cigarette a day and i'll get over this girl soon. junior year is where i want to come in strong, use all my wisdom from the last 2 years and realise my potential. to make all the moves i can with girls, be fun, be genuine, accept myself for whatever i am, be happy, smile, show interest in others, and accept that i am a good looking guy, i am very very lucky to look and have the life that i do, and if my mental frame is gonna keep fucking me, its not acceptable. i am still a slave to my anxiety but i am fighting, each day i tell myself don't just don't start the thought cycle where i am useless etc.. sorry for this long essay to those of you who stuck around to read my life story.",anxiety,1

7c3a5e2c-7da1-4d98-81c9-5f81e11aab39,"i was sexually abused by my best friend at the time 2 years ago. since then, i've had one hell of a time. i became obsessed with avoiding him wherever i went because we're interested in all the same places, and he lives up the street from me. i saw him outside in our neighborhood riding his skateboard while i was driving to a restaurant and i felt everything inside me just go numb for a few minutes and i could barely talk. after that, i couldn't stop picturing him in my head, how he looked, how he was feeling, what he would've done if he saw me driving past him, what i would've done if i were going for a walk and saw him- and then my urge to see him again amplified tenfold. i started taking routes to my college that intentionally pass where he lives in hopes of seeing him, i've considered on taking my dogs for walks past his part of the neighborhood, and i've fantasized about hiding near his house to watch him enter and leave his house. if i could, i'd put security cameras all over his house so i can watch whatever he does and says. i don't even like him. i hate him, in fact- i've spent hours fantasizing about ways to kill him. when i was in high school, i picked routes that passed him and hung out in places he walked by. does anybody know why i feel this way, or have any research on this type of behavior?",ptsd,4

85eb94b8-67b3-4488-9e06-653ff8c6e846,"hi reddit! i am a disturbance ecologist (think fires, windstorms, landslides) that primarily studies the response of forested ecosystems to emerging disturbances triggered by climate change. i'm particularly interested in how resilient forests may be to these new stresses - and if that resilience is a good thing. will our forests recover from future disturbances? what will that recovery look like? does this recovery – or lack thereof – help or hinder species ability to migrate in response to climate change? what new disturbances are emerging? one striking example of all of these issues is the emerging mortality of species along the remote southeast alaskan and canadian west coast, where 400,000 ha (so far) of trees have died due to low snow conditions brought about by warming winters. the cause is surprisingly related to freezing – the soil is no longer insulated by snow, so cold snaps can kill. this is an emerging disturbance that we are just beginning to study, and it’s dramatically changing the forest community. but it also appears to be associated with migration in other, less climate sensitive species. so perhaps this disturbance, and others, are facilitating the migration of species into more favorable climates. it’s a complex ecological story of adaption/maladaptation and creative destruction (so to speak), and great fun to investigate. most of my work involves a focus on either forest biodiversity, forest carbon, or water resources, and i've worked in hawaii, the rocky mountains, and alaska, and collaborated on projects around the world using a combination of fieldwork, remote sensing/satellites, gis, and modeling. i am also the caretaker of what is believed to be the longest running permanent study plots studying primary succession in the world in glacier bay, alaska (100 years and counting). so the data comes from a lot of sources, and i'm happy to discuss integration of methods as well. for more info, [check out this website.](www.brianbuma.com) **i will be answering your questions at 1 pm et, ama!** edit: thanks everyone! some really interesting and thought provoking questions in here, and it's humbling and exciting to see so many people concerned and interested in the state of the world's forests. there were lots of great ideas for next steps, projects, etc mentioned here and i'd love to hear how those progress. i have to run for a meeting but i'll check back in tonight (it's only 1pm in alaska right now, after all, lots of time) and keep on doing what i can. edit 2: and i'm back for a bit. this is really fun. ...off for dinner. will log in later to reply further. in the meantime, most of my work is posted on my website, and for those great questions about coastal forests i would encourage you to check out the alaska coastal rainforest center for all things coastal forest related. feel free to email with questions as well, i'm always looking for interested students and research collaborations, in addition to partners in management and policy. alrighty, it's late in alaska, so i'm done (and denzel is online...). thanks so much for your questions!",none,5

cf0fbd8f-dde9-47d1-a971-50a25b1d7668,"[hi, here's another long tutorial post that talks about some of the strategies i use to manage life with mental illness. there are pictures, too! ---- #why my previous solutions failed me: i've tried using apps, software, and pen and paper, but i don't like them. apps/software have cool features for syncing and organization, but at the end of the day, they still exist in one physical device. it's just a flat piece of glass and electronics, and the **responsibility is still on me to remember to open the app** and access the information. that's exactly what an executive functioning disorder makes difficult. paper is better, because i can take a piece of paper and **stick it somewhere where i'm likely to see it**, even when i do day-to-day things. post-it notes are even better. the problem is, papers are also **easy to misplace, easy to crumple up**, and if you have a lot of thoughts, **hard to keep track of**. they're very cheap and disposable and take a lot of work to actually use correctly. &amp;nbsp; #why whiteboards are better: they give you all the benefits of pen and paper, but get rid of some of the downsides. portable whiteboards are **much more sturdy and re-usable.** when you're done with a thought, or a task, or an appointment, you can just erase it and **continue using the same board**. the only issue is, they're kind of hard to carry around with you without accidentally erasing what you've written, because the board rubs up against stuff in your bag. ---- #my diy project: i wanted a way to bring whiteboards with me, in my bag. these are the supplies i bought: * transparent page protectors with holes for ring binders * some sort of hard material that won't bend, about the size of a sheet of paper. (plastic, wood, whatever) * blank white pieces of paper * duct tape * a binder (preferably one that's hard, not flexible. bonus points if it can fold over on itself flatly.) * literally anything to act as spacers between the pages. (you want to be able to have a gap between whiteboard pages so they don't rub up against each other in your binder) you can probably find a way to do this lying around the house. &amp;nbsp; here's some simple steps to make the portable whiteboard pages i made: 1. put the rigid material in the page protector. 2. use the blank white pages to make the surface look white (placed between the transparent sheet and the rigid material). 3. tape it all up fancy. (you only really need to add tape to seal the pages, but i added more to make it look nicer) 4. add the spacers to the pages so that it makes a gap when they're lying flat. ---- #ways i've used specific pages: **sharpies** + whiteboards are awesome. they'll be mostly permanent (edit: i say ""mostly permanent"" because if you write over permanent marker with dry erase marker, then erase, it'll come right off. so, it allows you to be flexible with your use of markers!), so you can use sharpie to **make templates** by adding titles and creating grids, then write in them with the dry-erase whiteboard markers. **blank pages** are also really good for brainstorming. gets your thoughts from your head to the page without using up a billion pieces of paper. lets you erase mistakes easily. lets you communicate your thoughts more easily when just vocalizing it can be really hard. &amp;nbsp; here are some example templates: &amp;nbsp; [**weekly organizer** -- click for image of finished i work week by week, one section for each day of the week. anything that's not within the next week, i add to an 8th section called future, so it's still there. more efficient than a monthly/yearly calendar for me, because it's easier to fit on a small page. &amp;nbsp; [**task/activity organizer** -- click for image of finished you've probably seen those grids with 4 quadrants, urgent/not urgent, important/not important. it's called the **eisenhower decision matrix** and it did not work for me. i spent so much time trying to figure out if something was ""important"" or ""urgent"" i just stopped trying to use it. instead, i sort my responsibilities by how badly they'll mess up my life if i forget them, and i sort all the cool things in life by their benefit to me. by doing this, you frame things in terms of their rewards and consequences, which is 100% the key to motivation for people with adhd imo. &amp;nbsp; ***responsibilities, obligations and commitments*** * **really important shit:** this is anything that will have a serious impact on my life if i forget to do it. if i ignore these things, then my life will spiral downward and i'll start to panic. this is where i put things related to financial deadlines, or upcoming assignments/tests, or important paperwork i need to do as an adult. * **sorta important shit:** this is stuff that i should probably do, but if i forget it, it won't be the end of the world. it'll probably still suck, but it won't completely ruin my life or anything. normal chores go here. ***rich and fulfilling life categories*** * **useful shit:** this is stuff that i can work on in my free time that'll be useful for my growth as a human being. anything relating to skills and self-betterment goes here. * **fun shit:** this is where i put all of the things i could spend time on that i really enjoy doing, and that make me really happy. &amp;nbsp; when i go to decide how i should spend my time, i refer to my chart and make sure i'm not neglecting anything with **consequences**. if i'm not, then i choose an activity with **benefits**. (edit: of course, i chose to write this post instead of working on the *really important shit*, so i'm gonna go work on those things right now.) ---- that's it. i stick these pages in a binder, carry the binder with me everywhere i go. if i'm at home, i'll prop important pages up in places where i can 100% see them. i stick them in my line of sight, and work through every item one at a time, and erase them when i finish them. everything is easily accessible and easy to see, and nothing gets lost in the depths of an app, or in a stack of pages. because there are literally only 2-4 pages, instead of hundreds. hope this helps! **tl;dr: whiteboards are awesome, i made portable whiteboard pages, then came up with some rad ways to use them to organize my shit.**",adhd,0
38d2e46b-0d4c-4076-bbbb-14d078388902,hi there guys i've posted in here regarding my experience with ptsd after a physical assault. i have just done my first session of emdr with a therapist and quite frankly amazed. i was already so much calmer just leaving the place. the whole experience has just seemed to shift my perspective of the incident just slightly more neutral rather than the extreme emotions that i usually experience. my memory has been stuck for a long time i've tried a couple of things to help but nothing has worked anything like this. it is expensive (here in uk) but i've been suicidial for a long time so if it continues to erase my extreme emotions regarding the incident and just more safely store the memories in a neutral place it will be worth every penny. i've got my walk back it sounds silly but i wasn't atall hyper vigilant and i had a confident stride. i read someone saying on here that ptsd is ptsi not a disorder but an injury for the first time i understand what they mean. if you feel lost and alone then believe me when i say i've felt the way you have and i know what it is to be misunderstood and lonely but things will get better. just take the right actions. peace and love guys,ptsd,4
ae504e19-5b2f-437d-9af9-3d41dae51007,"i've recently spoke to a friend about my personal life and he suggested that i may possibly be dealing with ptsd. ptsd was never really something i thought i could be suffering from - rather i just thought that i was a kid who had typical abusive parents that every chinese kid had and as a result, i have high levels of anxiety and depression. i thought ptsd was more reserved for individuals who dealt with high levels of trauma such as sexual abuse, war, murder, etc. because he's my friend and i felt like i've told him enough about my abusive life, i didn't want to get into the deeper details because i felt it might ruin our friendship, so i am asking you guys. i know you're not in any position to give a professional diagnosis but...i just want to know if it's possible. i just need someone to listen and know. something. i was also told growing up, ""this is how chinese parents teach their kids, because chinese parents love them unlike your white friends whom their parents let them do whatever they want, because they don't care."" a brief overview of me and notable events (usually occurring more than once)in my life that i can still remember to this day * male, asian descent * was physically/emotionally abused as a child by mother, father, aunt and grandmother * beaten with belts and several household items * was stripped naked and forced to stand outside my house for two hours when i did poorly in school. * accidentally fell down the stairs and when i cried for my mom expecting hugs, she beat me relentlessly saying that it was my fault. * being told to stand for 10 hours with both my arms up and being whipped by sticks on my sides when they lower below my shoulders. my dad would sit in a chair next to me and because i was crying i couldn't tell if he had his eyes open or not, so sometimes being whipped could suddenly happen * getting a bad report card from school and while taking the bus home i would feel faint, vision changes/blackening because i was anticipating being beaten that night * being suddenly yanked out of bed in the middle of the night and getting yelled at and beaten because my parents found my report card (or even a failed test from three years ago). i recall being pulled by my hair down the stairs. * being told to stick out both hands and my dad would hold a bamboo stick over them; he'd hover over each hand and move between them while saying stuff like ""what did you do wrong?"" and then smack the palm of my hand, depending on whether i answered properly or just smack them and then expect me to give the proper answer. sometimes the proper answer would still mean getting hit and i'd have to repeat it to ensure that it drills into my head. sometimes he could force me to count each time my palms was hit. * hiding under the kitchen table to isolate certain parts of my body from being hit that were incredibly sensitive. so if my dad kept hitting my shoulder, i would position myself and also put all my focus into ensuring and expecting that my shoulder was hit. if i did this, it almost created a numbing effect. however, my dad would make sure to hit other parts of my body, like my ears or my feet. this caused immense pain and i can recall how it would cause me to spasm and scream and break me out of the ""focus"" * being chased and beaten by my dad and running towards my mom for protection while she was washing dishes : i recall her kicking me away from her. that hurt me so much. * being deprived of sleep by not allowing me to go to bed and instead, sit in my knees and pray to a statue of buddha and repeatedly say things like ""i will do well in school"", ""i will be a good son"", ""i will not lie"" * being forced to recite books in french for hours. my dad would sleep on the chair and if he noticed i stopped or slept, he would hit me. if i finished the book he'd tell me ""read it again from the beginning"". he would place the bamboo stick in front of me. * falling into a puddle in public and as i would get up, my mom would smack me behind the head saying ""you made me lose face"" and literally wanting to die from everyone staring at me * in kindergarten, we had to change our pants for gym class and teacher saw my bruising/whip marks on my legs. i was brought into the office by my teacher and i felt like i did something wrong. my parents would tell me about how because of me being bad and getting the whip marks, the government is going to take me away and i'm never going to see them nor my sisters even again. * being hit by a broom on the top of my head that caused an open wound. because i had hair it was easily hidden, so during the weekend it closed up and i constantly picked it when i was stressed. teachers at school thought i had lice. i still have this habit today. * occasionally when i was a kid, i would wake up in the middle of the night crying because i had intense difficulty breathing. i was diagnosed as having asthma....but the strange thing is that i can't recall this feeling during the day nor during gym class. it was only at night and sometimes i would find myself pulling my favorite blanket in front of my parents' door crying myself to sleep while struggling to breathe. * my mom would invite her friend and her son (whom we were around the same age) but because i failed an exam that day, i couldn't play with him and instead my mom would force me to stand in the living room with both my arms up and hit me if my arms dropped. she would shame/complain about me to her friend while doing so, and then say ""look at your friend. why aren't you more like him? he's a good son unlike you."" - i just avoided eye contact with my friend and his mom and basically just phased out while crying. * coming back from every parent teacher interview and while driving back in the car my dad would say things like ""i'm going to beat you until you die"" and me sitting in the back crying and just hoping that it's going to be over and i'm going to wake up tomorrow because it was a bad dream, waking up and realizing i'm still in the car and we are heading closer to home and my dad was going to take the clothes hanger and beat me. * ""tutoring"" me in chinese spelling involved my mom saying ""i'm giving three hours to study. i'm going to test you later after."" and involved me standing next to to a blackboard while she was holding a feather duster. * the worst nightmare i had was something i just couldn't put my finger on - i cannot visually describe the details but it was the feeling of having all of my blood drained from my limbs, the incoming feeling of about to vomit and having something stuck in my throat, combined with the feeling of having to run because i feel i'm being chased. this same feeling would occasionally occur irl during periods of high stress. i could recall some periods in my childhood where i was beaten 3-4 days in a row. could any of these actually ptsd or am i just over thinking it? i am a first generation asian born in canada and because of that i felt that because of the cultural differences this isn't something that could cause ptsd to me specifically . i've spoken to other chinese kids growing up and they all tell me ""yeah my parents have beaten me"", so because of that i've always thought it was a ""normal"" thing and that non chinese kids i could never relate to them. i just feel alone most of the time and i feel because of these experiences, i could never tell potential partners. at the same times i would feel so much guilt because i'm hiding this away from them. this feeling of ""wanting to vomit"", blood draining from limbs, similar to my nightmare, happens when i'm in social situations....especially where there's validation involved.",ptsd,4

anyways. i have not had anyone that i feel comfortable telling this too because of the guilt i selfishly do not want to feel. i have been dealing with depression much of my life and the other night i felt so numb. i had felt like all of the emotion was drained out of my body. for some reason hanging myself felt like something i wanted to do. i had no great master plan, but i was genuinely feeling motivated to see what it felt like to hang myself and actually do it. i went to my shower door and tried a couple of jackets (they were all that i had that could work) and ended up finding this pink jacket that used to be my mom's and tightly double knoted it around my neck. i had multiple attempts cause the jacket was too stretchy, but was able to make it work. for some reason it felt right to be doing this. i stepped off the shower seat and felt the relief of the breath being taken out of me. i was easily able to stop the process and go back up on the step because it was not a far drop. i kind of wish i went through with it. at the same time i don't really want to go to hell if that's a thing. my whole life i have been chubby. ok maybe not to everyone's standards, but for mine. i have never liked my body and it only got worse as i got older. i eventually resorted to throwing up and bingeing. i am 21 now and had stopped for a while after high school, but ended up doing it again. i am fatter than ever and really do not like any part of how i look. i feel like i should just end it. i have a hard time seeing how i am suppose to live if i cannot even feel comfortable in this fucking skin suit i have to wear all the time. i got botched back when i was 18 and find that my body feels less like mine than it has ever felt. after three surgeries and 30,000 i still look fucked up. i hate being ugly, but have already drained the accounts of any money left to fix the issue. i feel like i am already too old and that my body is already ruined. i have scars where i thought i would never have them. i have always been obsessed with romance novels. ever since i was 13 they were my escape. those books and life in general taught me that romantic love will make a person happy. i have never had that. i am fearful that i never will. i feel like the people i liked always had someone prettier and less complicated to be with. it is never me. i think back to high school when i felt like i met the man of my dreams. he had a wonderful aura. he was tall and funny and nice and had the prettiest brown eyes that i had ever seen. his music taste was even more alternative like mine. he even loved the outdoors like me. i remember at the beginning of the semester we were texting until i heard two other girls in my grade liked him. once i heard this i stopped texting him. i knew that one of these two girls was the epitome of the perfect girl. she had the long blonde hair, was smart, and was skinny. i could never compete with her. i wished so bad to have been his date to prom. i know it may sound so childish to other people, but all i can think was that i was too stupid and too damn ugly to get the man i wanted. i still think about him sometimes to this day. i feel like i missed my shot. every other date i've been on since high school has not even come close to this dude. i even considered trying to go ""play for the other team,"" but i know that's not my real issue. i can't seem to feel that i do not have an other half and that someone already took him. ever since my parents divorced my senior year it feels like everything went down hill. i miss my old home. i miss having a home. now both my parents are remarried and happy and i cannot seem to get myself together. i feel that they will be sad if i left, but fine without me. i am just a waste of money for them. all i have done is spend all this money on surgery and health care to try and fix something that most likely can't be fixed anyways. i feel like all i do is take from them and am not even helpful in the slightest. i miss my old home. i miss my dog who passed away. i miss seeing her play in the yard. i miss having my family together. i miss my cat that passed away. i wish i would have spend more time with her and my dog. i feel that my family is gone. both my parents and even my brother have changed so much. i feel that i am the only one that has not changed. maybe i haven't had a boyfriend because i am meant to die a virgin. maybe i am just possessed or something. sometimes i blame it on being an aquarius, but i think we all know its not that. maybe all of the things i've lost over these couple of years was meant to happen so i could just go too. i needed to get this all out. it has all been weighing on me ever since i attempted to hang myself. i do not know the exact thing that came over me that night, but it scares me. i feel like it could happen again. what is the point of continuing on if it does happen again? i could not bear the idea of leaving a kid or even pet behind if i were to go through with suicide in the future. i feel like i have no real shot at life. to me this is all because i am just not pretty. i am sick of being fat. i am sick of feeling my inner thighs touch and my double chin. i honestly do not know where to go from here. i am still going to try to survive and do my fucking homework, but i am not sure when the wave of

f307bed5-38b0-4a3a-9056-58bbb4b26831,"*disclaimer: i understand that this post is insanely long but i feel condensing it will dilute its message. some of this is unrelated to my bipolar ii but it still plays a central role in my issue so i felt this would be the best place to post this (plus i don't know where else to post). little new here. i've been suffering from the symptoms of bipolar ii along with social anxiety since my early teens so throughout middle/high school it crippled me socially. my rapid, awkward, all-over-the-place speech in my hypomanic phases and my mumbly, confused speech in depressive phases (if i even spoke at all) along with anxiety kept me from really connecting with anyone and i was never able (and still am not very able) to display my true self, something that crushes/depresses me to this day. it also seriously held me back academically/athletically. i was a straight-a student with a promising competitive swimming career up until around 9th grade when my disorder had grown to an unmanageable level due to it going untreated, and it continued to for the rest of high school, with my relatively strict parents calling it bullshit at every turn and never getting me in any counseling or put on any meds until i dropped out of college at 18. only then did they listen and see an issue. knowing that i never realized my potential in any area of my life sends me flying into bouts of extreme depressive episodes in which i cry over what could have been and it can last days. i only thought i had depression at this point so i was misdiagnosed for another year. now at 20 i am finally diagnosed properly and on a mood stablizier although it hasn't been particulary effective, and smoking weed and dropping acid probably doesn't help matters. but i must admit that my first couple trips allowed me to take inventory and understand that i've been bouncing between manic/depressive phases since childhood and that my issue quite possibly extends into sex addiction/hypersexuality. and it brought certain behaviors and memories to the surface that i wasn't willing to face and it's a big reason why i'm even here posting this (i do not condone the use of lsd, especially for the people on this subreddit). now we get to the main point that the title addresses (not sure if i had to give ya'll my life story first).throughout my adolescent life a common theme has been my complete and utter lack of control of my sexual impulses, resulting in shameful behavior that i keep buried away from many: public masturbation. at the beach with a towel over me, in the nearest public bathroom and even in class. i knew it was disgusting as i was doing it, but simply had to get off constantly like some nympho. i could only dart to the bathroom throughout the day so many times (our monthly hall passes gave us a limited number of times to leave class). after reflecting, i feel that this urge was aggravated by a combination of my hypomanic phases (which involves being too horny) and my hypersexuality, bringing my sex drive to an insane level. if this is the case, then it would explain that behavior. it doesn't justify it, but it gives insight into how this happened. and teachers did nothing to address it. unless the kid's autistic, i would have confronted me about it if i were in their shoes and it may have gotten me the help i needed sooner. because they turned a blind eye, it continued to fester and get worse. i understand that it's not their job to counsel me but such extreme behavior warrants attention, i was very sick and nobody helped me. there is one exception, in which we were watching a movie in class a year after i discontinued my in-class meat-beating. a risque scene comes on, and my teacher promply says, ""ok, settle down, john."" to which the class erupts into the most intense laughter i've ever heard that rings in my ears to this day. so if anything they made it worse. i quickly became known as that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class, bc, well.... i was that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class. i never stared at some chick's ass to set it off, mind you, if anything i blocked out the world to focus on my animalistic impulses. so if anyone wants to call me a gross creep, save it bc i'm already aware :( but this realization that it may not have been my fault, that i'm not a complete pervert really makes me feel better and could bring me at peace but i feel i cannot confirm it without getting some outside opinions and i don't want to go to anyone else (friends, family, etc.) other than my psychiatrist bc i'm so shameful of it and i fear they would look at me different for the rest of my life. i've just been hurting for such a long time and i'm desperate to get answers about this bc i'm too hung up on it and i likely will continue to be until i come to peace with it. thanks",bipolar,2
c4bd6c38-5ee8-4a8d-b71d-4500cbda12e8,"hi, i have a question about something i have been dealing with...4 years ago a very traumatic event caused ptsd. i wasn't diagnosed until last year, so i didn't know what was going on and tried to put it out of my mind as much as possible. before this i was extremely confident and had no anxiety, loved drama and public speaking and meeting new people, and never felt the typical anxiety before a speech or presentation or whatever else. immediately after this trauma i suddenly started having panic attacks constantly, multiple times a day. then it graduated to a feeling of being extremely tense, anxious and on edge all the time, interspersed with panic attacks. i started to get nervous of being around people because i didn't want them to see the panic attacks and anxiety. that's when the anxiety and panic attacks started getting triggered with social situations or the anticipation of social situations, and the more it kept happening the worse the anxiety got until i was having panic attacks at night knowing i would have to interact with people in the morning. i would cringe remembering having panic attacks in class or in front of people, my voice shaking horribly and everyone staring at me. i developed almost selective mutism, i could speak a bit but not in class where all attention was focused on me, i had someone else appointed to read my work out loud, skipped presentations and forfeited the grade if a professor said i had to present, and could just barely speak in public. i lost all my friends and don't interact with anyone day to day. even knowing i have to go out and get a prescription filled or go to the bank or even make a phone call or send an email fills me with dread weeks ahead of time, and i get panic attacks and dissociate if i go out at all by myself. i wonder if anyone knows if this is known to happen with ptsd. my personality is entirely changed. i had talk therapy but it didn't help, maybe because the therapist only knew me as i am now.",ptsd,4

(hell, i once came across two flights, one was 36 hours long, cost $600, the other was 16 hours long and cost $650. is $50 worth 20 less hours, probably.) europe is lucky to have all of those budget airlines, but while they can be sweet, they will nickel and dime you for everything. they'd charge you for air if they could. - booking hostels directly is nearly always 10-15% cheaper than the booking sites out there, and they will price match. also makes problems infinitely easier to fix. the one downside is you're open to foreign transaction fees, which leads into my next point, which you briefly touched on. - if you're from the united states i highly suggest looking into a charles schwab checking account. makes life easier, and safer so you don't have to pull out the max and walk around with a lot of cash. they will refund you all atm fees and there are no transaction fees for foreign purchases. when you open one they give you a brokerage account, which you don't have to use, and there are no yearly fees on either account.",none,5

e89dfb5b-ed94-40da-b268-c5ad0ea6e5bc,"i have had depression at least since my tween years (like 10-12), and anxiety since my early childhood (4-6), i’m 20 now and it’s evident that neither are going away. (i also identify somewhat strongly with adhd symptoms, which is prevalent in my family, but that has yet to be medically confirmed thanks to doctors being convinced that girl brain is impenetrable to adhd or something. but that’s neither here nor there at this point.) neither my depression nor my anxiety were brought on by something happening to me, but a lot of things have happened since then which have only served to exacerbate the problems. at the end of the day, i feel like my poor mental health has served only to reduce value from my life. it has made me not only less likely to seek out opportunities, but less eligible for them in the first place. when i see other people my age who aren’t mentally ill, the amount of friends they have, hobbies they can keep up with, things they’ve accomplished, i can’t help but be so jealous. in my current (natural) state, it would exhaust me to my core, but i still want it. why couldn’t i have been born with a functional brain and the capacity to actually be willing to take on responsibilities, push myself, *feel* *happy*? i recognize that everyone faces struggles in their lives, but i feel like i never even got to start my life because my brain was made with permanently shitty default settings. i wish i could have been that person with a genuinely well balanced life, who has a lot of friends, keeps up with hobbies, works out, succeeds in school, loves their job. i know i tried to be, but any time i start to get into the territory of any kind of demanding responsibility outside of the home, i feel like i’ve spread myself too thin and i’m a few bad weeks away from a mental health emergency. don’t get me wrong, i do have a few close friends, and most of the time i can get out of bed and take care of myself in the most basic sense, and i recognize that people in the world generally tend to like me because i’m conventionally attractive and i make a joke out of everything. the anxiety forces me to put up a front of a pretty, but slightly frazzled manic pixie dream girl type of personality, but a lot more detriment goes on behind the scenes. it’s like my brain is holding me hostage, and i have to smile for the world and pretend like it doesn’t have a gun against my back. i know it’s possible for people to manage symptoms and lead successful lives, but i feel like i’ve exhausted my resources in terms of tools to improve myself. i have tried too many negative coping mechanisms, self harm, food restriction, jumping into shitty relationships to feel *something*, alcohol, weed, pushing myself to exhaustion because maybe i could just force myself to success (none of this worked, obviously. don’t try it.) then i tried positive coping mechanisms like therapy, yoga/meditation, journaling/mindfulness, medication, quitting medication to focus on my ~natural self~, eating well, straight up pretending to be happy, which is excruciating and also didn’t work. my brain is hard wired for self destruction, and unless there’s some kind of miracle cure i somehow haven’t heard of yet, i doubt i’ll get to where i wish i was. but anyways, people who can just say yes to a new project, or a new chapter in their life, or anything, really, have no idea how much some of us would give to be able to take on even a fraction of that. i’m not lazy, i’m not a faker, i’m a real person with a real illness that prevents me from living the way i wish i could. it sucks.",depression,3

a1836663-7762-4120-8703-f2793d15629e,"hi, reddit! i’m david steadman, and i study the evolution, conservation, and extinction of tropical birds. an overriding theme of my work is to learn how animals survive through time on tropical islands. a high percentage of island species have gone extinct over the last few thousand years, and i’m interested in helping prevent further extinction by looking for clues in fossils that could help us keep the species that we have today. on some islands, we can replace plants and animals that have died out with their closest living relatives to help keep the ecosystem healthy. i work with a lot of different scientists, including biologists, geologists, geographers, archaeologists, and paleontologists. my own training is broad, with a bachelor’s degree in biology from edinboro state college, a master’s in zoology from the university of florida, and a ph.d. in geology from the university of arizona. one of the advantages of working at the florida museum is that scientists here are encouraged to work across many disciplines. so, even though i am a bird expert, i get to study many different kinds of animals, not to mention the plant communities that make up their habitats. for example, we recently found a tortoise fossil in the bahamas that gave us the first sample of ancient dna from an extinct tropical species. the bone chemistry of this extinct tortoise gives us a pretty good idea of what it ate. my work takes me to some pretty neat places: caribbean islands, latin america, africa, australia, and more than 100 islands in the south pacific. i like looking for new fossil sites, exploring poorly-explored places, and looking for birds that are described as rare but might actually be common—we just haven’t looked hard enough! also, i'm one of the authors of the paper discussed here: **i'll be back at noon est to answer your questions- ama!** **hi, everybody, i'm here a bit early and will be answering questions until 1 pm. ama!** **signing off for now, but i'll do my best to get back on around 6 pm and answer a few more questions. this has been fun. thanks for your interest!** **hi, i'm back for a while to answer some more questions the best i can.** **ok, i'm circling the drain. once again, thanks for keeping me on my toes. buenas noches!**",none,5

685f14a3-921f-4aa2-9743-62c2ff52b221,"hi guys. going to try some vitamin supplements to see what improvements may occur. specifically for anxiety i'm going to try a magnesium supplement. it will be the floradix liquid magnesium because i hate tablets personally. i will try different times to take it, as i hear magnesium before bed helps sleep, though taking in the morning/day might help me feel the benefits throughout the day. i will also be trying floradix liquid iron and vitamin formula; in the hopes to aid my issues with fatigue. i think most of my fatigue comes because of anxiety, as it can really tire you out. it contains iron, vitamin b2,b6, b12, and c which are all supposed to aid reduction of fatigue. i'm going to make this a semi experiment and will update here as i progress - maybe it will help others! supplements arriving today, will let you know my first thoughts soon. **edit** *results* day 1 magnesium 250mg - took before getting into bed, fell asleep within half an hour (usually 1+), though highly likely influenced by poor sleep the night previous and busy day) the morning after i felt pretty refreshed, but quite dopey and have felt this way the day so far. again it may be tiredness generally, but anxious? barely at all today, except right now a tad, no matter where my thoughts go my anxiety level is normal. [floradix liquid iron &amp; vit formula; c, thiamin, riboflavin, b6, b12, - taken my am dosage, haven't yet noticed much change but may take a few days doses to see difference. after saying this my stomach got really painful and irritated, i think because of the iron, so the pain invoked anxiety massively. maybe just need to be smarter with taking it closer to eating times. day 2 after yesterdays stomach cramps from the iron supplement, i decided to stop taking it, just couldn't handle it yesterday. also, after taking magnesium for the second day in a row, this brought on some horrible side effects which invoked my anxiety massively and gave me serious worrying problems in my stomach, chest, and brain fog, etc etc. so unfortunately i went to the a&amp;e/er after speaking on the phone to a health line that advised me to do so. i had an ecg and a blood test. i had an electrolyte spike in my heart rate because of the unnecessary magnesium in my system, but the bloods came back fine so i was safe to go home and just rest it off. i feel much better today after a day of resting and its pretty much out of my system now. but **lesson learnt: consult your gp/doctor before attempting supplements, you might just end up overtaking what you do not need and causing yourself more problems.** soon i will go to my doctor to get the ok to take vitamin d, which is something i have had bloods for as being deficient in. i am only just discovering its connection with anxiety/depression and other similar issues i have had. i am *no longer* going to start trying different supplements to see what works unless its naturally through my foods, which greatly dilutes the effects and side effects. end of thread. until i begin vit d supplement.",anxiety,1

0f16be25-4723-4d9c-81af-df3f0b0f8dc8,"i'm bipolar and add, and have been receiving treatment for a whole two years now. yay. still working on finding that magical treatment that will make me a normal functioning human being, but for now, i'm mostly able to do life things. mostly. anyway, i'm on lamictal, just got bumped up to 250mg, and i take 30 mg of prozac, as well as 10-30 mg of ritalin, depending on the day. i'm turning 21 this month, and decided it would probably be prudent to ask my psychiatrist whether it would be safe to mix alcohol with my medication. wouldn't want to have any weird side effects while drinking, right? she essentially went off on this weird sort of doomsday rant that because i was on lamictal, an anti-seizure medication, i would most likely have a seizure if i drank. she kept saying a lot about how bad it was, and how it wasn't worth the risk at all, and i'd be much better just never touching alcohol, ever, because i'd probably most likely definitely would have a seizure. it was all very doom and gloom. now, i've never had a seizure in my life, and have done many stupid things around lamictal before. i had a bad doctor about a year and a half ago who refused to return my calls and emails, leaving me without lamictal for a good two months, and i had to cold turkey it once my medication ran out. i was told later by a different doctor that that was one of the worst things to do, because i could have gotten the stevens-johnson syndrome and died. she was pretty doom and gloom, too, about lamictal. this summer, i visited a different country that had lower age restrictions on alcohol, and i did in fact drink one night and get drunk the next, just for fun. i had no ill effects, that i could tell, though i did apparently wake back up and go do some weird blackout drunk shit (i said something weird to my mother, like ""i have to feed the dog,"" while fiddling with my luggage). i don't remember that part, which is a little frightening for me. lesson learned, don't get blackout drunk. i told my doctor about this, and she said that i got lucky, and that it was an exception, like i shouldn't even look at it as lowering my chances for this seizure i'm obviously going to have if i sniff a margarita. however, i see a lot of you mentioning drinking, while not always in the healthiest sense, and i never really hear much about seizures on this subreddit. my question is, do you think that i'm like, a super-seizure danger if alcohol and i are in the same room? i honestly don't think so, but if i talk to my therapist about it, she'll go talk to my psychiatrist, and then i get another doom and gloom lecture. i'm not planning on going on a bender as soon as i turn 21, but it'd be nice to be able to go and get a drink or two on friday nights. if i'm basing off of that one night i actually got drunk, and the night before, when i also drank, i have a relatively high alcohol tolerance that will keep me from getting too drunk off of one or two shots. anyway, thank you for reading this far through my ranting and sidetracking, i really appreciate any advice. i don't want to have to turn into some sort of anti-alcohol gal, but i'm not exactly intending to go off getting wasted every night. tldr: can you drink while on lamictal, and not have seizures?",bipolar,2

1ba2c88d-a4b7-4d7b-ac79-a48efecc13f2,"should i go and officially confront him now that he doesn't have a ski-mask on his face? i'm pretty positive it was one of the maintenance guys at my apartment. it was almost 11 pm at night and i was awoken by a noise, i heard a bunch of rustling but assumed my boyfriend was getting home from work and just took an uber (seeing at how i fell asleep and was supposed to pick him up at 10:30) then the rustling was excessive and unusual but i assured myself he'd be walking by my daughter's door any moment. i fell asleep in my daughter's room with her and we had her bedroom door wide open. still groggy, i stared at the doorway knowing i'd see him in a matter of seconds but instead i saw a figure creep by slowly that was much shorter than my boyfriend and much slimmer + he didn't have the very noticeable 'fro that my boyfriend has. it looked as if he was trying to see if anyone was there, or as if he was headed to our master bedroom. i immediately said ""hello?"" because i wasn't quite sure what was going on but i knew it wasn't him. the person immediately flickered the light switch in my daughter's room but must have second guessed that action simultaneously, realizing i'd see him and he didn't know where i was. he just said, ""give me your money."" i immediately sat up and said, ""okay, just give me a minute."" ""give me your money."" ""i'm sorry i don't carry cash on me, but you can take what you want."" ""give me the money!"" he said a with a little aggression. ""i promise you i don't have any cash, you can have my cards, you can take whatever you want, just please don't do anything to me. my daughter is right here. please don't do anything to me."" and by this point, i was bawling. the entire time during the conversation he stayed behind the wall but had his head peeked into the doorway. he paused as if he was thinking of what to do next and said: ""i won't do anything to you, but i have to take something."" and just proceeded back into my living room where i could hear him rustling again. i assumed he took one of my boyfriend’s consoles (all of our electronics were sitting there in the living room) i was so frozen i didn't want to move or make any sudden movements in case he came back to her door. i just simply wanted him gone. i immediately started texting my boyfriend to call the cops because we were getting broken into. after a minute i called myself. i didn't want to risk him not getting my texts in time, and i just knew i had to get someone there as soon as i could. i have no idea when he actually left but i know he couldn't have been there any longer than a minute or so, because i waited till i didn't hear any more noise from the living room before i called 911. all i could hear was the crickets from outside (assuming he just left my door open) cops arrived and we looked through the living room, but nothing seemed touched, my purse was even sitting in the same place on the couch, in plain sight (granted all the lights stayed off during the incident, i have a bright basketball court across the street that illuminates the room and nightlights around the house). i simply figured he would've gone for way more things and it was surreal how nothing was moved. after about 5-10 minutes that's when the cops asked about my missing desktop from our desk and it clicked for me, he took my laptop and a/c adapter off the couch. i didn’t get to see his face due to the darkness, and he was wearing a ski-mask. he had on a hoody and jeans which i could at least see from his silhouette/night light in the hall next to where he was standing. i mentioned, in the beginning, i think it was one of our maintenance guys only because two of them were in my house not even 5 hours prior and knew my front door was extremely flimsy/not secured. the one maintenance guy i think it is had the exact same stature as the burglar, was the one banging on my flimsy door hours earlier and since then has not been able to look me in my eye the two times i've made it a point to say hi and ask how his day was (to get a feel of him). when he was in my house helping the other guy with the work order he was very quiet, only said two things during the 30 minute visit, while the other guy was very chatty/shared his experience and what his goals were for the complex (we just literally got new management two days prior to the break-in) at the time i thought he was just shy or a quiet person (i can empathize) but now that this happened i feel like he was scoping out my apartment and had a sketchy/odd demeanor. i am trying to give him the benefit of the doubt and just not be in my head, but it’s the only thing that logically makes sense right now. i live on the 3rd floor and don't really know anyone out here like that, plus i've lived here for 3 years and nothing like this has ever happened. the cops suspect i was targeted, and although i live right in the front of the complex, across from the leasing office, i'm on the 3rd floor, that seems out of the way for a random break-in. the biggest thing that’s holding me back from being at peace and not so anxious to be in my home alone is what was his motive (besides the obvious)? why me, of all people? why didn’t he just grab the shit he wanted from the living room and leave, why did he creep down my hall? i’m glad he didn’t hurt us and just stole a laptop, but what do i do if it happens again, may it be him or someone else? what if we don’t get so lucky next time? the office replaced my door frame (since he broke in using his shoulder, the cops suspect) and i now have three new locks and will be buying a reasonably priced alarm i can put on my door. should i just go to the guy i suspect it is and let him know i know and demand he give me back my laptop or i’ll turn him in? what should i do, if you were me?",anxiety,1

it is factually correct to say that dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are the same molecule, because they share the same atoms in the same structure. **but since they do not share the same molecular shape, they produce different therapeutic and physiological effects.** from the (well-cited) [wikipedia (emphasis added): &gt; dextroamphetamine (the dextrorotary enantiomer) and levoamphetamine (the levorotary enantiomer) have identical pharmacodynamics, but their binding affinities to their biomolecular targets vary. dextroamphetamine is a more potent agonist of taar1 than levoamphetamine. consequently, **dextroamphetamine produces roughly three to four times more central nervous system (cns) stimulation than levoamphetamine; however, levoamphetamine has slightly greater cardiovascular and peripheral effects.**^^ a bit [further &gt; the half-life of amphetamine enantiomers differ and vary with urine ph. at normal urine ph, the half-lives of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are 9–11 hours and 11–14 hours, respectively. highly acidic urine will reduce the enantiomer half-lives to 7 hours; highly alkaline urine will increase the half-lives up to 34 hours. **what have we learned so far?** * amphetamine comes in two mirror-image ""versions"" * adderall combines both versions in a 3:1 ratio * dextroamphetamine is more potent but has a shorter half-life than levoamphetamine (""active lifespan"" in your body) * levoamphetamine is less potent but last longer, and has a different overall effect profile than dextroamphetamine ## vyvanse **vyvanse is an inactive prodrug called [lisdexamfetamine it contains 100% dextroamphetamine and 0% levoamphetamine.** vyvanse takes a dextroamphetamine molecule and attaches an l-lysine molecule, which makes it totally inactive at first. as vyvanse is absorbed into your bloodstream, your cells ""break off"" the l-lysine from the dextroamphetamine molecule, which ""activates"" it. **this process of breaking off the l-lysine takes time, which is what gives vyvanse its unique time-release property.** from what i can tell, this is the *only* unique thing about vyvanse: it uses on our bodies' natural metabolism to trickle in active dextroamphetamine over time. this is helpful to prevent abuse, because vyvanse's effects are not dependent on the means of administration. put another way, vyvanse will trickle into your bloodstream at the same rate, no matter how it first gets into your body. ## other formulations of amphetamine see a [table comparing the various formulations of * adderall / mydayis / adzenys / dyanavel: 75% dextroamphetamine; 25% levoamphetamine (3:1) * evekeo: 50% dextroamphetamine and 50% levoamphetamine (1:1) * dexedrine / procentra / zenzedi / vyvanse: 100% dextroamphetamine; 0% levoamphetamine (1:0) **if you do well on vyvanse but poorly on adderall, and you can't afford vyvanse, ask your provider about generic dexedrine instead. they contain the exact same active ingredient.** ## about me i'm a guy with adhd working through my treatment plan, and i want to help others do the same. i'm a nerd on the internet doing research. i'm not a doctor, pharmacist, or psychiatrist. if you can offer factual corrections to any of the above, please let me know. **don't trust anything i say outright.** follow the links and do your own research. read the entire fold-out sheet of prescribing information for whatever medications you take (for adhd or otherwise!). i wish you all the very best!",adhd,0

(sure, use “independence day” story line as an example!) the wisest line of action would probably be to try to scrutinise and understand this piece of technology in as much detail as possible (yes, just like in the movie!). probably, the hottest question would be on the origins of such innovation and how it was pieced together. you would take it apart and rebuilt it again. science fiction aside, spoken language is such an innovation! yet, we take it for granted, oblivious that it underlines all our relationships and societal structures. even science has struggled with the origin of speech and a quasi-mythical aura persists in many lines of thought. understanding throughly great ape communication systems provides us a framework to reconstruct the first stages of speech evolution. by studying and protecting our closest living relatives in their natural environment and in enriching zoo facilities, i envisage that we will be able to reconstruct and theoretically piece back together this unparalleled innovation that defines our species! ========= hello everyone, it has been an absolute pleasure to read your questions and to brainstorm about familiar topics on spoken language evolution but from angles that i had not considered before. thank you so much for your interest in our research! please stay tuned, we have several papers in the pipeline that will hopefully come out soon and that i am sure many of you will enjoy reading! all the best, adriano",none,5

18fb7d71-ea71-43f4-bf8e-9b4c669cb329,"so i just found this sub, and i thought i would share my story! i don't really know the rules but i think this qualifies to post here! it all started about a year ago. i was almost done with my first year of college. since i was a little kid, my neighbor had an old volkswagen bus parked on his land. every kid that lived on my road tried to buy it when they turned 15 for their first car. fast forward to last february... my neighbor was retiring and selling all of his junk. my time was now. i went over to ask him if he'd sell the vw... i had $1500 in my pocket and was prepared to offer it to him. now this thing was rough... it hadn't been moved in 30 years, was was rusted all over, and was sunken into the ground so far that we had to dig it out with a skid steer. i asked him what he wanted for her... ""is $200 too much?"" nope. $200 is fine. shut up and take my money... i was now the proud owner of a [1969 volkswagen fast forward again.... after a new $300 vw engine and some misc used interior parts i got from a vw scrap yard, i was on my way. my girlfriend at the time and i had planned to take the bus to colorado to go and see the avett brothers at red rocks. well, she broke up with me the week before... and i was pretty bummed as we had been dating for awhile... i considered not going to the concert, and just moping around at home. but, i already had the tickets and the time off from work, so i decided to say ""screw it, i'm going alone."" so i left... i got in my bus, grabbed my tickets, and got on the road. i had no idea that this trip would help me grow as a person so much. a three day trip would turn into a two week trip that i would never forget. the concert was great! i met a girl from the netherlands on couchsurfing and we went together! she was a foreign exchange student exploring the states before she had to fly back. she was traveling all across the country alone...hitchhiking! i am still amazed by that. well, at red rocks, i treated her to her first [philly cheese steak we parted ways after the show.. she had actually randomly found some friends that she had gone to school with in canada at the concert and took off with them! so i was on my own.. i drove up to the colorado rocky mountains and made camp in the first place i found. my adventure would really begin the next day. i awoke to the fresh mountain air and to a very cold vw bus... if you're at all familiar with vws, you'll know they don't offer much in the way of heat. i decided to go to one of my favorite places in the world, boulder, colorado. i spent the afternoon exploring pearl street, and i [made a new i decided to go and explore boulder canyon... i drove up the steep winding road, and came upon a town called nederland! i was searching for an alleged camp spot that i had heard about, that was supposedly nestled on the other side of the flatirons and offered a really amazing view. i continued driving through nederland. i visited the [worlds largest operational steam [found more and on the outside of this tiny town i picked up two hitchhikers. their names were carlos, and juan carlos, and they were just traveling around from mexico! i gave them a lift, about two miles up the road to where they were camping. they asked me if i wanted to make camp with them, but i was still in search of the famed camp spot i had heard of. they told me if i changed my mind that they would be down the road. well, i consulted my map, i ended up getting lost, and taking a pretty rough dirt road all the way back around the mountain and down into boulder... so, i went back up the road to nederland, realizing i wouldn't find my spot, and i decided to go camp with the mexicans. this is where it gets interesting.....i arrived at the road where i dropped them off, and just started to drive.. i followed the road for several miles, signs promising campsites ahead. i took a gamble and turned at a side road, and man oh man, i had no idea what i had just gotten myself into... a hippie camp, and i was in a hippie van... several hippies ran towards me, yelling ""bus driver, bus driver, pull over!"" i stopped... their leader, a man who called himself ""spongey,"" who lived in a school bus that he had named sparky and ate only grilled cheese sandwiches, approached me and asked if i needed a place to make camp... [i accepted, and pulled up and parked next to the old short several other travelers had made camp there, and later, a kid about my age who was traveling around the country in his mitsubishi evo pulled up to camp and joined us... this was the most interesting night of my life. we were sitting around a camp fire, late at night, singing songs around the fire, and being a typical hippie commune. a sheriff approached us. now the first thing that freaked me out was the sheriff's accent. he was irish... an irish sheriff in colorado!? he asked us if we had seen a woman named samantha walking around with her german shepard... it was the middle of the night, she was not all there (mentally), and had run off into the middle of the woods, and they were worried for her safety. we said we would keep an eye out and he left. at that point, i was slightly sketched out (crazy lady running around in the woods with a killer dog? yeah, no thanks) i retired to my bus, locked the doors, folded out the bed and fell asleep. i woke up pretty early, made some breakfast, and said goodbye to my friends. for the next few days, i explored the wonderful mountains and camped in solitude. i became really self reliant, and it was really really awesome to be out of service and totally disconnected for a few days. [this was my home during that i decided it was time to go back to civilization (i was also out of pancake mix and had to restock... pancakes were a staple in my diet... you'd be surprised how many different ways you can eat pancakes.) i headed back down, and decided i should probably start making my way back north, towards home... now, i could of just gone straight home, and been there that evening, but i felt that my adventure was not ready to be over. i took an old highway and headed to the famous teton mountains in wyoming. it was a grueling 11 hour drive, and i got to jackson around 11pm. i spent another few hours driving to different campsites seeing if there was any open spots.. nope, things were looking pretty bleak. this is where my bus saved me. my vw has grateful dead paint all over it, as her previous owner had followed the dead in her pretty much all throughout the 70s and early 80s. i lucked out, because this dude who was a huge dead fan saw me driving around. it just so happened he worked with the student conservation organization, and he was due to have a ton of campers show up tomorrow to do trail maintenance around the national parks, and he had 3 reserved camp spots that were currently vacant. he was nice enough to let me stay as long as i would be gone in the morning. i traded him some bratwursts that we cooked over the fire, and two peacock feathers (my trade item of choice...you can get anything you want with peacock feathers). we talked for a good hour, took my bus for a drive around the campground (he really wanted to drive it so, we went for a short cruise!), and then we went to bed. i got up pretty early the next morning, packed up, and headed back to jackson. i had heard that there was a place that you could get a $5 shower, so i decided to pay them a visit. i took my shower, parked in the parking lot to cook breakfast (pancakes of course), and then it happened. [my volkswagen fell in sadly, i had to yank her away from her new boyfriend, and we continued on the road. [we stopped to see the drove through yellowstone, and finally headed towards our native big horn mountains to get to home. this final day was my favorite day. although it was not filled with much more than driving, there was a lot of time to think, and to be alive. [this picture pretty much sums it at the end of my adventure, i was no longer heartbroken, i no longer doubted anything in the world, and i had a new perspective, and a clarity which i never before experienced. if you are thinking about taking the trip, do it. it is the best thing that ever happened to me. i am departing for another, longer trip this summer. i hope i didn't bore you with my adventure, i just felt that i should share it, and i hope some of you enjoyed it. until then, safe travels friends, and we'll see you on the road. with love, [spencer and edit: i've had some requests for [pictures of the and also, just for fun, here are some pictures that the original owner sent me of the bus [from the",none,5

(hint to dumbass senior mangement: don't write down the evidence of screwing someone over in an official document that has to be handled by the person the document is about. like i said, *dumbasses*). i did the analysis, and on financial and economic terms, i am not making the same level of income i did in 1989 in terms of real dollars. so i haven't even managed to break goddamn even. i've gone fucking backwards. so when that fucking douchebag doctor making his millions every fucking year, more in one year than my entire goddamn lifetime, says stupid shit like the usual hollow, positive things ""it gets better"", ""hang in there"", ""don't give up"", ""pray (&lt;--the worst and most useless)"", it makes me just want to shit fire. that asswipe, and all of them like him, don't have a goddamn clue what it's like. on their worse day ever, they've still done more than i ever will. i mean, when a homeless guy has a girlfriend or wife, and i couldn't get laid in a whorehouse with a fistfull of $100 bills and pot, i'd say the contest is clearly callable. no, i don't need goddamn therapy. therapy is nothing more than some overpaid fuck taking shitloads of money for the sole right to try and mind fuck me into believing shit isn't shit. well, shit is always shit. rolling shit in powdered sugar doesn't make shit a jelly fucking donut. i'm not depressed for depressed's sake. i don't have a gorgeous wife of 30+ years, or anything close. i don't have kids. i don't have any family. i don't have success, money, or possessions or anything like that. i don't have friends, i don't have things to do or enjoy (they all take money). i just wake up, shower, work for nothing, shit, sleep, and permanently repeat. i'm mad as fucking white hell and i have been for a long time. here's the therapy i need: a rewind on life, with things that work out and not emotionally crush my spirit and will. enough money to be able to be a viable option for someone that isn't a coke-riddled road whore. enough accomplishment to give myself a sense of pride instead of failure to stoke shame and embarrassment. and given that the rewind on life isn't possible, and at my age, even if someone got knocked up by me (ha-right), i'd likely croak before the thing was born. so i'd take even just the last one. so i told the asswipe: ""y'know what'd make me have a better disposition? elizabeth hurley pulling up the driveway in a new ferrari to take me on vacation in monaco"". but as the old saying goes, ""shit on one hand, wish in the other, and watch which one fills up first"". thus endeth the rant.",depression,3

life, everyday waking up to this existence is a nightmare. i never would have thought that my life would turn out like this, but it did. i had a relatively decent stretch of teenage years, there were minor bluffs, i was always the odd kid in the group, a natural introvert. my mother (single parent) also had a rough couple of years after the passing of my grandmother in 2013. she was an educated professional from the former eastern block (teacher) who could barely find a job in canada that matched her credentials. her relationships failed, her career ambitions crumbled, and on top of that i was a shitty teenage son who gave her daily problems, (stealing money, rebellious behaviour, staying out late, fighting etc). **september 2016** i had just started my final year of highschool. i was looking forward to a smooth 2 semesters and i would finally be free, free to start my own path in life. my mother continued to wallow in depression, she had become a ""born again christian,"" her sudden conversion to orthodox christianity seemed normal to me at the time, i didn't think much of it. as days passed she continued her existence of sending off a dozen resumes each day (with no response); praying for hours on end for shit to change; until one day the praying stopped. i had frequently seen her in her room visiting fringe ultra orthodox websites, but again i didn't think much of it. she started talking on the phone with various ""faith healers"" and ""monks"" who were affiliated with mt athos (or so she thought). one day she pondered the question to me of her becoming a ""nun"" when i went off to college, i told her if that's what she wants to do with her life so be it. little did i know that the phone calls she had been receiving from the so called ""monks"" had convinced her to drop everything and leave the country to join their ""brotherhood."" i came home from classes one day and she asked me if i would be comfortable moving to russia and finishing my schooling there. i thought it over, the chance of a fresh start, but i never took her seriously. **the plane tickets** an average weekend grocery run, my mom convinced me to come along with her. after loading up the car and getting in the passenger seat she pulled 2 plane tickets out of her purse and said that we would be leaving in a week. i immediately knew something was up, but she was convinced and there was nothing i could do to stop her. in the back of my head there was a faint belief that she would just go off and join a nunnery, and that i would enroll in university and live the rest of my days in eastern europe. nevertheless i wasn't going to let my mother run off to europe alone, the whole situation just felt strange from the get-go. **the week prior to departure** i stopped showing up to classes as i didn't see the point, i sat at home gaming, smoking whole packs of cigarettes/day, slamming vodka, i really didn't care anymore. my mom would be in her room on skype calls with various shady entities who were praising her decision for leaving the country. after a few days we ditched everything, the home, the car, my ""friends"". i didn't care, in my mind i wasn't losing a goddamn thing. **october 2016** our plane landed in athens, and from there we took a flight to crete landing in heraklion. it was late at night, we were met by an suv full of men with long beards in long black religious garments. they loaded our baggage in the car and quickly dropped us off at a cheap hotel a couple blocks away, saying that they would pick us up in the morning. upon my first meeting with them i immediately knew something was off, they seemed in a hurry to get us both out of public view, they looked visibly shook. the following morning they woke us up with loud knocks on our doors and told us to get dressed and get our luggage we were being moved. we drove probably 100km south to the other side of the island. they set us up in another cheap hotel near the beach. before leaving the head guy(bishop) gave us sim cards to replace in our cellphones so that he could contact us. that night my mom spilled the beans, she told me that they had convinced her that the world was ending in november and that she was trying to save me from the apocalypse. basically she believed that ww3 would occur, and christ would return with a new russian tsar to retake constantinople. yeah....... i immediately knew what was going on, it was a doomsday cult, i knew she was crazy but i played along. we were already there and she was brainwashed there was really nothing i could do. **summary of the following few months** -we would wake up at 5am and they would pick us up and drive us to their hideout in the mountains, it would last 5-6hrs until then they would make my mother prepare food and make me do some form of manual labour ie-build them a driveway from stone, clear shrubs, collect firewood, all while fasting on an empty stomach. -every night my i would try to convince my mother to leave, she didn't budge. at times i had a plan to ditch my mom, rob her of a couple thousand euros and hitch a flight to athens where i would report the whole fiasco to the canadian embassy. i couldn't just ditch my mother with those people. **their intentions** they planned on separating me and my mother, they wanted to send her to tver region in russia to their ""religious retreat."" one of the guys there posing as a monk was an ex-merc in hiding from eastern ukraine. he was an mp, he bragged about his actions of executing people in sloviansk, etc. he told me that he knew the higher ups in the dpr, he met ""motorolla"" (a commander in the donetsk pr) he showed me photos on his cell of him in uniform. they wanted to send me to novorossiya to fight. in total they probably managed to suck out $5000 of my moms cash for various ""religious ventures."" **how they received their funding** they had some sort of online donation thing set up, they also had a shop which sold ""blessed herbal remedies"" (claimed to cure everything) i remember sitting in the car overhearing how the main guy was telling a terminally ill cancer patient in russian to just keep consuming the ""blessed tea"" and pray harder. i was disgusted, but kept my mouth shut. they also had a large following (in the hundreds) which would occasionally visit them and give them money. (women would take off their wedding rings at his request). the ""pilgrims"" were forced to destroy any biometric documentation that they might have as it was seen as ""the mark of the beast."" i remember seeing a man and a woman burn their passport to appease the guy. **how i managed to get out of there** i was collecting dirt on all of them. i found out from the hotel owner where we were staying that the head (bishop) would occasional rent out a room with a woman who frequently visited him on the guise of ""confession."" along with the herbal remedy bullshit, and the date of the so called ""apocalypse"" being moved every other week, i finally managed to convince my mother that these people were scum. after missing ""mass"" 2 days in a row under the guise of being sick, they called my mother on the phone saying that they were departing to thessaloniki and were coming to pick us up. i called a cab, we got to heraklion, stayed a night in a hotel and got the next flight out to athens. **back in canada** we came back to a dark home with no power or heating in mid january. the fridge had been full of food that had rotted and sent a stench of mold throughout the entire home. the next couple of weeks, i got my part-time job back, started going back to school, we got the utilities up and running, and decided that the only way we could get money is by selling the home. **life got better, but not for long** we sold the house, and got a nice 2 bedroom rental (where i'm still currently living). my mom got a new car as the other one had been apparently stolen (we called all the impound yards in toronto with the vin with no results). and my mother finally managed to get a job, life was getting better, sure i missed a semester, but i was still going to graduate on time. **suddenly cancer** my mom's boss called me one day while i was in classes saying that my mom had been taken to the hospital in an ambulance due to her headaches. (she had been complaining about headaches for the previous couple of weeks, even visited doctors). the doctor had diagnosed her with a pinched nerve, but upon ct examination by the doctor they day of her being taken by ambulance, it was revealed that she had multiple brain tumors. the cancer was stage 4, i was in shock, i didn't know what to do. the next following weeks i took care of her at home with the assistance of nurses and social workers who would stop by and help out, i watched her deteriorate into the mental state of a small child. she went blind and started assuming that i was her father. i was just dead inside. eventually i couldn't take care of her anymore, she was moved to a hospice where she died a week later. **the next following months** i wasn't in school, the small amount of $$ my mother left me i was burning daily in a cycle of self destruction, abusing drugs, drinking, smoking. until in the end of june i began to experience headaches, i immediately quit everything cold turkey, but the headaches didn't stop (i still have them). i was paranoid and i visited 3 doctors until one reluctantly agreed to a ct scan. (i figured that with my luck anything was possible). the ct scan came back normal. **the present** i'm working 40hrs a week minimum wage at a dead end job, i can't sleep most nights, i have constant flashbacks some good, some bad. i'm totally alone, i had a fear of death before but now i realise it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. i've accepted my ""existence"" and am completely depressed. i never thought my life would end up like this. **tldr** **got out of a cult with my mom, only to have her die of cancer a couple weeks later**",depression,3

a2bd644e-d510-49df-8703-99b0ea984e57,"i thought i would post about my experience with neurofeedback in treating depression and anxiety. a little background, i've always had underlying depression and anxiety, but didn't start dealing with it until about 4 years ago when i kept having issues getting to work and having panic attacks. my social life suffered too, pushed away a lot of friends in that time, wanted to be alone yet i was lonely. i've done therapy (still do), tried several different medications, and had my ups and downs with my symptoms, but earlier this year, things got bad. i missed work several times, was very hopeless about the future. i even looked into going on disability just to not have to deal with anything anymore. at least that's the short story. my therapist had just hired a person that specialized in neurofeedback treatment and she recommended i try it since i was struggling so much. i got more information on it and decided give it a try, i was desperate. the way i understand it, they match these sound waves to match the frequencies of your brain, then they adjust the frequencies to ""calm"" your mind. overtime, your brain responds to this and changes. i would ruminate a lot, and get emotional about it, panic...well this like slows down the rumination. this treatment is used for other mental conditions like adhd and addiction (which i also have issues with). i can't remember the exact type i did, but i believe it is a slow wave form, perhaps infra-low frequency neurofeedback. at the beginning of each session, not sure if this common though, i would do some slow breathing first and practice breathing deep. then, she (my specialist) connected these electrodes to my head, and she put a movie on and played these sound waves that respond to your brain patterns. the movie is just to occupy your time, each session was 30 min. my specialists would ask me questions about how i was feeling and adjusted some things (the frequencies?) to tailor it to my needs. i had some weird effects early on, like i would feel itchy sometimes, or i could feel pressure in my head. but after a couple of weeks i was starting to feel better. like, while i still wasn't happy with some things in my life, my anxiety decreased drastically. i started it in february and by may my outlook on life was changing, i was more optimistic and didn't dread the future as much. i have concluded my treatment for now (august), but i am a changed person. i haven't had a panic attack in a long time. i am more social, and i am actually looking forward to work. if i do get down or worried it usually has to do with my missing a dose of my medication (viibryd). i haven't even taken a xanax in months. i wanted to post this as a recommendation for those who are struggling. if i could be a commercial for this i would lol. i can't believe that it worked for me. your brain can change! with anxiety and depression it's like the wiring in your head is just messed up, this like tunes it back up. i see a lot of posts that remind me of myself on here (or perhaps my ""old self"") and wanted to share this in case it could help anyone out there. of course, naturally i do worry that it won't ""stick"", but according to the research, it should, but i can go in for a ""booster"" if i need to. my insurance covered it, i had to do it twice a week at first, then dropped to once towards the end. talk to your therapist or doctor and see if you can find a specialist in your area. tl/dr- neurofeedback saved me from the grips of depression and anxiety, it ""calms"" your brain down. i hope it can help you too. talk to your doc or therapist about it. if you have questions, i'll try my best to answer them. take care everyone!",anxiety,1

f893595e-d522-4cd2-9a28-9ad96f122f3e,"i don't know if this is the right place to post about this, but i figured someone here might understand or relate to what i'm going through so it seemed like a good place to vent. this is probably going to end up being very very long. context: i'm 29 years old, and was diagnosed with type ii bipolar disorder about four years ago. prior to that, i had been misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder for about nine years. --- after graduating high school, i attended an out of state college about 5 hours from home, and had a really hard time adjusting during my first semester. feeling so lonely and like i wasn't able to make friends triggered a mild depressive episode - i wasn't suicidal, but self-harmed pretty regularly. i wasn't eating well and cried a lot, but stuck it out. eventually, i got to know a girl in my degree program named liz (not her real name). liz was more outgoing than i was, so being friends with her helped me get to know other people in our classes. we had most of our classes together, hung out all the time, built a solid circle of friends, and became very close. one day, liz opened up to me about her struggles with depression and self-harm, and i shared my own experiences with her. that was a major bonding experience for us, and after that we were practically inseparable. sophomore year, we moved into an off campus apartment with another friend of ours. that was a pretty good year. i came out of my depressive episode and was mostly stable for a little bit, even though i wasn't seeing a therapist or taking any medication at that point. at some point towards the end of the year i started dating a guy - i can't remember when exactly that happened in this series of events, but he's important to mention. towards the end of sophomore year, a friend of mind from high school passed away after a long battle with cancer. that was really hard for me to process. i started seeing a campus therapist, and dealt with it as best i could. the year ended, and we went home for the summer. over the summer, an acquaintance from our degree program committed suicide. i was never that close to him, but we had classes together and he ran in my general circle of friends. losing two people so tragically back-to-back like that was awful, and i was definitely teetering on the edge of another episode. we returned to school for junior year - our third roommate from sophomore year moved out, and two other girls moved in. i lost my virginity to the guy i had been dating. the next day, he called me to let me know he had been hooking up with another girl for a while and wanted to break up. i felt used and worthless, and while i probably could have moved past that at any other time, dealing with that right after the death of two friends was too much, and i snapped. in retrospect, i fell into what was probably my first mixed episode. i was suicidal, barely slept, cried all the time, and did a lot of weird shit that i'm not proud of. i showed up at my ex's apartment unannounced and screamed at him on his front porch. at one point, i broke into his apartment when nobody was home and texted him to let him know i was going to kill myself in his room. he told me he was going to call the cops, so i left. honestly, i'm shocked that he didn't call the cops anyway. there's a lot more, but i'll just sum it up by saying that i was really self destructive and scared a lot of people. i started seeing a therapist, and it got me through that first semester. i went home for winter break that year, and developed a plan to kill myself. i told my ex about it, who told liz, who told my parents. i ended up in the local psychiatric ward for three days, and after i was released, spent the rest of my winter break in an outpatient program. i went back to school for second semester, which i know seems questionable, but honestly was the best thing for me - i'm a perfectionist, and my doctors realized that missing a semester and falling behind would have made me feel like a failure, and probably would have made me spiral into an even worse place. so, i went back to school. i can't remember how much time passed, but it wasn't very long before liz and our two other roommates decided that they didn't feel safe around me, and kicked me out of the apartment. (a side note: one of our other roommates had spent a few days in the local psychiatric ward the previous semester, and we all dealt with it and supported her as best we could. when i brought this up, i was told it was different because she ""didn't actually attempt suicide"". um, fuck you, neither did i.) anyway. liz's mom paid for the three of them to stay in a local hotel while i packed up all my stuff and moved out. i didn't have anywhere to stay, so i went home and missed a week of classes while i got stuff sorted out. somehow, i managed to get dorm housing even though it was the middle of the semester. i moved into a suite-style dorm with three girls i didn't know, and basically hid in my room and powered through the end of the semester. i'm shocked that losing my best friend and core support system didn't push me to an actual suicide attempt, but i think i was just so angry that i wanted to finish school just to spite her. i can't even describe how horrible this felt. the one person i thought i could confide in - who i thought understood my perspective because she had also struggled with depression - felt i was too scary to deal with and left me on my own. i felt like i must be a monster. thankfully, the rest of our circle of friends saw that she abandoned me when i was super vulnerable and realized how fucked up it was. a few people that i wasn't very close to reached out to me, and were an amazing support system for the rest of my time in college. i'm so grateful for everything they did for me, and they are a huge reason i managed to survive that part of my life. i'll admit that i kept fucking up and being scary right after liz kicked me out. i would get really drunk and leave her voicemails calling her a bitch, and sent a lot of text messages that said creepy and mean stuff (plus a lot of depressing song lyrics). my friends convinced me to delete her number so i wouldn't be tempted to do that anymore, and that was that. senior year: i moved into an off-campus apartment with a friend. i was in individual therapy and group therapy, and seeing a campus psychiatrist who tried (and failed) to find a medication regime that worked for me. i wasn't in great shape, but i was surviving, you know? then, one day, the cops showed up. apparently liz had started receiving some creepy phone calls, and decided that i was stalking and harassing her. i still don't know who was responsible for that, but it sure wasn't me. thankfully the officer assigned to the case had experience working with depressed and suicidal people (he volunteered for a suicide hotline in his spare time), so after hearing my side of the story and talking to my therapist, he believed that i wasn't involved and the whole thing was dropped. moving on. i graduated and moved away. i was still in bad shape for a long time, but things got sorted out when i finally got the right diagnosis (bipolar ii). i found a therapist that i like, i'm on meds that work for me, and in the last year or two i'm actually, truly stable and happy for the first time in my life. so that brings me to last weekend. (i know, i know, finally! thanks for sticking with me.) i was browsing reddit, and whose face pops up on my front page? fucking liz, of all people. she posted a picture of herself to a subreddit i follow, and it got popular enough that it was on my front page. at first, i wasn't even 100% sure it was her. i mean, i haven't seen her in around eight years - plus, in the whole entire internet, i'm sure there are people who look like her out there. so, i made the horrible mistake of reading through her post history to see if it was actually her. and wouldn't you know it? i found all kinds of recent comments and posts about her unhinged college roommate who went crazy and stalked her. seeing her face out of nowhere, and in such an unexpected place, was a huge punch to the gut. on top of that, reading what she still thinks of me gave me a horrible flashback to feeling like a terrifying monster that nobody could handle being around. no matter how stable or happy i ever get, i feel like i'll never really be able to work through that feeling of abandonment. i'm so scared that everything i've worked towards and accomplished since then is going to crumble into dust sooner or later. if you've made it this far, i really appreciate it. i needed to vent to someone who understands - my boyfriend let me cry it out and is so amazingly supportive, but he's never seen me at my most unstable and i know he doesn't really know what it's like to deal with this. i didn't want to post to r/offmychest or anything big like that, since there's the possibility of her finding it. i assume she doesn't subscribe to this subreddit, so it felt safe. i'm so glad that an online community exists where we can open up to people who understand.",bipolar,2

72f1a7a1-126e-40e4-9dbb-0fb6a6f84708,"i have long held a fascination for how ancient cultures tried to describe concepts they couldn’t yet scientifically grasp through myth and how those mythos affected the development of human culture. hellenism (ancient greek religion, actually still practiced btw) in particular has held a special place in my heart since i was very little. recently i was looking more into athena. most commonly known as the goddess of war, specifically the wisdom of battle strategy and taking up arms in defense of one’s home, unlike ares who loved bloody war for wars sake. she was also however the patron deity of “arts and crafts”. one of her most famous myths is the one where the skilled but vain human weaver arachne dared say she could out weave the wise athena, who (in the myths) was the one who invented weaving in the first place and *gifted* that knowledge to mankind. of course for this arachne was turned into a spider and forced to “weave” silk webs forever. we must remember that in ancient times, arts and crafts weren’t a childhood pastime but entire professions providing vital necessities to society like clothing and kitchenware. so being the patron of such important activities made her patron of entire wealthy city-states like athens, overflowing with some of the most brilliant minds in history. while reading several of the classic epic poems written by ancient greek scholars, (and translated by modern british ones) there was one that finally talked more about that artisan side of her than her prowess in battle and the wording of it really struck me. “and on my dark’ned mind pour thy pure light in measure unconfin’d, that sacred light which beams eternal from thy face serene, inspire my soul with thy own blessed and impulsive fire, invigorated hence by thee we find a demiurgic impulse in the mind” i cropped a few lines out as the epic poems are peppered with constant flowery-nicknames for the gods, i just cropped those bits to leave the important parts. “demiurgic” basically means; possessed by a deity to fulfill a task for them, btw. so, is it just me, or does that sound like they were describing the hypomanic creative spark?! “and on my darkened mind” depressed maybe? at least without a “lightbulb” idea spark for sure. “pour thy light in measure unconfined” that means infinite clearly, like when an entire project concept just *hits you*. “blessed and impulsive fire” sounds manic to me, impulsive? yet somehow “blessed”? manic. then the whole “demiurgic impulse” is quite literal once you know the words meaning. and as someone who crafts and makes art while hypomanic (and often *only* while hypomanic) i have often described it as the project “not letting me rest until i’ve brought it fully into this world”, i can see how someone 2,000 years ago might think they had been possessed to create something. then take that train of thought farther, they probably explained the depressive slump after a manic high as “athena no longer being with them” and i can totally see how they thought that. looking back at my episodes, i can 100% see how they thought the hypomanic energy was bestowed by a god, and how the emptiness of a following depressive episode would feel like the god left you a hollow husk. how they also describe her as an intense fire throughout the poem marks how manic episodes can go too far, being too filled with “the divine” logically drives mortals insane. how many of the most prolific ancient greek artisans were really bipolar? was athens an ancient hub of bipolar’s coming together to essentially worship hypomania? i’m thinking, quite probably.

2b60c03c-8ca6-4026-b4ca-7b097ef13730,"a few days every month i get really into cleaning. for example, last night i checked the time at 3am and realised i'd been washing my mattress for four solid hours. the mattress was new last october. i have a mattress protector though there was stain from spilling tea and a few really minor marks from chocolate. i cleaned it all two months ago. it looked fine. i again cleaned it last night. today i decided that even though it looks fine i'll go buy spray bleach after the gym and get it really white. unlike my old ocd and hypomanic episodes there's no agitation, racing thoughts or irrational negative consequence if i don't act. instead it's relaxing and i listen to the tv in the background. at the same time nothing is ever clean enough. in the mindfulness audiobook i've been listening to the psychologist says that perfectionists can never be happy because perfection isn't possible. i know in the grand scheme of things extreme cleaning doesn't matter, though it's a passing fixation. i tried to sleep for half an hour and ended up making vegan caramel sauce for the first at 5am on a whim. normally i've been going to bed around midnight. anyway, i read this article about cleaning and pms that was interesting: ""the answer lies in the way estrogen and progesterone levels affect your brain. before our periods, our estrogen levels drop — causing serotonin levels to drop right along with it. as you probably know, low serotonin levels are behind a host of issues like depression, anxiety, and ocd, which is why those illnesses are often treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), drugs that try to get those serotonin levels higher. this hormonally-induced serotonin dip before our periods can leave those of us who are already prone to depression feeling extra sad, or even particularly negative about our bodies when we're pmsing. but that drop in serotonin can also make you feel a little obsessive and compulsive before your period."" ""but the drops in estrogen and serotonin aren't the only things that spur the desire to clean up. before your period, your progesterone levels also drop, which combines the impulse to clean with an instinct to ""nest."" we see this tendency manifest itself more dramatically in pregnant women, who in their later months of pregnancy have low progesterone levels — which often lead them to go into a frenzy of cleaning house and nesting in order to prepare for the baby. the pms-related drop in progesterone is a less-intense version of the same phenomenon. in her fascinating book, moody bitches, dr. julie holland explains why this happens: ""every month, when your body prepares for a possible embryo implantation, progesterone levels are building and causing a smaller form of nesting,"" she writes. ""toward the end of the cycle, a woman might become dissatisfied with her environment and obsessive about making changes in order to make sure the setting is appropriate next month for the burrowing of the embryo into the uterine lining.""",bipolar,2

93f456ef-d572-4f5d-80d0-07d0b5ddabf3,"the first step towards managing your anxiety is to be able to identify your anxious thoughts. to help you do this, please read the linked post about identifying problematic thinking patterns: [be aware of your distorted keep a journal to help you identify what types of anxious thinking you engage in. think about which types of negative thought patterns interfere with your life the most and focus on those. **have realistic expectations.** the goal is not to completely eradicate your anxiety. the goal is to manage it. expecting to get to a place where anxiety is no longer a problem for you is setting yourself up for failure and a form of perfectionistic thinking. remember that even though you struggle with anxiety, you can still be happy. you can still live an interesting, pleasurable and rewarding life. your life doesn’t need to be perfect in order for you to be happy. once you have good idea about what types of anxious thinking you engage in, you will need to generate new thoughts that will eventually replace the old, anxious, thoughts. the goal is to use your conscious mind to beat the new thoughts into your stubborn subconscious using repetition, practice, and effort. this will take a lot of work and time, but that’s ok. 5 tools to help you generate new thoughts: **1) generate new thoughts ahead of time:** write down what your anxious thoughts are, and then beside them write down what you *wish* your brain would automatically think instead. next time you are in the situation that makes you anxious and your subconscious starts being a dick; use your conscious mind to repeat the new, positive, thoughts, which you generated earlier, over and over again. (obviously just do this in your head, don’t do it out loud or you will look insane) **2) probability flow chart:** think the situation through by making a probability flow chart about your anxious predictions. more often than not, we underestimate our ability to cope with “bad situations” and we overestimate the likelihood that these situations will actually happen. make a flow chart: identify your anxious thought. what is your anxiety telling you about the probability that your prediction will actually come true (probably 100%)? what is the objective probability that it will actually come true (probably &lt;5%)? really focus on how the objective probability of this “bad” thing happening is much lower than what your anxiety is telling you. ok now lets say your anxious prediction actually does come true. continue the flow chart. what is your anxious prediction about the situation that would follow? assign objective and anxious probabilities to the new prediction. now what if this one comes true? continue on the flow chart assigning anxious and realistic/objective probabilities to each new link in the predicted chain of events. continue on to show your mind that is it overestimating the likelihood of these anxious predictions. since these are dependent events, the probability of the very worst thing possible actually happening, (the prediction at the bottom of your flow chart), actually coming true is next to zero. this tool is slightly abstract so here is an example: [probability flow chart (math geeks: for fun, determine the final probabilities using the rules of dependent events for both the realistic probabilities and the anxious probabilities. notice that the final probabilities are incredibly lower than you would think! even for the “anxious” predictions) pro tip: really think about the “so what if this does happen” before you move on to the next prediction. you’ll often realize that very few things are as important as your anxiety makes them out to be. **3) method of extremes:** generate new thoughts by asking yourself and writing out answers the following three questions: 1) what is the worst possible outcome of (the thing i am anxious about)? 2) what is the best possible outcome of (the thing i am anxious about)? 3) ok, what is the most likely outcome? this one is a nice quick way to get your mind thinking more rationally by looking at positive extremes for balance. often us anxiety-ridden folks focus on the first question (the negative extreme) without giving any thought to the other two. get yourself thinking about the other two. make conscious efforts to answer the 2nd and 3rd questions. the more conscious thought you spend on alternative views, the more your subconscious will begin to accept these views. the brain is an incredibly malleable organ. **4) three method:** recognize that what you are anxious about doesn’t really matter in the greater scheme of life by asking yourself: will this matter to me 3 minuets after the situation is over? will this matter to me 3 weeks from now? will this matter to me 3 months from now? will this matter to me 3 years from now? very few things effect people’s happiness for longer than 3 months. here’s a ted talk about it: [science of personally, three minuets after the situation i was anxious about is over, i don’t think about it at all anymore. while you’re in the situation focus on the fact that in 3 minuets (or hours or weeks or whatever) this won’t matter at all to you. **5) change your ideas about the anxious situation.** instead of looking at the situation that makes you anxious as something to be feared and dreaded, look at it as an opportunity to practice dealing with your anxiety. decide that it is an opportunity for you to conquer your fears. we all know that exposure to something leads to desensitization. *remember:* changes do not happen over night, but if you are persistent and make a significant effort to change your conscious thinking, your subconscious will follow. more tips: avoid caffeine, exercise vigorously, and don’t fall into the trap of numbing your anxiety with alcohol.",anxiety,1

(csa tw begin) when i was 3, i was subject to months of prolonged csa by the hands of a family friend, and many times while my parents were still in the house. i remember it happening, and despite being 3 years old, thinking ""if i call out for my parents for help, he is going to go into the kitchen, grab a knife, and stab me and kill me."" so i never called out for help, and i didn't tell anyone, because i was terrified of him killing me. it took another survivor, who was a few years older than me, telling her mom and starting an entire investigation for my secret to come to light. i certainly wasn't allowed to watch gruesome material at that age, and i also strictly remember that was my own independent thought and not something he said to me. i worry that it has ingrained a weird response to death in me, though. (cw parent death begin) my stepmom of 10 years died when i was 16, and not once did i cry or even feel remorse. granted, she was also an abuser and my dad had been divorced from her a few years prior to her death, but she was also the only mother figure i had for a very long time. i didn't really think twice. death in the media doesn't really shock me, unless it's mass murder/a mass shooting. relatives have died, although none immediate family, and i havent been bothered. (cw animal death) some lifelong pets have died, and i didnt bat an eye (although my closest animal friend is getting old, and i have no idea how i'll react to that.) is this common?? how could i have conceptualozed death at 3? how do i get better ? what if i always shrug it off?? i dont want to be a coldhearted monster for this but i just dont know how, or if i even can, process it. thank you for reading. i really dont know where to go with this.",ptsd,4

0b38f33e-784e-4977-ac2d-9cfe6c691a4d,"obligatory rant. i was diagnosed with adhd in my second semester of my freshman year in college, and it was a blessing to have that kind of clarity a proper diagnosis can bring. what i was not prepared for was the struggle of finding the right medication. i had preconceptions of the prescription of pharmaceuticals to be a very linear, cut and dry process. i didn't realize that as good as doctors can be, there aren't really tests or procedures for calculating what drug in what dosage is going to work for you. i know now what i'm sure many here have experienced, that it is more of a trial and error process in which you are constantly weighing the risks and side effects against the benefits adhd meds provide. i struggled to find the right balance, switching from adderall ir (instant release) 10mg, then to 20mg, then adderall xr (extended release) in 25mg and 30mg, before finally arriving at vyvanse, starting with 40mg, going to 50mg, back to 40mg and then back to 50mg. all of which had different side effects that affected me physically, mentally, and emotionally and sometimes in ways that i didn't notice until pointed out by close friends or family. i struggled with lack of appetite, emotional supession, anxiety, exhaustion, sleep problems and maybe some slight depression. some of the side effects were more profound than others, and there was a dark period with me and adderall xr when i was taking 30mg with a 10mg ir booster. i became a different person in a sense and i didn't even notice until months of being a shut in and anxious. i'm finally at my sweet spot with vyvanse 50mg and it's working great for me, despite some side effects of decreased appetite and a crash at the end of the day. i go through all this because when i hear non adhd people who talk about adhd meds, i know they really have no idea what it really is. i see alot of people abuse it in college and i've had to deny friends trying to buy my medication off of me. adderall is kind of a meme at this point with so many people who think of them as smart pills. as someone who has been dealing with these medications and the mental health system, i would want to let people know that these drugs aren't something to fuck with. they're powerful medications that can have serious side effects. you have to be extremely aware of your body and your mind because the side effects can sometimes be very subtle and you can be totally unaware that you're becoming slowly more irritated, anxious, and depressed. that can destroy you if it gets too far. i'm not trying to give a 'drugs are bad' speech. i'm saying that this shit is potent and if you don't give it the respect it deserves, it will bite you. if you think you might have adhd, don't self medicate. a dose good for one person could be way too much for another. talk to a doctor you can trust and get a proper diagnosis. adhd is often comorbid and can look very similar to bipolar disorder. adhd meds and bipolar disorder do not go well together. just talk with an expert and do your research. if you're just trying to cram for finals, stick to coffee. adderall can take a little anxiety and make it a mountain of anxiety. plus, the science isn't exactly clear if it truly helps those without adhd with learning. it's not worth the risk of making a habit out of taking these pills when you don't know what you're doing. if you're just starting down the pharmaceutical journey with your doctor, be patient and alert. take note of how you feel and make sure you have a support group, whether it's friends or family, to give you objective data about how your medicine affects you. you might be surprised by what they notice. take it slow, you're going to get there eventually, and it's not going to help racing up your dosage too quick because you want results now. i just wanted to share my experiences with you all and see if you felt the same. i also wanted to give some insight to people who are just beginning their journey with a diagnosis or who are unfamiliar with the complexities of adhd. vyvanse has made my life significantly better and i have no plans of stopping my prescriptions with my current side effects at this time. i don't want to scare anyone away from taking medicine. i just want to make sure people treat this process with respect and care to make sure they stay safe. sorry this is so damn long. tl;dr adhd meds are potent and can fuck you over. treat them with respect and you won't get bit.",adhd,0

(school was where the trauma originated). i have a loving boyfriend who i've been with for nearly two years, and from the outside, i have a picture perfect life. however, lately i've begun having intense depersonalizations episodes. it's like i become aware during a dissociative state, but i feel like i'm in a dream state. i can feel that my brain isn't functioning properly, but i can't do anything about it. i can't seem to make decisions, and i feel like i'm floating just a few inches outside of my body and experiencing everything in a dream state. it's incredibly scary and very isolating and traumatizing in itself. at the worst of it, i've convinced myself that the world is just a figment of my imagination and that i made it all up. i've tried cutting to make myself feel something, and at the absolute worst of it, i've contemplated suicide in the hopes that if i kill myself, i'll feel ""normal"" in the afterlife. i'm a generally happy person, and this isn't a cry for help. i love my life and my family, i'm just so terrified by what's happening to me and i can't get it to stop. i carry a lighter with me that i'll hold the flame as long as i can and then press the hot metal into my skin to feel something. not enough to burn myself, just enough to ground me. it works, but i know it's probably not healthy. tl;dr - i'm terrified of depersonalization episodes i keep having, and don't know how to get it to stop. i'm really good at pulling myself out of a panic attack, but can't seem to do the same here. help?",ptsd,4

ec6b263f-2139-4dd6-bfa5-38981568186b,"hi everyone! i just want to share some strategies that i learned from my therapist. i’m diagnosed with aspergers, and my therapist think that i have either general anxiety disorder or ocd. i’m also pretty sure i suffer from depersonalization. going in therapy has helped me a lot. i was a wreck when i started seeing my therapist 6 months ago but now i’m much more stable. i still suffer from anxiety regularly and the purpose of these tools is to handle anxiety – not to remove it from your life which i believe is impossible. everyone on this earth deals with anxiety at some level. # important the strategies and tips below is my interpretation from the talks with my therapist. this has helped me – it doesn't necessarily mean that it will help everyone since all of you probably have different types of problem. **i want everyone who reads this not to takes these tips not as absolute facts that will work for everyone**. as i said, this is my interpretation and not necessarily the words by professionals. i wont include a tl;dr because it's important to read everything to get the full context. \--------------------- • first and foremost, **take help from a professional if you have the opportunity**. i can’t stress this enough. for many years i’ve tried to ”solve” and analyze my problems in my head. trying to understand why i feel this way and how i can battle it. but this is hard to do by yourself, at least for me – although some work by your own could be helpful. i’m not saying you should stop reflecting or problem-solving, i’m just saying it will be a lot easier if you have a coach along the way. • acceptance. this is important. for the last 15 years i’ve not felt ”like myself” in my head. but worrying about it or trying to get rid of the feeling only makes it worse. try to live with it, play along and do the best out of the situation. don’t try too hard to ruminate about going back to ”your old, happy and real self”. this is the new you at the moment and you have to make the best out of it. anxiety is like tinnitus or a headache: annoying and unpleasant as hell, and for some present all the time, but focusing on it constantly doesn't help. my therapist said i should think the following when i'm unease or worried: ""i feel as i feel now, and it will we as it will be"". the point is not to do things with the intent of removing anxiety or any doubt, because then the body/mind think anxiety is dangerous which is not. but don't take this advice too hard – if you really need to calm yourself down, do it. this advice is, like all the others, not carved in stone. • do the things you would do if you didn’t suffer from anxiety. this is really hard to do for some, but my therapist also said to me: ”what would you have done know if these recurring and intrusive thoughts or feeling/state wasn’t a problem for you?” • **exercise! this is crucial.** you don’t have to run for 1 hour every day, take small steps. start by walking for 15 minutes a couple of days if that is what you can manage. i try to run 30-60 minutes 3-4 days a week and it has done wonders for me. i hated running but signed up for a 21 km run and therefore i had to exercise so i would be able to participate. since then i loved running! exercise is proven again and again to give your brain enormous benefits. • challenge your fears. this tips should be taken with some caution: take really small steps. people with a phobia for spiders doesn’t start with petting a spider, they start by maybe just thinking of spiders. i was really worried about mental health issues, but i went to see the joker movie at the cinema (with my dad) and while it was hard to watch, i felt much better afterwords. also, i’m afraid that everyone who reads this post will misinterpret my advices and, as a result of this, will start to feel even worse. but that’s why i’m should do this: exposure is the key. • don’t argue with your negative thoughts. i don’t know if this is backed up scientifically, but my therapist advised me to do this. example: i’ve always worried that i might be homosexual (although nothing wrong with that, i'm just worried about how people would react). i often make up arguments for/against that possibility. if i see a man that i think is handsome, a thought might pop up that says *”this must mean that i’m gay”*. instead of responding with *”it doesn't have to mean i’m gay, it's normal to think that people of the same sex look good”*, which is the most logical thought, i now try to think *”yeah, maybe it means that i’m gay, future will tell!”*. i’ve had these thoughts for 15 years and i’m still not sure of my sexuality – the point is that thinking about it and looking for proofs hasn’t helped me, so it make no sense anymore to counter the negative thoughts. the point is to not feed the troll which is anxiety. try to treat your anxious thoughts like a bully: fighting it only makes it worse, try to become friend with it instead. according to a book i read during therapy, a theory (not necessarily true) says that the anxious thoughts keep coming back because you get so relieved when you counter them with more logical and positive thoughts. the author described it as if you would wearing shoes that are too small, just for the feeling of relief when you take the shoes off. this was and is extremely hard to do for me. at the beginning, i was overanalyzing this exercise to the extreme, so if you to find it too hard to understand i would recommend you to stop it, if it makes you feel better. but with some practice you can learn it too. **the key here is to accept uncertainty**. • everything will go soooo much easier as you get better. i started therapy when i had hit rock bottom, and it felt completely impossible at the beginning. i saw everything as danger – [i got a book from my therapist that would help but i was afraid that it would only make me feel worse, so i googled and googled for negative reviews of the book/therapy. but, as i felt better, these kind of exercises almost became child play. when i feel good, the negative thoughts either don’t pop up or bother me at all, but when i’m down, they feel like the indisputable truths or things that had to be solved. my therapist said to me that the negative thoughts feel so true because of the anxiety it gives me. • anxiety is a false alarm, a feeling that something ”must be wrong”. as someone on reddit wrote: ”having anxiety is like having a broken spider-sense that is constantly warning you of non-existent danger”. every time i feel unease, i try to just say to myself that this feeling is anxiety, instead of overthinking and analyzing it. • patience! you may have heard that word so many times in this context, but it's for a reason. it could take years to feel better, but if that's the case, it will be worth it. don't give up if you doesn't feel improvements after two months for example. **finally, some encouraging words for you all:** • i don’t know how many times i thought that ”this feeling/state will last forever. i can’t ever go back to normal”. but i was wrong everytime. maybe you feel pessimistic about yourself and your future, and find it hard to believe that there is a better tomorrow, but it is possible. • think of those youtube-videos of stray dogs being rescued. the dogs are in a complete mess, afraid of everything and maybe has given up on life. but they get rescued, and later in the videos you can see them extremely happy, jumping around and playing with humans. see that journey as a goal if that helps you. **it is possible to feel good again.** • remember how many times your heroes in movies was at a point of no return? when they were surrounded by enemies and an escape seemed impossible? but they always find a way to escape and win. i hope this applies to you too,, **even if you are suicidal with no support from family, friends or a therapist.** i wont say that everything always works out in the end for everyone (because life isn't a fairytale), but i think it's important to have that mindset when you feel like shit. [you may feel like the captain america who thought he would face thanos army by himself in but we all know how it played out. \-------------- if you have questions or criticism i will try to respond. you might find contradictions or even factual errors in this guide, as i said i'm not a professional and i'm still trying to handle my anxiety. but hopefully this will help someone at some degree.",anxiety,1

61e97f04-9b85-4571-b96d-2e25a9a2eb04,"hello, my son was jotting down some multiplications for school and asked me if there were many numbers that, when multiplied by their mirror image, resulted in a palindromic number (e.g. 221 x 122 = 26962). i made a quick python script to test this and found the results rather surprising. for 3-digit numbers, there are 11 results. for 4-digit number, there are 23. the number of positive results doubles approximately with each addition of a digit, reaching 642 results with 9-digit numbers. this is the longest number we could test because calculating time increases exponentially by a factor of approximately 10, reaching 15 minutes for the last example. what i find interesting is that in all of the above results, with no exception, the factors are invariably composed of zeros, ones and twos. there's never anything else. for example: 1211101 x 1011121 = 1224569654221. i asked a mathematician friend — not remotely involved with number theory or arithmetic – and he said it might be related to ""carry digits"" messing things up. it's true that for 1-digit numbers, excluding the trivial zero, there are only 3 possible examples (1, 2 and 3) before the symmetry breaks (4 x 4 is 16 which isn't palindromic). but when multiplying huge 8-digit numbers you get tons of ""carry digits"" as can clearly be seen from the results: these can include any digit as seen in the example above. it *does* seem to have some impact, though. for a test for n digits, all the multiplication results have the exact same number of digits, which is always 2n-1. e.g. 4-digit numbers always give 7-digit results. i am sure there must be a deep reason for never seeing digits above 2 in the factors, but for the life of me i can't understand what it is. like i wrote i've only tested this up to nine digits, so my conclusion could be wrong. any insights are welcome. i'm not a mathematician, so please forgive me if this seems trivial to you. thanks a lot.",none,5
8a3a43d5-7e76-492a-a11f-6103362d14aa,"(note: i know we're not all in the us, and many of you are lucky enough to live in a country where healthcare is treated as a public necessity in the same way as education... but for my compatriots up in here, you might wanna check this out.) so, if you're low-income like myself, you probably read some of the shit on here and think, ""damn, that outpatient program really sounds like it benefitted them... if only i could afford that! also that latuda stuff sounds pretty fucking awesome, but they don't even have a generic yet? whatup wit dat?"" i spent yesterday morning on the phone with the health insurance department of the state i'm attempting to move to. the good news is that having been covered by medicaid in my state, i'm eligible to just switch over to their state without having to wait until 2018. the bad news (as i later found out) was that i wasn't eligible because i was on medicare. then i found out later in the day, by total coincidence... my medicare is going to be dropped. they told me it could have been avoided if i had been able to explain the situation to them in person - like, they told me it would be better if i went into their office and filled out a paper application rather than an online one(?) so once i get to town, that's what i'm going to do. [anyway, check this (it's a pdf, so if you're not able to download/read it, i'll give you a summary.) for those unfamiliar - there's medicaid, and medicare. medicare is *usually* only for people who are retired - but as i was considered a ""disabled adult child"", i am a dependent on my father's medicare. this covers most of my health expenses, but not all of them. only 80 percent of doctors' visits are covered - this is what they call part b. there's part a covers hospital visits. these two things are pretty standard across the states. part d covers prescription drugs. (there's also a part c, but i'm not quite sure what it is.) so if you're on a federal program like medicare, no matter where you are in the states, you need to have some kind of backup insurance in order for doctors' visits to be fully covered. medicaid is a little different. it's basically ""health insurance for poor people"". the names for each service varies from state to state (for example, in massachusetts it's masshealth.) within those states, there are health plans that are subsidiaries, which you can choose depending on your specific healthcare needs (the one i had for a while was called ""neighborhood health plan"", though i just found out in doing research here they've ""temporarily"" stopped taking new members. wonderful.) since i don't have many other health problems, i would want something that covers mental health first and foremost. so as of 2014, the affordable care act (which is totally not the same thing as obamacare, obviously) now requires medicaid to insurance to cover what they call ""essential health benefits"". now, this does include what they call ""behavioral health"" (with a disorder like bipolar that's so organic, i really do find this name inaccurate and kind of offensive.) i forget what led up to it, but i remember a while ago being told on the phone with a masshealth representative that ""behavioral health"" wasn't covered. what i know now is that there are many subsidiaries within masshealth (all of which falls under the realm of medicare) and that my however limited my options were, my mental health care could be covered. basically, it requires a little asking around, but even if you get shut down at first... the law says you are legally entitled to coverage. this is a federal law that applies to the entire country, not a state law. remember that. a lot of you were concerned about my move, in large part because of my health care situation. i just wanted to reiterate that this isn't going to be much of a problem for me as i had originally thought. what is going to be a problem is if the tiny-handed jack-o-lantern goes forth and tries to dismantle the aca (despite that being ruled unconstitutional several times by the supreme court.) i haven't looked into the details of what he wants to do yet, but i am very afraid of these benefits being lost. anything that serves as a safety net for the underclass in the us is pretty much in danger - and since i don't see myself moving back to the middle class i once belonged to anytime within the next four (please not eight) years, i'll just say it... yeah, i'm afraid. if anyone else would be interested in discussing this further, since i'll admit i'm still learning about the situation and there are parts i don't fully understand... i'd really like that. whatever your politics are (and really, i try to be sympathetic to everyone, even in the us we all come from different places/cultures) there's no real way to treat our disorder without a full understanding of this.",bipolar,2

""hello this is 9-11 whats your emergency?"" ""i dunno i just dont feel right, wait you know what never mind"" *click* oh shit oh shit now they are coming oh no? what do i do? pace around this apartment doing laps...pull that picture frame off the wall i know this place is bugged... they have been listing to my dad and i's conversations..they are onto me. i then look down from my 5th story loft window and see two sheriff's pull up. fuck fuck they sent sheriff's...not a fucking ambulance... they are here to take me away... i'm not going away. at this point i take the elevator up-to the roof top 14 stories high. receiving multiple phone calls, all ignored now....wait what the fuck are you doing...well i'm going to step over the railing and just see. i stood there for a good ten minutes until the security guard of my building tried to grab me, i was moving around the side of that building so quick, i dunno how i didn't fall. i back into a corner. once a cop comes through that door i'm going! i'm fucking going! 6 cops come through and i jumped. i must have hesitated because one cop hand turned to 15 cop hands as i'm dangling over the edge. fuck this they are not getting me...let me go..struggle.. then i bit a cops hand to let me go pushing my legs against the building away from them. but you know what they got me, they fucking did. and i am grateful for that. they reserved a room for me at the hospital first on a 3 day hold (5150), then on a 14 day hold (5250). day 11 they released me to my father. toxicity report negative, had been sober 3 months before that because things didn't feel right. losing you memory is a hell of a thing, i hope it never happens to me again.",bipolar,2

1e9dc41c-696c-4703-8235-210ec8f83d42,"i felt it was important to share my experience as it may help others or i may find some answers in the comments. i have been curious about a diagnosis. i separated from the navy almost two years ago with an honorable discharge at the completion of my contract. i spent three years in japan during the fukushima incident, where i also had three back to back deployments. then came back to the us and got married, a month later was on deployment to the middle east for two consecutive deployments. those were considered ""combat zone"" so i am categorized as a ""combat veteran"" though i never actually performed any hand to hand combat. i just worked in extreme heat conditions with no relief of stress, and as stress built up in me, i didn't handle it appropriately. i passed out from heat exhaustion a handful of times; only one time was actually reported in which the experience was so embarrassing and uncomfortable i don't feel like explaining it, but i was rediculed for it really badly. after getting back to the states, i married and deployed, the home life was difficult because my finances weren't in order before leaving which created stress with the wife. the wife comes to find out was pregnant at that time. the massive stress loads of her husband leaving, being in a position where we could communicate once weekly, my calls only stressed her more telling her that i witnessed sexual assaults, that i was being harassed by my chain of command for creating ""problems"" for them by blowing the whistle. she ended up having a miscarriage. so i had no one to talk to about my issues because she wasn't there and telling her about it only stressed her out more. i went to the chaplain to tell him what was happening. he was assured by my chain of command that i was the problem and not the other way around. who do i talk to at this point, the command equal opportunity officer (e-7) who basically says she will look into it but doesn't seem concerned. there is a stigma about asking for help in the navy and it needs to change. basically, if you take any meds you get treated like a black sheep. if you go to medical and they give you meds, you get removed from your duties and everyone else carries your load while you are forced to stand around them not allowed to do anything. if you do get out of the navy because you spoke out about being depressed, anxious, or having symptoms of ptsd then you would be seperated from the navy and sent home. this was referred to as ""sadding out"". i am not a quiter, i signed a contract and was monetarily tied up because they gave me a re-enlistment bonus. if i complained, they wrote ""written lawful letters"" and made us sign page 13s (statements) saying that if we were to ""sad out"" then we would be responsible for paying back the entirety of our bonus before taxes which really meant about an extra 15k more than they paid me. this scared the living shit out of me because i don't want to let my wife or family back home down. i was being bullied hard by my chain of command, 2am calls to the deptartment heads office after a 40 hour work day and 45 minutes of rest just to be yelled at to the point i'm trembling with fear, crying, and feel like i am worthless. rinse and repeat for months on end. this seemed like normal navy life. ""living the dream"" they called it. then i go to the pysch-o (pysch officer) because my wife convinced me that i needed to talk to someone. i didn't want to be seen going into the psycho's office, which by the way should not be located directly next to your work space. the intentional design to have medical and psychological lines in walk ways right next to your work space is a complete violation of all hepa rights. out of fear of someone i worked with noticing me talking to the pyscho's office i tried to ask him to meet with me regularly in private someplace that wasn't labled ""pysch officer's office"". again, the stigma of sadding out is real and strong. the pyscho doesn't want to prescribe anything or help me in any way. no follow up, just tells me to go talk to an e-5 in a closet of an office directly connected through the pyscho's office. he began teaching me ""breathing exercizes to use"" while i was experiencing a panic attack. i remember this experience well because we were in very close quarters and his breath stunk. i decided at that point that this was not going to help and i wanted nothing more to do with this. so i just started bottling everything up as best i could. the bottling up was working for a while but i had a kid on the way, was getting out of the navy, applying for jobs like it was my job, and interviewing, moving, work repeat. no time for relaxation, that will happen after the kid gets here. i start scaring myself while driving because i would space out for long periods and just end up on the other side of town or have to pull over because i was having a panic attack or i would be falling alseep at the wheel from pure physical exhaustion. i was driving my kid home from day care after getting off work and i late breaked almost ran into the car in front of me because i was so mentally checked out. i decided i wouldn't drive anymore. i immediately sought help from a private doctor while on terminal leave and went to the military docs to make sure it was documented on my medical record including a trip to the er about panic attacks i was having. i was placed on a ssri (lexapro) with the initial diagnosis of a ""chronic adjustment disorder"" basically meaning i didn't handle the change of getting out well. then i started to get really depressed, bored and avoided doing about everything i enjoyed. i shut down. i believe my wife noticed and had me moved to a new city where she could make more money, where pot is legal, and i could stay at home to avoid driving, going to work, or basically interacting with the rest of the world. i have been concerned about the sexual side effects of the meds i had been on because my wife wanted to have another kid. i went 2 weeks of no panic attacks for the first time since the whistle blowing/miscarriage/dog bite/boss fired from job for fucking his boss/emminent war/etc deployment. i then decided it was best to decrease my meds to a lower dose. ""not being productive because it takes 2 hours to ejaculate is causing my problems"", i thought. these are side effects of my medications. this is where things went bad... i started to get depressed but was personally unaware. my wife started to notice that i wasn't eating, was moody, not sleeping, and laying in bed all day. she asked me if i was ok and i... broke down. all emotions came to a tipping point and i started whaling in tears. i told her i had been thinking about suicide. i told her that i didn't feel like life was worth living. she made me go to the va and talk to a doc. i think they are evaluating me for ptsd. they have yet to give me a diagnosis but were pretty dead set on asking me questions about my upbringing. i feel like the va treatment plans are designed to make it sound like the things you are experiencing were caused by something in your childhood so they don't have to compensate you or something. i don't care about compensations but i cant hold a job for health care so i go to the va. like, ""we are here to make sure the military is not blamed for what ever is wrong with you"" kind of thing in my opinion. anyways, i felt i should share some of the basic symptoms i have struggled with and the only treatment i have found that really worked is smoking indica strain cannibis at night when the child is asleep and having some relaxing time with my pets. here are my symptoms: panic attacks severe avoidance confusion when trying to get off medication, confusion when going on medication stuttering / stammering with increased frequency and severity. episodes of extreme emotion (getting upset about the small things, irratablility) night sweats (bed stinks so bad and i have to wash the sheets daily and my bedroom is 68 degrees and i only sleep with sheets.) night terrors (re-occuring dream: waking up with the feeling that i am supposed to tell someone something to prevent an awful occurrence from happening but unable to say the words. the words just won't come out) wife scared to wake me up because i am fearfully jumpy and suffer from panic attacks upon awaking. depression",ptsd,4

7df679fd-33bd-423a-8154-f54feb66ea89,"we're writing this in part in response to some popular posts we saw recently, and partly in response to a trend we've noticed here. this isn't aimed at anyone specifically, nor is it an official rule.we have no desire to ""gate keep"" or alienate anyone. however, this is a subreddit centered around a medical condition and those living with it, and we'd like to keep things medically accurate as much as possible. without any judgement or ranking of what is ""worse,"" we encourage everyone to only use medical terms in ways consistent with the medical literature, including terms like ""mania."" if you describe something as a ""manic episode"" when it is not a manic episode it's confusing for everyone. we can't offer any help or commiseration when we don't know what is going on. it's certainly true that the line between mania and hypomania can be a bit fuzzy - we're not talking about that. if there are more than one reasonable and informed opinion... that happens. but when people describe mania as a welcome and productive event that flies in the face of the diagnostic criteria which require a severe impairment in functioning that is often accompanied by psychosis and hospitalization. when someone describes themselves as being currently manic or experiencing a manic episode, we think of high levels of impairment, potentially including psychosis and loss of insight. hypomania can be imparing too, especially socially, but does not involve the same level of impairment and potential medical emergency as mania. another thing that is often ignored here is that for an episode to be considered manic, the symptoms and impairment must last at least a week or require hospitalization. we understand that some people have slightly shorter episodes, and that in the middle of an episode you don't know how long it will last, but an episode lasting less than a few days does not qualify as a manic episode. hypomania can be shorter, with the official requirements being only 4 days minimum, but if your symptoms are lasting less than that and have triggers (caffeine, life events) it’s not necessarily a bipolar episode. some amount of change in energy levels over time is not necessarily pathological. we hope everyone can understand why we feel this way and that this is not meant to be an attack on anyone. we also hope that realizing the full extent of harm caused by mania will help everyone be more understanding when it changes the way someone interacts here or when someone seeks advice on repairing strained bank accounts and personal relationships. from u/ssnakeggirl and u/mymainismythrowaway1",bipolar,2

dating almost ten years, married for three, one dog and no kids (yet). - ‎he was diagnosed maybe 7ish years ago after some prompting from me, has been taking ritalin since, but no other formal treatment. **key relationship issues *possibly* linked to adhd** here are some of patterns that are/were present in our relationship that i have often seen listed as symptoms of adhd (note: does not mean they are all necessarily symptoms) and how i/we initially responded: - hyperfocus on early stages of relationship: our first two years of dating was amazing and intense, but at some stage, it was like someone had flicked a switch and he had lost interest → that was a super painful process for me and i was left wondering if he was no longer interested in me. - ‎forgetfulness: he can have a terrible memory for stuff like chores and appointments→ i found myself getting frustrated and picking up an unfair share of the housework, developing a parent-child dynamic. - poor attention span: he can't really do much of low-stimulation activities like watching tv or just sitting and talking, but could easily play computer games by himself for hours on end→ i felt like he didn't enjoy spending time with me and it was difficult to find stuff to do together that he would enjoy. - ‎lack of intimacy: he is often hypersensitive to touch, e.g. can be averse to kisses or even light touches, or just rarely in the mood→ it became a vicious cycle where i would initiate intimacy, he would reject me, i would feel upset and my self-esteem would take a dive, and he would further avoid intimacy in future. - ‎quick temper: when trying to address the issues, he would often get defensive and quick to anger→ he'd get angry, i'd get upset, we wouldn't resolve anything and would both dread future interactions. **things that have worked well for us** over the years, through plenty of tears, talks and trial + error, here are some things that we've incorporated into our lives that have worked quite well for us: - shared calendars and task lists: we use shared google calendars, which means i don't have to remind him of events, he doesn't have to remember events, and he can also take more ownership of our scheduling appointments (less of the parent-child dynamic). he has also started settting himself reminders for regular activities so i don't have to nag him about it. - ‎read ""the adhd effect on marriage"" together: [this is one of the best adhd relationship resources i have come across. the examples throughout the book are so relatable, to the point where i was moved to tears, but most importantly, it stresses that there are behaviours and patterns in both partners (i.e also the non-adhd partner) that need to be addressed. as with most self-help books, know to take the advice with a grain of salt, but there is some good stuff in there. my husband and i would set aside one night per week where we would sit down and read a chapter of the book together, then take 10mins afterwards to discuss what we felt was accurate, and how we could implement this in our own relationship. - ‎scheduling intimacy: while scheduling intimacy can be really unsexy, we're in the process of rebuilding that healthy level for us both, so starting with small steps. setting aside some time for intimacy means that he can always anticipate it, allows him to occasionally initiate, and it ensures it doesn't get completely forgotten about. - ‎housework routines that work for him: my husband is the champion of folding clothes and ironing, as long as he can put his headphones on and listen to a show/audiobook while he's doing it. i've learnt to exercise more flexibility with when and how housework gets done, and he's learnt to develop regular housework habits that fit in his routine. - clear plan of action when having serious chats: these can be high risk events for us, so whenever we need to sit down to talk about relationship issues, we put a time limit on it (if it can't be resolved in that time, we just continue the discussion another day), agree to let him leave the room for a breather if the conversation escalates too much, and to always end the conversation with hugs and our trademark exchange of silly faces. **key takeaways** good things to keep in mind if you're in a similar situation: - (for the non-adhd partner) not taking everything personally: it can be tricky, but try not to take everything they do (or don't do) as a direct reflection of how they felt about you. because it's probably not about you. - (for the adhd partner) reassure your partner: on the above point, help your partner understand that it's *not* them. remind them that you love them whenever you can. - it's not a blame game: it's so easy to start blaming one another for your behaviours and making it you vs them, but remember that you're tackling this as a team. try to see the other person's perspective and how they are being affected, and discuss things that you could both do to work on things. and try to have a laugh about it every now and then. - celebrate even small successes: even with the best of intentions, progress can often be slow, sometimes you might even take a step backwards, and you may be left feeling hopeless. make sure to acknowledge any progress, however small. a simple ""yay us, that was a really positive, productive discussion"" or ""hey, i really appreciate that you unloaded the dishwasher"" can go a long way. - be patient: across all aspects of the relationship. be patient when having to tell them something twice. be patient when waiting for their train of thought to drift back to the conversation. be patient because sometimes it just takes a while to override the bad habits and sucky feelings associated with past negative interactions. always be patient. our relationship is not perfect. i'll be the first to admit that at times we can reeeally frustrate one another, but we love each other to bits and are open to continuing to discussing things and trying new techniques together. its a constant learning curve. i'd definitely welcome anyone else's tips if you're willing to share! good luck to all you adhders with your current/future relationships and also to any fellow non-adhd partners out there :) be nice to one another &lt;3 tl;dr: adhd guy and his non-adhd wife sometimes drive each other crazy, but their crazy love for each other and their crazy persistence delivers crazy good results.",adhd,0

i didn’t understand what was happening. even as a teenager, i believed her excuses for the mass amount of cuts on her arms, and needing to change clothes five times a day. i was definitely a lot closer with my father then, but i was also terrified of him. the moment i heard his harley davidson coming down our street, i’d book it for my room, and hope the house was cleaned to his liking. it wasn’t until i was much older, when i discovered his stash of needles and, steroids, that i understood his rage. even as a child, i’ve always been very oblivious, naïve, and reserved. i was quiet, and spent most of my time day dreaming. i had/have dyslexia (also left-handed), which not only caused me to struggle in school, but contributed to me wetting the bed almost every night until i was 13. my mother was well aware of this, but still drove me to school every morning covered in pee. as a result i was bullied harshly, not only by my peers, but even my own parents. after my own attempted suicide, i was diagnosed with gad and severe depression. my parents divorced when i was 15, my mom has been clean since (almost 10 years). my mom moved me and my sisters out of the house, and into an apartment. after about a year, i moved in with my father, step mother, and 9 month old half-brother in 2009 when i was 16. i wanted to go back to the school with all my old friends i had before my parents’ divorce. i wasn’t allowed to leave the house to go on walks, or to go anywhere really. i had to take care of my infant brother every day, if i wanted to hang out with friends; they had to come over to my house. in september of 2009, my father had just left home for a month + to work his new job traveling. he left my step mother to take care of me, my brother, as well as both of my bedridden grandparents. this was very overwhelming for my step mother; it would have been for anyone. having a father whose hobby, as well as job revolved around beer, i was used to it; beer was all i knew at home. so when my step mother’s drinking increased, i didn’t even bat an eye; it was normal for me, i even participated with her. the first two days he was gone, she drank every night, and would have me drive her to the store to get more alcohol when she ran out. one morning, after staying up too late with my step mother, i slept in, and missed the bus, not a big deal. i sat in the back seat of the van feeding my brother his bottle on the way to school while my step mother drove me, that’s the last time i ever saw him again. after school, i had to go to a classmates house to work on a chemistry project, i went home first to let my step mom know. when i found her she was sprawled out on the couch passed out, i felt really awkward seeing her like that, i never had before. instead of waking her, i just wrote her a note letting her know what i was doing. checking on my brother didn’t even cross my mind. his bedroom door was shut, all was quiet, and so i assumed he was napping. i left, and walked to my friend’s house, which was about twenty minutes away. after working on the project for about an hour or so, i get a call from my father. he couldn’t get ahold of my step mother, and was worried about the baby. he asked me to walk home to check on him, and i did. i had an uneasy feeling, but i wasn’t really worried. when i arrived home, my step mother was no longer on the couch, but in the bathroom. it was freakishly quiet, i can’t explain it, but it was unordinary, i even had the thought that she might have been drowning him in the bathtub. i told her to call dad, i let her know that he was worried. i didn’t get much of a response, maybe an “okay”, but that was all i needed, and i rushed out the door without so much as peeking into my brother’s room. i should have, i don’t know why i didn’t, i guess i just wanted to get out of the house. another hour or so at my friend’s house passes, and my father calls me again. he hadn’t heard from her, and wanted me to go back home and make sure everything was alright. i kid you not, on the walk back home, i was texting my friends that my brother was dead, i was so sure of it. i got home as it was getting dark; and all the lights were off in the house, which freaked me out even more. i sat outside smoking my step mothers cigarettes on the driveway, i couldn’t escape the thought that my she had murdered my brother, my grandparents, and she was waiting inside for me. i don’t know where these thoughts came from, my stepmother and i were very close at the time, and i had no reason to suspect this. when i finally worked up the courage to go inside, i checked my brother’s room first, it was empty. i found my step mother in bed once again passed out. i woke her up, and asked her where the baby was; she had no idea. we searched the house, called family friends, we couldn’t find him anywhere. eventually she made her way out the front door, next thing i know; i see the van pull out, and speed away. i was left at home, alone, wondering what the fuck was going on, until police showed up at the door. they wouldn’t tell me anything, and i wasn’t allowed to use my phone to reach out to friends, so i fell asleep on the couch. i woke up after 3am to a homicide detective introducing himself to me, with my house full of police, and photographers. the detective took me outside to his car, sat me down in the front passenger seat with him next to me in the driver seat. the first thing he said to me was “could you describe the events of this afternoon leading up to your brother’s death.” i didn’t even know he had died. my brother was left in his car seat for 9 hours after i was dropped off for school; i lived in houston, texas at the time, so the temperature was still in the high 90’s even at the end of september. he was cold by the time he was found, covered in blisters, with nothing but a diaper on. seven years later and it still haunts me, i know it wasn’t my fault, or responsibility, but he would have never been in the car had i not missed the bus. when my step mother came home from the hospital/questioning that morning, the first thing i said to her was i forgave her. the hardest part was having to explain to my two younger sisters what had happened. though deemed a homicide, my step mother didn’t spend a day in jail; it was wiped off her record after a year of probation. other than my initial testimony, i wasn’t brought in to testify in court; i wish i had been, my brother might have received justice then. my father didn’t actually marry my step mother until 2 months after his death. their response to his death was to abuse me and my sisters, so i moved out on my own before i graduated high school, they kicked my sisters out one after the other not long after. my father hasn’t spoken to me in years, yet he married the woman who killed his only son, i feel like he blames me. i’ve been dealing with this on my own for seven years, all the guilt i feel with no release. i never got counseling, i was isolated, and that’s how i’ve learned to deal with all that i have experienced. i’ve dealt with severe depression and anxiety since childhood, but now death is all i think about it seems. i have obsessive thoughts that my sisters, friends, and other loved ones are going to die, especially in a car. i don’t see myself living past my thirties, no future, just constant thoughts of impending doom. so much stress, and worry that a year after the incident, i grew a large solid white forelock in the front of my hair. i’m filled with so much fear, sorrow, and pain; i feel as though, that is all life has to offer me. i often wish that i wasn’t alive anymore, i wish my mother had aborted me, like she told me she had intended to. i don’t often show this sadness to others, i’m heavily introverted and reserved. at the same time, i’m a huge goober, who just wants to laugh and be happy, while making others happy; that’s all i ever strived for. i grew as a person through all of the trauma. i’ve always been very empathetic, i can connect with anyone. i’m the person people reveal their deepest darkest secrets to; go to for comfort, etc. i only have love to give, i can’t bear for others to suffer, especially alone, because i know what that feels like. i’ve been through a lot, but it’s made me into the great person i am today. i don’t really know why i’m posting this, i just needed to get it out i guess. tldr; when i was 16, my step mother left (her child) my half brother in the car for 9 hours after dropping me off at school, when i missed the bus. 7 years later and the guilt still eats away at me.",ptsd,4

a5556e8f-981d-4479-90bc-3120d6c8c510,"i've had anxiety for as long as i can remember but never experienced a truly crippling panic attack until yesterday. i have an interview for my dream job on tuesday and while interviews always make me anxious, i've been feeling pretty confident this time around. yesterday i spent some time preparing answers to potential interview questions and after an hour or two of productive work i decided to take a break. i was feeling excited and hopeful, confident that i had done more than enough to prepare. no more than 5 minutes later my chest tightened up, my heart started racing and i felt chills all over my body. initially my mind was free of anxious thoughts, however, physically i felt as though i was no longer in control of my body. the feeling of no control eventually lead my mind into its own state of panic. i took a klonopin and went to lie down to try some breathing exercises and relax. usually when i'm feeling anxious, lying in bed is the only thing that makes me feel ""safe"" and relaxed. unfortunately, it backfired this time. lying motionless made my rapid heart rate much more noticeable and only added to my panic. at the height of my attack i recalled someone mentioning that coloring was the only thing to bring them peace. lacking any supplies, i thought about walking to cvs to buy an ""adult"" coloring book and pack of colored pencils. i don't know how i managed to get myself out of the house, but once i stepped outside into the fresh air and sunshine, i began feeling a small sense of relief. i don't know if it came from the fresh air or the fact that i somehow regained control of my body, but the ounce of relief i felt was undeniable. as i made my way to cvs, my mindset slowly began changing from its state of overwhelming panic to a state of comfort. i didn't feel quite like i could see the light at the end of the tunnel, but i knew it was there and slowly approaching. recognizing the difference helped ease my mind and slow my rapid heartbeat. i walked into cvs and made my way to the school supply section. the shelves were completely ransacked and mostly empty and my panic began creeping back as i realized back to school is upon us. i scoured through the disarray of what was left and managed to find the last coloring book (lucky for me it came with a pack of colored pencils). i went straight to checkout and headed home, protecting my coloring book as if it was a winning lottery ticket. when i got home i plugged in my noise-cancelling headphones and turned on some therapy music and got right to work on a heart-shaped bouquet of filling in the last flower made me feel as though i had left all of my anxious thoughts and feelings on the paper and replaced them with a colorful bouquet of happiness. at first i was skeptical that coloring of all things would help, but it did! it was incredibly helpful in changing my focus from my anxious thoughts to careful concentration of coloring. i would absolutely recommend it to anyone who needs to distract themselves from their anxious thoughts. even writing this post a day later has been therapeutic and has made me realize that things do get better. i will definitely be keeping a coloring book and pencils handy in case of another emergency! update: thank you everyone for all of your support! just had the interview and i think it went well! the questions were surprisingly difficult but i think i answered them to the best of my knowledge and handled it with grace. at the end, before i could ask about ""next steps"" the interviewer said they would let the team know about our call and she would contact me later this week with next steps. i'm hoping this is a good sign, but i will keep you posted! thanks again for your support, /r/anxiety! &lt;3",anxiety,1

( this was a huge step) 2. hang out with friends and do this a lot ( if you don't have any just go to the nearest coffee shop drink your lemonade and watch people passing by 3. eat mostly clean but if you crave something just do it once or twice a week. 4. meditate at least 15 minutes a day ( especially when times are bad is when you need it. ) 5. go exercise. i can't stress this enough it has helped boosting my mood and my self - esteem a lot 6. sauna, jacuzzi, massage . do those, sometimes the tension we feel is trapped inside of our bodies and we really need someone to get it out 7. force yourself to go outside the house everyday even walking 5 minutes. 8. rest and do this a lot, don't find this as an excuse to proscastinate but really take a break you might be doing too much and some things people do efforless we put to much energy and struggle to do it and that burns as off. just rest. play your favorite video game, have a beer if you like, talk to someone just take a break. 9. talk to people: just say hi and contunue your day, this will help you understand that people are not monsters and they won't bite you. 10. always remember that you are awesome and your life it's the most precious and important thing you have and at the end it's you vs you, bad times maybe here and you think now that they won't surpass but do remember and believe that it will get better and it **will** you just have to help yourself. edit: i hope this helps, take care guys please! edit 2: oh oh oh and don't forget to be patient!! that's really really important.",anxiety,1

24e6336b-466b-4cbe-8909-ced850e91f4f,"i'm in new york. a co-ed room with 2 bunk beds. a total of four single beds. above me, there's a middle aged taiwanese woman who only arrived maybe an hour ago. she can barely speak english, and is calling me ""tom from london""...i'm not from london. in the other bunk, the lower bed is empty, and the upper bunk is taken by a half-good looking foreign guy from a place i don't know and haven't really had the chance to find out yet. maybe ten minutes ago, the taiwanese lady squatted on the floor next to my bed and proceeded to tell me she was drunk. or ""very drink"" in her own words. she then said, i think, that she didn't think she was pretty enough for new york or london, and asked for my opinion on her appearance. always a dicey question to answer, anyway, and i had to explain it in a way that someone who can't speak english would understand. so i said, ""yes. you are...pretty. you nice."" to which she cooed and blushed in the cheeks. still squatting, the front door to our room opens and bangs up against her-it's the foreign guy. taiwanese girl, now shaken and embarrassed by being found on the floor, quickly climbs the ladder next to my face, stroking me on the chest and leaning across me to kiss me on the cheek and say goodnight. she giggled and danced up the ladder. the foreign guy also climbed up to his bed. i'd say maybe 2 minutes later, the lights had been switched off and i could hear mumbled and possibly broken english, but too mumbled to understand, coming from the upper bunks. i thought nothing of it, until the sound of moist lips groping another set of lips. clearly they were kissing across the gap in the bunks, which just so happens to be directly above my head. **edit**; the blankets of the beds are now moving around as if someone was struggling to get comfortable in bed, and deep breathing has started. i'm not a moron, so i can tell that i'm about to be an unwanted guest at a live sex show. **edit**; there's now a deep, heavy breathing, definitely female. what's confusing me here is, i haven't felt very healthy today so have spent the majority of the afternoon on my bed, watching netflix. the girl and guy have never met...until now. so, fair play to him. **edit**; they're talking again, this guy needs to learn how to shut up and get the job done. **edit**; the girl has stood up and climbed over to the other bunk. here we go. **edit**; i'm pretty sure he's eating her out. **edit**; yep, definitely eating her out. she moaned a little bit, but nothing crazy, and then she giggled. **edit**; it's only just occurred to me that i could have been eating her out right now, she was coming on to me, but apparently i'm too english to realise. **edit**; this is no word of a lie, i let out the smallest of farts. i couldn't help it. it wasn't too loud, but audible. i think they ignored it. **edit**; there's a quiet bang on the wall, followed by a sort of ""huh"" exhale noise. the bad thing here is, it's too awkward to just get up and walk out. that'd be insane. looks like i'm here for the long haul. **edit**; 90% sure he's just opened a condom wrapper. nice touch. this guy thinks of the future. **edit**; an iphones text noise has gone off twice and a camera flash has gone off twice. it's lit up the whole room. whatever they're doing, it's being recorded in pov. **edit**; the girl just climbed back down the ladder opposite my face, leant in up close to my head and said it's time for me to sleep, doing the two hands under her chin sign language for sleep. who does this bitch think she is, giving me a bed time. **edit**; the girl went to the bathroom, i think. i fear this may be dead and buried. **edit**; okay, this just took a strange turn. the girl returned from the bathroom, and sat next to me, perched on the edge of the bed. she said, ""tom, i don't think i am pretty enough for you. england...london people don't like asha people."" ""no,"" i said, ""we do."" she cooed again and kissed my knee. ""tom. can you give me a kiss? just one kiss."" this was the weirdest thing that's happened to me since getting here. ""erm,"" i said, ""yes."" she leant in, her mouth wide open and i was officially scared. then her tongue came out, and it sort of bashed against my lips the way you'd imagine the alien from alien to kiss you. it was awful. she leant back, looked me in the eye and collapsed onto my chest. she leant back up. ""tom, me...i am very lonely. i do not like here in america. in new york. but i like london."" she kissed me again, and by kiss, i mean she smashed her tongue against me. she kept going on and on about how she doesn't feel pretty to london people, and when she asked how far away from london do i live, i said 2 hours, she got very excited. she points up to the other bunk, where the other guy is. ""him, erm. him is from messico, and he want to date. he want me girlfriend. buuuuuut, i don't like. i like london people."" she smashed her tongue against me once more, and said, ""tom, today. tomorrow and tomorrow. you my boyfriend? i be your girlfriend."" oh shit. ""i very lonely in new york."" i said, ""yes, okay."" ""are you single? you have girlfriend?"" ""yes, i'm single."" at that she got very excited and reiterated that we were a couple for the next two days. i think she'd been eating tuna, or something because that's all i can taste. for the last time, she smashed her tongue against me, said goodnight, and slunk off back up the ladder. that's it. i think she's asleep now, and i'm too afraid to sleep. thanks for reading **edit**; okay, today hasn't gone down half as creepy as last night. although, this morning to wake me up, she tapped me on the shoulder and when i woke up and turned round to see, she was smiling at me and saying good morning. lovely couple. **edit**; for those who wanted to keep updated with this, i was out all day (not with her) and returned to the hostel at maybe 11pm, this was when i saw her in the bar stroking the leg of another guy. they then got up and walked up the stairs. my first thought was that i would find them screwing in my bed, but when i got up there, she wasn't there, and i didn't see her all night. when i woke up this morning, she was gone, along with her stuff. i assume she's left.",none,5

7aec4993-533b-4226-925d-a16161641e48,"i want to lobby the state legislature to reform welfare and institutions code §§ 5150, et seq (involuntary holds- “et seq” basically means “and the statutes that follow”) i know, i know. hypomanic goals. hear me out. i have three primary reasons for this: 1) inadequate care of the actual acute psychiatric emergencies of patients— which i have heard plenty of anecdotal tales in addition to personal experience 2) the lantermam petris short act which created 5150, et seq was great for its time. it made it so that people could not be institutionalized against their will and there was a “due process” in place limiting holds to 3, 14, and 30 days and only under specified conditions. however, over 50 years later, these holds can be practically if not absolutely punitive or punishment. once you’re in, you can’t get out, and the more you plead your sanity, the more insane you are treated. “5150” is used nationally as a slur against mental illness. the entire statutory scheme perpetuates stigma while providing little to no valuable care to those who are subjected to the holds. 3) corporate greed and laziness. because hospitals can easily bill for involuntary holds, why try any harder to improve acute mental health care? patients are often put on 5250 holds (14 additional days) on these extended holds, we are entitled to a hearing within a certain time frame. hospitals will often hold a patient as long as possible and release them right before the hearing. (again, anecdotal stories and personal experience.) 5150, et seq needs to be shaken up so that these corporations can no longer rely so readily on the easy income of an involuntary hold. the law needs to be reformed to both hold them accountable and force them to change and adapt their business models to provide alternative services that give us patients dignity and agency. yes, i have thought this through a lot. i have been thinking about this since i was first hospitalized in 2009. then i finished my psychology degree. went to law school. became a lawyer. and i spend my days researching and using and criticizing all kinds of california law. 👏🏽👏🏽 i’m ready. so if you live in california, this is my request: if you are comfortable, please share your experiences, negative and positive, with involuntary holds. if you have been lucky enough to avoid involuntary holds with an alternative intensive therapy, you can share that, too. also i welcome any legal or policy insights whether you’re a lawyer or in the mental health field or just finished high school. bring them all at me. (anecdotes outside of california are appreciated too, but since it’s a state issue, it’s more effective to appeal to legislators with state stories. but feel free to share!) if this reads as a bit hypomanic, you’re probably right. i’ve considered spending an entire weekend just redlining all the statutes and shooting off packet of proposed law to every other assemblyperson in the state. (i had a great aunt i never met who apparently did virtually the same thing with state developmental disability law... successfully. so i guess i inherited a very specific kind of bipolar.) but i’m posting this because i told myself to slow down and get more input. i do have my own frameworks for changing the law in mind but i wanted to pause and try to see if i could get some open forum response on this. either post replies or pm’s are fine. if there’s a character limit issue, feel free to ask me for my email address in pm. thank you all for reading",bipolar,2

4cf923af-150d-4797-abfa-cfefad0e5c77,"this is an x post. hi all, i just need a place to vent. i'm 23 and for as long as i can remember i have been depressed. i remember reading a teen magazine article about depression in middle school and that being my first memory of having a name to what was happening. i've always been described as moody, irritable and low energy. the thing is though, is i've always also been in denial about my depression. even though it was apparent i was experiencing depressive symptoms, i felt it was just because i was a bad person. it's like i can look at all of you and be perfectly able to accept something is mentally wrong and hurting you, but can't turn the same compassion onto myself. i always felt i was the one person in the world who didn't ""deserve"" to say i was depressed. i didn't expect this. i have always been sure this is my own problem and in my control, my inability to control it was always my own fault and continued to ignore obvious and textbook symptoms. i never expected the inverse to happen, that this was more debilitating than i realized. i am just now learning how much this was effecting every corner of my life. i didn't know how much of me this was taking over. so i finally coughed up the money and saw a psychiatrist and got on some amazing medication. it's been a little over a week and i'm already feeling the effects. i'm trying not to put all my eggs in one basket and keep a healthy level of skepticism about possible placebo effects i may be feeling, but i can't help but feel all these intense feelings of desperation for the medication to work. i'm in this uncomfortable in between stage where the medication has started to work but not taken full effect. i have this sudden clarity, but i am still depressed. it feels very unstable, because my brain can't help but shut down and feel hopeless at any sign or symptom of depression and it makes me so scared it often sends me into an episode. all these memories are now bubbling to surface now to, of just things i've said or done under the influence of depression that i am ashamed or guilty of. my therapist said this is normal and i believe her, but it just feels so awful. my medication tackles depression symptoms most, so now as they are slowly dwindling some hypomania has appeared. i'm not complaining because it makes me driven and energetic and a bit wired but then i crash. i crashed pretty badly yesterday, i could feel myself slipping and it is one of the most distressing and all too familiar feelings i have expirienced. it's so distressing. i'm rapid cycling. ive been both manic and depressed twice in the last 8 days. depression is still in control, however, so with this sudden clarity i have been sent into a few depressions over what could have been. i am feeling this intense frustration with myself and every professional i have gone to because this slipped under the radar for so long. i know bipolar ii is incredibly difficult to diagnose, my manic symptoms went unnoticed for 23 years, it wasn't until i got on this medication that i could start differentiating relief or anxiety from mania- and the constant presence of mixed states muddies everything. so i'm irrationally frustrated, but i can't help but fixate in how much time was wasted suffering like this being a nothing person. i was unwilling to admit i needed help and so ready to punish myself for two decades that i rejected medication vehemently most of my life. i ignored any concerning symptoms and family history because i felt i deserved this pain and regularly brushed off symptoms because of misinterpretation and just unwillingness to research into them for fear of being confronted with the fact that i was a ""sham"" for saying i had depression to everyone when i was just a shitty person. i wonder what would have happened, who i could have been if i had done something about this sooner. i almost failed out of high school because i was so depressed, i dropped out of college because i couldn't function. i have never had a hobby or interest in much of anything at all and now i'm finding it's incredibly difficult to start from nothing as an adult. i feel like such an empty person. a blank slate in the worst way, because it didn't have to be like this. i could have graduated, i could have learned a different language or taken up guitar lessons. i could have read so many books through the years had i been able to concentrate and care. i've missed out on so much and it paralyzes me. i feel this uncomfortable mix of shame, guilt, regret and frustration. i know it's only going to go up from here as the medication takes more effect, but i am in such a emotional state right now i want to crawl out of my own skin.",bipolar,2

(details on request.) for this, i was severely punished both at school and at home. some other complicating issues include some then-undiagnosed “invisible disabilities,” as well as equally large and unusual (but very different) types of abuses at the next school i attended. therapists have been hard to convince that this was all real (“i can’t believe that any conceivable set of parents would pick out a school for you and then forbid you to do half of the work, while still insisting you must get perfect grades”) — and, once i do convince them (paying for the privilege meanwhile), they basically say that my case isn’t the kind of thing that they know about or can confidently make referrals for. (one therapist said: “i should probably refer you to a colleague, but frankly i don’t have any colleagues whom i hate enough to dump your problems onto them.” another said: “we don’t yet know nearly enough about combinations of issues like yours. you need to come back on about 50 years or so, when more will be known.” i pointed out that i was already in my 40s [i’m now 57], so wouldn’t be scheduling 50 years ahead. she just sighed and told me that this would therefore be my last session.) so i will continue to look for therapists (a few already turned me down when i searched for video therapy a bit earlier this year), but i think it might help if i could find anyone who has, or might have, problems like me: because maybe i could get better ideas about how to find the right therapist. please get back to me if you have any ideas or just want to talk.",ptsd,4

don't tell me my flight has been delayed 7 hours. i get to the desk and ask, and they say to me: &amp;nbsp; ""hello mr. wang, the flight has been delayed because the flight crew has not shown up. additionally, since you are on an award ticket, i cannot place you on the 17:40 flight, and [will have to put you on the flight for the next :| fine. my sleep deprivation and less than stellar chinese skills cause me to just accept my fate. i go to the hilton @ beijing airport and stay the entire day and night. i'm able to board my flight the next morning without a hitch. &amp;nbsp; *march 23rd, 2:00am utc. 10:00am cst.* *25.5 hours.* &amp;nbsp; i somehow got stuck with the middle seat in economy on this flight. i find my left hand seat mate is a [rather large no worries, he's nice and i am a pretty skinny guy myself so i don't mind too much, as long as the guy to my right isn't taking up too much space. as soon as i think this, almost on cue, another gentleman who was at least 30% larger than the one on my left starts walking down the aisle. i thought to myself, ""wow, wouldn't that suck if he sat next to me?"" at this point, i was still brave enough to tempt fate. &amp;nbsp; turns out, the fellow walking down and the man to my left know each other. the man walking down is scanning the row numbers, until his eyes narrow on… &amp;nbsp; my row. &amp;nbsp; as he squeezes in to his seat, i am faced with a dilemma, i try to squeeze my shoulders in, but i am stuck between these two men and i have no space to myself, literally touching their shoulders, no matter how i contort myself. i contemplate crying, or asking to switch seats, or both. as i’m trying to decide the best way to hide my tears, an angel with blonde hair and a blue aa uniform walks down and asks the man to my right if he would like to move to a more comfortable seat, as, she says, “it looks a bit cramped in here.” she must have sensed the desperation in my eyes - either that or the nervous sweat that was now accumulating in my armpits. &amp;nbsp; he moved, i sat on the other aisle seat, and the rest of the flight was uneventful. little did i know that this was an omen, a sign of worse to come. &amp;nbsp; *march 23rd, 3:30pm utc. 10:30am est.* *39 hours.* &amp;nbsp; we land in chicago and i run to catch my flight to miami. &amp;nbsp; i get to the gate, it’s a long process to board the plane since the overhead compartments are smaller than normal and people are struggling to fit their luggage in. as soon as everyone is done and settled in, we hear an announcement. &amp;nbsp; “sorry folks, it turns out that the lavatories on board this aircraft are not functional. due to faa regulations, this plane cannot fly. we apologize for the inconvenience. everyone must now deboard.” &amp;nbsp; cries of anger are heard throughout the plane. why did they wait until everyone was on board and settled? the plane had been sitting at the gate for an hour, had no one gone and checked? why do airlines suck? of course, asking these questions is futile. &amp;nbsp; the plane ends up taking off two hours later. &amp;nbsp; we land at mia at around 5:15pm. my flight to barbados takes off at 6pm so i'm not too worried. we hear the captain: “sorry folks all the gates are full, we're currently trying to get you all an open spot. should be about five minutes.” no problem, i still have plenty of time to catch my flight. &amp;nbsp; five minutes go by. &amp;nbsp; ten minutes go by. &amp;nbsp; it's 20 minutes until we hear the captain again. &amp;nbsp; “sorry folks, the plane just left the gate. should be another three to four minutes.” &amp;nbsp; i know this game. we are the proverbial children on the car ride, asking “are we there yet? are we there yet?” and the captains, just to appease us, keep saying “just five more minutes. no, i know it’s been five minutes - i meant five minutes from *now.*” &amp;nbsp; of course, the “three to four minutes” takes another 20 minutes. we finally start going to the gate. it’s too late, i’ve already accepted my fate - my plane takes off at 6pm, i get out of the plane at 6:10pm. i go to the ticket counter to get a new ticket, and the man tells me that the barbados flight is actually right next door - and to run, since the plane is still there. &amp;nbsp; it takes me ten seconds to run there. i get there and i see. this is my plane. they refuse to let me on because the door has closed. i don't even try to fight it since i know that there is no way they will let me on board. i am so close, yet so far. fate had dangled a carrot in front of my nose, then pushed me down into the dirt, ate the carrot itself, and gave me a voucher to a shitty hotel along with its “sincere apologies”. &amp;nbsp; i use my meal voucher to order a chicken sandwich from burger king. she rings it up and i am actually 30 cents short. i had to pay 30 cents for my crappy airport chicken sandwich. &amp;nbsp; i get on a shuttle to my hotel and open up the reese’s pie i had also ordered. [it turns out it was a this is the cherry on the shit pie - i wanted some god damn peanut butter, and i can’t even have that. i turn on transformers 2 on the hotel tv so that i feel marginally less alone. i pretend shia labeouf is my friend, but like everything else good in my life, we both know that he’ll entertain me for two hours and get up and leave without saying goodbye. &amp;nbsp; i wake up, eat the hotel breakfast, get on my shuttle, and get to the airport. i am 2 hours early, so i hit up the centurion lounge. [i get a rum and - even though it’s 7am here, it’s 6pm in thailand, so technically i’m not an alcoholic. &amp;nbsp; *march 24th, 12:00 noon utc. 7:00am est.* *59.5 hours.* &amp;nbsp; i finish up my meal and head to my flight. we board without incident. i am on edge, knowing something is going to be wrong. and, if you've read this far into my story, you can probably guess what's going to happen. &amp;nbsp; we are informed by the captain that... ... the air traffic control in barbados is having a strike, and they have closed down the whole airport. &amp;nbsp; he does not know how long we are going to be stuck. after half an hour of waiting, he tells us: &amp;nbsp; ""uhh, folks, looks like we'll be departing a bit later than we planned. at least **four hours later.**"" &amp;nbsp; he gives us permission to leave this aa metal prison. i leave, go back to the lounge again, grab some lunch then proceed to get a free massage and very, very drunk. &amp;nbsp; i was supposed to make it to barbados at 9pm on march 22nd. it is now, if everything goes well, supposed to be 6pm on march 24th. &amp;nbsp; i have been defeated by aa. &amp;nbsp; *march 24th, 5:30pm utc. 12:30pm est.* *65 hours.* &amp;nbsp; and, as you probably can guess, everything did not go well. the flight went from showing up as a boarding time of 2:30pm to being showed as ""cancelled"". i stood in line at rebooking for half an hour and turns out all flights are canceled because the airport in barbados is still closed. i managed to be one of the very few people from the original 10am flight to get on the 10am flight for tomorrow, march 25th. the agent felt bad for me so she booked me, while there were 60 people on standby on that flight. the family next to me had their flight rebooked to saturday - a full two days after. unbelievable. this will add 21 hours to my ordeal, and i will be up to 86 hours in this cluster fuck. and yes, i'm staying another night in the same hotel. &amp;nbsp; i realize that this is not all aa's fault. they couldn't have seen the barbados strike coming, and it was procedure that i am not allowed on a plane that closed its doors. i have no problems with that. and to be fair, they did give me vouchers for food and a hotel. but i believe that should be the bare minimum. the two instances where i believe aa was at fault was in beijing, where the airline staff just didn't show up and because i booked an award ticket they pushed my flight a day back, and in chicago, where they didn't have mechanics check to make sure the bathrooms were working. the plane had been sitting on the tarmac for an hour and no one bothered to check, causing us to be very late.",none,5

a8fcf8b8-b146-4284-92d6-ea8e7a83e761,"hi reddit! the international ocean discovery program (iodp) conducts scientific ocean drilling expeditions throughout the world’s oceans in search of clues to earth’s structure and past. many people will know the basics of the theory of plate tectonics, but fewer know that this keystone of science was built with the contributions of different researchers and ocean research expeditions. in school textbooks it may appear as if everything has already been discovered. this is not even close to the truth! of course, the big picture of plate tectonics is well known but there are many areas of the oceans that still need to be explored and investigated. for example, how do continents break apart and allow a new ocean to form? there are at least two possible models already proposed. one is a ""magma-rich"" model, like iceland, where the continental lithosphere was burnt out by huge amounts of magma in a short time. the other one is ""mantle-exhumed,"" (many people call it magma-poor) model, like newfoundland and iberia, where the continental breakup is purely by extension. due to lack of magma, the continent mantle was exhumed after the crust breakup and before the new ocean formed. which tectonic model is the one in action in the south china sea? one of these two already known or even a third one? this is the main goal of expedition 367 (and 368 also) in the south china sea (scs). by drilling along the scs rifted margin scientists want to understand the mechanisms of lithosphere extension during continental breakup in a magma-poor rifted margin. only the sediments in the seafloor and their underlying rocks contain the answers to this question. the scientists, technicians, and crew of expedition 367 will drill them and seek, like detectives, for clues that will reveal another piece of the amazing jigsaw puzzle that is the plate tectonic theory. an international team of scientists is on board the joides resolution – the nation’s only research vessel dedicated to scientific ocean drilling -- for two months exploring these questions. **we'll be back at 10 am est to answer your questions. ask us anything!**",none,5
3a4467bf-58da-4b39-b254-9fd9e26f9ead,"one thing i've learnt over the years of trying to fight my anxiety, is that no matter how many times you think or say to yourself ""this isn't fair!"" ""why should i have to beat this?"" ""why me?"", it doesn't change the fact that you have anxiety. your anxiety will be as bad as it is and won't get better unless you do something about it. now don't get me wrong, i'm not going to say ""just get over it"" because believe me i understand just how hard it can get. the panic attacks, the nausea or being sick, the fear. constant headaches, stomach aches, muscle pain, insomnia, paranoia, depressive thoughts, self harm and so on and so forth. i get it, i really do. for over a year i spent most of my time in my bedroom, i'd go to the doctors, i'd go to therapy, i'd take meds. but nothing would help. i thought i was an exception to rule, i thought i would never get better. well let me tell you now, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. but you have to get there, you have to push yourself every single day to get things done. yes, you will have panic attacks. yes, you will fail a lot at the beginning. yes, it is going to be really hard and unfair. but, you can do it. you have to do it. take a walk everyday, longer and longer each time to get used to being outside. meet up with a safe friend and ask them to help you in uncomfortable situations. talk to your doctor about medication, even if you're scared of taking it. they will understand and will know how to help you. medication can be rough, but once it kicks in it can really help. exercise. i know everyone says it, but it really does work. even just walking everyday is going to make you feel and look better, and it does wonders for health. don't drink or smoke, or take illegal drugs. they're not helping long term and could very well be the cause of your anxiety. give therapy a try, be it talking therapy or cbt. and actually follow their instructions and suggestions. if you don't try, you won't know if it will work or not. if you do try, at least you're doing something. my last tip, never give up. never let the anxiety keep you at square one. because you are literally the only person that can get you off that square. there will be bad days, there will be good days. but hold onto your progress, nurture it, be proud of it. good luck and much love to all! edit: with some feedback from people feeling like i'm generalising or offering my advice as fact, this isn't a post for everyone with anxiety. this is a post that i am hoping will help some who are struggling to accept their anxiety, or who are apprehensive to try and change their lifestyle around anxiety. not everyone will benefit from this, and i appreciate that. take this post with a pinch of salt and apply to your own situation. anxiety isn't forever, but be prepared to change to make it that way.",anxiety,1

1740ad5d-df56-4c90-a2d7-f4849be2ff02,"donnie darko is one of my favorite films of all time. if you haven't seen it, stop reading this, go watch it. it's on netflix. significant spoilers follow. also: i will be using ""manic"" interchangeably to mean hypomanic or manic, for brevity's sake. donnie is a dissatisfied, schizophrenic teenager in sleepy middlesex, anystate usa. up until a giant bunny rabbit named frank warns him that the world is going to end in just over 28 days. this prophecy seems to inspire donnie into taking actions that, he believes, will save the universe as it should exist, with him at the center of everything that transpires. until this happens, though, donnie's disillusionment with the simplistic schemas of life that are presented to him deepen, and his frustration grows. an outlet for this is his english teacher's class. ms. pomeroy, the teacher, assigned graham greene's ""the destructors"" to the class to read. in offering his thoughts, donnie says that, ""destruction is a form of creation... they just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart. they want to change things."" from being challenged with what is arguably difficult literature, from a thematic point of view, donnie is subsequently subjected by another teacher, kitty farmer, to a self-help guru's model of life, based on two things: fear and love. because, you know, 10 year old boys wet the bed out of fear, but stop because of love. /s when asked to rate a moral dilemma on this incredibly narrow scale, donnie objects. i think the entire exchange is worth reproducing below: &gt;donnie: well, life isn't that simple. i mean, who cares if ling ling returns the wallet and keeps the money? it has nothing to do with either fear or love. &gt;kitty farmer: fear and love are the deepest of human emotions. &gt;donnie: okay. but you're not listening to me. there are other things that need to be taken into account here, like the whole spectrum of human emotion. you can't just lump everything into these two categories and then just deny everything else. woah. stop the presses. this really hit me hard. i've seen this movie several times, but this is my first time watching it since being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. and this really jumped out at me: **""you can't just lump everything into these two categories and then just deny everything else.""** early in my diagnosis, and even to a degree now, i tried to identify my bipolarity in everything i could. i'm feeling energetic, am i hypo? i'm feeling sad, am i depressed? i had an impulsive thought! is that a sign that things are developing? i feel energetic after drinking coffee! shit, i'm definitely hypo. and on and on. i've also seen this overidentification, this overanalyzing of what can be, and often are, normal human emotions and behaviors on the bipolar subreddits. and that makes sense why we would be so introspective: bipolar disorder is insidious, and it affects almost every aspect of our lives. but we are not manic or depressed. we are not euthymic or manic. we are not depressed or euthymic. it's just not that simple. it's unfair to us individually to ascribe every feeling or thought we have as due to bipolar disorder. it is, in a word, damning, and denies us our right to claim our own feelings and experiences as uniquely ours. the way i think about my mood swings is they're like a funhouse mirror: they take what i normally feel and experience and blow it up, distort it in a hundred different ways. but it's transient. it always is. that's the nature of bipolar disorder. doesn't it make sense, then, that emotions and feelings and thoughts that we have before an episode, that we may also have in an episode, and after, could just be us, and not influenced from the disorder? it is also damaging, i think, to try to define ourselves in terms of manic, depressed, or euthymic. ""i'm manic so i am doing..."" as opposed to ""i am in a manic state of mind."" defining ourselves, thinking of ourselves, as manifesting all of what our mood state outlines, or believing that because we are in a particular state of mind that we must behave manic or depressed, is another form of overidentification that is, i think, worse than overattributing our own experiences to the disorder. i've done this before, unfortunately, with more than just this. when i came out as gay, for a while i thought, ""well, i'm gay so i should be having sex with other men all the time, otherwise i won't be gay."" illogical and stupid, but that's where i was at that time. and i had a brief moment of that same kind of thinking when i was newly diagnosed bipolar, as well. i tried to identify exactly where i was and what i was feeling, and what was thus incumbent upon me to do or act because of my mood state. it's just not that simple. we crave order and structure. we need things to make sense, to know the rules, to understand them. however, when we receive our diagnosis and in every moment of self reflection afterwards, we are applying destruction as a form of creation to our previous way of thinking and seeing the world, seeing ourselves, seeing our illness...and trying to find a way to make it better. ultimately, defining ourselves **in terms of** our disorder is unhelpful and possibly ruinous, while defining ourselves...and understanding that we have an illness, and that it affects our behavior, thinking, and a whole host of other things, empowers us with the knowledge and understanding of what is going on when we are in the midst of an episode. most importantly, allowing ourselves the room to feel normal emotions, and **not** immediately ascribe them to bipolar disorder, is one of the kindest things we can do for ourselves. a major theme of donnie darko is time travel. i've often thought about my disorder, and my personal history. how it might have been different if i had been hospitalized as a kid (as i should have been), if i had been on the proper medication (or at least not on welbutrin), if i had been undergoing treatment in college, if if if... while donnie does manage to perform an act of time travel, saving the parallel universe and dooming his own, that is not possible for us. surely things would have been different if we knew of our disorder earlier and were receiving treatment sooner. our attitudes, our experiences, our perceptions, everything might have been different. but every day we travel in time--forward. and while we can't change the past, we can learn from it, our bipolar past experiences and our normal, human past experiences, and use them to tear the world apart...so we can build it better than it ever was before.",bipolar,2

2789c0e6-cc6f-459a-abeb-00285652d89c,"i've been planning a small birthday get-together for myself and a few friends tonight, including my ldr boyfriend. i saw him last weekend and accidentally gave him my cold. he texted me this morning to say he can't make it tonight, and it feels like my entire world has shattered. i've been crying for nearly three hours, hedging whether to cancel everything or force myself to go. i have to go at this point (too late to cancel), and i'm struggling to stop crying. things haven't been good lately. in fact, just about everything is going wrong. i'm losing my job in two weeks (layoff), which i guess is fine because i've grown to hate it. i've been job-searching for over six months now; gotten four interviews and zero offers. at this point, if i do get a job in my field, i'm probably going to have to relocate somewhere rural, which is horrible for my mental health. my relationship isn't going great, especially since the ldr will get worse if i have to relocate. i don't feel like i can open up to my bf about what i'm feeling, in part because his best friend is also going through tough times and leaning hard on him, and in part because i'm not sure if i love him even after 10 months together (although i wouldn't be this devastated if i didn't love him on some level, i guess). i had hobbies and corresponding friends that i've had to abandon for financial reasons with the impending layoff. i'm $5k in credit card debt and $30k in student loan debt, neither of which i can tackle with only two paychecks left to my name. i'm losing my insurance at the end of august, but i keep catching colds, strep, and other bugs - i've been sick nonstop for nearly three weeks and i'm losing my mind over it. i also have an unrelated long-term degenerative health problem that makes me feel certain that i will kill myself at a relatively young age (40s/50s) once the symptoms and complications become too much to manage. i'm turning 26 tomorrow, but i feel like i'm processing my emotions at a toddler's level. i've lost track of when it started, but for at least the past month, i break down in tears at least daily, usually 2-3 times. every little thing makes me start crying or irritates me to the point of shouting or slamming things. even though i'll see my bf again within two weeks, i feel inconsolable that he won't be here tonight. i'm terrified that i'm going to start crying again some time tonight. i just need to get through tonight, and advice on that would be useful. thank you. **edit:** i went out to my gathering (cried once in the restroom halfway through but pulled it together and had a pretty good time overall), and woke up this morning to an unbelievable outpouring of support and kindness – i truly never expected to get this much attention or reassurance from total strangers. thank you so much to everyone who responded; i feel overwhelmed in a positive way and hope to pay it forward to this community once my own storm passes. i am so grateful to everyone who took the time even just to say that they were/are in a similar place and sympathized. this means the world to me - you’ve made my birthday substantially brighter than i was expecting, and you’ve turned today into one of the good days. thank you all so much!",depression,3

f7e135e3-c5b7-4b8a-9511-f4d684dfdb89,"so, last month my therapist deemed me well enough to author my trauma impact statement. during one of the lesser months of my trauma calendar (deceased daughter's birthday, 1st anniversary of a friend rage-quitting life). it nearly killed me. in fact, i emailed my therapist during the process and he told me that it was triggering me and i wasn't ready. so, of course i finished it. that day. within two hours.

5675a334-8a98-44c5-96af-702c6b539b36,"i posted this as a reply in a thread in /r/malefashionadvice where someone was wondering what clothes to pack for a trip to europe, and even though i was a bit late to the thread, i got quite a few pms asking me to elaborate or thanking me for this, so i figured i'd post it here, too, in hopes that it may help fellow travelers. if you have any questions or need any clarification, please don't hesitate to ask. i'm a former travel photographer who is forever plagued by wanderlust. i've gone on trips ranging from a yearlong trip through south and southeast asia to 3 trips to europe over the past 5 months. i've been to 40+ countries, and i'm sharing what i've learned during my journeys. this is general advice, but moreso for 1st world travel. i've spent significant amounts of time in the developing world, so if you have any questions pertaining to that, i'm happy to help. i certainly don't claim to know it all, and packing is a very personal thing, so apologies in advance for anyone who disagrees with my advice, but i'm hoping this will be helpful to some. **layer.** rather than carrying one giant coat that will only work when it gets truly cold, bring a few warm layers that can all be layered together. an apolis chore coat and a good shell works great together (insulated and weatherproof), but both serve their own purposes when worn separately. **wool.** it doesn't stink, doesn't get too wrinkly, wicks sweat, insulates when cold, and insulates well in general. icebreaker makes great merino wool t-shirts that can work as a general tee (even in the summer) as well as a base layer when hiking away from cities. a wool sweater is as insulating as a hooded sweatshirt, but can also work in a more formal environment. wool socks, too. you can wear them day after day, and they'll resist being smelly and will do a better job at mitigating foot sweat than virtually anything else. costco's quasi-smartwool (kirkland branded) hiking socks are cheap and good. **2 pairs of pants.** 1 pair of dark slim-fitting denim and 1 pair of chinos. chinos will get you through museums and fancy restaurants (they may not be suit-pants like the locals, but you're still showing respect, even at a michelin-starred restaurant). i recommend grey, as it's about the most versatile color out there. the [outlier is a great option for these (albeit expensive), as they can work for when you're hiking if you plan on getting out there, as well as dining at a fancier restaurant. the nice denim works everywhere else, as the entire world wears denim (from the hottest states in india to paris or milan during fashion week), and it can take a beating and tends to hide stains. in warmer weather, bring a pair of shorts...the more versatile the better. rather than bringing a separate swimsuit, just bring a pair of outlier shorts, as they're dual purpose. **ocbds.** virtually the entire world wears collared shirts, and they can work in warm or cold climates (roll up the sleeves in the summer). bring one more than you think you'll need, as you'll likely end up staining one. (ocbd stands for ""oxford cloth button down"" and is formal enough for a night out but relaxed enough for a safari). you can get one made out of a more technical fabric or made of wool if you want to spend extra money, but i tend to stain shirts more than any other piece of clothing, so i generally go for cheaper shirts. **airism undershirts.** wicking, lightweight, and they pack small. cheaper than the fancier stuff, but still work really well. deep v-neck to prevent your undershirt from showing through on collared shirts. they also work wonderfully when hiking in warm clients or going for a run. [i like these **comfortable shoes.** a good pair of properly broken-in boots with a reasonable sole (i prefer the vibram 430) can work anywhere (nice restaurant to trails) and is my ideal, as they're classic and versatile, as well as being dual-purpose (hiking and dining). i generally recommend bringing a second option, both for the longevity of the shoes and to prevent blistering on consecutive long days with extensive walking. some people like a comfortable running shoe, but no matter what, make sure they're comfortable. **ex-officio underwear.** they don't stink, dry super quickly (shower in them at night, hang them up, and they'll be dry in the morning), and breathe well. a few pairs should be enough. are what i wear. **dark colors.** it hides sweat well, hides dirt well, and is generally considered a bit classier. textured fabrics can further help to hide stains, as they'll blend in with the mottled colors in the clothing. if you plan on hiking in warmer climates, bring one lighter colored shirt for that, to reflect sun rather than attract it. white is the enemy, as it will undoubtedly get stained...and unless you bring everything in white, dealing with bleach is just a pain in the ass. **bandanas.** not to be seen by the general public, but they work well as a handkerchief/sweat-rag, as well as sun protection when away from the city/people. **duffle bag.** half-full, and it can be used as a carryon bag even if the full bag would be way over carryon size. this gives you room to expand (buying things). i prefer [filson as they're classic, rugged, have a lifetime guarantee, and fit in at a campsite as well as a nice hotel. obviously, if you're planning to hike for days on end and are bringing everything, a true backpack makes sense...but barring that, a nice classic duffle looks better, functions better, and helps prevent you from sticking out like a sore thumb. certain trips call for a traditional backpack (if so, the only thing that matters is that it fits you well and has good accessibility to your stuff), but for everything else, i recommend a duffle. there are ""travel bags"" made by eagle creek that have certain features that can be ingenious, but i find those still make you stick out from the crowd. the less black nylon, the better. **female specific:** in many parts of the world, it will help you greatly to bring a long skirt or two, even if you're hiking or doing other physical exercise. if you have to, wear it over your pants, but you'll find that locals will be much more welcoming and open if you're wearing a skirt that covers your knees in an area where every woman where a skirt or dress than you would if you wear pants. my wife found this especially true while hiking in rural himalayan village in nepal and rural india and indonesia. this isn't about women's rights or anything like that, it's purely showing respect for the locals and being seen as one of them. making locals uncomfortable is rarely helpful for anyone involved, both at that moment and for years down the road for future travelers. **roll, don't fold.** roll your clothes. you'll save space, things will be less wrinkled, and it'll be easier to go through your bag. there are youtube videos on this to see more, and to each his/her own, but i have found this works best for me. **fit in.** it's not to be cool, it's so you're not targeted. targeted by thieves, targeted by touts, targeted by front desk staff who can see your desperation at the end of the day from a mile away. hotel fees will go up, you'll get the dreaded tourist menu (with double the rates as the regular menu), etc. the more you look like a local, the more you'll have a locals experience, which imho, is the reason to travel. to see the country the way their own people see it. you're also an ambassador of your country when you travel, so the less loud and obnoxious you can be, the better that will reflect on your country and everyone in it. this also means that you should dress like those around you, not the caricature of that (i.e. no mexican sombreros with dangling balls/fringe), as that can be seen as making fun of the culture and people of the country in which you're traveling. **relax.** generally speaking, you can buy whatever you need while you're abroad. people wear clothes all over the world, and while it may not be your absolute favorite shirt, if you're in need of a new shirt (yours is lost or ruined), you can find one wherever you are. sure, if you're 6'2"" and in japan that might be difficult, but it's still doable. relax and enjoy yourself...there's always a solution, and you're surrounded by people who will be happy to help. *clothing aside, here's a few other thoughts:* **usb drive.** always bring a large usb drive, to backup your photos as you take them, to transfer files from one computer to another, to store movies on an already full hard drive, etc. **unlocked phone.** relying on your home country's data/phone plan will cost you a small fortune, will often be unreliable, and will make you generally unreachable (locals won't want to call internationally to get a hold of you) and stick out (their caller id will be confusing when they get a call from an int'l number). ideally it will also have user replaceable batteries that will allow you to go without power for days on end. buy a local sim card (prepaid) and use all the damn data you want for a reasonable rate. **int'l travel adapter w/ replaceable fuses, plus extra fuses.** you want things to work everywhere/anywhere, and int'l power is often unreliable and can be tempermental (hence the add'l fuses). i recommend [this **surge protector/splitter.** rather than bringing 3 bulky travel adapters, bring one splitter. i recommend [this as it packs small and offers 4 outlets. **incognito passport wallet.** i carry a leather journal cover that fits a fieldnotes journal, and tuck my passport behind the fieldnotes journal when not going through customs. that way, when i leave my passport in my hotel or airbnb, if someone finds it, they think they just found a boring journal. i also keep one credit card here in case my daily wallet is stolen or lost. is the one that i use. i also use two of [these business card stuck to the backside of my field notes journal that's tucked into the pocket, one to hold a hidden credit card and the other to hold some hidden cash, both are separate from my regular wallet and are a just-in-case kinda thing. more on that in a moment. **us dollars.** i usually carry two $100 bills, just in case. i keep these hidden in my passport wallet/journal cover. us dollars are recognized everywhere, and can help to get you out of any jam. (crooked cops, declined debit card, etc) **photocopy of passport in wallet.** in case you're asked to show a passport while out and about and your passport is in your room, this is immensely helpful. scan of passport in email/on phone in case you lose that, or are robbed of everything you own. backups of backups here, as you really just don't want to be without it. **sort credit/debit cards before you leave.** make them aware of when/where you're leaving and which countries you're going to...and pad it with a few days at the end in case you get stuck. don't forget the countries that you have a layover in, as you could get stuck there, too. also, email yourself the international numbers for all your cards, both in case they're declined and in case you're robbed. if you're robbed and the only way to access the number for theft is on the back of the stolen credit card, you're going to have a heck of a time canceling it before the thieves start emptying your accounts. **zip ties and an itinerary (with email address) at the top of your bag.** write a note asking them to use a zip tie to ""lock"" the bag back up if they cut your locks to search your bag. this will help prevent others who aren't involved in security (usually monitored to prevent theft) from rifling through your bag and taking what you want. the itinerary with your email will help a lot more than a generic luggage tag with a phone number that won't reach you while you're abroad. your email won't change no matter where you are. the more info the better...hotel address, local contact/friend's phone number, dates, flight numbers, etc. **no nerdy neck wallet.** you'll be targeted by thieves from a mile away, is incredibly obvious under a shirt, and if someone tries to get it off you, it could potentially involve a knife near your throat when they try to cut the strap. if you want to do something like this, use one of the [small money pouches that has two belt that can be tucked inside of your pants. it's borderline invisible, and won't attract attention. do *not* carry all of your money in there, as it makes a lot more sense to keep it in your normal wallet, as it won't alert thieves to the possibility of a honeypot and you won't look as touristy. **international driver's license.** if you're planning on renting (even something as ""silly"" as an atv), you'll generally have a much easier time and it'll often be much cheaper. you can get one at your local aaa office with $15, a couple passport photos, and showing your state driver's license. you should also figure out international car insurance, as most domestic policies (i have state farm) won't cover you internationally. some credit cards, however, will have this insurance included for free (my barclays card will). bringing a few extra passport photos never hurts, either (worked for my scuba license). *note: this really is aimed at travel to a place where it might matter where you look. when traveling to the developing world, one can often get by with one pair of shorts, a pair of flip flops, and 2 t-shirts, so i understand that one's packing needs can vary greatly based on destination and itinerary. you may find this advice is worth what you paid for it (nothing).* i hope this helps. happy trails.",none,5

c4c501f0-5ecd-433f-8a0e-3e4a5ef756a0,"kind of a long one but here goes. i am depressed, probably for about 6 years now. i came to terms with having it in the last year or so, and i've been getting better since then. i still have such a long way to go, but seeking help for mental health issues does not always go over well in the military. so instead, i'm going to tell my story. feel free to make whatever comments you will. i'm pretty thick skinned and will honestly just ignore any comments i deem negative, while taking in the positive. at the beginning of my senior year of high school, my life was going amazingly. i was spending all my time making music in bands i'd formed with my best friends, and dating a girl i'd liked for years, despite having much stronger feelings for her best friend. i was close with my family, and it felt like nothing was ever going to bring me down. fast forward to the new year, and both of my bands fell apart. seeing as how it was something i had worked on night and day for 5 years, it was especially crushing. i graduated at the end of the semester, still dating aforementioned girl. two months later, i turned 18 and a week after that, my girlfriend took my virginity which was amazing. a month later, the biggest change of my life happened when my mother came to me at 1 am and asked me if i could come into the living room and stay there all night to keep an eye out for my stepfather. (he had played the role of father for me since i was 3 and even adopted me, so by all rights, i considered him my bona fide father.) i was obviously confused, and my mother explained, too mortified to show emotion, that she discovered videos of my sister and her friend bathing and dressing/undressing on his phone. he had been taking them for months by hiding his phone at planned times. she confronted him, and he left without much argument, but took his handgun with him. i laid awake all night, with just a baseball bat to try and use should the need arise. to make an attempt at brevity, what followed over the next year was a series of every member of my family (my mother, brother, sister, and myself) being both stalked and periodically confronting him while waiting for the law to do something. after a few months of that, i knew i had to leave my hometown and preferably take the girlfriend who had stood by me through all of this with me. i enlisted, and left for basic a little less than a year after everything transpired. i left behind friends that cared for me, and a family that was fighting an insurmountable battle, and still regret that to this day. i thought i would find solace and structure in the military, but the stress that it puts the average member through only compounded my emotional situation. i married that girl sometime later after learning at the end of basic that her best friend, who i never stopped caring for, was pregnant and going to get married to her boyfriend. as a caveat, i did feel like i loved her more than her friend, but at this point in time i'm not certain if that was ever true. about a year after that, my stepfather finally got his sentencing. 23 years on 12 counts of sexual misconduct with a minor/possession of child pornography. the next few years were relatively uneventful. i drifted further apart from friends, of course and have had a lot of trouble making new ones in the military (my career field is very dog-eat-dog.) my wife and i finally had a child together, who has honestly been my greatest source of happiness ever since. my marriage is great now, but i still feel deeply for the other woman, despite never acting on it. to make matters worse, i learned recently that my stepfather won an appeals case, and is due to be released from prison this december, and is basically free to stalk my family again, and i'm too far away from home to be there to support them. he's significantly bigger than me, and i always felt intimidated by him, and have recurring nightmares of him which take a great toll on my mental health. that's basically it. i'll answer any questions, but i'm really looking for some support or advice about what to do with any of these situations.",depression,3

&amp;nbsp; &gt;brian here. yesterday’s era of reporters would never have put this garbage out there to begin with. that’s regardless of the topic. in the day when there was the noon hour news, and the six o clock news from 2 or 3 different station editors… well you know….. edited. they threw out crap. multiple instances of crap would result in a firing. now, editors largely scan the article just to make sure it’s a little different from what the other outfits who broke the story are already running. we need to understand that, so we can put a juvenile and unsupported piece of writing where it belongs. &amp;nbsp; are they clueless? &amp;nbsp; no, not clueless, perhaps actually uncaring is closer to the truth. &amp;nbsp; i have found a remarkable and disturbing lack of empathy amongst media folk. there is a distinct sense of superiority in their attitudes, both written and spoken. those who have walked the walk, who have been a cop or a serving soldier and now a journalist are the exception, even their politics are bit wonky but i put that down to the tbis (smile). as are those who openly admit that they too fight depression, anxiety or have a loved one who does. with suffering comes humility. &amp;nbsp; brian here: i’ve done a bit of media in recent years. they are not the enemy. but they do use us as a tool to do their job, so we have to be more savvy and use them just as shrewdly. when they want to entice you to do their piece, they want to hear everything you have to say. and during the interview, very personable. but after that last question is answered, they often bolt without saying goodbye and sprint to the shop to put together whatever it is they wanted to say anyhow, just with snippets and soundbites cut out of your interview to look like you said it. it’s a game. you don’t play unless you know how to play. &amp;nbsp; weaponizing mental health and addictions appears to be par for the course in north american media. the recent election of doug ford to leader of the progressive conservative party of ontario has seen a great wave of weaponized addiction posts. his brother who was famously addicted to cocaine, and doug who used to deal drugs are lampooned by media who in the next breath (i kid you not) say things like, “addicts are people too” and “addiction doesn’t lessen somebody’s humanity”. i honestly laugh out loud at the pomposity and hypocrisy displayed by these moronic pseudo intellectuals. &amp;nbsp; &gt;brian here: very true. if there’s a way to portray the government as not doing enough, or the evil policeman not caring about the downtrodden, trust me you’ll see a piece that is 100% about the trials and tribulations of being an addict. but if the media wants to take you down, suddenly they need to know if back in the sixties, you inhaled when someone passed you a joint. &amp;nbsp; what damage did the awful colby cosh and his witch of an editor, anne marie owens, do to those bravely stumbling towards a decision to ask for a ptsd service dog to get them back to living? how many lives will we lose as a direct result of that asinine piece of shyte? i will tell you because i will be watching and i will be researching, i’ve had enough of this idea that people sit behind their desks and throw darts at those surviving mental health and addictions are easy pickings, because like any bully they go for the weakest and less able to defend themselves. &amp;nbsp; what benefit was there to national post, editor anne marie owens and scribbler colby cosh to not only publishing but then defending that post on ptsd service dogs? the title of which was incendiary, which as they all know creates reactions thus achieving “engagement maximization”. in other words, they used a small group of ptsd service dog owners to drive social media traffic to their media outlet and accounts. modern media seeks to entrap you in a closed-loop and unless you become aware of it, fight it you will succumb. those of you fighting mental health issues need to be aware of this and stop it from drawing you in. &amp;nbsp; &gt;brian here: i have a service dog. i’ve helped others get service dogs. i’m at this very time talking to two individuals who are considering it. they are considering it because they know, for one, that the dog will get them back up off the couch and living again to some degree. and for the other, she routinely sees her attacker and wants to live life again. i’ll help them both. i think they can be put on a better path than they are currently on, with a dog. i can assure you that the dog is not a fashion accessory. it’s not a social conversation instigator but rather leaves you excluded from certain social events. it’s hard. dogs fail. as their handler it feels like you failed. and when they pass, it’s the result of hundreds of dog hours, people hours, trainer hours and many thousands of dollars of donations. i received a donation for 200$ from an old lady at the pentiction anavets club a few years ago, which i of course gave straight to a dog placement foundation that deals with service dogs. this shit article attacks her too, not just me. it calls her foolish for spending money on some veterans fashion accessory. &amp;nbsp; let’s focus on my point on the use by national post of the veteran community to drive traffic to their media accounts: specially, targeting a vulnerable subset of those veterans, veterans with an all too visible symbol of their injury. the first time brian took his ptsd service dog, sasha, out was extremely difficult. now he was visibly broken. i have been enraged by the ignorance and rudeness he has faced with a smile when in public, i am far less polite and unlike sasha, i bite. the damage done by the national post’s cheap and dirty post is incalculable. &amp;nbsp; opening minds was an initiative of the mental health commission of canada to combat the damage being done by media outlets like the national post in their stigmatizing portrayals of those fighting mental health issues. studies were clear from the early 2000s, media had to be educated. a best practice guideline was produced to help journalists better report on mental health issues, known as “mindset” with other 4,000 distributed across canada. it would appear that colby cosh, anne marie owens and the editing team at national post never read. &amp;nbsp; the impact that they have had on the perception of ptsd service dogs? that could be defeated by national post printing a rebuttal, strongly worded and well researched (the antithesis of the illiterate vendetta piece cosh wrote and owens supported) explaining the science behind ptsd service dogs: science that has been peer reviewed and minutely studied since 2002. but sadly, as of now the national post refuses to stand by the oath of all journalists that speaks to integrity and education. &amp;nbsp; &gt;brian here: if a politician said something this stupid, they’d be sent for a sensitivity class and left off the nomination papers next election. a team player would be fined. a business executive would be relieved of duties. a professor would find a pink slip. there is currently no recourse for reporters who publish unresearched, unreferenced and un-cited pieces. they can literally publish something they wrote on the toilet, and perhaps should have gone in it. &amp;nbsp; brian smith wrote a study which i have included below on the impact of media on mental health stigma. it is a great shame the findings in this study are not more widely understood by professionals in the media world in addition to reading the publication produced by the mental health commission of canada (mindset). &amp;nbsp; [mental illness stigma in the media &amp;nbsp; brian and i remain extremely angry with the damage that has been done to efforts painstakingly taken to reduce the stigma around ptsd and ptsd service dogs by the national post’s ignorance. when i first started this journey i wished i could give some individuals a window into my world if only for a few minutes, knowing that they’d never be the same arrogant, pompous twat again but a humble, empathetic human would emerge who understood that there is a great deal going on behind silent, calm eyes and that they don’t get to judge us, or others. sadly, that’s not an option.",ptsd,4

if you're manic you lose control over your decisions. personality and upbringing explanations of mental illness assume always having the mental capacity for full agency over our lives and decisions. as bipolars we don't always have full agency, and stopping moments of uncontrolled destructive behavior is important for us. there can be aspects of choice but that is often not the full picture. we bought a car we couldn't afford because we thought it was a good idea and saw no downsides and couldn't remember or even think of long-term consequences. we think we're gonna get rich tomorrow because we have a *brilliant* idea that's gonna pay off the car. we become manic when we take stimulants because they're affecting our moods in ways that are beyond how they affect other people's moods. when someone having a midlife crisis buys a car they can't afford they know damn well they shouldn't but feel they need it to happily enjoy the rest of their lives and wanna live in the moment. when a teenager does this they're acting from inexperience and being impulsive because they are young. when non-bipolar people take stimulants they don't stay up up for days and destroy their relationships etc and only come down with the help of sedatives or antipsychotics. this is a medical condition and you aren't gonna will it away. if your medical symptoms are controlled enough you can will much more of it away with coping strategies, self care, learning to love yourself again after destructive episodes, finding who you are without bipolar, childhood problems, unhealthy thinking patterns, etc. i am pro-meds and have good reason to be: i have felt them help me. i know they do. why the fuck would doctors approve them and write diagnostic criteria if they weren't. how tf does the fact that they work better than the placebo not prove that they work. i think meds **suck** a lot of the time, aren't well researched enough, often have shitty side effects and some people really struggle with finding ones that help...but that's where medicine for us is right now and the fact that there isn't something better isn't a reason to reject that option entirely and let yourself suffer and destroy your life while having a counselor blame you for actions outside of your control, feel guilted about how you're acting because you are told it's totally in your control, try so hard at something you may not be able to manage, etc. or feeling that all by yourself! to be fair, forms of bipolar (often not 1 or 2 but potentially cyclothymia) and euthymic periods may be just fine dealt with on their own with or without therapy and depending on the individual. i totally think med doses need to be adjusted as moods change. i totally think some psychiatrists have a tendency to over-prescribe and under-trust your own judgment and reporting of symptoms. **but there's almost always another one out there or there will be in the near future and just because it's difficult doesn't mean it's not worth the trouble.** **some counselors are bad counselors. fire them and get a new one!! you deserve better!** thank you for reading &lt;3 edit: paragraphs exist now edit 2: grammar and formatting",bipolar,2

92947e28-d779-44bb-9ef9-dbdf4c8ef58a,"i put the original text here below since its blocked in most countries (and also since it's under (k)-license...). [original] ___________________________________________________________ internets, 18th of january 2012. press release, for immediate release. over a century ago thomas edison got the patent for a device which would ""do for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear"". he called it the kinetoscope. he was not only amongst the first to record video, he was also the first person to own the copyright to a motion picture. because of edisons patents for the motion pictures it was close to financially impossible to create motion pictures in the north american east coast. the movie studios therefor relocated to california, and founded what we today call hollywood. the reason was mostly because there was no patent. there was also no copyright to speak of, so the studios could copy old stories and make movies out of them - like fantasia, one of disneys biggest hits ever. so, the whole basis of this industry, that today is screaming about losing control over immaterial rights, is that they circumvented immaterial rights. they copied (or put in their terminology: ""stole"") other peoples creative works, without paying for it. they did it in order to make a huge profit. today, they're all successful and most of the studios are on the fortune 500 list of the richest companies in the world. congratulations - it's all based on being able to re-use other peoples creative works. and today they hold the rights to what other people create. if you want to get something released, you have to abide to their rules. the ones they created after circumventing other peoples rules. the reason they are always complainting about ""pirates"" today is simple. we've done what they did. we circumvented the rules they created and created our own. we crushed their monopoly by giving people something more efficient. we allow people to have direct communication between eachother, circumventing the profitable middle man, that in some cases take over 107% of the profits (yes, you pay to work for them). it's all based on the fact that we're competition. we've proven that their existance in their current form is no longer needed. we're just better than they are. and the funny part is that our rules are very similar to the founding ideas of the usa. we fight for freedom of speech. we see all people as equal. we believe that the public, not the elite, should rule the nation. we believe that laws should be created to serve the public, not the rich corporations. the pirate bay is truly an international community. the team is spread all over the globe - but we've stayed out of the usa. we have swedish roots and a swedish friend said this: the word sopa means ""trash"" in swedish. the word pipa means ""a pipe"" in swedish. this is of course not a coincidence. they want to make the internet inte a one way pipe, with them at the top, shoving trash through the pipe down to the rest of us obedient consumers. the public opinion on this matter is clear. ask anyone on the street and you'll learn that noone wants to be fed with trash. why the us government want the american people to be fed with trash is beyond our imagination but we hope that you will stop them, before we all drown. sopa can't do anything to stop tpb. worst case we'll change top level domain from our current .org to one of the hundreds of other names that we already also use. in countries where tpb is blocked, china and saudi arabia springs to mind, they block hundreds of our domain names. and did it work? not really. to fix the ""problem of piracy"" one should go to the source of the problem. the entertainment industry say they're creating ""culture"" but what they really do is stuff like selling overpriced plushy dolls and making 11 year old girls become anorexic. either from working in the factories that creates the dolls for basically no salary or by watching movies and tv shows that make them think that they're fat. in the great sid meiers computer game civilization you can build wonders of the world. one of the most powerful ones is hollywood. with that you control all culture and media in the world. rupert murdoch was happy with myspace and had no problems with their own piracy until it failed. now he's complainting that google is the biggest source of piracy in the world - because he's jealous. he wants to retain his mind control over people and clearly you'd get a more honest view of things on wikipedia and google than on fox news. some facts (years, dates) are probably wrong in this press release. the reason is that we can't access this information when wikipedia is blacked out. because of pressure from our failing competitors. we're sorry for that. the pirate bay, (k)2012",none,5

919b7078-5dca-4487-a93a-80f57f028a51,"i'm new to reddit, so i hope i do this right. i've been in therapy for awhile now (maybe a decade?), and have hit a bit of a rough patch. i guess that explains why i'm trying new things and coming outside my comfort zone to post here. i figure that with the time i've put into therapy, each individual session will continue adding tidbits of insight, but that if there are 14k users here, all with even half my time in therapy, that's 70k years of therapy-insights to tap for resources, so even getting ultra-condensed insights with a high loss rate and a high rate of overlap will still provide more insight and more help than rotating between a team of therapists sharing notes everyday for a month (outpatient much?--okay, outpatient has other people with you, so you get less focus from each clinician and more insight from peers). still, even seeing my therapist multiple times a week i figure i can learn from yee wise people. so since i've been trying to teach myself coping tools, i've been reading some therapy-related books (the dbt skills worksheets book has been pretty cool for example) and trying to learn new tools. i figure since i'm asking for people to share, it's only fair that i contribute as well, and this seems like a good starting point (...i hope?)). i think my main goals for what i'm trying to use therapy for are to reduce the extent my crazy warps my thinking, to reduce hurt, and to be a better friend (psychosis is a bitch). i found theories of psychotherapy and counseling: concepts and cases, 5th edition by richard s. sharf online and have been going through it, and it seems like dbt, cbt, and rebt (what even is rebt? who names these things?) can all blend together. for instance, i realized what cbt refers to as cognitive distortions can be treated with rebt's abc dynamic. challenging irrational beliefs and all that. i wonder where the line between thought and belief really lies, anyway? sounds like some confucian shit or something. and i came across a doozie of an irrational belief: ""i need other people to be happy."" i feel like i need to figure out why i think that to figure out why it's wrong and then i can channel depressive rumination into a kind of mental role-playing (rebt) to perform some chain analysis (dbt), but i still have a hell of a lot to learn from dbt, and it's just so hard to get yourself to turn rumination into that productive thought train of ""how do i do it differently next time and how can i feel okay about my mistakes this time?"" i figure if i can spend some time practicing mindfulness and self compassion (i overate today even though i need (no, not need, that's a demand there, demanding it will just make me more unhappy if i fail) want to lose weight), then maybe i could even throw in some behaviorist psychology and reward myself for positive thought patterns by not pushing myself to do as many chores when i do things right. i really want to work on my people skills because i'm a bit of an asshole, but i was hoping maybe some of you could share some ideas you've learned in therapy that've helped you, especially if they could help me 1. challenge that irrational belief that i need other people to be happy 2. be less of an asshole to the people who've been kind to me and are sick of my shit, at least so i don't scare away even more friends. here goes nothing... *cringes*",bipolar,2

b35d9807-e158-46ca-80aa-883054d28351,"so ever since i was formally diagnosed with adhd at around age 4-5, i was always a little chatterbox. the problem at the time was that it was mostly me talking about the things that interested me, which ended up being whatever i happened to be watching on tv or a toy i was obsessed with or something like that. as i got older, this led to me getting bullied a lot and so i ended up retreating into myself and not really putting a lot of focus into speaking. that, and not having too many friends probably made the issue worse. when i went into college i was pretty much a stuttery wreck that could barely edge out a sentence that sounded remotely mature and/or constructive. i could never really do ""small talk"" at an adult level very well, but the bigger issue that concerns me is how this makes me come off to other people. i'm currently 25, and communication is an extremely vital part of our lives, especially in a professional context. if i had a ton of prep time and a topic i was particularly versed in, then yeah, sure, i could probably hold a somewhat decent conversation. the problem is that casual conversation regarding anything that i don't really care too much about is daunting. i used to sort of just skid by as a kid by repeating one-liners from shows and other stuff i found funny, but other than that, i don't really have too much to talk about. i don't know if this an issue inherent with adhd sufferers, but it seems to pop up in discussions rather frequently. another issue is being unable to really ""think on the fly"" when it comes to being witty or responding with an appropriate answer. in work/school related settings, i usually let others take charge and if my input was needed, i'd default to just agreeing with whoever spoke prior. i feel like this makes me come off as intellectually slow and someone not suited for projects that require some measure of commanding presence. when i'm on my meds (i currently take 10 mg of adderall xr), then yes, i usually feel like the ""restraining bolt"" in my cerebral cortex has been wedged off, and i can easily hold and even lead a conversation while keeping people engaged. it's also easier to let ideas and thoughts come to my brain. i always assumed that most people didn't have this sort of smooth thought flow on a stimulant as it's meant to increase focus. yet when i'm on my meds, it's like a combination of focus and relaxation that allows me to be less stressed about figuring out what to say. i don't know if it's just me that has this problem so intensely, but another non-adhd friend said ""well, talking with others and being social in any environment is like a muscle; you need to do it more and then you'll get better at it."", so i'm not entirely sure if this is an adhd-exclusive issue or just a part of my general feelings of anxiety. tl;dr pretty shit at conversation off meds, not-as-shit when on meds.",adhd,0

""what if you just stopped taking the pills tomorrow? what if we all pledged to help you find your balance and you threw those pills out?"" i was dumbfounded. completely taken off guard. i was visibly uncomfortable, and said something about brain chemistry not working like that. ""there's no such thing as brain chemistry."" wtf. it's embarrassing, but tears started welling up in my eyes, and all i managed to say before getting up to go back inside was, ""i can tell you that if i tried your method, after months of being unable to get out of bed the guilt that i was failing would destroy me, and that's why i'll keep taking my meds tomorrow."" even days later i feel shitty and full of doubt for myself. i've never encountered someone so ignorant in basic biology and psychology. my anxiety has been much higher since then, and i'm struggling to focus enough to finish this post. i just needed to vent it i suppose.",adhd,0

005382f2-2190-4be3-a317-f9b8bbc1d667,"i'd been hesitant.. scared.. wary.. about going before. thoughts racing through my head of what a diagnosis would mean for me. my pdoc didn't feel comfortable giving me a diagnosis for anything other than general anxiety/depression, and recommended i go to a specialist so i could get more accurate treatment. took me well over a year to finally go. i'd made appointments and blew them off , never actually going. i'm so glad i did now. i had to get over the fact that i would get diagnosed with 'something' and it would be on my medical records. i guess i had some preconceived notion that it would never go away and there would be some sort of stigma attached to me everywhere i go. irrational as that may sound, it is what prevented me from seeking professional help. i finally went this past monday, spent an hour with a p.a. talking about my history, what meds i am currently on (lexapro/wellbutrin from my pdoc), etc. she took that information and talked to one of their head psychiatrists about it, then came back about 15 minutes later with him. he was very nice, understanding, and seemed genuinely interested and concerned about my care. my personal research proved to be right. i have bipolar ii. i felt an inner sense of calmness and clarity now that i had a professional, someone that has spent their life studying conditions such as this, verifying that yes indeed, there was something amiss in my brain. and that better help was coming. lexapro had been working wonders for my anxiety and slightly for depression as well. wellbutrin didn't seem to do much, but made life ""liveable"". i was not thriving or excited about anything. just going through the motions. he took me off wellbutrin and replaced it with a mood stabilizer, trileptal. i stopped the wellbutrin cold turkey and started trileptal that same night. i had a really good tuesday and today is looking great as well. i feel much better now that i was finally able to get over myself and get proper help, and hopefully better meds to balance my moods. i have a follow up appointment in 2 weeks. by then i hope to see even more positive changes with the trileptal. i also chose to stop drinking cold turkey as well. i knew i had been drinking too much for too long. each time i drank it was 6+ beers, and sometimes 4-5 nights a week. it became routine. a way to quell my mind at the end of the night. to slow the racing thoughts. it took the words from the psychiatrist to really cement it in my brain that alcohol counteracts anti depressants and that in order to feel better, i would need to make a lifestyle change. he said the trileptal would assist in those nighttime racing thoughts. i even stopped smoking cannabis. this happened after i started the wellbutrin. i think that can be attributed to the fact that wellbutrin is somewhat of a cessation tool used for people quitting cigarettes. the urge or desire to smoke (which used to be daily) just stopped. i don't care anymore. it doesn't really do anything for me. even with my mmj card and specific strains, all it really did was numb me and slow my brain down (again like with alcohol to slow the racing thoughts). so without the alcohol and cannabis, i feel strongly that i can finally let my mind be a blank slate for the psych meds to work properly and not be counteracted or made less effective by other psychoactive chemicals. i am committed to feeling better, and if drinking la croix instead of beer helps in any way, i'm all for it. i want to be able to let the meds do their job in the most effective manner. thanks for being here, community. i may not post much but do lurk frequently and have gleaned a ton of helpful insights over time since i have been subbed. i hope you all have a wonderful day!",bipolar,2

ea0af829-878b-4ff1-9834-83ab1aaad4cc,"hi, my name is paul helquist, professor and associate chair of chemistry and biochemistry, at the university of notre dame. i was a native of northern minnesota where i grew up literally in the “sticks” on a small lake surrounded by woods somewhere north of duluth on the way to the canadian border. i attended school in a small town of 2,000 people 15 miles away from our home and was the stereotypical example of the first member of our extended family to attend college. i enrolled at the university of minnesota, duluth, in 1965 on a free-ride scholarship, which paid for my full tuition, which was all of $400 per year in those days. i had the common problem of deciding upon a major and a career. i kept wavering back and forth among physics, astronomy, medicine, and dentistry but not yet chemistry. i initially opted for physics, but in the midst of taking some chemistry courses as required for physics majors, i was working on lab course experiments one day when a brand new, gung-ho assistant professor, bob carlson, came into the lab and said “follow me.” i was a little taken aback, but he took me, greatly bewildered, to his very small two-person research lab and said “this is where you’re going to work” as a substitute for taking that lab course. that was a very fateful event. it was a synthetic organic chemistry lab. i quickly fell in love with the research, changed my major to chemistry, and was very fortunate to be able to publish two journal articles with bob carlson. my odyssey in synthetic organic chemistry continued at cornell where i earned my m.s. and ph.d. degrees in a little over three years under the direction of another young, super enthusiastic assistant professor, martin semmelhack, and at harvard where i did postdoctoral research for a year and a half with nobel laureate e. j. corey. i was then set to begin my own career at age 27, but i had tremendous difficulty making a decision about which of the positions to accept that had been offered to me at a pharmaceutical company, chemical companies, or universities. well here i am now, after choosing the academic route and having been a faculty member for 42 years. in 1974, i began as an assistant professor at suny stony, and in 1984, i was recruited to notre dame when it was entering a period of tremendous investment and growth in graduate and research programs. this career path has led to living and working in several places, including minnesota, new york, massachusetts, indiana, and even in sweden and denmark, where i have held a number of visiting positions. i teach undergraduate and graduate courses in organic chemistry and run a research group, which has generated over 180 publications and patents in the following areas: development of new synthetic methods; design and development of transition metal reagents and catalysts for selective synthetic reactions; total synthesis of natural products synthesis; and applications to new pharmaceuticals, including antibacterial and antitumor agents and treatments for rare inherited diseases as part of an international network of collaborators in the u.s.a., europe, and asia. a therapeutic agent developed in my lab is currently being used in an fda-approved human clinical trial. i have also served in many university administrative and service positions, as chair of the chemistry board of examiners for the graduate records examination at the educational testing service, as the director of the national science foundation workshop for college teachers of organic chemistry, as a regional and national leader in the siemens math, science, and technology competition, as a consultant to the pharmaceutical industry, and head of an indiana state-wide program for clinical translational research at indiana university, purdue, and notre dame. since 1981, i have offered special courses on advanced synthetic organic chemistry on over 140 occasions at sites throughout the u.s.a., canada, and europe under the auspices of the american chemical society and several other sponsors. my present acs course, [“organic synthesis: methods and strategies for the 21st century emphasizes the latest developments in this field and is next scheduled for this coming november 7-8 in san francisco followed by several offerings in 2017. i am very enthusiastic about answering as many questions as time permits about any of the aspects of the career area in which i have spent the last half century. **i will be back at 11:00 a.m. edt to answer your questions!** i am now on line until noon edt. i will be off line until later in the afternoon after i finish heading a faculty meeting and a few other duties. i am back again (2:00 pm edt). i will mix the rest of the afternoon with meeting in my office with my research students and with responding to your reddit questions. ok, i have run out to time for today at 4:45 pm edt. i greatly appreciate the huge number of questions and responses, including ones that were in direct contrast with mine. that is what makes for a good chat room.",none,5

(my previous record was, at most, two days. this is for all 41 years of my life. not just at my current job.) my vast sea of laundry has been whittled down to what i need. everything is hanging in an orderly fashion in my closet or is neatly folded into a few shelved in a dresser. nothing is scattered across multiple bedrooms or hampers or floors. i am all caught up with my mba homework after i fell far behind. i still need to get caught up for a class i am teaching, but i will do that this weekend. i also learned that it's okay to say ""no"" to opportunities. i can only pick and choose so much. once this semester ends, i'll make a rational decision of what i want to do in terms of my education. i am not sure what my employer thinks, but i believe my production and output at work has improved dramatically over the course of this month. i have been listening better. i'm more attentive when talking and listening to my wife. i get tasks accomplished. i put things away. we have actual conversations. my brother and i have had a bunch of great talks where i actually don't drift off as to what he is saying. i have been a better friend. i have been treated for bipolar for 10-plus years. the initial diagnosis and treatment for that felt like it worked. but there were still just the routine complaints about a lack of detail and the constant distractions and noise in my head from the 20,000 things i was focusing on all at once. everything in my brain slowed down about one hour after i took that pill. it has remained at that speed ever since. reading up on adhd, i realize i spent an entire life without any executive brain function at all. i won't pretend to understand the chemistry. but all i know is that there was a lock on my brain that kept me from living up to my potential for my entire life. i found the key. now it's a matter of managing what comes next. every day brings with it another joy. to most people, being able to successfully navigate calling a plumber, dealing with a dog that recently had surgery, having a friend from out-of-town stay over, work, a little bit of laundry and a homework assignment in the course of one day is not a big deal. but to me? this is a parade. i would not be able to handle this over a month ago. i am so optimistic. let's support each other.",adhd,0

(it was around this time that drake released his sophomore album *take care* and accusations came out that he bit the weeknd's signature sound, but that's a story for another time.) cut to 2014 and we have a new weeknd with *beauty behind the madness* and a new audience that will automatically associate him with ""can't feel my face."" what at first sounds like a simple, catchy pop track is actually a little darker. in fact, it may be the first song about doing cocaine that ever won a teens choice award (he would end up [talking about in a song on *starboy*.). and [in the - another song with a catchy pop beat - is about a stripper who is forced to dance to the song that played when she was raped as a child. the weeknd performed this song at the grammys to no controversy. however, there were songs on the album like and [the which are clear examples of his original sound that made him, well, him. which brings me to my point: what separates the weeknd from other acts is his lyricism. he is able to translate ideas that would be considered too dark or too sexual for the mainstream and mask them using entendres and metaphors over friendlier beats that have larger appeal. *starboy* is the pinnacle of this. it is completely new sound for him, and yet he's still sings about getting road head and doing coke with hookers. and he gets away with it, too, because he's not saying these things outright. so if you're unfamiliar with the weeknd's older work i've included some of my favorite tracks, because it's just as important to watch an artist grow as it is to listen to their music.
