19bcafec-f6cd-4d5c-aca6-01cb3bf6b5fd,do not rely on willpower,"just a quick tip. if the current you had no 'willpower', future you can't be expected to either. thats fine though, willpower isn't neccesary. to achieve your goals, forming systems of accountability and support structures is the easiest way. this means organising study groups, emailing your lecturers, telling your classmate you are going to send him the work you've done so far at a given time. if you can't watch a 2 hour of lecture today, how do you think you are going to watch 20 hours of lectures on top of all your other commitments next week? i don't know about you, but i've often thought ""i would happily give away my entire weekend if it meant i had done 10 hours of study"", even though that means i'm forgoing 15-18 hours of sleep and 12-15 hours of leisure, assuming i could make myself do 10 hours of study normally. however, it would be worth it. 100% worth it, if you are unable to study normally like me. because 10 hours of study isn't being done that weekend otherwise. however, by sacrificing some time, you can make yourself do that 10 hours of study, and it doesn't even steal your whole weekend away from you! make goals, but small, seemingly inconsequential goals, not just to yourself but to others as well. it also allows you to break your assessment into smaller pieces, because you are committed to having done the segments by certain dates. i know you might be afraid to make any sort of commitment, because if you're like me, there have been countless times you have said you were going to do something, and then you couldn't make it happen. however, i'm not encouraging you to tell your lecturer that you're going to be awesome from now on and get 100% for that big assignment due in a month. i am saying that you should tell your roommate (if he is your mate), that you aren't going to game for a week, and give him your computer if you need to, asking classmates if they want to catchup the next day at a specific time to study, and make that a weekly thing, and telling your tutor you are going to send him specific parts of your assignment on specific days, so you are not looking at your assignment for the first time on the day its due. this might all seem excessive, but also realise that normal people don't have to rely on willpower as much as we do. in addition to out brain chemisty, another the reason why we with adhd struggle so much is because getting judged is so painful for us, so we subconsciously try to escape from and avoid systems of accountability. so we end up not only trying to manage a brain that struggles to plan, organise and focus, but we are also lacking the support networks that could help compensate for this, that others have but take for granted. eventually, once we have developed routine, structure, and good habits, you can relax those systems of accountability, but don't completely toss them aside so, right now, i recommend you try to build your system of accountability, whether with family, friends, teaching staff, or even people here on reddit, because its by taking willpower out of the equation that you are most likely to succeed.",adhd,0
1b9910ed-a124-472b-9022-272ae2bf044b,adhd - stockholm syndrome,"there's a lot of stuff out there talking about the positive side of adhd and to be honest, it bugs me. i think i first experienced it after watching this [ted (""adhd sucks, but not really""). the idea seems to be that adhd isn't so bad, because it also makes us creative, or spontaneous, something like that. my reaction to that is always 'fuck that'. i just figured out why: it's stockholm syndrome. adhd has taken our lives hostage, made them markedly more difficult. and now we're supposed to give it credit for our successes too? as if in some way our lives would be worse if we *didn't* have adhd. that we wouldn't be the people we are without it. every time there's a thread on this sub about the 'best career for someone with adhd' the thing that always grabs me is the breadth of different careers people with adhd have. because it doesn't predispose us to any particular talent, or gift. it just makes it harder for us to succeed. but we do it anyway. i think that makes us mighty. so here's an idea, next time you're considering saying ""my adhd is great because it makes me good at x"" or ""if i didn't have adhd, i wouldn't be good at y"", instead try thinking ""i am awesome at this and i'm awesome at it *despite* having adhd "". ""i have adhd and yet here i am, kicking ass and it doesn't get to take credit for a single goddamned bit of it"". that way every positive thing you do is you breaking free of adhd, not being held hostage by it while it occasionally feeds you scraps. **tl;dr:** don't let adhd take credit for you overcoming your adhd.",adhd,0

85f6708a-08db-4915-8eb1-1ea44965dfc9,people who say adhd is “not an excuse” are gaslighting you,"i’ve been thinking. whenever i tell people i have adhd i always follow it with, “i’ll never use it as an excuse though.” and it just occurred to me that i only do this because so many people would tell me adhd is not an excuse that i started saying it to save face. but adhd is actually, in fact, a very valid excuse. we’re not some cult of hypochondriacs. this is an actual, scientifically-recognized disorder. just because someone doesn’t believe in adhd doesn’t mean i have to take their shit. in my honest opinion, someone saying that adhd is not an excuse just means they don’t believe it exists at all. so i’m not explaining myself or this disorder anymore (which none of us are obligated to do anyway). adhd is a valid excuse for situations that don’t affect other people. adhd is a valid excuse for my room being messy, or me not completing my assignments on time, or things that do not affect [*insert condescending person*], etc... i feel like it should be a valid excuse for things like being late, but we’re just conditioned to think it’s not. i mean, why does it feel like the only people who accept this as an actual disorder are people who have it and some doctors?",adhd,0

7df33c99-fd0a-49d8-ac81-9b9bf1d4949f,"this subreddit has had me in tears. adhd is one of the most misunderstood diseases. internally, this has made college extremely isolating because of the emotional struggles that come with adhd that are overlooked. thank you, adhders. thank you for the reminder that i am not alone. i love you all.","wow, i am overwhelmed by everyone's support! let me clarify a few things with some background info: after 4 1/2 long years, i graduate in a month. in fact, last night i was finishing up my capstone project that's due today and i was having the hardest time because i put half of it off until last minute and i'm stressed the fuck out. anyway, even though i made it through college, i'm now being faced with new challenges and a shit ton of deadlines. i'm graduating in a few weeks, yet i missed a doctors appointment recently because i forgot, still have trouble with not wasting my time for hours and have two labs that are kicking my ass and i can't keep up. however, this morning i woke up to a reminder that though it's an uphill battle, especially while managing bipolar disorder, that i really am doing better than i think. whether you're freshman in the same shoes i was in four years ago, or are thriving the career you worked your ass off for, your advice, encouragement and the courage to open up have inspired the hell out of me. every single one of you. that being said, i want to share something in return that i hope will encourage you as well: i was never a model student. i dicked around in high school (on the days i actually went lol). i was your standard class clown. my grades were average, but i was always late and had to work extra hard to keep up. senior year, i accepted that since nobody believed i would make it through my first year of college, it was probably true. my first year, i was encouraged by people i looked up to to drop half the classes i signed up for because it ""wasn't realistic"". my advisor saw my act scores and i should consider a major that somebody with my scores could handle. i was told that i'm not a ""problem-solving"" student. junior year, i became depressed and felt that i was wasting my time because i was out of options. i started failing and almost dropped out. i believed the lie that having adhd means you must lower your aspirations. thus, i gave up pursuing a degree in cj because people like me just don't go to law school. or so i thought. that was two years ago. now, after making the dean's list four semesters in a row, i'm graduating and possibly with honors. did i mention that ever was also practicing for the lsat? i started college four years ago thinking i'd flunk out and accepted the fate of being a burnout because the world told me to. today, i'm applying to law schools. i didn't have anything to lose, so i took a risk by starting over and switching to cj. see, the thing about adhd is that you know you can do the work and that you are equally (if not more) as intelligent as your peers. it's frustrating as fuck knowing your performance is not a reflection of your potential...but there is no reason for letting a manageable disorder keep you from contributing your unique ideas and passions to the world. the world needs people like us. people with different perceptions that enable us to excel in certain areas. no matter your personality type, the obstacle of adhd does not limit you. does it get easier? fuck no. will you have to work harder than everyone else due to the inevitable emotional blockades that make accomplishing simple tasks a struggle? probably. i am not in any way a ""this is how i beat adhd"" success story. however, when something is incurable, it does not make it unmanageable. that being said, i still fight the lies that tell me that adhd is an excuse and that i'm a worthless and lazy pos. it's not your fault. your brain is an organ just like your heart, meaning mental health issues should be combatted just like you would any other part of your body. you can't just one day decide that because you've changed your mindset that you don't have heart disease, just like you can't do that with adhd. obviously. the good news is, is that together, by sharing our experiences and simple solutions, we can at least all go about this knowing that we are not alone. i understand not everyone has access to resources such as medication and therapy, and i truly respect anyone who has gone without. ultimately, it is coming to the realization that you are the one who has to initially seek help, which is hard when it's hard to do anything in the first place. if you are reading this, that means you are already one step ahead because you're on this subreddit. thank you to everyone who has taken the time to share your time management solutions, love and other things you've done that have helped you with daily tasks. these are valuable insights that can truly make a difference. i took some advice i read in a comment on another thread and had a productive day yesterday. it wasn't much, my damn it was satisfying when i looked at how much i'd crossed of my to-do list. alright, so i have to get back to my project but i could not ignore the outpouring of support from my fellow adhders. also, if anyone has any questions or just needs somebody to talk to, message me. i'm so glad i found this community. remember, you're awesome. go kick today's ass. cheers",adhd,0
5ee23aa4-08d7-4f55-a6bd-9ce92b494958,shoutout to being medicated - even when i’m bad i’m still way less bad,"i know medication isn’t for everyone but concerta has really done wonders for me. i feel like adhd, for me, is like a box of electric cables. you get four or five in the box and it’s a bit painful to get the one you want out but it’s doable. get 20+ cables in the box and it’s a nightmare. so, lately i feel like i’ve got a box full of tangled cords in my brain and yesterday that culminated in really bad anxiety. i felt like i was getting really over sensitive at work, i didn’t get my gym program done for the week because i ended up trying to drink my anxiety away last night (which i don’t endorse, i actually think it makes the anxiety worse) and have woken up today feeling pretty bummed. i feel like i’m a disappointed in every aspect in my life. i was only diagnosed with adhd in my 30’s but have been on and off medication for depression and anxiety since my teens. whilst i feel pretty crappy today, i know that if i felt like i do today pre-concerta i would have stayed in bed all day. got nothing done. possibly slipped into a depressive episode. full disclosure - it’s 1130am on a saturday and i am still in bed watching drag race but today i’ve got a needle and thread and i’m sewing up some holes in some cardigans i’ve been meaning to do for a while. i’m not cured. i still get anxiety and i still struggle wit life a decent amount but knowing that a few bad weeks doesn’t end in a depressive episode where i basically turn off life as much as possible for weeks if not months is a huge improvement. and not just for myself but for my husband as well. anyway, don’t really know what the point of this post was ha i guess i just feel like i needed to share with people that understand seeing as i’m too broke for a psychologist appointment right now haha hope all you fine people are out there being your best selves today!",adhd,0

b0f44371-5748-4fc5-b076-0a10b1b23f88,the problem with willpower being seen as a character trait,"how often have we heard, ""you just need to try harder,"" or ""i find it boring too, but my parents taught me to stick to it,"" or ""you're smart but so lazy!"" the problem seems to me that for some reason people believe that everyone is capable of the exact same amount of willpower. they accept that people have different levels of intelligence, that a kid who can't solve a math problem as quickly as another could have a lower iq or a learning disability and really needs extra help. we don't blame their moral character for being less intelligent, we accept that it is a function of their brain beyond their control. but with willpower, which is actually just motivation and sustained attention, we think of it as a character trait. i don't understand why people think every person is capable of the same level of self-motivation and attention and if they are poor in that area it isn't an indication of a brain problem but of simply never being taught by their poor parents to have motivation or a personal character flaw. i feel this is the core reason adhd is doubted and misunderstood. even those who accept adhd exists often don't seem to understand this difference. teachers writing reports will acknowledge the student has learning problems and make comments like ""billy struggles with more complex material but is making good progress from earlier in the year."" but when it comes to effort it is still assumed everyone is capable of the same exact level with the same ease, if they would just try. so the comment is ""billy has real potential but he must show more consistent effort, it is disappointing that he just does not try his best in most classes."" so now it is the kid's fault. it's really hard for people to accept this because they like to think of their work ethic, their ability to stick with things as a personal victory, as part of their moral fiber. they don't want to think of it as good luck in getting a well functioning brain. what do you think? does this sound accurate to your experience? tl;dr: people see intelligence as a brain function and having a low iq as bad luck. but they see willpower as a character trait taught by good parents and as a personal victory that every person is equally capable of and those with poor motivation and attention as morally flawed or failed by bad parents.",adhd,0

""it's been 15 minutes and you aren't working? what is all this crap about you not having enough time?"" thing is, i had no idea how it could have possibly been 15 minutes already. i felt like i had just sat down. but she insisted that she knew how many songs she had listened to in the meantime, and it had been 15 minutes or more already. i tried to argue with her but she wasn't having it. it sounds silly now, but it was really upsetting at the time because i had no idea how that could have happened and therefore no idea how to prevent it from happening again. she took that as proof that i wasn't trying hard enough (don't blame her, she was young and stressed out too, and chores that i didn't have time to get to fell on her). it literally just occurred to me, 8/9 years later, that it was because we have so many problems perceiving the passage of time. i was probably hyperfocusing on what i was doing and 15 minutes felt like nothing. i knew that i had adhd at the time, but at the time i knew little other than ""i zone out in class and forget things."" do you guys have any memories that make so much sense in hindsight after learning about adhd?",adhd,0

077618ae-d993-4b4a-8393-56500c071e2c,you don't have to sacrifice your personality to medication.,"hey all, i've seen a few posts lately with people saying that they miss their fun-loving personalities that they seemingly ""lose"" when they're medicated. as someone currently on generic strattera (atomoxetine), i can say i still feel like myself 100% -- just a version of myself who can finally understand my latin class lectures the first time around. when i was first diagnosed at 18-19, my mom and i both worried about this exact issue; i'd known this kid in my past who was fun, charismatic, and full of life off his adhd meds, and on them he was like a zombie. we expressed this concern to the doctor giving me my prescriptions and she looked at us with no small amount of concern and said,""that's not normal. his dose was probably way too high or the medication he was on wasn't the best fit for him."" (note though that it's possible on a dose low enough to 'keep' your personality it's possible you won't be able to focus as super strong as on a high dose, but it's a balance! my medication still works wonders for me in my eyes.) my point is, please, if you're medicated for adhd and feel you've had to sacrifice your personality to be able to focus, try a lower dose. try different meds. that is not normal. talk to your doctor. love yourself. thank you, that's all. tl;dr: if you feel like you're not yourself on meds, your dosage is probably too high or you need to try a different medication.",adhd,0

16dcb147-d44e-44ee-9926-8832e8413d4c,what learned helplessness is like,"just in case anyone isn't aware of what learned helplessness feels like, and as a warning to people not to keep trying the same thing over and over, i've written the following. i will use the term ""brain"" to refer to the unconscious, impulsive parts of the brain, the parts that aren't ""you"", and ""you"" to refer to your conscious experience and rational brain. (disclaimer, this is only my experience, i don't know what other people's experiences are.) --- imagine walking around, going through life, except you don't decide what you do. your brain decides everything for you and you have no say. it wants to play video games, so you play video games. that isn't to say you don't fight it, but on those occasions that you do you either are simply unable to do anything, or every frustration with yourself for every past failure floods upon you, washing your willpower away in a tidal wave of anxiety. you quickly learn the only way to fight is to not fight at all. --- now, imagine somebody calmly tells you, ""i know it's hard, but you really need to just get up and do it. i have no magic bullet unfortunately."" this is nice, they know that you have a hard time ""just doing it"" but at this point there's no way around it, it just needs to be done. you wholeheartedly agree with them, and feel like the ultimate solution _is_ to ""just do it"". your brain however immediately reminds you how ""it's never worked before, so why will it work now?"" this isn't just a small voice, it is backed by the combined anxiety of every failure and inadequacy you have ever had. --- i'll attempt to explain what lies behind this sense of hopelessness: this sense of hopelessness, in its simplest form, is the feeling that ""it's never worked, so why would it change?"" however, it goes deeper than that. the following is the main thought process: - according to other people you just need to try hard enough to solve the problem - you feel like you have tried countless times, but it has never worked - if your trying doesn't work, you must not be trying hard enough, thus you must not _really_ want to try - your desire to try is inadequate, so your brain shifts focus from trying to the desire to try itself. so at the end, you stop wanting to try, instead your focus is diverted toward wanting to want to try. of course you didn't just give up at this point, no, you tried everything at your disposal, except none of it worked. every time you tried to force yourself, you got so anxious about your own lack of ability that you either disregarded your own rules or curled up in your bed until you could forget about what you needed to do (you never really forgot, you just ignored it and it was added to the ""reasons to be hopeless"" pile) --- one day you become aware of the name of what you have: learned helplessness. you feel the first glimmer of hope in what feels like forever, you feel like now you might be able to finally control your brain! there's one problem: how does one reverse learned helplessness? you realize that what seems to be the best way to reverse it is to force yourself to succeed. well, that poses a problem. you've been struggling for so long that you don't know if you can succeed enough anymore to start changing how you feel. you feel like you've fallen so far down the hole there isn't a single handhold nearby to pull yourself up, as if you had the strength to pull yourself up even _with_ a handhold. beyond that, for the past few years your newfound depression has been telling you how much you hate yourself every time you screw up (screwing up is quite broad according to your brain: it includes every time you remember that you should be doing something else, every time you realize you're just giving in but don't care any more, every time you remember how often you mess up, and more) depression and anxiety feed off of learned helplessness, which, in turn, feeds off of them. it becomes a viscous cycle where your successes are minimized, failures amplified, and problems are focused on. this in turn causes you to fail even more at getting stuff done, which makes those feelings even worse. the only way you've found to escape this cycle is to be productive, which works until you fail to do something (even a tiny insignificant thing) you should have. --- having learned helplessness, plus the depression and anxiety that come with it, the most common things my brain repeats over and over and over and over to me are the following: - ""i hate this"" (when i'm overwhelmed and just try to numb myself) - ""i just don't care anymore"" ( ditto ) - ""i hate myself"" (when i metaphorically close my eyes, cover my ears, and run from what i need to do yelling ""lalalalalalalala"", also when i am sitting doing something i enjoy and remember what i'm supposed to be doing) - ""i just can't."" (when i try to calm myself or when i'm lying in a fetal position on the bed, spiraling deeper into depression) - ""i just want the world to go away"" (this feeling makes me realize why some people kill themselves. i fortunately just retreat to my bed or some form of entertainment that allows my brain to shut off temporarily) --- i'm not saying this is permanent problem, or that there aren't any solutions, just that it's incredibly difficult, more difficult than i feel most anyone can imagine. it's the torture of hopelessness, with the frustration of fully knowing with your rational brain that hope itself is all that is needed to solve the problem, yet finding that hope hopelessly far away. please, everyone. think before you tell someone to ""just try."" they may have forgotten how to. --- edit: some people may say that you just need to build in systems, and i agree that that is a good solution, but at least for me, i've tried so many of my own systems that even trying to talk with it causes my brain to lock up with anxiety. likely because it forces me to confront all my past failures, which further discourages me from trying. i'd still love to hear any advice people have though. --- tl;dr; learned helplessness isn't thinking you are helpless, it is feeling that you've forgotten how to try. if you really wanted to try it would have worked, since people say to just try, so you must not really _want_ to try, so you begin to instead want to want to try. in addition, confronting it in any way brings with it all the anxiety of every past failure, meaning that often, instead of doing something you often fail to do you just close your eyes and hope it'll go away.",adhd,0

36cefbe7-b2b4-4eae-9a6f-0370da00dfb2,i cleaned my room and holy shit!,"sorry, this is long. so, just like the title says, i cleaned my room yesterday. i mean, i really cleaned it. it was disorganized and always messy and it had been driving me nuts for probably a year. i made a deal with my husband that every saturday we would choose one area of the house and purge it and really scrub it. we've lived in our house for 6years and we neaten it here and there, clean it up better when company comes, but we've never really gone room by room and sorted everything and purged all the old stuff and scrubbed the corners and walls and stuff. so this is pretty embarrassing, but i normally use natural cleaners for everything except the toilet and i've never really scrubbed everything hard- just surface cleaning here and there to get it a step above unsanitary and gross. yesterday i broke out the big guns and used an entire brand new can of scrubbing bubbles just on my makeup counter and toilet/shower area (our house was built in the 70's and our sink is in our bedroom opposite another counter vanity for make up, and the toilet and shower are in a tiny little room with a pocket door). you guys, i dusted everything, scrubbed the window frames, washed the windows, cleaned our lampshades inside and out including the bulbs. i scrubbed all the baseboards, washed and reorganized my medicine cabinet shelves and cabinet drawers, scrubbed the walls including the grooves in the fucking bead board on the bathroom walls and shelf with a fingernail scrubber (note*never use bead board for a shelf!). i scrubbed the shower pan, walls, grout, and fixtures, the entire toilet inside and out and behind it (that was gross). we cleaned out our closet and filled two large black trash bags of clothes to give away and my husband filled another one with trash from old shit he had 'stored' in there (old papers and bills and shit). i hung hooks for my hair dryer and curling irons under my vanity counter and then more inside my closet for bras and purses and swimsuits. i sorted my socks and made pairs and reorganized my dresser drawers, once everything was off the floor i vacuumed like i've never vacuumed before! i vacuumed, emptied the canister once and then re-vacuumed and emptied it again! i know this sounds unbelievable, but it didn't *seem* that bad! i mean, it was messy, but i didn't feel like it was so dirty! ugh! i also rode my bike for exercise yesterday morning and then scrubbed for about 5-hours- my muscles are so sore! today i'm finishing laundry and stripping the bed. i'm going to make sure under the bed is cleaned up and then move it and vacuum under it. then i'll clean out underneath the sink cabinet (my husband cleaned the sink area, but not under it or the cabinet doors). i ordered a new shower curtain and laundry sorting cart thing. i'm thinking about getting new sheets and bedspread too. i feel like we've finally finished moving into our room after six years! we never really focused on it and it's just been piling up and slowly getting out of hand. right now i just don't want to leave my room because the rest of the house is messy and it's so nice in here!!!! we have three little boys, so next saturday we're each tackling their bedrooms. little by little we're going to make our way through the whole house and de-clutter and organize it. it's such a daunting task, but just knowing how good it feels to get it done is huge motivation! i'm also trying to not berate myself for letting it get so bad. cleaning is probably my least favorite activity ever, but i feel so good when things are picked up and cleaned. i know it's better for my mental health and feeling in control, too. more motivation to get rid of a lot of extra crap taking up room in my life! tl;dr-cleaned my room and it was much worse than i'd realized. motivated to keep the momentum going and get the rest of the house in order. edit:: i thought i should give an update! it has been three weeks and my room is still clean! i can't even believe it, but it is!!! dh and i both also clean all three of our kids rooms and i cleared up a lot of launfry today. i can't even begin to tell you how motivating it is to get this done. i think i've reached a point where i actually want to clean things up because of how nice it feels! we still have some pretty major sections of the house to work our way through and it will be a chore to get the kids to be more cognizant of their rooms, but after three saturdays of committing to this it feels like i'm almost at the stage of making it a new normal! *happy dance!*",adhd,0

95cdafca-770a-4f54-915d-f12ccb99b051,adhd's non-direct effects on my academic life are way more hindering than the direct ones,"our biggest issue is that we couldn't get our lives together, it doesn't mean our focus is weak, i'd describe it as our general attention span and sense of urgency are low, because the direct focus is a constant ability. if you can focus on writing an it script pretty well, but not a calculus class.. it's not like your focus got weaker.. on this example, you might have passion about programming and that excites you to do, which stimulates you (in my theory) therefore you'd be able to get it done and enjoy that without issue despite having adhd , but calculus is boring to you, and you are already at low dopamine level, so you'd just feel no motivation at all to care. a normal-dopamine person would be able to do calculus when they find it boring because they are at normal motivation energy and naturally more stimulated than us, plus they care and have the sense of urgency a lot more. ************************************************** things like being able to attend classes on time (or at all) .. doing homework on time (or at all), ... and the list goes, from paying bills, cleaning place, not being able to achieve goal or staying committed to hobby and being a mess constantly are the most frustrating part of adhd. college was a big transition,, and it made me realize that my adhd problem,, looking back at my child hood and highschool it makes a lot of sense.. i was known as the super smart, but the most lazy kid at the same time im grateful that we are in age adhd is discovered and studied well, otherwise i'd lose hope on myself and self loath it without knowing how i can treat it, and how it's legitimate, it's just a relief mixed with hope.",adhd,0

""attention deficit disorder was coined by regularity chauvinists,"" he remarked. ""regularity chauvinists are people who insist that you have got to do the same thing every time, every day, which drives some of us nuts. attention deficit disorder - we need a more positive term for that.* [*hummingbird i should think.""* *xanadu, the ultimate hypertext information system, began as ted nelson's quest for personal liberation. the inventor's hummingbird mind and his inability to keep track of anything left him relatively helpless. he wanted to be a writer and a filmmaker, but he needed a way to avoid getting lost in the frantic multiplication of associations his brain produced. his great inspiration was to imagine a computer program that could keep track of all the divergent paths of his thinking and writing. to this concept of branching, nonlinear writing, nelson gave the name* *although the concept of hypertext made nelson legendary in programming circles, he is not a programmer. ""i have a terrific math problem,"" nelson said. ""i still can't add up a checkbook: i can add a column of figures five times, get four different answers, and none of them will be right. i'm very accident-prone and extremely impatient. i can't work my macintosh - i have three that are completely unfunctional and one is marginally functional.""*",adhd,0

e69780c5-eaa3-4c98-b330-50d3fdc5d3c8,adderall for adhd; dogs for depression,"my doctor prescribed something very unorthodox as a cure for my horrible adhd related depression. while my medicine always would treat my adult adhd, it never treated my depression. i never could escape myself- my mile per minute mind focused in on my shortcomings, my opinion of myself and how i felt others felt of me. so my doctor prescribed to me- a dog. he recommended a belgian malinois- the quintessential military dog. mostly due to its stereotypical adhd like behavior- high energy, high drive to follow organized orders and easily bored in the hands of the wrong person. i did not get a belgian malinois because most pups are around $1.6k. so i listened to his runner up choices- a border collie or a german shepherd. so i did my research, and was about to save a 9 month old german shepherd from the pound. the owner decided that the day of the sale, he was just going to not talk to me. the day after the original sale date, i was on the hunt for another german shepherd. i instead found a steal- almost 2 hours away was a family of people who had imported czech working line german shepherds. they were selling unregistered puppies for $225 as a mother's day special. i drove that whole way at around 8 in the morning, and held every one of the 7-8 week old litter until one of the pups was so calm and lovable that it hurt my heart. my leyna, a german name meaning ""little angel,"" rode home with me that day. she only cried when my friend got out of the car (she lived only 15 minutes from me by foot, but she was also pregnant so i just gave her a lift back home.) you might be wondering why i gave the whole origin story of my puppy, rather than explaining how she fixed my depression. there's two answers to this: 1) i'm heavily intoxicated because i taught my little leyna how to do a toast with me (i hit her water bowl with my shot glass and she laps up water when i take the shot) 2) i'm not 100% sure how it worked, or how he time flew by. i've had her for two weeks now. i'm still unemployed, i'm still single, and my friends totally use me like they always have, but i don't care anymore. the truth is, this puppy has so completely engrossed my life and accomplishes something better than any high or any medicine could- the satisfaction of progression. i wake up, and everyday my puppy grows more attached to me and becomes smarter and smarter. she is at the 8/9 week age now- her ears are starting to stand, and she's understanding the world. i'm understanding her world too. the amount of knowledge, time, and effort it requires to care for her and give her love has completely destroyed any form of self loathing. while i still may harbor negative feelings or thoughts about myself, they no longer eat up the negative space- the time i have to myself- because that time doesn't exist. i'm always teaching leyna, or playing with her, or enjoying my alone time while she sleeps. the funny part of this being that i've had the past 5 years without a puppy or a dog to constantly train and focus on and having infinite free time and now that freetime becomes a scarcity it has feeling and meaning behind a depressing vacuum. i am extremely adhd- i scored a 20/200 on the test my psychologist gave me, he asked how i even made it through high school, at this point i've had to withdrawal from college because in a hyperfocusing state i focused on hating myself and needed up losing 35-40 pounds, i can ponder questions of the universe for hours and i have a near eidetic memory so there is always a little tiny snippet of knowledge to latch on to and theorize on...if i needed to untie my shoes, i would rather stare at the ceiling for 30 minutes or just ignore it. if i needed to put my clothes in the washer, i would rather pile them beside the washing machine rather than sort through them and check pockets. i would rather just go hungry for a while rather than actually take the time to go get, or make, food. **however...** i would not ignore her when she needs to potty outside, or when she needs food or she needs water. when she is hurting, she doesn't cry aimlessly. she begins to cry and looks at me to help her. if i'm not in the room with her, she can't sleep for more than an hour before she has a nightmare. when i don't sleep well, she lets me oversleep and will restrain her urges to use the bathroom until i wake up. when i am hurt, or whenever i am emotionally drained, she takes notice and proceeds to lick my hands until i say something positive and take her out for a walk. i can't avoid eating, because she needs exercise and while i'm okay wasting away into a muscle-less pile of skin and bones due to sheer laziness, i'm not okay with harming her development. at certain points during the day, she gives me a certain look that means she is ready to learn. she so far nearly masters a new trick in one to two days. if i don't spend enough time with her- whether it be with mental or physical training or be affection, she devotes her intellligence into being an adorable little shit that bounces back and forward between 'no's and alternates spots to use the restroom indoods with areas you hadn't specifically said no to (i told her ""no, don't pee there"" once and she moved into our dining room, still within eyesight, and popped a squat in front of me and peed.) my whole life we have had dogs and puppies and occasionally cats, with a nice little mix of snakes and bearded dragons occasionally...but now that i'm an adult and my mind needs an escape, having a puppy that i care for has completely changed me. it's nowhere near the same- whether it's because i'm the main caregiver or because the german shepherd needs early attention in order to maintain proper physical or mental growth, i'm not sure. long story short, if you need to escape depression, purchase a puppy or, better yet, adopt an animal at a humane society/dog pound/animal shelter. train them, day by day. they might be a small part of your world, but you are their entire world. educate yourself in correctly training your puppy in positivism- even if you already know how to do it. i suppose that while you can procrastinate on matters involving your own health and well being, you can't ignore the pain of an innocent life that directly depends on you for love and care. regardless of how much my family or friends need and want me, my puppy needs me. i am her survival. she is like a child to me- and i feel lucky to have such a smart companion. **tl;dr: puppies/dogs are amazing for curing depression, because unlike medicines and coping methods, your puppy/dog requires you to exist. in order to properly raise your canis lupus familiaris, you need to socialize, feed and train it. it shatters your mental barrier of artificial isolationism. if you have adhd and are depressed, dogs and adderall can help you as well.** note: i understand that some might take medicine for depression that is very effective, and i am not bashing that in the slightest. i personally didn't like taking anything except my adderall due to the other effects it had on my personality- drugs like respiradone which i was prescribed following an overdose and the rapid depression and paranoia there after, helped me immensely but i felt like a zombie- i would twitch and shake, especially at the crevices of my mouth which made me look like i was making a fake smile off and on, for about an hour. the adopting of a puppy or dog however is completely different. i'm a very irresponsible person by my nature, but something about a crying puppy makes my personal adhd limits not exist. no legal drug nor high can replicate the feeling of success that is achieved whenever you and your canine companion make a new step on the journey of understanding eachother and new tricks/training. this post isn't meant to offend, however it is meant to present a viable option for those struggling that are uncomfortable with most antidepressants/antipsychotics...like myself. if my post failed to make any sense, i apologize. i am extremely intoxicated at the given moment, but i felt that these past weeks of success needed to be uncovered for others that suffer like me. like seriously, i thought my therapist was full of shit and that he was just making it up as he went along to keep me from doubting him...yet, here i am. proud friend and primary educator of a german shepherd puppy that has completely destroyed my depression by introducing a host of responsibilities. if you are lost in an endless abyss of self loathing and hatred like i was, then get a puppy or a dog and make sure that you alone are the caregiver. if others do the work for you, then i feel that the the whole sene of reward when the puppy/dog grows as an individual is lost. i'm anxious to hear how others feel, peace out for the night/morning of the 20th of may (and teach your dogs to toast with you- smirnoff filled shot glass to water filled doggie bowl....) and may all of you that are like me, find similarly simple and fulfilling purposes/reasons for living...as i have :)

9d5dea88-45ad-419d-8bd0-ff6ffdbe56ab,adhd is so much more than hyperactivity: ramblings of a socially inept patient,"it annoys me when people say that adhd just makes you hyper. for example, take freshman year me: i just enrolled into high school, starry eyed just like the rest of the kids looking to make friends, get into college, and find some passions. however, the honeymoon phase quickly ran its course, replaced by the constant stress of grades and most importantly, making friends. for me, i was basically friendless for my first two years; i never even hung out with one person. now, as a college freshman armed with more knowledge about our condition, i decided to make a small tidbit on what adhd can affect in your social life, and how to overcome it. first of all, we need to deal with out physical and (most importantly) mental hyperactivity. physically, hyperactivity can sometimes be a pain, but i found that the mental aspect was much more damaging to my social life. not being able to listen, talking too much, and not being able to self regulate are the three main problems that plagued my life. also, it’s important to realize that i was never physically hyperactive, but spinning something or twirling a pencil can really help. the first item to tackle is our lack of self regulation. this encompasses the fact that we have sudden, intense emotions that have a hard time going away. this, from my experience, had proven to be the most destructive, as the constantly impassioned emotions we get can tire out other people quickly. to tackle this issue, i found it easiest to just excuse myself from the classroom/lunchtable and just walk out whatever emotion is making us irrational. the process of identifying your sudden mood bursts is extremely helpful, and can help you develop better ways to balance out your emotions. the other problem we need to focus on is, for a lack of a better word, narcissism. while we may not all be narcissists, after reflecting back on my high school career, i found that i was a massive narcissist, and i bet that a few of you can really benefit from the advice below. first of all, even though you may not realize it, there is a high chance that you are talking too much, drowning out other conversations. in conjunction with not being able to listen as well as others, this makes us come off as massive narcissists, which can be very unappetizing to other people. to counteract this, make sure that you can identify when you are talking too much. i usually find this when i change the story subject within the original story, making a 10 second example turn into a 5 minute epilogue. to be honest, the hardest part about add/adhd for me was not having the ability to make friends as well as others. this is usually overlooked by online articles, but plays a much more damaging role in our personal lives. i know that there are thousands of kids just like me, too hyper to be accepted into the normality of society, but fortunately, this can be fixed. by combining the use of a vigorous monitoring system and empathetic self reflections, i hope that kids will be able to not repeat the same mistakes i did and live more emotionally balanced lives, filled with plenty of friends. end note: this is just my ramblings after i took the wrong meds before going to sleep. this definitely isn’t the shining example of a good essay, but the overall message is to find kids that are going through the same predicament, and help them. if you’re struggling with social isolation/ alienation, i would love to hear your story. at the end of the day, we all need a friend to talk too, right?",adhd,0

well, allow me to introduce you to a new concept: barriers to exit. super important. recognize and accept that your new ""hobby crush"" may fade with time. when i get excited about a new hobby i am super tempted to buy professional-grade stuff. mistake! when entering a new hobby, recognize that it may not last and make it as easy as possible to get out of financially -- meaning it won't be too much of a loss if (when) you give it up. when starting a new hobby that requires purchasing things, try to force yourself to only purchase entry level stuff until the hobby has stuck around for long enough to justify investing in. or buy things that can easily be resold on the internet. entry level dslr camera that can be resold if you decide you hate photography? fine. professional grade dlsr camera engraved with your first and last name and therefore with limited resale value? not fine. not fine at all. this month i started a new workout class. went to the first class and loved it! was ready to purchase the $200 month unlimited monthly membership for 12 months! yay! then a little voice said, ""hey man, remember to reduce the barriers to exit. you might not like this next month."" so instead i bought the $50 entry-level package and will re-evaluate my commitment as i go. if it doesn't stick, it won't nearly be as much of a loss! &amp;#x200b; **\*\* 5. don't try harder, try differently!\*\*** also a foundational adhd rule. but relevant in literally every scenario...including this one! when it comes to a new hobby, you may need to outsource your executive function to a teacher or class (if you can afford it!). example: i've had a regular gym membership for 6 months and literally only gone 1 single time. it's just too much to actually figure out what workouts i am supposed to be doing, keep myself accountable to the time set for each exercise, etc. also tbh it's honestly kind of boring. i signed up for a workout class last week. the only thing i need to do is show up. they already have the exercises planned so i don't need to think about it. and it's a group class so there's constant motivation to push myself from peers. i have exercised 5 times in the last 7 days! that's like an infinity percent improvement from my previous strategy. i would never have gotten there if i was just trying ""harder"" at a strategy that didn't work for me. &amp;#x200b; **\*\* 6. trying new hobbies is a hobby unto itself!\*\*** what is the definition of a hobby? something you do for fun. some people collect stamps for fun. other people watch birds for fun. others make scrapbooks. you know what i do? try new hobbies! i get pleasure from getting excited about a random thing and diving into it a month at a time. trying new hobbies is my hobby! no sense in feeling guilt or shame about it when it makes me so god damn happy! this is a subtle but ***really important*** reframing. person x would say, ""i collect stamps for fun. last year i found a rare limited edition 1956 stamp from montana and a couple from california in the 1760s! i loved it!"" i would say, ""i try new hobbies for fun. last year i dabbled in photography, guitar, and dog sitting! i loved it!"" both of us would be having fun doing what we do. person x would never feel bad about him or herself for not trying ""enough"" new things, so why would i ever feel bad about trying ""too many"" new things?! &amp;#x200b; **\*\*tl;dr:\*\*** be kind to yourself. accept that your hobbies will have to be dynamic. instead of trying harder, consider trying differently. reduce the (financial) barriers to exit. and, most importantly, recognize that trying new hobbies \*is\* a hobby! godspeed, mateys. happy hobbying!",adhd,0

6c50d1b3-8241-4d32-b984-68e62ae3f990,meds helped me realize a lot (success story),"hi, i'm going to tell you how meds have helped me. this is more of an encouragement post for those who are still questioning or don't regularly take meds, but it's also a success story in some regard. firstly, i had to struggle a lot through self-diagnosis then officially diagnosed as adhd-pi by a psych. i also have/had depression. it's difficult to fight these two if you don't understand exactly what you're dealing with. meds have helped me differentiate between the two. even if you don't have other accompanying mental baggage, they still allow you to function in a more concise manner. i did some research. they work because they give your brain some space to process from a different angle. for some, it is as a sudden breath of fresh air. for me, it was a room being emptied over the course of many months. you learn more and more about yourself each day. i don't believe you need to be reliant on medicine in order to succeed - thanks to neuroplasticity, the brain can form new pathways even without the help of the stims. however using them is like an explosion of such pathways (metaphorically). whereas you may have had to struggle and fight through terrible trials to come to the same conclusion before, it becomes a lot more clear now. think of it as an electrician who has blurred vision and keeps crossing the wrong wires. now, the red and blue are obvious. now you have time to think about the entire device, and even consider how to use it. now, you don't feel like your world is going to end if you spark the wrong wires. then you realize your tenacity. how hard it was for you to fit in, and how difficult it still is after the diagnosis. you wonder with curiosity how you managed to stay caring and sympathetic despite how deeply you get cut, and cut in return. all in all - meds don't necessarily change people. it may for some, but it doesn't have to. i was scared of using them. i'm a strict non-smoker (non anything harmful) and believe in good health. but these past 6-8 months, i've received the support i needed from my own self. now, i can see the need (and ways) to rely on others as well. it's truly amazing. tldr; meds can truly change your life if you are diagnosed, but it's not because of the meds. it's because of what they allow you to do. it's because for some like me, all that's happening is i'm living up more to my potential and that's still me. sorry if this reads depressing or doesn't flow logically. i used to be far worse - but now the new motto for me is ""what was difficult before shall be easy now"". make it happen.",adhd,0
9ef57000-e310-433d-914c-e4bb0a7f2df9,do not tell anyone about your learning disability in a work setting,"hi folks, i want to save you a lot of stress, sadness, and self-hate. i revealed information about having adhd to my previous employers and it didn't help. people gossiped about the issue, tried to make it look like i would be lying about symptoms i struggled with, would bombard me with questions about my medications, etc. it got to the point where i was now the ""weak one in the group"" or the ""crazy one in the office"". for one, i understand that those with adhd seem to be very apologetic, sympathetic, and insecure. i was diagnosed later on in life. although we may face these challenges, it does not mean we cannot complete our jobs, perform well, and be successful. giving someone else fuel to dismiss you as incompetent is not okay, but it will happen. so yeah, at work be careful of who your ""friends"" are. do not reveal any information about adhd, depression, even anxiety. the organization will find a way to use it against you. if not, coworkers will try and use it against you and sabotage you. in short, be confident in anything you do.

i would probably have taken a week to finish it. tomorrow is schoolwork, and if today is anything of an example; i should have no issue finishing all my homework in a timely manner. i know i've heard people say that adderall is a ""helluva drug"", and its been a decade since i was on it last, when i was 12. on one hand, i'm devastated by thinking about what could be if i had done this two years ago. i could be done with my degree by now. i could still have that job, or something better. on the other, i'm feeling *liberated*. like the world is open to me now. literally every teacher i've had has mentioned that i should be doing a lot better than i am right now. every employer has praised my skills and work ethic but bemoaned on how i might solve problems other can't, but stumble on the simple things we do every day. today is a turning point. things will not be the same. the world had better watch out, because i don't think its prepared for /u/replieswithanimegif on medication. thank you to /r/adhd, and your wiki in particular. reading through the wiki was an eye opening experience that convinced me that i wasn't weak/broken/whatever. i had an issue. there was a solution. i realized that i was what i criticized often; someone refusing to acknowledge the answer when its staring right in front of them. thank you for helping me confront my pride and shove the answer in their face. tl;dr /r/adhd wiki is amazing. after two years of getting very little done academically and losing my job over add issues i've finally swallowed what to me was a bitter pill. if today is any indication, this is the beginning of major beneficial change. for the first time in a long time, i'm going to go to sleep without the thought of all the things i didn't get done tormenting me and making me feel inadequate. at least if adderall doesn't fuck up my sleep too much since i took it at like 1pm. thankfully my old job had me up till 12am anyways and i often don't get to sleep until 2 or 3am. here goes nothing.",adhd,0

b6a2728b-5386-4a4b-830e-5b5c3dfe1162,i unknowingly had adhd my whole life and was never treated for it.,"really angry with my mother, along with many other things. when i was a kid, i was diagnosed with adhd. i grew up never knowing i was diagnosed, until my kid's doctor looked me up and said i was diagnosed. i brought it up to my mother a few weeks later and she said that she did not want to bother with helping it, and the school wanted me on medication. this infuriates me because my whole life i have felt like a below-average person, because i was bullied for being ""dumb"". i had trouble in class, tests were a nightmare, and homework was such a drag. i was punished physically because of everything i did, which is all relating to having adhd. so she goes to not help me, but then when i do something that is related to having adhd, i get beaten and blamed on. she would throw things at me, or throw me down stairs, or grab the closest thing and hit me wherever she can - all because i pissed her off. i developed depression, anxiety, and aggression because of my life and how i did not know i had adhd or how to cope with the symptoms, which i probably could have helped treat. if my mom had actually helped with this, i probably would have done much better in school and probably have not been bullied to the point of depression. i regret so much from my life, and now that i found out that i had an issue, i feel like my life would have been completely different. i don't know if i should be angry, or what. i mean, i grew up without anything to help with the symptoms. i had to teach myself more self-discipline in suppressing everything. maybe it was good to where i can suppress this with my own mentality, without the use of drugs, i am not sure. i just feel like most of the issues surrounding being bullied and being abused at home could have been prevented if my mother got me the right treatment. well, at least i know about it now and can do something about it. i want to be a successful firefighter for my department, and this has been hindering me from doing that. maybe now i can turn everything around and actually not feel dumb or look like some dumb ass(like i have, very badly...) this is one thing i am bringing up to my therapist, though. it will explain a hell lot. edit: thanks for the kind words, this sub is amazing and being here has made me feel like i belong here. i finally have a place where people understand me and why i am who i am.",adhd,0

6ef7d4c4-e11e-43cc-b5ba-743d4dfd763a,about to leave my [29/f] fiancé [28/m] due to his refusal to seek treatment for his adhd. i don't know what to do anymore. any advice would be greatly appreciated!,"i'm sorry this is so long. but i'm desperate. i've been with my fiancé for 5 years. i'm a type a personality, highly anxious and - unfortunately - can be controlling as a result. i also have a high stress job as an attorney and work a lot. i'm starting to think he and i are fundamentally mismatched. or, maybe i need a swift kick in the ass and to calm down a bit. i'm hoping for some perspective. he's very kind and thoughtful in a lot of ways. most ways. but he has a number of adhd-related personality traits (i believe and please, correct me if i'm wrong) that are driving me absolutely *insane*. (1) **the bank.** he simply appears unwillingly to handle an issue when it arises. for example, he had been receiving letters from his bank informing him that the automatic payments he was making towards a loan were insufficient. he got a letter about it every month for 4-6 months. i showed him the letters and asked him to *please* see what the issue was. i went into his email recently (we have full access to each other's devices) and saw an email from credit karma saying his credit score took a hit. and it did. from 720 to 590 . . . because he never called the bank back. when he finally did call the bank, they said they would not reverse the reporting. and he proceeded to throw a fit about how the bank ruined his credit. never mind the *incredible* impact this will have on our future if we need to make any big purchases like a house or moving. he now has shit credit and he's a risk. who is going to rent to us? (2) **to-do list.** he seems to not keep a running list of the things he needs to take care of in his head, like i do. he forgets things he promised to do *constantly* which has resulted in me more-or-less not trusting anything he says. he refused - for reasons i don't understand - to write things down for a while. trying to be understanding, i bought a blackboard and kept a list for him. it didn't seem to help. (3) **sleeping habits.** he *never* gets enough sleep. and so when we hang out a night, he almost always falls asleep on the couch at some point before bed time. this is frustrating for me because i rarely get to sleep next to him and, due to my anxiety, can't relax and just watch tv late at night because i'm worried he's going to fall asleep and miss what we're watching (so i'll have to rewatch it the next day). we've been attending couples' counseling and the doctor suggested we create a schedule where he can stay up all night 3 nights a week and must go to bed with me 4 nights a week. he sort of followed it. the number of times i've *begged* him to just let me know when he's feeling tired so we can go to bed is staggering. he never does it. he's fallen asleep, i wake him up, and he gets upset with me for ""thinking"" he's fallen asleep. he seems to have absolutely no idea when he's tired and just passes out unexpectedly. i have a very hard time believing this, but people are different. what i can't handle is *the number of times* i've told him that it bothers me, how i wish he'd just tell me so we can go to bed together (which means a lot to me and happens so rarely due to his sleeping habits), and how he'll crucify me for ""picking a fight"" over him falling asleep on the couch, but doesn't understand when i say that i feel disrespected by his doing it after all of our conversations. he falls asleep on the couch 2-3 nights a week. for five years. and doesn't appear to have any interest in changing this. (4) **talking.** he talks. a lot. all the time. about everything. which is fine, for the most part. but it's a running stream of consciousness frequently. and it doesn't stop regardless of whether we're watching a movie, watching tv, i'm working from home, or i'm on the phone with someone else. i've tried to set up boundaries to no avail. for example, i've give him the remote and we agreed he can talk about anything he wants however frequently, but please, just pause what we're watching so i don't miss anything. he pauses it only after me reminding him 5-6 times each day and then, he does it only about once every 4-5 times he starts talking. it makes me feel like i'm literally a sounding board and nothing more. he doesn't seem care if i asked him not to talk about a certain subject, doesn't seem to care that my feelings are being hurt, doesn't seem to appreciate how much self control it takes me not to snap at him, and, again, will get upset with me if i start showing i'm upset. (5) **listening.** despite how much he talks, he also can get super focused on something we're watching. in those moments, it's like i don't exist. i will say a paragraph of stuff and he *literally* appears not to hear me. i have to say his name to get his attention focused away from the tv. when i express how bad it feels to always have to stop what i'm doing 1000 times a day to listen to him, but i can't get him to listen to me, he says he's not doing it on purpose. implying i have no reason to get upset with him. i've explained that intent only gets someone so far, but he seems not to understand why i'm upset simply because he didn't not listen on purpose. he also seems incapable of *not* finishing a thought. even when i tell him i understand what he's saying and to please not repeat himself again. he has to finish talking. or he'll pout and look hurt, which makes me feel bad, so i'll give in. i can see a thought pressing on him, and see how desperate he is to finish it. why can't he just stop? i've told him in the past to please let me finish what i'm doing, please let me work, that i don't want to talk to him anymore at the moment, that i just want to be alone and silent, and it has almost no impact on him. he' ll say ""okay"" and nevertheless keep talking for 5-15 minutes. asking him to stop again often causes a fight. he's lapsed into saying, ""come on, there are worse things than your fiancé wanting to talk to you."" which is hugely beside the point. (6) **finishing tasks.** the laundry is still in the dryer and now needs to be re-washed or ironed. the sheets are on the bed, but not the pillowcases. he got the credit card bill but it got lost in his messy work truck. he has to wake up an hour early on monday to finish paperwork he had all weekend to do. the pants he should have returned *six months ago* are still on the table. his shoes are so gross i can smell his feet sometimes when he's *wearing them* but not amount of begging and promises to buy 7 pairs if we can just go to the shoe store together so i don't have to hear (and withstand the embarrassment) of my family members asking him whether he wants new boots for his birthday. we got into a massive fight about bills recently. he rarely remembers to pay his bills so i took over the finances for both of us. he said he wanted to start paying his own credit card bill and i got worried since his credit will soon affect us both. we fought insanely about it and i relented with the caveat that if he doesn't pay it on time, i'm taking the payments over again. he agreed. it didn't last one month because he failed to timely pay the bill not four days after our fight. (7) **therapy.** due to these issues, i suggested couples' counseling. he agreed. the therapist has repeatedly suggested he get adhd testing. gave him the names of some doctors. he's pretty much told me at this point that it's not something he's going to do. after five years, i got frustrated and made it clear i would not marry him until he did. he hasn't made the appointment. so, am i an asshole? not understanding enough? do i need to relax and put things into some perspective? he says i'm constantly critical, which is true. but i feel like he constantly doesn't listen and is failing to respect me as an adult who *maybe just doesn't want to listen anymore.* i'm lost. i don't know what else to do. any advice would go so far!",adhd,0

'she might call me back' i said, so i sent her a sms telling her to write or call back when she can. nothing. weeks passed and my mind is still full of doubts and i can't stop worrying about what i did wrong and why she did this, and my depression has gotten way worse. i don't know what to think. did something go wrong? does she just not find me attractive at all?has she already found someone? why did she even bother? i honestly want an answer but i'm so frustrated that i can't get one back. i feel like i was so close to something so special and it's already gone. nightmares are waking me up. i'm too weak for this stuff, i have no idea how other people handle this.",depression,3

3e887e99-ad25-4d51-ab85-137bb309997f,four months ago i posted a suicide note on reddit and now i'm doing pretty damn great for the first time in my life,"i'm 18 and i've... honestly struggled with depression for as far as i can recall being alive. i know a lot of people feel like depression is the emotional equivalent of watching paint dry, or just constant numbness, but for me it was pure agony. every second of my life was spent hopeless and wanting to die. something else a lot of people say is that depression has its ups and down, and i don't remember having any ups at all; it was just a constant downward slope for me and i felt more and more hopeless by the day. i could not get out of bed. some days it was so bad that i would scratch my thighs violently with my nails and lie on the pool of blood created on my mattress because i had the urge to hurt myself but i couldn't even be assed to get out of bed to get something sharp. if i were to rate it on a scale of one to ten, one being normal and ten being constantly being stabbed by burning knives in every inch of your body, i would give it an eleven. the only thing that kept me alive was my desire to pursue a career in astrophysics, but even that was slipping out of reach because studying was unthinkable for someone in my state. on january 7th of this year i decided i had enough and posted a suicide note on here, headed to the bathroom to try to drink bleach, but i couldn't bring myself to do it. because minutes after i had locked myself in, 7 of my friends burst in through the front door asking my grandma where i was and if i was okay, because they had called several times in the past hour and i had not answered them. they had even brought me all of my favorite snacks. they put on my favorite movie from my childhood (finding nemo) and we watched it all cuddled up together on my bedroom floor eating the snacks while one of the girls braided my hair and tied it with a white ribbon that i still have. i wish i could say that this was the turning point, but sadly it wasn't. however their love made me feel so warm inside. it definitely made me think twice about attempting suicide again. it took me another month and a week until i gathered the balls to see a psychiatrist, which with my abusive family situation is the bravest fucking thing i have ever done. i ignored my mother screaming about how psychiatrists are evil and will try to lock her up in jail and i had my dad drive me to my first appointment and by god i will forever celebrate february 15th as the day i was given a second shot at life. i was scared to death but my psychiatrist is such a nice guy and i felt like talking to a best friend (he even showed me pictures of his cat, a black little fella called pumpkin but he did not respond to that so they just called him fufi). i was put on 50 mg of zoloft, a brief prescription for clonotril (a different brand name for klonopin, so clonazepam) for when i was having panic attacks or trouble sleeping, and a reference for a therapist. at first my mother tried to withhold my meds, then tried to convince me that i should take them at evening because that's when some doctor friend of hers said i should, and i did and i could not fucking sleep all night. i took zoloft properly for the first time the next morning. it took three weeks to kick in. i only realized that it had when i found myself laughing myself to tears while my best friend tried to open a beer bottle with his belt buckle when we were in the middle of a cinema watching battle angel alita. i don't think i had ever felt unadulterated joy before. it felt so fucking good dude, i can't even describe how fucking amazing it feels to spend your entire life in agony and suddenly you're happy! and you never thought you would ever feel such an emotion! and with the help of my therapist i started making a lot of progress in a short time. honestly, when i thought about the possibility of recovery i always imagined it would take me, like, at least a couple of years. i surprised myself by being able to get out of bed and go for a jog after only a month and a half. i would not say i am cured. i have a long, long way to go, but at least this time i'm walking and not crawling towards my destination, hell, i finally even have a destination. i feel like a proper human for the first time since i can remember and i can finally fully dedicate myself to my beloved astrophysics and get better at it. i used to spend my saturday evenings crying myself to sleep. now i go out with my wonderful friends and meet new people, play guitar on stages in front of crowds which i never even imagined i could do let alone have people come up to me after the show and tell me i kick ass at guitar, have dinner without wanting to throw up because i feel fat and disgusting, and if i stay in i spend my night drawing or writing music or studying. i used to be unable to fall asleep and when i did i would get the worst nightmares. my sleep isn't that good to be honest, but the quality has improved and i no longer sleep for 15 hours straight if not woken up. i used to have panic attacks when strangers talked to me. now i have made so many new friends, and they all say that my sense of humor is great! i never even thought of myself as a funny person! i am so fucking thankful to whatever deity is responsible for my road to recovery. i can't believe that i have hope. i am actually crying as i type this because feeling emotion is such a new thing for me and god fucking damn it, it feels amazing. i hope everyone gets to experience something like this because it's the best fucking thing ever. i am human now.",depression,3

""you'll get through it"". but i'm 29. when does it just get better? when does all of my hard work and effort turn into happiness? i feel like even the counselors i've been to don't want to hear my complaining. they just tell me to breath more when i feel anxious. like, fuck you! what do you think i'm doing! i go to yoga regularly and i'm still fucking anxious. i go jogging. i do weight lifting. i go for walks. i read. and i'm still do sad. but then again, maybe it's just me. maybe i'm just doing this all wrong. i should be able to figure out how to make myself better. i should be able to stop myself from being sad all the time. but no one wants to help me. no one wants to listen to me complain. i can see it in there eyes when i start to talk about my struggles. they can barely wait for me to change the subject. tl;dr how do you know if your depressed or if you just suck at life? i try so hard to make myself better but maybe in the end i'm just lazy and self-absorbed and that's why in unhappy. update: thank you all for your replies and kind words. i'm amazed this post got so many comments and likes. and even though i don't know you guys, it has made me feel really supported on these really bad days. i saw a new psychologist today who diagnosed me with with an adjustment disorder, coupled with anxiety and depression. she referred me to a prescriber, but i have to wait a couple weeks for an appointment. hopefully i can get some meds then. even though i don't feel any better, it's a little comforting to have a diagnosis. and even more comforting to know this community exists. thank you so much.",depression,3

(this will be kinda rambly) i was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety disorder after i checked into a psychiatric hospital a few years back, but i always felt as i grew up that something was wrong. when i went to go meet my biological mother (who is very bipolar) when i was 18 things started to click with me that i needed to figure out a way to find meaning. it didn't help that my step-mom was an abusive cunt. so overall i kinda suck at being a person.(still do) anyways, i've struggled with constantly feeling down, and also feeling a whole lotta shit i didn't really understand. because of this i turned to weed and alcohol when i was 15. went through a few phases of drinking hard, but really weed was my poison of choice(still dont think it's bad but that's for another sub). again anyways because of the plant i kinda regained a sense of what it meant to be a healthy functioning member of society, but it was only a sense. a taste of what its like to kinda face things with some objective stoicism. a new perspective. but its a fading remedy, a bandaid. it doesn't address the core of the problem. well, new years eve 2018 i get arrested for an ounce of pot and a gram of shrooms. as i stood there with those cuffs on i couldnt help but think ""damn, cant catch a break.."" that was a low point, sitting in that cell. in my own cell with anklets as if i were the most dangerous person in there. statistically speaking i kinda was, at least the type of person most frequently shot by police, a mentally ill colored man mid 20s. but i just wanted to feel better. for the past 15 years constantly thinking of the relief dying would be. those thoughts popped right back into my head with my ass on that cold bench. how nice it would be to not be a burden to my dad. i'm tired of feeling that way and to this day i feel that way. but... a human life doesnt last that long and i know one day ill die anyways. its the only thing promised when you're born is that you'll die. so i observe those thoughts and counter them with the former. ""i wanna die. -you will."" so how do i make this time count if none of it really matters. what do i do with this big cosmic joke of an existence? i make it worth it for my dad. we struggle. sometimes we dont know how we'll pay the rent, things get complicated with family, with work, with life. and all of it together makes me wanna opt out. but then i think of leaving him by himself to deal with it himself and what a living hell that would be. even if i cant do much, ill do what i can till i can't. because if i dont that would make me sadder than anything i can ever encounter in my life. my point is that out there there are strong, amazing, incredibly intelligent and driven people, who do this shit alone. while feeling everything. and its heart breaking. my dad spent his life trying to make me feel welcome when every fiber of my being says i don't belong on this earth. the least i can do is gtfo bed and try to do something. even if my battle that day is just to brush my teeth. so that he can see a good looking smile that he made. to make him feel just a little better. that's my part, my mission. thats what gets me up. there are people that can use your help, and you owe it to them. but that s just my opinion.",depression,3

ad51142a-6401-4c92-be3d-ec5da91fcf4b,i accidentally turned in my poem journal to my teacher.,"i had to turn in my notes for a class, and forgot that i had a bunch of private writing in there. my teacher saw it, showed it to my other teachers, and eventually the principal, who sent me to the school therapist... it was the most embarrassing thing i've ever had to endure. i was called up to the school therapist's office and she showed me some scans of the journal and asked me what was up. it was a series of self deprecating shit about how much of a cunt i am. she had me explain why i was feeling that way, etc. i was in that room for about 2 hours. sounds like an awful situation, right? it turned out to be one of the best days of my life (but somehow still awful). i was just like a lot of you guys, being afraid to seek help, feeling that it would not work/be a waste of time, even in the morning today. i got the (it didn't seem like it at the time) privilege of getting the help brought to me. i learned today that shit like this can work. when i say work, i really mean it: * i was able to tell somebody the actual struggles that i have for the first time in my life. * they are objective people, they will always understand * i openly told them that i wanted to kill myself, and i was not brought to a hospital or whatever, per my request. * my teachers have now built an understanding of why i have d's in all of their classes. * my family didn't and won't ever know a thing * i was able to get a proper clinical diagnosis that i do have depression (helpful, in the sense that it's now set in stone as an actual thing, and i can better understand it all) what was bad about it? * it was uncomfortable * it was embarrassing. take the fact that this is the only positive post that i have put on this sub (not about me nearly taking my life, or hating it) and realize that there is actual help to be had. even when it's uncomfortable as fuck, as i have come to find out. i'm still not happy, or even content. but i'm more sensible with thinking about the shit that has been going on in my life forever, and am able to think of it with a more realistic perspective. if anyone has any more questions or any advise for people reading this, unsure if they want some guidance or not? please, by all means put something down below. thank you, all.",depression,3
bbdec9f4-4ef7-46cd-afad-bce3c3d6a809,a cop stopped me from killing myself last night,"a bit of background about me: male, turned 25 last week. i just feel like i have nothing and no one to live for. i’ve been really struggling lately. the people i count on to come and talk to when i feel like shit just flat out don’t answer my texts, so i’ve stopped bothering texting them. the only girl i’ve ever been into shot me down and also never answers my messages either. so i stopped texting her as well. no one bothers checking on me so why should i reach out to them? my aunt died from brain cancer 3 years ago. and my older sister was killed by a drunk driver. i was seeing a therapist but stopped because i couldn’t afford it. they care more about money than the health of their clients. america summed up in one sentence i guess. i dropped out of engineering school in october after 6 years of college and multiple majors, 6 classes shy of graduating because i just didn’t wanna do it anymore. i was burned out and sick of busting my ass with nothing to show for it but exhaustion and stress. i may or may not go back. my student loans are due starting in june which i can’t afford. i have a car payment on top of it, paying for a car that i never wanted in the first place with money that i don’t have. i only bought it to shut my parents up about it, because my other one which i much prefer wouldn’t pass emissions for a completely bullshit reason but ran and drove perfectly all the same. i just absolutely fucking hate being told what i can and can’t do with my own damn car that i pay for 100% myself. my car is my therapist and my favorite thing that i own. i’m working a dead end job with no room for promotion or growth, and coronavirus got me laid off indefinitely til the whole mess dies down. i cannot possibly be expected to pay for all that shit when they know damn well millions of people are losing their fucking jobs. it’s been a month since quarantine and i can’t really even leave my house. can’t have a social life. just feel like i have no one to turn to and i’m drowning. every fucking day and i’m just done. i left my house earlier this evening fully intending on making it a one way trip. i waited til my family had all gone to bed, then i got in my car and just took off. i drove 2 hours away, into the next state looking for a good spot to carry it out. i eventually found a cliff and pulled up and just sat there for a few minutes looking out over it, trying to find the balls to drive over the edge. i got out of my car and sat on the hood just staring into the distance and started crying, thinking to myself how the fuck it came to this and how alone i felt. i was sitting there in the dark with tears streaming down my face when i heard a car pull up behind me and felt flashing blue lights. i knew it was a cop at this point but didn’t bother trying to hide myself. i just leaned on the hood of my car and continued crying to myself. he approached with a flashlight and noticed me. apparently he thought my car was abandoned at first. he was a young guy, probably about my age. he asked for my license and registration which i gave him. i’d said maybe two words to him at this point, and i think he picked up on the fact that i seemed a bit off. he asked me how i was doing and what i was doing so far from home at this time of night. it was like 1 am at this point. i just said that i needed to get out and clear my head at first, but eventually i admitted that i had driven up here to kill myself. i thought he was gonna freak out and cuff me and drag me kicking and screaming to a mental hospital, but he actually was remarkably calm. he asked why and what was going on in my life. he even came over and sat next to me on the hood of my car and listened. i had stopped crying but the tears came flooding back as it all came out, how i felt like i had no one. he didn’t interrupt and even put an arm around me. i eventually said i planned to drive my car off this cliff because i was so unhappy. he was silent for a few seconds and then told me he knew how it feels to want to die. apparently he came close to suicide a few times. a quote he said really stuck with me. it was “sometimes you can have everything and it still feels like nothing.” and it hit me that that was exactly how i felt. he gave me his personal number and said to call or text any time of day if i needed to talk. we sat there til about 2:30ish just talking. it was so nice to just vent to someone. eventually he said that he had to get going, but knowing what i just told him, we both knew he couldn’t leave me there alone for obvious reasons. he walked me back to my car and reminded me that he gave me his number. he walked back to the police cruiser and backed out, flashing his headlights at me to do the same. he followed me to the highway, turning off onto a side road and honking as he drove away while i got on the entrance ramp. i drove the 2 hours back home, not completely believing what had just happened and how he saved my life. i never even got his name or badge number. i got home close to 5 this morning and no one was up yet luckily. i snuck in and went to my room and slept for about 3 hours. i gave no indication to my family that i tried suicide the night before. no one knew that i went out last night. i still haven’t told them and i don’t plan to. they have no idea that i could’ve died. i called the officer’s number and left him a voicemail thanking him again. he texted me later in the day saying his offer was still valid any time. i have no idea if he had to fill out any paperwork and don’t really want to ask. everyone has at least one secret that they’ll take to their grave, and this is probably mine. it’s a long shot that he’ll read this but if he does, i don’t know what to say to him or how to thank him. his compassion saved my life. it’s crazy to think what would’ve happened if he had taken a different patrol route and hadn’t come along when he did. he deserves a promotion and to win the lottery. i owe him my life. cops get a bad rap for being arrogant, power hungry racists with itchy trigger fingers, but this particular officer represents what humanity should be like. we wouldn’t have people killing themselves if we simply stopped being assholes to each other. i don’t know if there’s a department medal for talking a suicidal person off the ledge, literally in my case, but he deserves it. i could probably call his department number and get his name and send him something in the mail. not a bad idea. godspeed officer. i’ll never forget this and how someone cared, and cared enough to actually do something about it.",depression,3

26f33536-ab5c-4cb4-8f86-c15a8522546c,realising how far i've come,"around 4 years ago, i went through the worst anxiety i have ever been through. i didn't understand what was wrong with me and thought i was dying. i couldn't be left alone or go outside without going through a panic attack. i would convince myself that every lump i felt was cancerous and make numerous visits to the hospital only for them to send me home after hours of waiting. i was prescribed diazepam/beta blockers and almost prescribed citalopram but i only choose to take 2 diazepam and that was it. during this time i told my mum that i wanted to be sectioned because i believed that i wasn't in control of myself and was unaware that it was my anxiety causing me to think this way. every appointment i attended was also through the help of my mum as i felt like i couldn't go to any of them alone. i received two visits by mental-health specialists, 1 of them believed i should be on medication for life and that i would need to take medication to function and do normal things. the other told me that i should prove him wrong. as time went on i began counselling and attended a group cbt class. at first i felt like nothing had changed and that i had wasted my time but looking back on it now, i feel like everything got put into perspective around that time when i realised that my anxiety is just a part of me and that no matter what discomfort i go through it always ends up going away, i chose to feel the anxiety and not let it affect me doing anything i wanted to do. within the past 2 and a half years i have attended job interviews, bank/doctor appointments and completed a mathematics course. i now do my own food shopping, have a part-time job which is a customer-facing role and i'm in the process of working with a job agency to get a better job. to cut a long story short, i have went from having severe agoraphobia and panic attacks (-4 years ago) to working a part-time job and doing everything for myself. i'll probably delete this post in few hours but i hope it helps somebody on here who feels like their life will never change. i'm also open to any questions, if there are any.",anxiety,1

38624dd1-c0b7-4689-a9a2-b86763d3f429,how i beat my anxiety disorder and advice on how to do so yourself,"so if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying i know how you feel. i’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, i’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, i’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. i’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. i’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, i’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. and i’ve felt like i was going crazy. a lot. but i’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. after almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; i’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. i was also on medication (an ssri since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off . so i wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because i know i really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when i first sought help in late april of last year. if you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold. i don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. if you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books i left in the second section. i think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference. before you read, i want to mention something once so i don’t have to later on. recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. it’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. but even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better. so here it is. my comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder. if you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down: at this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have gad and are constantly anxious. i was diagnosed with gad and pure-o but i’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so i know this advice will work for both. **1.** stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. this is the basis of acceptance and commitment therapy (act) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. to do this: * don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. this is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. when i was first having constant adrenaline rushes, i kept trying to consciously stop them. this was actually making things worse. the more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. the best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. * questions, doubts, and fear will come up. when they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. it may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. this was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency. * if this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. as the dare response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. if you’ve ever read a book on act, this step is likely in there. when you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. the symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. in case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” it’s not discussed very often, but i found it to be very helpful. **2.** do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. in older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in the dare response, barry mcdonagh calls it being “engaged.” this basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** again, much easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. but it’s an integral part of recovery. when i first started out, i found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. **3.** give it time. your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. if you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery. **4.** if recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. when i took my first dose of valium, i didn’t feel a thing. it took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but i will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. but since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term. **5.** journal. i don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as i’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. but in the beginning stages of my experience with gad, i found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what i was going through. just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. it’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit. **6.** get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. you don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive. **7.** this one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. it’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. if you’re lying down, lay on your back. if you’re sitting, sit up straight. once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step. constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks: if you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. but you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. you can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. you may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. so here’s what to do at this stage: **1. start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. the more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. in the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. when you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. in fact, i found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on audible, which is how i consumed them): * the dare response. phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. his techniques are a combination between act and a little cbt. i would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale. * feeling good: the new mood therapy. this book is considered the gold standard of cbt. it’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. i listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters i thought applied to me. it’s long, so i don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over. * rewire your anxious brain. this one is 1/4 cbt, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. i like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful. * the subtle art of not giving a fuck. this one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and i really like it. it serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. fair warning: mark manson describes ocd as “an incurable disease” in this book. he’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so i’d take that section with a grain of salt. but the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless. remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself. **2.** get into therapy. this is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. some things to look out for when you screen your therapist: * are they nice? kind of an obvious one but worth going over. do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? are their answers usually thoughtful and caring? * are they experienced? my first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. * are they accessible? or do you have to drive two hours to see them? are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month? it may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. i would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. **3.** continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. these are things that i remind myself of even now. the more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. in addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. if you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. if you’re down to two a day, try one. **4.** start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term: * cardiovascular exercise. it’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but i’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. when you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. if you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. so getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. if you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. you don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. more on this later. * meditation. the reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. it also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. in fact, it’s almost the opposite. while meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. a really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. there is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so i won’t go into it that much here. make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. i suggest trying out the meditation app calm. * diet. if you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but i’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. one of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. it is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. you can also take a magnesium supplement (i’ll defer to the dare response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. * medication. this one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. i didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. this is a really important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. medication only makes it happen more quickly. **5.** give it time. your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. it may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. so just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through. once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase. hovering around 4 - 6: if you’re at this stage, congratulations! the first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. so give yourself a pat on the back. once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. you may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. you’ve started reclaiming your normal life. you get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. but you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. in addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. so here’s what you should do at this stage: **1.** keep staying the course. it’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. but remember to pick up right where you left off. also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. and it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better. **2.** keep pushing the envelope. identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. i used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since i was a little kid. i’d find flaws in every interaction i had with others and nitpick every little thing. once i started working on this, i noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. this is part of how exposure and response prevention (erp) therapy works. you expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use cbt techniques to curb your conscious worry. an important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. if you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. people around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. but you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time. **3.** along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. when you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. the only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. i saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “i’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t i seeing my anxiety improve?” and the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. if you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement. **4.** start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. for a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. it’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. one of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. i stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. if you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. i spent my entire college career going to different doctors (i think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). i was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. if you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. you can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (i personally used the cbt method outlined in feeling good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. **5.** give it time. i’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. and remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon. i think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as i think understanding it will be really helpful. google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, i’ll give my own definition. cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. in other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. one example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. you might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think i’m a loser.” in this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. i used to think this a lot until i realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying i did was for nothing. a healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety. at this stage, i had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. i thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, i always second guessed my own sanity, i thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts i was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime i was happy, i thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. this is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: i thought i was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that i really was. if you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? this applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**. one of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that i was paying so much attention to them. at this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. i found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. i suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. i find that at this point the really important thing really is time. once i felt like i was going crazy for the hundredth time, i realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. this stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once i did, i hit the next stage. anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free: you’re in the home stretch. this is it. you’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. for me, having a day where i go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something i wouldn't have been able to do even before my anxiety disorder. certainly not anything i’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. and on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free. note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. at this stage: **1.** you know what works best for you. keep doing it. you have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. all that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. on the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. **2.** slowly lose your crutches. if you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. if you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. the more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel. **3.** keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. for me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. the more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do. there really isn’t much left to say at this stage. i found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because i knew i was so close to the finish line but not quite there. in case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come. then finally… no anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1: that’s it. all the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. all those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. you might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. it’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. you know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. you know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came. i don’t have any advice for this point. you know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. congratulations. you understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. remember this feeling. _ my therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb i think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. if it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. if it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. if it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. if it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. if it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. **summary:** **ease into your symptoms. remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. you’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.** **don’t fight it. when you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. so let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.** **keep yourself occupied. the more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.** **keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. expose yourself to more anxiety. exercise harder. try things you’ve never tried before. make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.** **regularly question your thoughts. just because you think something doesn’t make it true. you’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.** **give it time. you’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.** thank you for reading this. i really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained

b88ab655-7639-42a3-bdc4-8122e75668d2,i bury my best friend tomorrow. i bumped into my ex with another guy. i can't deal with this. i feel sick.,"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me that what's happening with her and him is not what it seems and she didn't want me to worry about something when it's not. she says they are not seeing each other and that he is just a work friend. that he is going through a hard time. we then get talking about how i'm feeling, how devestated i am, how i'm scared for wednesday. she and a mutual friend went to a concert last week and she mentions they talked. she said she went on a rant about how much she cares about me, that i was her best friend, that she is worried for me. she says she's nearly messaged me just to see if i want to hang out. she has come to me since my best friends death to apologise and she says that she will leave me alone now and will wait for me to message. i do say i miss her but right now my head is all over the place. i'm considering my options about going home and starting again. that i'm not looking for anyone right now. i'm just tired, exhausted. she said i look like i haven't eaten well, that i'm really pale. she nearly went to the same club as me the night before but didn't and stays she's glad she didn't. she offers to cook me a meal or go for coffee. that she is always here for me. i ask again about them and she says they're not seeing other, that something could happen but it isn't. i accidentally saw her open diary just before the break up about a guy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible.",anxiety,1

81432ed3-ee14-4110-be66-6088a2085465,does your anxiety make it difficult/impossible to rationally see situations and nothing's just a little bad - it's always cataclymic,"couldn't think how to title this. i've got other issues but i'm thinking this one may be tied to my anxiety/panic problems (or maybe it just exacerbates them?) for example, i've noticed it most pointedly the past week while my cat's been sick. she's been to the doctor, i'm handling the practical stuff. but emotionally it's roller coaster. she seems to be feeling better (responding to meds and eating) and my mind's saying yeah, she's back. she seems a lil stiff and not eating as much as the previous days and my mind starts planning her funeral. (rationally i can see she's not acting like a sick cat, you can tell when they're uncomfortable and have given up. plus the vet hasn't done or said anything that seems like they think she's that sick. it's just my scared little mind that won't shut up and stop crying) it's like anything (in general, not just currently with the cat), but any time something isn't perfect, it's the end of the world and i'm positive it'll never get better. so i seem to spend a lot of time worrying about how i'm gonna handle the worst-case scenario which my mind won't stop telling me is definite even though the rational whisper knows i've never yet had to deal with the worst-case scenarios. i'm just wondering if y'all can relate? is this an anxiety/panic related thing? i've got some other issues (diagnosed bipolar and self-suspected mild asperger's) so i'm trying to define/understand what's going on with this catastrophe thinking because i deal with my issues/symptoms best when i understand better where they stem from.",anxiety,1

6a771516-a6dd-451f-b741-f36c90a63bec,my personal tips for anxiety (long post),"i haven't beat my anxiety, and i don't think that is ever possible. it's important to understand that anxiety is natural, and everyone experiences it; anxiety is a human emotion and it is natural to feel it. for some of us, it can be detrimental to our life however. i apologize if there are any grammatical or spelling errors. tl;dr: eat varied vegetables, exercise everyday, meditate, detach yourself from mental clutter, be aware of your drug intake, pay attention to the moment, engage in flow, seek anxiety and confront it. **nutrition** you are what you eat. if you are neglecting your diet you are neglecting your mind. personally, i have had a lot of success by implementing certain foods and being aware of the effect that these foods have on my body. tl;dr: eat vegetables, supplement magnesium ,abstain from caffeine or supplement l-theanine, learn about your gut microbiome, consume less sugar and eat more vegetables, consume sufficient fats. * magnesium: magnesium relaxes the body and helps contribute to a healthy electrolyte balance. personally, i noticed a severe reduction in my tremors and baseline anxiety level once i started to supplement magnesium glycinate. * caffeine: this appears to be obvious, but i feel like a lot of people do not think about this. excessive caffeine levels increase the amount of mental noise i have, which results in higher levels of anxiety. * l-theanine: a natural amino acid that is found in green tea. if you do choose to consume caffeine, combine 200mg theanine with your caffeine dosage to help combat any anxiety. also works splendidly as a study aid. * gut microbiome: i am not going to pretend to thoroughly understand this complicated system. but, from my understanding we have a second ""brain"" in our stomach. the bacteria that we choose to feed within our stomach has a feedback system, which fuels certain cravings and can change our mental state. this is why your anxiety may peak after a round of anti-biotics, you have eliminated all the bacteria in your stomach, and if you eat a diet rich in sugars or simple carbs you will have fed the bad bacteria. if your gut is populated by these bad bacteria, it will have repercussions on your mental health. * microbiome practical advice: consume more fiber and vegetables to feed good bacteria. consume more probiotics rich foods such as kimchi, kefir, saurkraut, and kombucha. favoid simple carbohydrates such as sugars, white bread, etc. avoid alcohol. consider supplementing a probiotics, examine.com is a fantastic resource to find the right supplement for you. **lifestyle** tl;dr: exercise every day, no matter what you do; meditate every day; assess your drug use and understand if you are using them as a tool or a escape. * exercise: start exercising more. in the slight edge the author jeff olson talks about momentum, and consistency. your goals are just do something, every single day. it is alright if you have a terrible workout, or if you only did a 15 minute walk. the goal is to create habits in regards to exercise, which will be easier to do if you reinforce this habit every day. on days that i really do not want to go to the gym, i tell myself that i only need to walk in and start doing one lift, if i still want to leave, i let myself leave. * **meditation**: key! anxiety comes from repeated negative thought loops, and a rejection of emotions. if i tell you that you can think about anything, but do not think about a white polar bear, you will find it almost impossible to not give the polar bear attention. by resisting the idea of a polar bear, you are forced to pay attention to it. anxiety works the same way. when you try to force a thought out of your head, you give it attention, which creates a negative thought loop. meditation allows us to practice being mindful. instead of thinking about our anxiety or the negative thought, you divert your attention to the sense (hearing, sight, physical sensations). this allows us to acknowledge the negative thought, and move on. * meditation continued: there a two types of thinking going on. you have mental noise: these are thoughts that arise spontaneously and we have no control over. for some people these are very negative. behind this mental noise we have the observer however, this is you. when you are engaged in a activity that creates flow, your mental noise is reduced, and the observer has complete control. engaging in mediation allows us to get in contact with this observer, separating us from our mental noise. * drug use: this is a complicated subject, and if you do choose to consume drugs please make sure to properly educated yourself through erowid, or the different subreddits here. drugs take away what they give you. if you are consuming marijuana to run from your negative feelings, you may find that you are unable to cope with them sober. personally, i know that weed significantly contributes towards my anxiety. it causes me to overthink and sit in my head, rather than in the environment around me. mushrooms, lsd, and dmt have been the most effective means for me to solve my anxiety. if you choose to consume these drugs however, please be aware that these are powerful psychoactive substances that can have repercussions on your mental well being. physically, they are incredibly safe. personally, they allowed me to view my life free from the ego, which let me adopt a healthier mindset. if you are using drugs (which includes alcohol) to escape your negative feelings, you are not solving the problem. it is in the background, unsolved and growing. **techniques** tl;dr: try to observe your thoughts, engage in flow, take time to be mindful about your physical sensations, separate the observer and the mind. * noting: this creates a barrier between the observer, and your mental noise. when you feel anxiety, be aware of the physical sensations. think ""this is my body feeling anxiety, my bodies faces is flushed, my hands are shaking, and there is a pressure in the back of my head"". this allows you to understand that your body and mind may act seperately. * you are not your thoughts: your thoughts are not completely true and are built upon heuristics. just because you believe that your coworkers are talking about you, this does not make it true. our brains are incredible, but they are oftentimes inaccurate. * mindfulness: again, the goal is to dwell less in our brains, and focus more on the present moment. there is no past or future, the only thing that truly exists is the present moment. when your anxiety is peaking, take time to focus on the sensation of your breath, rub your fingers together and be aware of the feeling, do anything that grounds you with your physical sensation. * watch your brain: take the time every day to just let your brain think. don't try to control your thoughts or empty your brain, just wait and see what your next thought will be. if it is negative, don't reject the thought. follow the thought as far as your mind wants to, and move on when you notice another thought arise. again, this creates a barrier between you and your mind. * flow: have you ever played a game where you are completely in the moment? maybe the ball was just thrown to you, and your body seems to react automatically. this is flow, and it is a important part of our mental well-being. you can achieve this state through many different activities, take the time to find the ones that you can find flow in. **the importance of fear**: courage isn't the absence of fear, but the ability to recognize your fear and act anyway. by engaging in activities that give you anxiety, you will find that your anxiety is often times unfounded. this sounds difficult, but honestly the best thing you can do with your anxiety is to push yourself. take baby steps, don't jump into the deep end. you will be controlled by your anxiety if you don't push the levels a bit. if you have social anxiety, start talking more online. make small talk with the cashier. find whatever baby steps work for you. **therapy**: you are not weak if you consult a therapist. please, if you are really struggling go and try to talk to some different therapists. they are generally wonderful people who just want you to live a happy, fulfilled life. **recommended reading:** siddhartha by herman hesse meditations by marcus aurelius the power of now by eckhart tolle the subtle art of not giving a fuck by mark manson the slight edge by jeff olson the feeling good handbook by david burns. these are some of the things that have helped me, hopefully you find something that can help you as well. if you have any suggestions or something that you would like to comment on, please do.",anxiety,1

3453112a-ee35-4715-9b4d-e2d447a9336f,wife had panic attack in the theater and passed out.,"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passed with her in this state and i thought i had a real medical emergency on my hands. there were only two other people in the theatre with us, and they were a couple rows ahead of us. they glanced back when i started to loudly say, *""are you okay?! honey, are you all right?""* i was about to call 911. with her head in my hands, i placed my mouth against her ear and yelled, *""can you hear me?! honey!?!""* suddenly, there was signs cognition. her eyes opened, and she started breathing very quickly. i'd estimate she was out for about a minute. she glanced around like she was trying to figure out where she was at, and finally seemed to see and recognize me. in between gasps for breath she managed to say, *""i'm having a panic attack.""* up to that point i didn't know what was going on. i was so scared. *""come on, let's go.""* i said. i put my arm under hers and held her tightly as we descended the stairs. she wasn't steady on her feet, and was leaning on me quite a bit. when we finally got out of the theatre she collapsed down on the floor against the wall and kind of rocked a little bit back and forth. *""i... can't... take... visceral horror.""* she said. i just held her; trying to comfort her. after a couple minutes she said she felt well enough to walk, so we walked back to our car. she said she didn't need to go to the hospital. we only live about 5 minutes from the theatre. after we made it home, she said she just needed me to hold her and help her feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?",anxiety,1

(i know that everyone does this, and try to remind myself most people aren't paying attention to everything i say, but i feel like an extreme case of this). i have trouble in awkward silences with coworkers not filling the silence, like i never know when to leave someone's office or how to stop talking when someone is in my office--even if i want the person to leave. i don't talk to anyone outside of work except for some out of town friends via text (i type too much there, too). i had some friends i used to hang out with at these gatherings where they'd host people at their house weekly, and i stopped hanging out with them suddenly. i saw them recently when they came by to pick up something from me, and it was a pretty awkward encounter, and they didn't say anything like ""we miss you at the gatherings"" or ""why don't you come anymore?,"" or ""you should come next week,"" or anything, really, outside of a vague ""we should get dinner sometime"" that sounded like the clichéd thing people say when parting, regardless of whether they mean it. this is something i've identified as an external clue (as in, not something from my own head) that they might also find me annoying. i'm not quite sure if i should work on: (a) just accepting that i am an annoying person and being okay with keeping my contact with others limited in order to avoid inadvertently thrusting myself upon a social group one too many times, or (b) if i should work on convincing myself that i'm not annoying, even if it isn't really true.

(this was one of my co-workers) but when i struggled with low mood i was told ‘we all have days like that’ ... ‘don’t let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable’ this is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. of course it’s not all bad, i’m lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me. i felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if you’ve been accepted or told to ‘hide’ symptoms from the public to spare their discomfort... like your doing it on purpose.",anxiety,1

9e558ae6-4966-473e-ae3f-a77ea2c70fbc,"finally after 8 years of severe anxiety and daily panic attacks i have finally got to the point where i no longer take daily medication, and am basically ‘cured’.","i (26 m) am by no means saying that i still don’t feel anxious now and then but i have definitely regained control of my life. i am now living the life that i want to live. no longer is anxiety holding me back from doing anything in life i want to. i am going to try my best to list of a few key points that helped me get to where i am today i no for a fact that i am going to miss out a lot of information just for the fact that it has took a shit ton of little things to get me to where i am. taking time to heal: 1 year ago i made the hard decision to take a break from my toxic job to focus on my own health, this was a super hard decision to make but it enabled me to take the time i need to push myself out of my comfort zone and focus on myself. consistently exercising and eating better: i had no self confidence and was always exhausted so i used to eat junk food most nights just because i felt like shit and the food made me feel worse, now i eat much cleaner, no caffeine alcohol or sugary drinks stopped smoking especially cannabis, i still treat myself of a weekend to what ever i want but for the most part i plan my meals in advance and make sure i eat them throughout the week. and the benefits of exercise are well documented but could not be underestimated. sleep: this was harder than you might think for me and i massively underestimated its value, i have never been a good sleeper usually getting anywhere from 2/5 hours sleep a night was not uncommon, but after a lot of self experimenting what works best for me i have finally got it under control i am now getting between 7/8 hours a night and the difference is chalk and cheese, when you wake up refreshed from a nights sleep there is no better feeling. took a break from ‘soical media’: i deleted all social media accounts (except reddit) and to be honest i have not got them back and i don’t think i will, people portray an image of themselves to the world that they want them to see not their real selves, and it can make you compare yourself to other people which in my opinion is not healthy, focus on yourself. perseverance: not everything you try is going to succeed, over these 8 years i have tried and failed more timed than i could ever count, but i always try again the next day, small victories are the key, i would push myself every day to do something i was uncomfortable doing, some days i would fail but i would try again until i could complete what i had set out to do then more. take experience and tips and tricks from people who have been there before: there is an old saying i can not remember where i heard it but it goes ‘ no man is your friend, no man is your enemy, every man is your teacher’, and basically my interpretation of it is you can learn from any and everyone, and that is what i did i did my own research and reached out to anyone with knowledge about anxiety and panic attack’s and see what they knew about it that i didn’t. i am not writing this to gloat i am writing this so that if even 1 person out there who thinks there is no way out or that life can never go back to ‘normal’ i am living proof that there is, better days are ahead. i hope anyone reading this might find it usually or insightful and if you have any questions leave them below and i will try my best to answer as best as i can.",anxiety,1

42bfaf7b-5094-4b5c-aa5d-8ae25b4b7659,my 5 year journey of agoraphobia,"i wrote a reply to someone elsewhere about my anxiety -- and it made me think about finally speaking about it more publicly. perhaps some people can benefit from my long, embarrassing, terrifying journey. the pictures in this post merely represent improvement over time, although the video would help a lot more, i am not sure if i should publish them or not, at least yet. my journey with anxiety still continues after five years, but at varying points i have had improvements. i lost a job as a result of anxiety, and gradually anxiety took over my life, ending up pure agoraphobic. i did not leave my house for 3 months, and then a few months later i agreed to take fluoxetine (prozac). i started at a mere 1mg because i believed that the medication would make me worse, and result in my death. gradually i rose it over a few weeks until i [finally took my first full to be honest, it gave me headaches but i did sometimes get a feeling of different peace. but then i would often feel quite hyperactive. i started walking to places again, but was probably still using a lot of alcohol at the time. at certain times i would also use propranolol but was convinced it would also kill me. one day i managed to have dental work done, but they gave me 2 diazepam (10mg). the feeling from those finally gave me a feeling of freedom for the first time. i was no longer inside the zone of anxiety. a couple of months past by, and i started acquiring it. eventually i was taking about 10-15mg/day, and the doctors wanted me off it, so i decided to taper. eventually i was off that and onto pregabalin, as it helped the side effects. pregabalin definitely helped me and was the first medication i liked besides the previous diazepam. i have also taken citalopram and hated it, and flipped out and went on an 8 hour bike ride hoping it would come out of my system. although i have had similar thoughts before. sometimes i would freak out and think maybe if i slit my wrists i could bleed out a chemical or something. i guess that is why i was eventually put on something called early intervention for psychosis. **i didn't leave my town for 4 years.** i used a lot of alcohol. i had incidents were i passed out and the usual stuff, and i believed that ultimately, i was going to die. i had nightmares daily about dying in plane crashes. there mere noise of a bus began to eat away at me. i believed that death would be an option, however i never truly acted upon it with intention. i decided to take sertraline at the recommendation of multiple doctors, and all i can say with regards to that is it did help me a bit. gradually i started walking further. but to be honest, i have become very apathetic on it and feel it is time to stop. not to mention it gives me slight diarrhea sometimes. no headaches though. interestingly once i started sertraline, i started therapy, and had a worker within the nhs that drove me to see the sea. [for the first time in 5 years i could hear the -- it was an incredibly experience as quite honestly i believed i should have been dead. i was on 100mg/day, i'm now on roughly 12.5mg. [i caught a bus for the first time and went ...maybe 1/4 of a but that was a success also. i'm a bit more stable these days, however i have relapsed on benzos. at the end of the day benzos are *fucking effective*. they are the gold standard for anxiety. the problem i have right now is i probably should taper but tbh i do not see the point right now -- as i am presently on sertraline still, including ~30-40mg propranolol, ~400mg pregabalin and 10-30mg diazepam. i eventually overcame my fear of propranolol and it actually proved fairly useful. infact in some cases it is more useful than a benzo... sort of. today i am slightly more stable imo, and propranolol and diazepam and pregabalin maintain stability for now. i'd like to try and just decrease all of the drugs in my system. although some people take way more than me :) recently i finally had the courage to travel in a car to other places. [i sat in a city and had no anxious thoughts. i was i am determined to beat this, and i hope my story and pictures can illustrate how when you are in your darkest moment, [there is a chance to see the you can get better, although i am still on that journey myself. we must learn from each other. personally i am slowly coming to terms with the idea i may eventually die, and as such have prepared this however i am determined to live. good luck to you all.",anxiety,1

12fe7e77-730e-4d7b-b6a3-a8032412018b,recently i've been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses that have led to me being fired from my job.,"my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medication early on, i was put on suicide watch due to my new medications not working properly. i have had a girlfriend for 4 years now, i just play games now and skate, no negative influences in my life. none the less, last month i lost my job, where both my girlfriend and i worked together, and commuted together for 2 hours everyday. we both made pretty decent incomes, my girlfriend is my back bone and structure to things getting better in my life. i can't thank her enough despite me losing my job and making the workplace awkward for her. she helped me apply for disability. she helped me stay in contact with my advocate for whatever questions needed to be answered. we filled out the questionnaire's together and made the best of a shitty situation, we have savings to go off of, luckily we live with her father in a nice location in california rent free, we cover utilities and our phone bill/internet and that's it. well, has and groceries as well, we just do our best on her one income until my sdi gets submitted and approved. i'm currently seeking my residency and gathering needed paperwork for the drivers written test, then i can finish my sdi application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so fucking difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day.",anxiety,1

99ef81f1-e858-4dbc-8336-e03caa8266da,dbt day one - radical acceptance and healthy distraction,"dialectical behavior therapy aims to balance accepting things as they are with aiming for positive change. the main disciples in dbt are mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation, and distress tolerance. each day (if i can keep this up) we will discuss an exercise from one of these topics. the first and most basic distress tolerance skill in my book is distraction. distraction gives you time to create an appropriate response to pain or impulse by temporarily stoping you from thinking about the pain or impulse. distraction is different from avoidance because you still intend to deal with the situation in the future, when you are more ready. sometimes for me if i can distract myself from emotional pain the pain passes on it's own with no further action necessary. an example would be when i get worse depression at night - by morning i feel fine. all i need to do is distract myself until the emotion passes. sometimes the problem does not pass, such as job hunting, paying bills, legal trouble, etc. it's still okay to distract yourself for a while so that you can form a healthier response to the problem later. distraction helps us avoid negative behaviors such as cutting, drug use, etc. step one is radical acceptance. this means accepting things as they really are. one example might be to say ""i am bipolar, and i am depressed."" or "" it's no use fighting the past."" step two is to distract yourself from the situation using a healthy coping skill. some examples include squeezing an ice cube, writing on your self, screaming into a pillow, crying (you will stop eventually!), talking to a friend, watching tv, drinking water, exercise, meditation, prayer, reading, etc. please comment with a radical acceptance statement and a distraction that you think will help you in that situation. i'll go first. i am bipolar and i am hypomanic. this is my current reality. i will post on reddit to distract myself from my desire to do more exercise (which would be bad because i'm hardly eating and i've already exercised a lot today). browsing redding will distract me from an impulse. here is a hypothetical example (it's not relevant now, but it will be later). i am bipolar and i am depressed. i want to kill myself now, but i will probably feel better in the morning. i will call my uncle and talk on the phone to distract myself from the pain. if he doesn't pick up, i will pet my dog. it is ok to cry. feel free to type out more than one example. it might be a good idea to do one for feeling up and one for feeling down. this post was guided by the dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook by mckay, wood, and brantley, but it is original content. if you share credit ssnakeggirl and the dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook or you're plagiarizing big time. the book is $11 new and $4 used, so if you want your own copy it's very accessible.",bipolar,2

(i’m paraphrasing what i got out of our conversations.) now, i’m about to leave work to go home, having just received a text saying he didn’t pass, and i’m afraid it will be my fault...again. i didn’t take care of the dog so that he could study, i didn’t find a new therapist quickly enough so that i could vent to them and not him, i didn’t grocery shop, i didn’t - and this one is a quote - “get [my] shit together so that [he] could focus on studying and work”. i guess this isn’t the short version, but i don’t have therapy until sunday and my brain is running at full speed trying to figure out if this is going to somehow be my “fault” again, or if he’ll be able to take responsibility for not studying enough and/or prioritizing other things, procrastinating/taking too long with work projects that caused him to fall behind, or just accept the fact that the test is damn hard and might take at least one more go. logically i know it’s not me, but “a lie told often enough becomes the truth” (ugh, i’m sorry i’m paraphrasing lenin here) is starting to take hold in this situation.",bipolar,2

(and i'm 18 so i'd think the doctor would have asked me first. guess not.) anyway she called me ungrateful and wouldn't let me speak and i dunno. it hit me. she said: ""i'm better off dead than i am alive to you, because nothing i do as your mother makes you happy."" i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth right there and then, ngl. i know that isn't the (logical) answer to this, but she isn't the only one who's said stuff like this. 2) my ldr boyfriend of two years broke up with me last night. he says he doesn't feel like he can talk to me, because he says offhanded things, and for a while, i didn't address them until months later (which is toxic). and now he feels that he'll fuck up no matter what he does, so what's the point. in the past i've addressed things as they came up and he either made fun of me, got super defensive, or asked ""so what's the problem?"". for example: he didn't speak to me for long periods of time. for like. a year. cancelled majority of skype dates at the last second. i said that i knew he has other obligations, but that still felt a bit emotionally neglected. (being left on read for days and sometimes weeks, not hearing from him for months, reading an ""i love you, too"" from him was rare. i felt like he didn't like me.) but he said that i had no reason to believe that. he had a roommate who made me cry, and he didn't defend me. even if i say that i didn't appreciate a comment, he would just join him. of course, he didn't mean to be rude, and of course he didn't mean to overlook my crying, didn't mean to misunderstand me. but he refused to buy earbuds because of his ""indispoable income"" (even if he went out to drink once a month). which gave his roommate ammo to be a bully. so i mailed my then-bf earbuds and he lost them. it felt as if he didn't put any effort into the relationship, and was justifying himself. when i asked if he wanted to break up, he sounded surprised and confused as to why. said that he loves me. i wasn't angry, just hurt and confused with all the mixed messages. but i said i believed him and ignored my gut. plus, on holidays, he drives six hundred miles in one go to visit me (and his family. so contrary to what he says, i'm not the only reason he comes to the city i live in.) but he said ""you think i wanna see my family? barely anyone there wants to see me. i'm driving for nine hours straight just so see you. of course i love you."" he gave multiple examples of his responsibilities, asked if i understood, and still asked what the problem is. i couldn't tell him anything other than ""i know you're busy but this is kinda bothering me man. we need to work on our communication"" thing, so i felt like i was crazy. i asked him if he felt any sort sort of way. his answer was always no. my response is that were in a long distance relationship which makes vulnerable communication important. makes understanding each other's love languages important. he didn't get what i meant. eventuallly, i stopped acknowledging every unintentionally rude thing he said and did, because ""nothing is wrong"" and he noticed the changes in my behaviors. said i ""excude negativity"". called it complaining. so i just stopped, not wanting to be negative or complaintitive. later on, he kinda had to pull teeth to get me to, but i asked him for the clarity i needed about his actions; on a road trip. he did. everything felt resolved after. last night, he shared that we never talk and that everything feels miserable until we're physically together. i felt the same; that is the anxiety i tried to communicate with him a year ago, that he didn't acknowledge, a while before i ignored it too, what used to make me cry. now it's making him cry. making him miserable. it's horrible. it makes me miserable too but ever since i ignored the doubt and anxiety, i was able to function normally. but now *his* behavior is affected, he says. he told me how he feels about me for the first time, in literally two years. and basically; he doesn't associste me with his happiness anymore because we have such poor communication. so he's been *avoiding* me. and he doesn't want to hate me, so it's best to just leave this as is. it's crazy how the table flipped *and* self destructed; he's as anxious as i used to be about our relationship, and i'm (acting) as lax as he was. i basically transferred my anxiety to him by not addressing what i needed to, until months later. i don't know if this is a hypocrisy thing; where it begins with his aloofness and my anxiety, and ends with *my* aloofness and *his* anxiety. with him feeling emotionally neglected. it's almost like this is a taste of his own medicine. because i totally understand how he feels and don't question it a bit. it's just feels like he wasn't listening to me, when i tried to address the same thing. he even joked to his little sister's. we were in his car when one of them asked us how she should ask out a boy. he said: ""dating is overrated. imagine having a little chris of your own."" and his sisters said ""aaaw"" at the same time. he said: ""no! imagine. just sitting there. minding your own business. and out of nowhere, they come up to you, and say they think you two need to *work on your communication.""* i was so confused: what *else* are relationships supposed to be like? metacommunication is important. his sisters seemed confused, too. and after an awkward silence, he just kept driving. didn't say anything else until one of the girls made another joke. i wanted to cry but didn't say anything. for a while, i did what he did. not respond immediately (but within the same day), but i still told him that i love him. asked him about his feelings. tried to be open up around him, regardless of his blank reactions. but it failed; nothing i did could get him to open up, too. so we both closed up. unless he asked me to send a nude. then i'd get heart emojis and an ""i love you, good night"" for a day or two. anyway. is anything i'm saying here being needlessly negative? this is yet another relationship in which my dissatisfaction rubs off onto the other person. i don't know if i'm a toxic person, but i don't want to be. i try not to be. bottling up doesn't help, talking about it makes it worse. i don't know what to do. 3) this girl in my art class i wanted to call my friend, noticed when i wasn't myself. at first, i avoided her, because she told the class she has depression (for a ""draw something that hinders you"" project) so i gave her space. eventually, she opened up to me. sometimes she had her moods, but kept to herself in said moods. when she felt like it, we'd talk and have fun. when we got close, she asked me what was wrong, and when i said i don't have any complaints, she said ""sure, but self expression isn't complaining"" all nice and sweet. so i told her about not knowing where to go in my relationship. i told her about my house flooding. about how being transgender in a transphobic household makes living in a beautiful suburban home feel so hostile. about how i got kicked out of the house when i came out. she was understanding and showed her support. invited me to sleepovers. every time i came to school unlike myself, she would try to get me to smile and open up, because ""bottling in stuff as stressful as this is unhealthy."" i even said: ""you're not my therapist. i see him on saturday. knowing you're my friend is enough to make me feel great. i just have to get out of my funk."" or something simular. many times. she still said things that encourage opening up. kept asking what was wrong on the days i was quieter than usual. eventually she started avoiding me, too. avoiding everyone. got in a real bad funk. said uncalled for comments to me and to other people. i understand how depression can be; but that doesn't excuse her from being mean. from playing rough and with scissors (as a seventeen year old). from going out of her way to patronize people. but she put on her snapchat story her suicidal thoughts, talking about how everyone she knows is against her. so i swiped up, let her know that i apologize if i wronged her, and that i want her to be okay. that i don't think anyone is against her. that i am here if she needs to talk. she said that i can't make her pity me, and i was baffled. that she doesn't have the energy for my bullshit. (yikes.) that i shouldn't play nice if i don't feel nicely about a person. (still don't know what's she was talking about but it was childish. but still yikes.) and then she said all i do is complain about my family problems and boyfriend and do nothing to fix it. (that was when i said ""good to know,"" and blocked her. hehe.) it's so funny that she *asked me* what's wrong, didn't accept ""nothing"" for an answer, and then secretly hated when i was open and honest. i thought she was my friend. but i guess only therapists are meant to hear your problems. anyway. i digress. days after i blocked her, she came around me in person. went out of her way to sit next to me. acted fearful, as if i would reject her. took every single chance she got to be overly nice. for example: i was presenting and the class (of 13 people) was talking over me. she stood up, cupped both hands over her mouth, and projected: ""everyone! chris is talking! it is important to hear what they say, so that they can finish their presentation!"" sat down, then grinned at me. the class had the same weirded-out expression as i did. like. ugh. that was so artificial that it hurt me. i have a floridan friend who i tell some of these situations with, and he says it sounds like the other person has some unsolved problems of their own. my therapist said the same thing about all three scenarios. that nothing i complain about is like.

009c89be-d2ec-4678-943c-3025644c4244,my doctor gave me validation today and an eight month hiatus,"two months ago i went to my psychiatrist after being stable for a year and asked her for adderall. i made a total fool of myself. what i didn't realize is that i was on a downward spiral. all of my responsibilities have been unmanageable but i didn't realize it. slowly but surely, my mental health declined until it was affecting me physically. i was having acid reflux that was so severe it was making me vomit... even though i take zantac every night. the reflux was worse when i was late to work (every day) so it was happening because of stress. i haven't been myself in months. a couple of days ago after i quit yet another job, i realized i need a time out. but we need an income. i don't want ssi, just time to get healthy. the welfare office agreed to give me cash assistance if i got a medical waiver saying i can't work. i fully expected my doctor to say no. i thought asking for six months off was too much. but she agreed with me. she told me she knew from experience that a person who has been stable asking for a control is a sign they're slipping. she said she knows how hard i work and it's understandable that i need a time out. my doctor gave me eight months, minimum. she will let me have up to 12 months if i need it. i'm going to use this time to completely overhaul my life and get help. it just feels so damn good to be validated.",bipolar,2

4ab4a2a8-6bf9-476d-ae14-ceb9e032ad32,bdsm: first steps back since being diagnosed. (nsfw per content),"i've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, nos, since november 15 2017. my world was turned upside down that day. it's been seven months since, and i've done an incredible amount of reflection and research. how this affected my life up to this point, what i need to do moving forward, and how i need to approach things anew. the most fraught is the topic of bdsm. i have been involved in my local bdsm community for a few years, and i've learned much about safe, sane and consensual, as well as risk aware consensual kink. impact play, rope, sensory deprivation, wax, electric play, fire play... i've had experiences as a dominant and as a submissive, i've fucked up more than once, and i've learned from all of these experiences. but i've also placed myself in harms way. more times, i think, than even i realize. two instances that come to mind are when i impulsively jumped in a cast iron cage and asked to be locked in without designating a dominant, limits, what i wanted to happen, anything like that. i just wanted to fuck around. i scooted myself around the floor \(the cage was on wheels\), undid locks, twiddled with the wheel brakes, did everything i could to just be a nuisance and try to get away. when someone took a cane and started rattling the bars, literally, i tried grabbing at it and was struck on my big toe. reflexively i called ""red"", the 'scene' ended, and i was left with the sordid task of sorting out exactly where i went wrong: i should not have gotten into that cage in the first place. i didn't set up any of the usual safety guards, and i fell into a significant depression after that. it was awful. before that even, i negotiated a scene with a trusted dominant friend of mine. i told him ""i want to go hard, i want to push past my limits."" he started flogging me, i took it, but then i felt an incredible **rage** pushing itself outside of me. i bellowed like a lion, attacked the concrete wall in front of me, tears streaming down my face, so angry so sad so fucking furious so much self hatred. i asked him to hit me as hard as he could with his fists, and...he said no. he hit me, he placed his strikes well, but he immediately started winding down the scene and did not hit me as hard as he could. we've talked about that night many times since, and last night we discussed it again. in short, he suspected that i was bipolar for a while, because of that and many other small things he's seen, but he refrained from saying anything because he's not a medical professional. the biggest thing, he said, is that i was pushing too far too fast. and he's absolutely right. i was. a curious feature of mania is obsession. not ritualized obsession necessarily, but obsession coming out of an intense desire for something. this is usually referred to as ""goal directed behavior"" by the white coats. for me, when i began to involve myself in my local community on a regular basis and really start to push myself to learn, i pushed myself all the way. coming up with contrived scenes, delving into what i felt was, then, the deepest part of my kinky self, allowing my feelings and my mind to just fucking go...to relinquish all direction over my thoughts and feelings when i was strapped in my gas mask and chained naked to the wall... i pushed myself as hard as i could, almost self destructively, to the point that if my dominant friend had not acted as a grounding force and put the brakes on many things very early, i most certainly would have come to serious harm. i knew this before i was diagnosed, but afterwards, realizing where my drive was coming from, where my obsession with bdsm and all the kinkalicious things there are that can be done that i want to learn and master and experience, i feel like that energy was like a wildfire: incredible, amazing, intoxicating, consuming and destructive. i'm now on lamictal, 200mg, and lithium, 900mg/day. last night i took my lithium an hour or so before the party, with a few anxiolytics as i felt my anxiety really kicking into gear. when i got to the party,...i felt good. i felt normal. i didn't feel driven, i didn't feel pushed. i was able to keep myself from falling into a depression that was lurking at the side of my thoughts, engage with people head on, manage my energy levels, have normal conversations that didn't go immediately to the newest and lewdest kinkalicious thing i had discovered... i was able to just enjoy the party. and that's also when i realized that i was in a safe, sane, level headspace to negotiate and undergo a scene. i scened with my dominant friend. we started with me in my gasmask, on the wall, and following some light sensory play it went into impact play. halfway through, i took off my gasmask and looked him in the eye as we went into harder edge play: breath play, knife play, things that i was able to consent to with a level mind and a grin on my face. it was an incredibly intimate scene, and the kicker really came from facing him for the first time i think, eye to eye, no gasmask on. from now on i don't think i'll be using that tool again, unless the scene calls for it. more importantly to me, i was able to explore a new headspace that...doesn't delve into what i once thought was ""crucial"" and ""essential"" to my kink and how i practice it, what i've referred to as ""toy"" headspace before. i feel safer, i feel that i'm doing the right things now, and i feel that i have more of my dominant friend's trust than i did before. previously, rightfully, he held his reservations because i was \(unbeknownst to me at the time\) in an altered headstate. but when he suggested knife play, a kink i brought up very early with him, i knew that he felt confidence enough in me to judge me fit to explore this particular kink. and that means a lot to me. i'm safer now. i am seeking and getting the help i need. i'm more readily able to consent now, being of sound\(er\) mind and able to fully, presently grasp everything that is happening and that i am agreeing to, without losing myself to my mind's maelstrom. and i am saner. but i think that goes without saying. the bedrock of what i have always believed in, the foundation of how i try to practice my kink \-\- safe, sane, consensual \-\- is strengthened, and i really feel indebted to my dominant friend, as well as all the others who have taught and coached and reprimanded me in my journey, for keeping me safe while i had less insight than i ever knew into what i was trying to do. i feel a lot of shame and remorse and...anger at myself. for how i may have acted in scenes past, if they didn't go as planned, or if i've acted unpredictably when my senses were notched up to an 11 when submitting. all i can do at this point is express my remorse, hope that the right ears will hear it, try to forgive myself and move forward with the treatment that i so sorely need under my belt. mental health and bdsm are

1605bc1d-457b-4fbf-838e-ea37a3cb674e,how i motivate myself to leave the house when i'm depressed and don't want to.,"like many of you, when i get depressed i tend to stay in my room, unshowered, and pass the days bingeing on netflix, hulu or amazon prime. i canceled netflix so i could afford movie pass. (i'm on a fixed income.) it's a subscription service that allows you to see one movie a day, every day, for $10 a month. (this is not an advertisement, just an idea. i don't work for movie pass.) i spoke to my therapist about it and she thought it was a great idea to swap out the subscriptions. to go see a movie, i have to get up, shower, put on makeup (maybe, sometimes i don't ""put my face on"")get dressed in clean clothes and get on the bus and go to the theater. it's been a great way to get myself going a few times a week. i love movies and enjoy going to quiet, morning matinees when the theater isn't as full (i get panic attacks in crowded places), sometimes there's only 3 or 4 people in the theater with me so it's like my own private showing. so maybe if you're like me and love movies, a subscription service may be the thing to help you leave the house. amc theaters also has a subscription service for $20 a month if you can afford that. (this is in the us). sinema has plans starting at $4.99 a month. if you love movies and want to have a motivation to leave the house once in a while, this may be a good idea for you.",bipolar,2

24ccbb87-900b-4136-8869-47920a663183,work?,"hi all, i've been around here for awhile, been contributing to both communities here on reddit since my diagnosis with bp2 at 18. i'm now almost 20, hit my first major manic episode since the diagnosis. (i have gone through this before. it lasted the entirety of my 1st and 2nd grade year.) i'm due for rediagnosis to bp1 and most likely gad as well. we all have very abusive tendencies with drugs, i am no different. so, he's going to be very apprehensive to give me any type of anti anxiety medicine. i see my psychiatrist on the 18th. i've been irritable and quick to anger for over a month. on friday i got sent home early as a direct result of my misbehavior. saturday i had off. sunday night rolls around, i work all day, mostly fine, amicable, sociable, then i'm supposed to get off, but the dinner rush has kicked in. i take another 2 orders, (domino's) and come back to it being even busier. i'm visibly upset, shaking, complaining. ""then fucking quit"" my manager tells me. take another run, burst into tears the second i get into my car, spend 5 minutes composing myself, dry the tears from my eyes, dodge the customers gaze until the very end when i have to say thank you, i mean he gave me some money, i have to look him in the eyes and say thank you. as i walk away he hesitates to close the door, clearly seeing that i had recently been crying. run into the bathroom at work and sit there, pretending to go to the bathroom. try to compose myself, someone knocks, just needing to use the restroom. i clean my face and head out. i stay in the backroom and hide with my face in my hands, whole body shaking. another 10 minutes go by, i walk up to the front and look at my manager, apparently a run had been sitting for 10 minutes and i was supposed to take it. i couldn't see while i was in the backroom. 3 other people at work saw me in this state. i told my manager that i have bipolar disorder and that i'm trying. he said his best friend was bipolar, and he knows that i am trying. it just sucks because the more i try to reign in the beast the harder it fights back. today i hurried into the shower, spent half an hour in there. my roommates definitely think i fap in there when it takes that long. no, i'm getting the tears out. because they've expressed disdain for the crazy people. they don't know, and i only have to maintain the illusion with them til may. all of this compounds with the fact that i've always been told that the man is supposed to be strong, unbreakable, unwavering, stable. everything i'm not. all i need in this life is to be loved and to care for others, unfortunately for me and many of us, when we're at our best we anger easily, love hard, are full of ideas and excitement! love makes me manic. then just as things start to go well with anything, but especially love, depression strikes and i can barely look at my phone. all the friendships i had fizzle out and i'm left to try and rebuild. i lost my best friend because of this. it has been 18 months since i've had someone in my life i could talk to about my problems. plenty of people willing to take my advice, and they all say it's good and some of the most insightful, best advice they've received, but when i call for help, i'm alone. so i turn to you guys. because you understand. you understand what it's like to want to be loved more than anything, but to hold yourself from it because last time you tried the girl was emotionally a wreck for a year you took so much out of her. never abused her, you're just so much to handle that it left an incredibly strong girl with no will to even try until recently. i dated this girl when i was 16. you guys know what it's like to look at the statistics, 90% divorce rate among people with bipolar. my grandmother (also bipolar) has had 6 marriages. i grew up in church, where the one, partners for life in flesh and blood, was drilled into me until i left the church and the notion of god behind. that statistic is heart breaking to someone with this upbringing, but it is to all of us. this morning, as i sit here knowing that i have to go to work, fearing another breakdown, shaking with anxiety, i just want to scream, kick, throw a temper tantrum and let it all out. break shit. there's too much built inside. every emotion possible at the same time. but you have to control yourself, keep it all in check, it's just in your head. no, it's not. but why spend the time explaining to people unable to understand. people understand one aspect of the disease. they get depression usually. they understand anxiety. mania? hypomania? completely alien concepts. the inability to recognize the person that's actually you? they don't understand that. i'm not thinking of killing myself, but i'm beyond tired of living. excuse the ranting. there's a lot going on in my head right now, and trying to reign it in isn't helping. thanks for reading. thanks for being there for me, and i'm here for all of you if you need it. helping people helps me, at least i can make a small difference so that people will put up with some of my bullshit. edit: shit. all of this to ask how do you guys hold a job? because i'm having trouble doing that much at domino's. and if i can't do that, then i'm not ready for love and that's killing me. because i fear i'll never be. ""one day at a time"", ""focus on music and guitar, it's the only thing you're good at, at least you've got that. you've performed with juilliard's jazz band. been told that you're way ahead of where their top guitarist is when he was 20. you were 17. at least the one thing you're good at, you're damn good at it."" these are the things i tell myself to keep me going. but it's not enough anymore. and that's another concept that is completely alien to many. ""develop coping skills!"" i did. they work for that cycle. then none of them work, then some do, then i completely reinvent my strategy, works for a time, repeat the process. they can use the same coping skills for much closer to life than even the most stable of us. i feel like an outsider. and when this happens i listen to the outsider by guthrie govan. this song, and steven wilson's latest album are my only currently working coping skills. but those 60 minutes while those songs are playing is the only time in my days where i experience peace. how are you guys stable when your brain is a hurricane of emotion? or how do you all maintain the illusion at least? i just don't want people to worry about me because i know this will pass, but i can barely maintain control right now.",bipolar,2

d4b14c9f-cd97-4bed-b5af-795e8277c496,vent about horrible psychiatrist,"tl;dr psychiatrist is rude and cold and blew me off. should i send a strongly worded email? i moved and got new insurance a year ago and so of course that meant new docs. i got a great therapist but strongly disliked my psychiatrist. she comes off as cold and without empathy. my first visit i was talking about binge eating and that i had eaten a whole pizza the day before and she laughed. not only did her cell phone ring in our appointment the other day, but she answered it! she takes terrible notes and doesn't bother to refresh herself on them before or even during the appointment. she asked me why she put me on a certain med and i had to explain her own reason back to her. she seems to have forgotten a few times that i'm bipolar (vs. being depressed). it's been a year, and while at first i really wanted to get a different doc this is an hmo and i couldn't unless she basically okayed it. i don't know, i didn't want a confrontation or to make her feel bad or something. with some time she proved herself to be really good dealing with meds and very knowledgeable, so i figured i don't have to like her on a personal level, she does the meds and then i have a great therapist. then yesterday happened. we put me on depakote a few weeks ago, which i have had immense anxiety over. i had an appointment for next week and i am getting labs to check the depakote level and liver function. she gave me no refills because she wanted to check in on me and check my levels to make adjustments. all this is fine. something came up and she had to cancel. again, fine. i was at the office seeing my therapist so i went to make a new appointment with the shrink since i *assumed* that since she cancelled she would squeeze me in around the same time. no refills, follow up on labs, etc. also lets not forget my extreme anxiety around all of this. the poor front desk guy had to call her and even after giving her my patient number so she could look up my file, had to relay back and forth between the 2 of us the reasons i wanted an earlier appointment. no refills, labs, etc. what labs? i can just give you a refill if you request one next week? what labs did i order? no, i can't squeeze her in. seriously. she has my stupid electronic file in front of her and wouldn't even look at her own lab orders. she didn't ask to speak to me, or walk out of her office down the hall to save this poor guy from having to relay this all back and forth. i am in a really vulnerable state right now, which i told her, and refusing to squeeze a patient in after the appointment was cancelled on her end is ridiculous to me. that is common courtesy in my experience when you have a patient with time sensitive concerns. not to mention she had a number of on call slots (poor desk guy brought this up to her) and squeezing someone in to one of those in this type of situation is standard. he even seemed surprised she said no. after this i called and said i wanted to see someone else. she had to ok it and ""recommend"" someone but she did it by the end of the day. i can see then sooner than what my rescheduled appointment with her would have been. so i also have a desire to send her an email telling her that these types of things were inappropriate. i recognize that this would probably be more for my benefit than hers. the hmo also does encourage providing feedback, positive or negative, about their docs, so i could submit something that way. in sorry but i really feel like this woman is horrible in this profession.",bipolar,2

""i don't care if you fail, i care if you try."" too fucking bad dad, i care more if i fail than if i try, and i get that that doesn't get me anywhere; it feels pretty shitty to be reminded my ridiculous rejection sensitivity makes me a terrible person. fine, impedes my success. you didn't call me a terrible person. but that's what i'm getting at. the rejection sensitivity. what amounted to ""your not trying for the sake of avoiding getting hurt disappoints and irritates me"" turned into ""you're a terrible person."" or maybe i took it to mean ""you're broken."" i often think i am. how do you think it feels when i submit 10 job applications and my brain does the same thing about not hearing back? how do you think it feels to be constantly looking at jobs trying to balance what i'm qualified for, what won't be soul-crushingly mind-numbing, and what will actually move me forward in life? and then after beating myself up to get myself to start and continue that process, getting discouraged either not hearing back or hearing i didn't get the job. and then there's: what if i actually here back? interviews are stressful. stress *fucks me up*. and what if i can't handle the job? i always expect i won't be able to. or that it'll be discouraging and i'll go back to going home each day taking a shot of straight everclear the minute i get in the door. oh, right i didn't tell you about that month. *why do you think that is, anyway?* of course moving forward at the slowest possible rate doing minimum wage retail is still moving forward faster and more effectively than sitting at home being afraid to apply to job applications. i fucking get that, and it feels terrible. i go into the grocery store and tell myself, ""these employees are better than you, *at least they're trying*."" do you know how discouraging it is to go from hearing, ""sometimes i think you're brilliant"" to hearing ""but i wish you'd apply yourself,"" when i frequently remind myself my intelligence *means nothing* if i do nothing with it. and then on top of that, i get the added bonus of having to question if my intelligence has an expiration date. my iq already went down a standard deviation from before treatment, and both antipsychotics (which i'll have a fucking hard time arguing my way off of) and bipolar itself aren't exactly putting an upward pressure on that. so i get to remind myself my capacity for success could expire and i'm self sabotaging. oh, and *i get the fucking bonus uncertainty of not knowing whether it's my illness or my just generally sucking as a person.* you want me applying to go on federal disability with you. we have bills piling up and i feel a need to do what i can to lessen that shit. but i feel capable of performing work and am now telling myself ""you're gonna be the lazy drug using social security beneficiary nobody wants to get their money"" while i tell myself i don't deserve it because i feel like a liar. but you know what? it may hurt, **but i take it on for you**. because i acknowledge my debilitating fear of trying on the job front and would rather take on shame than let my failure to launch weigh you down. when i was growing up, i used to tell myself ""no one can hurt you more than your own family."" i think that's still true for me today. thanks dad. *do you know why i changed therapists after you got your cancer diagnosis?* **i wanted to make sure you'd be proud of me before you died.** i sure as hell don't feel like you are right now. tl;dr: my dad hurt me and pissed me off by telling me he doesn't feel like i try and expressing frustration at how much time i put into videogames (where i can at least feel successful at **something**) when i spent less time on videogames today than half of what i spend most days in general. seriously, videogaming and weight loss are the only two things i've succeeded at since graduation. maybe not dying, too, but i don't think that should count. good to know i'm a disappointment.",bipolar,2

0d8e3eaa-7dd3-4507-8010-4c8d23554cee,on feeling broken and undeserving of romantic love,"i was recently pming with someone about relationships, heartbreak, and feeling broken and picked up on a shared sentiment. that our mental illnesses made us less deserving of love from healthy people. which my rational mind tells me is total bullshit, but it's still a sentiment i have to put effort into rejecting. it's no secret i've been investing serious time into online dating, but i think it's progress on my part that most of the time i don't feel like my mental illness disqualifies me from relationships with healthy people. i still feel like i'll be better understood by people who experience depression and whatnot and like my issues will be less of a burden to someone with their own struggles for me to give back to, but as i was thinking about it last night i remembered everyone has their own struggles. that even ""normies"" feel broken sometimes and even normies get overwhelmed and that i could contribute back enough that i'm not weighing them down. i was in a relationship i think it's fair to describe as long term, and she was ""normal"" and seems to have started a pretty successful life, and when it ended i felt it showed my brokenness. but i think the most broken thing about me at the time was my own perception of being broken. that the relationship ended mostly for reasons that didn't reflect unhealthy psychological functioning on my part. right now i'm talking to two people from online dating and even though i seem to share more interests with the one i know has a mental illness and think i might be more able to be understood by, it's the one who comes off as normal and like a better influence who seems more promising right now. while it's not rare for me to feel broken and i am very much flawed, everyone else is flawed too and i'm no more broken than any ""normie."" *how many of you have struggled to feel like it's okay to have relationships with healthy people, and of those of you who have, what if anything has helped you chip away at that feeling?* as broken as i've felt and as flawed as i've been, i've never been broken and i've never stopped being worth loving. there have been things about me that have made it harder to love me, like my former bmi of nearly 40 as a barrier to that kind of attracted attention, but even then i was sometimes shown that kind of love. **however broken you may feel and however unlovable you may feel, you are most certainly mistaken. you are complete and just as flawed as everyone else and worthy of love, however hard it may be to find that love.**",bipolar,2
03bb474e-8cf4-4f07-91aa-e318fb2ee2e8,"therapist-recommended ""the bipolar workbook"" written as a tl;dr [homemade sparknotes]","#lessons learned from 10 years of therapy and 6 years of medication: (tweaked from a comment i made elsewhere on this sub) --------- * **understanding &amp; controlling mood swings**: be mindful of prodromal behavior and focus on using behaviors that lend themselves to the direction you want your symptoms to go. want to be active and stave off depression? drink lots of coffee. want to prevent hallucinations and scary kinds of mania? go to bed early and take melatonin to ensure sufficient sleep. * **learn about symptoms**: for me this meant: take an abnormal psych class, spend dozens and dozens of hours researching medication and treatment options, do enough research on treating bipolar to get published. generally wikipedia, nami, dbsa, and google scholar are your best friends for this. * **recognize moods**: keep a mood tracker and customize it to identify individualized warning signs. watching weeks worth of porn in a single day and barely getting sleep? you might be manic. unsure? come to bipolarreddit and ask for opinions; proceed with caution. [the altman self rating mania is a solid option, too. -------- * **distinguish symptoms from the real you:** realize that symptoms *are a part of the real you* but that you don't have to let them define you. remind yourself that you do what you can to stay in control and that you take responsibility for the mistakes you make that are partially attributable to your disorder. * **identify triggers**: go to therapy religiously and listen when your therapist notices a pattern; keep an eye on your mood tracker. * **improve coping**: trial and error, talk to people with the same problems and hear what works for them; post to bipolarreddit asking how people cope with the same problem. (it turns out you rely heavily on distraction to cope with breakups, which there's *absolutely nothing wrong with*; i'm just hoping to fast-track this and don't think distraction'll facilitate that) ----------- * **avoid things that make you feel worse**: 1. identify what makes you feel worse 2. convince yourself it's important to avoid those things or figure out how not to let them make you feel worse 3. execute your plan and stick to it; don't beat yourself up when you falter, keep trying * **don't let your emotions control your thoughts**: stay aware of what biases your emotions are prone to distorting your thoughts towards in a given moment and screen your thoughts for their possible presence. don't be afraid to talk to your therapist for help on this or to come to other bipolar folks to screen for cognitive distortions and irrational beliefs. or in my case: have multiple psychotic episodes in which every time you have a thought about someone it gets analyzed by a hallucination so you become ***painfully*** aware of how your acting on your thoughts could make others feel. * **stop avoidance &amp; procrastination**: wait, the book just told me to avoid things though. ~*dissonanceeeee*~ (mostly being playful here). 1. identify when things are piling up and avoidance becomes problematic / unsustainable. 2. come up with an incentive system to make it suck less. 3. ***use smart goals (small, measurable, actionable, realistic, timely)*** 4. try 5. try again 6. find comfort despite failing and keep trying * **regain control when you feel overwhelmed**: 1. identify what's overwhelming 2. see if you can break it into pieces that are more manageable. 3. ask for help 4. take a break to reset your distress tolerance so you can go back to being able to remember what feeling good feels like. if this means smoking some weed, take a nice long toke. 5. work a little bit at a time at getting it off your plate to feel less overwhelming. (i could be better about this one and need to do a better job chunking and reaching out to get papers i've lost &amp; stuff) * **change your negative outlook**: surround yourself with positive people, keep healthy outlets available, stay social, be proactive about changing your meds when depression pops up, read /r/upliftingnews, frequent /r/eyebleach, don't watch the nightly news. * **analyze your thoughts**: practice techniques you learned in therapy, identify distressing thoughts and challenge them by looking for flawed assumptions. meditate, see what thoughts keep popping up, and ponder why your mind goes back to them and what you can do to ensure these thoughts go in a healthy direction in the future. * **work through denial about needing medication**: do research that shows medications have efficacy and that self-medication can fuck things up (google scholarrrrrr). see what happens when you forget your meds. feel either conspicuously amazing or fantastically shitty? remind yourself your meds are doing something. think you're better off without meds? come here and read stories about what happens when people go off meds. read posts by users talking about their symptoms after going off medication, listen to their psychosis, and remind yourself that could be you. i accused my mother of drinking when she was pregnant with me and my girlfriend at the time of keeping me as a mentally deficient pet because i wasn't taking medication for psychosis. seriously, all you need to remember medication is important is to see how much better you feel after a good med change and to read posts from people who aren't taking their meds. * **improve medication consistency**: see the previous bullet point and then get a med tray. bonus points for setting an alarm or generally taking meds the same time every day. -------- * **effectively solve problems**: identify problems and utilize coping skills. ask for help as needed. put effort into maintaining healthy relationships so help is available. * **strengthen stress management skills and healthy habits**: identify poor stress management skills (such as drinking feelings away), identify why those skills get chosen, and come up with substitutes with better outcomes. alcohol makes me depressed? smoke weed when it's available instead. have too many stressors on your plate? find ones you can let go of or de-emphasize. binge eating negative feelings? count calories and come up with foods that give the most good feeling per calorie. decide which health risks are worth taking and which aren't; balance risks with protective factors (e.g. alcohol &amp; exercise). * **make better decisions**: identify poor decisions and factors that led to them. dbt chain analysis is a good option for this. avoid situations that compromise your decision making capacity. get enough sleep, stay in therapy, keep people around you can ask for advice from. * **maintain your gains**: ~~set your calorie counter to weight neutral goals /s~~ go back over your skills periodically, be compassionate with yourself when you fuck up, keep trying, be proactive and honest in managing your medication, stay active in a support group so you get practice going over coping skills for when you need them and so you have help readily available when you need it before you fall too far. hopefully this is helpful to *someone* and not just douchebaggery on my part =/",bipolar,2

f7c2bb03-c271-4f1c-b2b2-ad13803504da,"hypomania, hope and delusion","since being 'in recovery' i've been thinking about this a lot. hypomania for me was predominantly a good thing - it made me smarter, driven, sociable and funnier. more importantly it allowed me to accomplish a lot of things in short spaces of time that would have been unlikely otherwise. that's not to say that i didn't often embarrass myself (although i rarely cared) or jump from one obsession to another. i was always able to convince people that what i was doing was rational and achievable. other people usually got swept up in it too. when i changed psychiatrists two and a half years ago he asked me to describe hypomania to confirm my diagnosis. i described the more vivid colours, strong sense of fate, louder sounds, enhanced scents, little need for eating or sleep, bright coloured sparks and sometimes faint music. i gave a recent example of walking through the centre of a town on a sunny day and hearing music that wasn't playing and feeling like everything was perfectly connected. he said he'd only ever heard people describe it that way when they were about to stop taking their meds. so now i'm stable to the point where he thinks i won't have significant episodes again and could in theory stop taking the very last of the lithium. he advised me not to take on too much at present, giving the example of 'don't try to be leader of x party.' i definitely am better to the point where even people i worked with and dated last year have said that i seem massively more stable and should keep up the lifestyle changes. a few days ago i was in a pub with a friend i've known for a decade. neither of us drink now and i was also avoiding caffeine. he joked about how i used to, and still do to an extent, do silly things on a whim. ""you know sugar free red bull? i think i'm going to live entirely off that for a few weeks just to see what happens."" that's not actually that far off former reality. i've definitely also exasperated former coworkers. one had lived with a bipolar flatmate so chose her words delicately. ""i couldn't take any more of the same topic when you were... in a heightened state of emotion."" so at the moment i've been researching tefl in asia, which other people have not deemed irrational. feeling the need to get 100% on every assessment perhaps is, though as my chinese friend pointed out 'well, over there most people feel the same obligation.' yesterday and the day before i got a bit bored of stability and had a normal amount of caffeine two days in a row. two black teas and a diet coke. then i was back to enhanced motivation. seeing a few coloured sparks and staying awake until 4am. i know that every up leads to a crash, so i won't continue with it. i suppose i always imagined that stability would be one long mild to moderate hypomania without the depressive or mixed episodes. i didn't inherit the extended family's alcoholic gene though i'm almost addicted to being up. anyway, since i sometimes don't realise when i'm being irrational i read a few interesting articles about hope versus delusion. mainly in terms of tefl and other ambitions. this is the most relevant: ""delusions are beliefs about the current state of the world. hopes are future-oriented."" and pro-hypomania: ""the findings are published in the british journal of psychiatry. they suggest that mania may improve intellectual and academic performance, accounting for the link with ""genius"". people with mild mania are often witty and inventive, appearing to have ""enhanced access to vocabulary, memory and other cognitive resources"". they tend to have exaggerated emotional responses which may ""facilitate their talent in art, literature or music"". in a manic state individuals have ""extraordinary levels of stamina and a tireless capacity for sustained concentration""."" lately i've had several ambitions that come and go like a bad radio signal. as in i want to start a blog or write a book, then i switch to another fixation.",bipolar,2

ef4b8898-e908-47a5-87ba-7e5edc012adf,rollercoaster year,"tl;dr; this year has been rough and i want to tell someone about it. bipolar, adventures, shitty relationships, growth. i need to tell someone about my year and i don't feel comfortable telling anyone i know the whole story. this is what happened in 2015. i went to cannes film festival where a film i worked on was showing. i drank wine on the roof tops of paris with one of my favorite friends and saw the louvre. i fell in love with my best friend at a music festival and literally had the best 10 days of my life, and some of the best sex too. i experience my worst bought of depression to date and contemplated suicide. this led me to seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist and getting diagnosed as bipolar. i'm on meds now and things have balanced out a little. i lost a lot of weight from being so down. i've made more art this year than ever before and i'm starting to sell it. i started renting a studio in an artist collective. i flew home to surprise my parents with a visit which meant a lot to them. i dated a lot of shitty guys. one hit me when he was drunk, one stuck his hand up me while i was sleeping and one was nuts. i found the guy i want to spend my life with and while he agrees that we'll end up together someday, he's not ready to sort out his feelings for me. i understand, but i'm incredibly sad. i learned to walk away and give him space both because he needs it and because i don't like how i'm being treated. i sold a large painting of mine. i became an adjunct professor. the other part of my job has been extremely stressful. i worked 70-80 hours a week for half the year and i'm salaried. my job went from being my passion to just how i support myself. after i talked with my boss about how we need to set more reasonable goals to not burn out the staff he told me that ""it wasn't about me."" that convinced me not to renew my contract at the end of the year. i started saying no. i started saving money. i started taking care of myself. i stopped smiling as much. i'm more direct at work which is earning me respect and dislike. i shaved the sides of my head. i got a visible tattoo. i stood up to my family about taking advantage of my mother's good nature. i got an iud because i got tired of pregnancy scares. i started using coconut oil and baking soda to clean my face and it's great. i upped my cold weather clothes game after coming to terms that i don't live in miami anymore. i kept in better touch with some friends and i didn't with others. i spent a lot of time in bed. i bought some new furniture and shelves to prove to myself that i'm an adult. i bought some spice racks too. i felt really jealous when my ex got a new girlfriend. i came to realize that i'll always love him because he's a great person but we would have never worked out because we have different priorities in life. i registered to vote because there is finally a candidate i believe in. i donated to his campaign. i downloaded tinder. soon after that i deleted tinder. i gave up on dating. i recognized that i'm super emotionally distant and that's not fair to the nice dudes i date. i decided to move to a different city next year to freelance and make movies again. that really scares me but i'm doing it. i miss having a partner. i don't have anyone to rely on when i'm down. the dude i love needs space, the guys i've dated have made it super clear that i'm not their girlfriend and the close friends i do have are such a mess most of the time that i don't want to talk about my issues. i'm surrounded by lots of beautiful people, artists and musicians and students but my walls are built up so high that it's hard to relate to anyone. i bought a bike and i ride it a lot. my dog died. i got my first root canal. i walked around in the first snow and i liked it. this year has been the hardest year but i've also grown the most. i'm terrified next year will bring more of the same but i'm doing everything in my power to avoid that. i hope next year i can trust a little more, smile a little more, get back to being open. happy new year guys, and good luck.",bipolar,2
bd34be92-2c34-4f34-a30c-3cba96441042,this is a half life psa for when you're explaining drugs to people,"just because a drug has a half life of 3 hrs or 7 hrs or whatever, does not mean its out of your system/stops having an effect/etc... it means that after that many hours there is half as much left. so your dosing regimen (amount and frequency) will account for the half life, and it is very likely you will still be within therapeutic range after that halflife cuz that's usually the point, though not always the case. so if you're explaining drugs to people, remember this because otherwise you can easily make things sound like they're not. like one drug is better than another, or that you can do certain things differently... each drug-person combo is different when it comes to dosing, frequency, and the drug itself. listen to your pdoc!! i've seen this in multiple articles and forums... **this psa was brought to you by an annoyed, hypomanic med student.",bipolar,2

0e817712-c8ac-4c85-a55d-392f43f12d89,to all of my fellow redditors who have ptsd. documenting my 30 days at a partial hospitalization program for ptsd. support needed. (california),"this is not medical advice of any kind. this is to help the community, those who experience ptsd, and any mental health advocate out there. please up vote this to get it to the bigger crowds. hey reddit and community. i am starting a partial hospitalization program today (full day iop) and i'm going to attempt to document it and how i hope it helps stabilize me from very severe intrusive thoughts/nightmares, hyperarousal, depression, and everything going on in my life. those who experience ptsd, cptsd, and acoas (adult children of alcoholics) might be able to relate. i've been a mess and have said very hurtful things to my family who is trying their best to help me. i'm a 30 year old male who has been on and off in therapy for the last 8 years of my life. i'm currently taking valium daily and stopped taking my ssri because i could not handle being the zombie it made me. i grew up in a very dysfunctional family, alcoholism, neglect, domestic violence. compound that to a reckless 20s fuelled with alcohol, benzos, and a masters degree later, here i am. the complexity of my trauma has reached its limit and i must do this for myself. i did 2 weeks at a hospital a few weeks back but did not gain much. realize i have to make the most of it. my girl and i split a month ago and i still have yet to heal in the capacity that i should be so i've taken the initiative to start this program. the split is not the only reason i am going in, this is long overdue. this cascaded all of my problems and i just broke. we were planning marriage and i believe she had some kind of nervous breakdown and left me heartbroken (and with herpes which she didn't tell me about until 2 years in). my goal is to develop a treatment plan and document it here in hope that it will help those looking to recover from ptsd. day 1: i am sitting in my car about 2 hours early because i couldn't sleep last night. i was experiencing intrusive thoughts i could not fight off with cbt. the morning ride here was pretty serene. listening to some spacey tunes and trying to mellow out and prepare myself. yesterday i went to a medical cannabis doctor and i will be starting high dose cbd mmj as needed. i am not a cannabis user whatsoever, but the benzos and ssris just are not working for me. i don't condone psychiatric medication but it is just not for me. i will not be starting the cannabis until i am out of the program. day 1: goals for the day: participate in group. don't hide behind the mask of a person i sometimes wear in public. admit the complexities and realities of the trauma i've experienced in life. meet with doctor to taper off of valium. listen to one chapter of internal family systems book. after my 1st day: man, so many things came up in the assessment. things i had totally forgotten about. i feel like i was as transparent as i possibly could have been during the assessment. i interacted in group and couldn't stop shaking due to the all the stimuli. another member of the group crunched a water bottle and i was so hyperaroused that it pierced my ears. i cannot believe how sensitive i really am when i'm triggered. it's better to know now just how much i need to work. i was and am so pent up. i will be meeting with a case manager to develop my treatment plan tomorrow, so i'm excited for that. the meds they had me on made me gain a whopping 30 lbs in the past month. i'm not taking it anymore. i actually laughed today on the phone with my friend talking on the way home. very exhausted. day two begins on monday but will be sure to update. thank you for reading and the support. dreams: night 1. i woke from a dream within a dream. a woman i was so fond of years ago was in it texting me. i was so glad to be in touch with her. she was was a friend of mine and also, i was so fond of her and there was potential for more, but i was so consumed with myself that i ripped it apart. i drank heavily, left her stranded downtown, and was letting my insecurities impact what we had. god, how much i miss her and did not realize just how much i loved her. i'm sure she saw the good in me, but back then i couldn't. i'm still working on finding the good. i miss her so much and as odd as it sounds, despite crying right now i feel a cathartic release. she got married briefly after we stopped talking and that man is a lucky man. i never realized just how much i miss her. i'd forgotten about her until this dream. dreams have a funny way of helping us work out things. will update at the end of the day. any support appreciated.",ptsd,4

0e31aa8b-480a-4fc3-a316-5ae5f5845eb7,a psychotherapist did a reddit thread on orgasm and rape,"i found this thread online today. i thought it was interesting. it's crazy to read that ~50% of people who were raped had an orgasm or had their body respond (i'm guessing that those whose bodies responded in even smaller/minute ways is approaching 95%). (i'm guessing that child sexual abuse has similar numbers). i think that this is an issue that if we can have a frank discussion about it can allow many people to find healing and freedom from shame. it would be fantastic if societally we can address the fact that i believe most rapists are actually specifically setting out trying to make their victims orgasm or feel some pleasure (against their will) in order to humiliate, confuse and traumatize them. not all rapists are taunting their victims with the words, ""you enjoyed it"" but i think the vast majority of the rapists are trying to communicate this idea to their victims with the action of rape. (sometimes i wonder what it would be like to be the first human that discovered rape, ""hey i can torture this person very effectively by causing them to feel intense pleasure against their will. they will feel so ashamed for their pleasure and blame themselves and hate themselves."") i think this is the whole reason (and motivation for) why rapists rape. this is the main/greatest trauma of rape, to cause ""pleasure"" that humiliates and confuses the victim. if ""pleasure"" wasn't ""possible"" even in a rape scenario, rape would cease to be so humiliating and confusing for victims. victims would be able to easily blame the perpetrator and quit blaming themselves. regardless of whether the rapist ever verbally says to someone ""you enjoyed it"" with the act of rape itself and the ""pleasure"" people can be confused into thinking that they consented or partially consented to the abuse. victims think, ""how could i be being raped, when i was/am enjoying it and want(ed) it to continue ?"" i think it would be interesting to see this topic of orgasm and rape addressed from the perspective of rapists. what do rapists want ? what do rapists aim for victims to feel ? how do rapists feel about victims having orgasms ? do rapists like that ? is it fulfilling to them ? how does it benefit them or fit with their purposes ? why do rapists choose to rape (i.e. cause sexual pleasure) rather than do another type of assault that would be totally painful (and have no potential for pleasure) such as beat someone else up ? why is rape in particular so attractive to rapists as a form of torture ? what gives rape its power ? i mean after all a lot of rape is not physically violent. what makes rape sexually violent ? i also believe that this should lead to a larger societal discussion that we should question sexual pleasure in many contexts and see that it can be extremely traumatic, and a powerful means of breaking people down, a means of torture violence and controlling them. if there is a hint of sexual pleasure people can easily be convinced to believe they consented to a sexual encounter where they did not or where there was some kind of power imbalance. (your orgasm is your whole problem right there so to speak).",ptsd,4
c569e817-5c87-4725-b400-9a7591263196,i had a ptsd freak out at work and i feel really ashamed,"hi. i'm not very open about this stuff, so forgive my awkwardness. i was diagnosed at age 16. i don't remember what happened to me in my childhood. i remember bits and pieces here and there of random things, but most of my childhood is extremely disassociated up until age 14. i have problems validating myself of the abuse that i suffered through because... well... i can't remember it. there's other shitty shit that happened from 14+ on wards, but i don't feel it pertains to this. i work with kids who have autism as my job. i really like it, honestly. i accompany them at schools and help work with them throughout the day, managing behaviors, emotional regulation, etc. i was working with a kid in 2nd grade. he was having a pretty not great day, and i was getting a little frustrated but nothing too major. it all fell apart when he tried to cut my hair. i moved away in time, no biggie, it happens, but then he held the blades up an inch from my eyes, pretended to stab and snip, and then pretend to throw them at me. i nearly lost it when he wound his arm back. i started freaking out inside, i felt my adrenaline rush, and all of the sudden the only thing my brain screamed at me was ""we're going to fucking *die. he's going to* ***kill us*****.""** barely holding it together, he ran off from me and hid in his break room. he barricaded the door and kept himself in there. the teacher noticed what was happening and came over to support me. i managed to take a break of mine for a few minutes and i completely broke down. one half of my brain was scolding me, saying things like ""he wasn't actually going to hurt you, you know his behaviors, you know how this works. this isn't logical."" while the other side of me was completely whirling in pain, confusion, and complete and utter terror. going through that cycle of emotions was fucking agony, and what only made it hurt worse was in the midst of it my only thought was my brain going, ""i remember feeling like this before."" it didn't get better. come nightfall i completely broke down, freaking out and having a depression episode, self-harm tendencies were nagging, ed thoughts were high, and i was just a complete wreck of a human being. didn't eat, hardly slept, i picked fights with my boyfriend, i was incredibly insecure, etc. i couldn't even go to work the next day because my absolute *terror* of this kid throwing pencils and scissors at me was too strong. i had to be reassigned to a new child. i feel so humiliated, frustrated, confused, and just so angry. it feels so hard to move past from, and i feel like i can't even tell my work what's going on due to an instilled fear from my mom that if i told anyone about anything regarding my mental health, i would be fired instantly. i need this job so that i can receive mental health assistance to lead a functional life, but it feels so impossible to navigate through life - especially when you're suffering from this disorder, but you can't even remember the fucking things that caused it in the first place. i only get more information when triggers come up, and i'm forced to relive the horrible emotions all over again.",ptsd,4

47975abd-f2c0-4afd-966c-15344dfba18c,my story: is it ever possible to get over ptsd and have life again?,"hi everyone, here's a little background information on my story: growing up as a teen (15), i moved out early and started living with my boyfriend. when we first started dating, he was kind to me, but after a year of dating he became physically and verbally abusive to me, and he also became addicted to crack. i was scared all time time of him physically abusing me/ felt like i wasn't able to leave that relationship. eventually i did, but i got into another relationship that ended up being physically abusive. in addition to this, my boyfriends brother was raping me. i was finally able to get out of that relationship, but i believe that both of these situations primed me for what happened after that- i was seeing a therapist for awhile who referred to what happened to me as ""sex trafficking"". i was 19 years old. since then, i was able to escape (read: flee) from that situation. i was extremely lucky and even received some help from my family. i've been able to get myself through college and am even planning to apply for a graduate program in the medical/psych field. because of what i've been through, i have pretty severe ptsd. it's been over 5 years since all of this happened to me, but i don't think that my symptoms have really gotten any better. when i was in class and when i am at work, i always have managed to get everything done, but am extremely anxious and begin to feel triggered/spaced out. many times i start to feel panicked because i get a flashback and feel like i'm trapped, even when i'm in a totally safe situation. i have a boyfriend who is really supportive of me, but besides that i don't have many friends. i push people away and isolate myself because i don't think that it would be easy for people to understand me (what i've been through). i also worry that when someone gets too close to me, that they can tell that i have ptsd or think that i'm ""crazy"" or in pain/anxious. i feel very alone, but at the same time i have a very difficult time trusting people now. sometimes it's very hard to relax in a totally neutral situation, because i feel so hyper vigilant, my heart racing, and on guard. i'm also extremely private and don't like talking about what i've been through. has anyone been through something like this? how have you coped with chronic ptsd? *edit* if someone told you that this happened to them, what would you think of them? do you share details of what happened to you with people you care about?",ptsd,4

9869be89-6617-4a08-b814-b75066b446c1,please help me find ways to cope while i'm saving up to go back to therapy,"hi everyone, i'd like to ask for help. i'm a 19 year old female. growing up, my parents were emotionally/verbally abusive. my brother was physically violent to me. he would still have several angry outbursts today. my two aunts who stayed with us were also such angry people. i'm the youngest in the family. most of the times, i never fight back since i never wanted to be as angry/violent as them. during the times that i opened up about how they treated me, they immediately dismissed it and called me selfish. entering college, i only get to see my family once a week. i developed certain habits from the trauma i got from my household. because of how they treated me, i often get anxious for standing up for myself. my first kiss wasn't consensual. my close college friend kissed and groped me when i was drunk. months passed, another close friend kissed me forcefully, but this time, no one was drunk. then came the time i had a boyfriend. things were going great at first, and he even helped me cope with the trauma i got from the two guys. then, he began forcing me to show him my chest and lower private part. there were several times i said no, but i gave in eventually. i didn't see it as a red flag before until he forced me to suck him off. it was a terrible experience. i puked and cried right after. i didn't notice that he was manipulating me that time when he started going like ""oh no, i'm such a douchebag for doing that! i'm sorry i'm a huge douchebag!"". i ended up comforting him that entire night instead of the other way around. it was our first relationship. we didn't break up that time. he was also controlling, and didn't give me privacy whenever he forced to see my messages. i was wrong to give the relationship another chance because after months passed, he sexually abused me several times. he would apologize, then do so again. i will not go into details with the other sexual things he did since this is all i could talk about without breaking down. we broke up in 2018. i'm currently not seeing a therapist atm, but will do so again next month once i save up some money. i'm in my third year of university and i do freelance graphic illustration part-time so i don't really get as much. can anyone recommend other ways for me to cope while i'm not in therapy? i've been getting nightmares and intrusive thoughts again. i'm mostly scared these days. all this trauma i got from different events makes me feel so weak. one of my harassers also contacted me. idk what to do. i'm scared of not getting better.",ptsd,4
b6a53e89-7065-4bea-bcda-bfa509408ba2,went through shit as a toddler and foster child. want to get it off my chest. trigger,"i was born the 3rd of 7 siblings to two schizophrenic drug addicts. my older 2 brothers grew up in the luxury of 2 parents that took meds, had jobs and could take care of themselves. however when i came i fucked it all up. i was born with pyloric stenosis (a sphincter is fucked up so the baby can't digest shit, i basically could eat) so from the get go i was a problem for my parents. as shit got worse and they had to help 2 almost teens and 1 infant they stopped being able to care for themselves. they lost jobs, stopped meds and started drinking. my dad became abusive towards us all and was frequently sobering up in jail overnight. shit was hell for a kid to grow up in. eventually my mom got pregnant 4 more times from 1 to 7. (possible rape) and shit went haywire. my eldest brother (now 14,15 or so) became very abusive. he got verbally, physically and eventually sexually. he taught 5 year old me to masturbate, made me do it until i vomited. he'd hit me if i ran away. he eventually taught me about girls/my sisters. i'm not sure how it started (probably blocked it out of my mind due to ptsd) but i began to have sex with my sisters conscentual and not. i was 5/6 years old. i hated myself. my brother would sometimes watch, then call me a peice of shit and say i was going to hell. at 7 i started playing with fire, one day i was playing with it in a back room with a shit ton of boxes but the fire fell. the fire spread and spread until i had to run outside. i was scared of what my family would do if they found out (i didnt really think about the possibility that they could die, just that the box's with clothes could get damaged) luckily they found out before it got too bad, and no one was hurt. this was basically the breaking point for the foster system to step in. they gave my parents an ultimatum and split me and my siblings apart. (not the abusive older brother, he was put in a group home because realistically a 16/17 year old isnt getting adopted.) my sisters stayed with each other and i stayed with 2 of my brothers. my 2nd oldest brother who endured similar abuse to me blaimed me for what happened. not just the fire but also being the 3rd one born, the one to ruin his childhood. i've always felt inherently guilty about it. we argued and bickered until i was forced to split up from them. i bounced between 5 foster homes (some shitty, some not) all by myself, until age 12 when i was finally adopted. the first 2 years were peaceful. this is what foster parents call the honeymoon, basically a perfect kid. i was subconsciously testing out if i could trust this place to see if i could attach to the person there. then my ptsd started getting worse, i began remembering shit that happened until i really couldnt sleep. i legit thought i was going to get arrested for what i did to my sisters. one night i was panicking, fucking screaming and crying. i had never told anyone what happened even though it goes through my head every day. my adoptive mother came in and i finally told her. my fear of her rejecting me didn't happen, instead she consoled me. while this was great, it was also hell. i was used to people rejecting me, so used to it i became perversely ""in love"" with it. i did all i could to try and make her get rid of me, show her that i only deserved pain (which i truly believed, and sometimes still do) i gave her hell, yelled tell her i hated her. i never hurt her physically but i hurt he emotionally and verbally. this is what reactive attachment disorder is like (one of my diagnosis) it basically makes it very difficult for someone to feel like they can accept love, so much so that they are willing to hurt to prove themselves right. its fucking horrible, i dont wish it on my worst enemy. luckily my mom is the goat and has stuck through it to the point where i'm at college now. however i still think about my trauma every day, and it affects me so much so that i'm really bad with relationships (friends and romantic). i feel like a horrible person, even though all the stuff i did i had no real control over or even knew was wrong. i still hate myself for what i put my mom through and i fucking hate that i still want a relationship with my bio family. i'm fucking friends on facebook with my eldest brother. it sucks that i was the one to be put on his own out of all my siblings and i was the one that had to go through so many families. i fucking hate it. anyways just wantex to get that shit off my chest",ptsd,4

00b9371d-f6a1-46c6-968c-79539fe34d83,the national post calls ptsd service dog a fashion accessory! shame on them.,"the national post on march 4, 2018 stated that “there is a fashion among veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder for having therapy dogs accompany them in public places. mind you, we are not supposed to call them “therapy dogs”. that is an insulting term, one that hints that these animals are not as serious, and might not be eligible for the same legal and social deference, as trained dogs for the blind, physically disabled, or cognitively compromised.” &amp;nbsp; they didn’t stop there, calling a ptsd service dog a fashion accessory wasn’t enough for them they went further to claim that there is no scientific evidence to back up these “therapeutic dogs”, they even ridiculed a hero amongst canadian veterans, medric cousineau, who has tirelessly championed service dogs for vets with ptsd and found brian’s, sasha. &amp;nbsp; as most of you know brian’s dog sasha is the reason he was able to function in the world again after returning home from his last tour to the sandbox (afghanistan). at the time he was on a shocking regimen of drugs: psychotropics, sleeping pills, ssri’s, pain meds… you name it he rattled with it. he couldn’t function. he was isolated and in pain both physical and mental. it was medric cousineau who found his cure, a dog called sasha. with her by his side he was able to re-enter the world and somewhat bit by bit function again. &amp;nbsp; the first time brian took sasha out though was excruciating. here was a visible symbol of his invisible injury. it says, “there is something wrong with me”. i have been horrified by the obnoxious comments that often come his way, the ignorance around ptsd service dogs that remains out there. the first time he was turned away from a restaurant, hurt and humiliated him. he is in the middle of a human rights fight with a taxi firm in ottawa who refused to take him because he had sasha with him when he was on the way to the government’s mental health committee for veterans. &amp;nbsp; you can perhaps imagine my deep and seething rage upon reading this appalling post from what i had thought was a reputable media outlet, the national post. so, i did as general hines did, and many others, we approached the editor and ask that they apologize and post a rebuttal. they steadfastly refused stating that they fully endorse the article, the comments made in it and the writer, colby cosh. &amp;nbsp; in my emails back and forth with the editor i pointed out the danger of increasing the stigma around service dogs, how unhelpful it was and how damaging. i also asked what on earth the point was to vilify one veteran when ptsd is not and never has been a veteran only issue. to no avail, i might as well have asked a stone to have empathy for the plight of those surviving ptsd. &amp;nbsp; the rebuttal i posted on their comments is extremely angry and rude, yes i do tell the writer of this awful post that he has a small penis. brian did not approve of that at all, but i remain very angry. &amp;nbsp; this is the full article: [colby cosh: don’t call them therapy dogs: a case study in the liberal tax-engineering &amp;nbsp; is there science? yes, oodles of it and as medric pointed out ptsd service dogs and their owners are held to standards that others are not. &amp;nbsp; here is my hope: if you care about this issue please share your thoughts with @nationalpost and @annemarieowens. i see no point in focusing any attention on the individual who wrote this garbage, he clearly has zero respect for any of us fighting mh stigma. but should you wish to @colbycosh but i warn you there’s very little point, he deleted all tweets except this one from a @markgilroyab who says “you may take some heat for going after the shibboleths of victimhood culture. especially when it’s a puppy.” in other words, colby cosh sees veterans as a specific class who live in a state of being a victim. that their ownership of a ptsd service dog is simply a statement of their need to remain victims, a victim fashion statement if you will. and no, that isn’t going to far, i’ve read through the tweets he didn’t delete from his account and that is exactly his view. &amp;nbsp; **the science in brief behind ptsd service dogs** &amp;nbsp; whilst it is true that veterans provided anectodal evidence that service dogs did indeed help them with their ptsd in cases where no other intervention was working (ruiz, 2012; winkle, crowe &amp; hendrix 2012). considered an “alternative treatment” they cite that 40% of veterans could be helped who do not experience improvements after participating in treamtsments such as prolonged exposure (pe) and cognitive processing therapy (cpt) which are considered the gold standards for treating ptsd (monson &amp; friedman, 2006). at this point i will explain to you, as clearly this has frustrated your limited intelect, why veterans are used as the guinea pigs for ptsd treatments: they are an easily collected data point with comparible exposures. &amp;nbsp; on the research available on the impact of service dogs i refer you to the following: sachs-ericsson, hensen &amp; fitzgerald 2002 (! go figure and you couldn’t find anything on it); ruiz, 2012; winkle, crowe &amp; hendrix, 2012; monson &amp; friedman 2006; foremon &amp; crosson 2012; esnayra &amp; love 2005; hoge 201; henry &amp; crowley 2011; yount, olmert &amp; lee 2012; valsecchi, prato-previde, accorsi &amp; fallani 2010; knisely barker &amp; barker 2012; shubert 2012. that’s just for starters. &amp;nbsp; **biological impact of service dog on a ptsd survivor** &amp;nbsp; yount et al studied the decrease in cardiac reactivity and cortisol levels when a ptsd survivor interacted with his service dog. they measured the reductions in hyperarousal, social isolation, pain and sleep disturbances with the best tools science allows for studying pscyhiatric and neurological injuries. pleaes read it to glean more on this subject. &amp;nbsp; horowitz 2008 measured the increases in oxytocin and dopamine, reduction of cortisol in individuals interacting with their service dogs. &amp;nbsp; physiological stress reduction responses were measured and colated by yount, olmert &amp; lee in 2012. &amp;nbsp; the pathway to the brain that (is believed) to be affected by ptsd is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis; oxytocin has been shown to decrease cytokines, adrenaocorticotrophic hormone and coritsol which are the active ingredients in the hpa. service dogs have been proved to increase the natural production of oxytocin. &amp;nbsp; psychological (proven) impact of service dogs for survivors of ptsd. &amp;nbsp; valsecchi, paerto-previde, accorsi &amp; fallani 2010 amongst others cited above studied in depth the “secure base effect” of a service dog. also, the impact on “attachment”. now i understand that your grasp of the principles of human psychology are sketchy at best so i will do my darndest to simplify this for you. &amp;nbsp; “any relationship in which proximity to the other affects security is an attachment relationship” escolas &amp; friends in 2012 (fyi this is 2018 but hey i’m sure google was down the day you wrote this.) &amp;nbsp; attachment and a secure base are the two things a ptsd survivor does not have. fixing that is key in their recovery. it allows survivors to reconnect with family and the world at large. &amp;nbsp; social level: sachs-ericsson &amp; mates all the way back in 2002, go figure, found that individuals with service dogs were less isolated socially and felt more comfortable when initiating social interactions with others, also increased a survivors social desirability (note also that henry &amp; crowley 2011 found that a survivors sense of self-worth as well as murturance were enhanced exponentially by having a service dog). do i need to add the impact of these on a survivor of ptsd’s ability to recover? &amp;nbsp; **treatment effects of a service dog on a ptsd survivor** **86% of individuals in esnayra &amp; love 2005 study of those with agoraphobia and anxiety reported a reduction with a service dog. 86%. but that’s nothing right? still a fashion accessory.** **80% respodents diagnosed with ptsd, pani and depression reported a decrease in the mh symptoms they experienced.** **40% were able to reduce the medications they were prescribed.**",ptsd,4

b21140a2-69b8-4787-a931-ac4dfbdd026d,the story of my recovery from ptsd,"in 2002 my then boyfriend started abusing me. it began with verbal hostility and escalated to serious physical violence and sexual assault. i was embarrassed and afraid, and decided that i needed to handle this problem by myself and then not tell anyone about it. i succeeded in leaving the relationship in 2003, but not without suffering further trauma (he broke into my new place and killed my small pet). for two years i suffered from serious mental health problems: hypervigilance, anxiety, flashbacks, dissociative states, and nightmares. i went to therapy but withheld the important information about the abusive relationship, leading to several misdiagnosis including bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and schizoid personality disorder. i still thought that i had to pretend it never happened and that would eventually be the same thing as it never having had happened, and thought i could also get help for the serious problems i was experiencing at the same time. that kind of worked, because the anti anxiety medication i was eventually prescribed in 2005 did give me some relief, and i was able to function again. i felt like things were really turning around. i was able to go to school, hold down a job, and started dating again. i finished college and met the guy i would eventually marry. i stopped going to therapy except to get refills. in 2009 i was accepted to a competitive grad school program. the pressures of the program exposed the mental health problems i had been living with all along, and the fact that they were still interfering with my life. i decided to go to therapy again, but my then fiancé and i had very little money, so i decided to enroll in the program at the university where you could get free therapy from a third year student in the psych program. the student would be reviewing all the sessions with a licensed therapist. that turned out to be the best decision i ever made. the therapist was younger than anyone i ever talked to before, and i connected with them. after a couple of months, i disclosed what had happened in the abusive relationship, and was finally diagnosed with ptsd. at first just telling people the secret i had kept for so long seemed to greatly improve my symptoms. then i went a little too crazy telling people, and got some bad reactions (disbelief, excuse making for the abuser, etc). i pulled back on telling people. i learned some concrete techniques to manage the flashbacks and dissociative states i was frequently experiencing, and these improved quite a bit. i felt very hopeful. then in the spring of 2012, when it seemed like things had really improved, i suffered a flash back and extended dissociative state while attending a prep class for the qualifying exams for my profession. the whole episode lasted over an hour, although thankfully i managed to leave the class and walk home, all while barely connected to reality and believing a lot of things that were not true. i was extremely disheartened by this and frightened for my future. my therapist explained that reoccurrence of symptoms like this was to be expected and was not a sign that i was not getting better, but i still felt discouraged. the good thing about the episode was it convinced me i needed to keep going to therapy after graduation. my therapist helped me connect with a cognitive behavioral therapist in the city i was moving to accept a new job. cbt really changed my life. i had been living with a lot of phobias that had developed due to events in my past and flashbacks i had had, and i was able to eliminate nearly all of them with cbt. for example, i was afraid to open closed doors because this would frequently trigger flashbacks, and i was also afraid to go to the grocery store for no apparent reason (my theory is that the bright lights, lots of people, loud music, lots of activity all create a perfect storm for me wigging out). with the help of cbt i can now do an entire large shopping trip at a big grocery store alone, wheras before i would go to small stores and get a few things at a time. and i open doors without fear. also at this point i switched my medication to zoloft, which works so much better for me. i felt like things were really getting better. i was even having less frequent nightmares, which i had had so frequently for so many years i had barely considered it to be something that could change. then on new years eve 2013, i had a terrible panic attack and ended up pacing the house in a dissociative state again thinking a lot of things that weren’t true and not well grounded to reality. my therapist had taught me the trick of holding an icecube to ground yourself in such a situation, and that had always worked like magic for me. my poor husband kept shoving icecubes into my hands. i would clench them until they melted and continue to pace, panicked and agitated. thankfully after the third icecube i came around. i again felt extremely discouraged and started to despair that i would have to live with ptsd symptoms for the rest of my life, all over a stupid, terrible thing that happened to me now over a decade ago. in nearly 3 years since that incident i have had one brief flashback (when opening a door coming out of a stairwell). i continue to be hypervigilant and anxious, but i no longer have panic attacks, flash backs, dissociative states, or night mares. i cannot believe how much easier life is without all those things, and i will never take it for granted. so that is my journey, 14 years long. my hope is that it is encouraging to people still struggling with severe symptoms. i hope it is not discouraging to people who have struggled longer than i have and still not found relief. my heart goes out to you, and i hope you find treatment that works for you soon.",ptsd,4

a226a058-1190-4ba4-a9ea-192e1a42fc41,is this behavior normal?,"i find myself wasting so much of my life ruminating on things that always prove to be false, and in retrospect kind of ridiculous. but in the moment it's real. i feel like i spend almost every day arguing against reality, trying to avoid accepting it and i don't fucking understand why. it's exhausting. i know the truth. but each day i wake up and feel like i refuse to believe it. but at the same time i want to accept it so i can get better and move on with my life. for example: some days i convince myself that i am just some sort of psychopath who made up the ""memories"" of my rape because i just have a sick mind, some days i convince myself that i have a different disorder like schizophrenia or ocd that are making it look to people on the outside that i have ptsd, sometimes i convince myself that i just don't have a proper connection with reality and have hallucinated all of the bad stuff. sometimes i'm obsessed with self harm, because i would rather just be a cutter than a rape victim. sometimes i convince myself that i have a brain tumor, and none of it is real. sometimes i convince myself that i am actually an alcoholic, and the ptsd and rape story are just a mask that i'm trying to hide behind to avoid dealing with that. sometimes i find myself trying to make myself into an alcoholic consciously because i would rather have that problem than this be true. sometimes i even go as far as to convince myself that maybe the dream i had last night was real life, and what i'm living now is the dream. it's crazy, because i know that's not true, but it's like my mind is fighting so hard not to accept this! i don't know what my problem is. i don't know why it's so hard for me to accept the truth and connect with it. i just want to fucking live my life and stop feeling this way. it's such a waste. i know deep down that having another problem doesn't get rid of the ptsd and the fact that i was raped, but it's like i keep tricking myself and falling into these rabbit hole thought patterns. it's like my brain is so desperate for this not to be true. it doesn't make sense and it makes me feel crazy. please tell me i'm not the only one going through this insane behavior.",ptsd,4
3c1a236c-d634-4720-a3c7-0fd5e2861a29,my story is a little different...,"hi. i’ve wanted to tell my story on here for quite a while. i hope it’s not too lame of a reason to suffer from ptsd, but with the one-year anniversary coming up soon, i think it’s time. on october 4, 2017, i got off work around 7am, and i stopped in lake stevens, washington to find a quick geocache on the way home. this was something i did pretty often, and i had never had any negative consequences before. it’s a fun hobby, and i still really enjoy it as much as i can. it was about 42 degrees fahrenheit outside, and we had already had some cold days, so i never expected what was about to happen. i was looking for the cache in the woods between two residential streets. there was somewhat of a trail, but it faded out because the forest wasn’t very dense. the leaves were already well into the process of falling from the trees for the winter, so there was very little bushwhacking that needed to be done. my gps led me to an old rotting stump, a common place for a geocache to be hidden in the pacific northwest, so i searched in that area. suddenly, i felt my foot give a little, and then there was a stabbing pain on the outside of my right leg. at first, i couldn’t figure out what was happening, and then i felt the stabbing pain again, this time on my left leg. i figured that i had stepped into a thorn bush or an ant hill at first, and i moved away from the spot where i’d been standing. that was when i saw them. there were hundreds of yellow jackets coming at me, flying at my face and crawling into my hair. i started running toward some houses in the distance with my eyes closed and trying to shield my face. i could hear this loud, nonstop buzzing, and i could feel them stinging my ears. when i opened my eyes briefly, i saw that my left arm was covered in wasps. i screamed, hoping someone would hear me, and i kept running toward the houses. they kept following me and kept stinging relentlessly. i felt one go into my mouth while yelling for help, and i think i swallowed it. i felt a couple of them try to crawl into my nose, and i pulled them out. then, the burning began. there was this intense, systemic, hellish feeling of being set on fire, burning alive from the inside out. my legs gave out from under me, and i figured that i would die soon. i heard a lady from one of the houses yell to me that she’d called 911, and that they were on the way. i thought that maybe i should just wait for them. it wouldn’t be too long, and i wasn’t sure if i could walk. i still had a good tenth of a mile to the nearest house, but i was in so much fucking pain. i decided to keep going because something was telling me to. something gave me the feeling that if i stopped and waited, i’d be dead before anyone found me. it was a struggle to get my legs under me, so much so that i had to grab onto a tree to pull myself up. everything was feeling weak. i kept running, hoping that my legs would continue to support my weight. i was starting to feel dizzy and nauseous, and as fast as i was trying to run, those evil creatures were still in pursuit. i tripped over a tree root suddenly, and fell flat on my face. when i tried to keep moving, i realized my foot was stuck in the root, so i kicked my shoe off and kept going. at this point, when i tried to stand once more, i wasn’t able to, so i crawled the remaining distance. i found my way to the back patio of one of the houses and was able to stand again once i got onto the cement. i ran up to the house and banged on the screen door. there was a large dog inside who was barking at me, and i heard a man yell at me to go around front through the gate. i begged him to let me inside, but he refused, so i did as he said. in front of the house was a cul-de-sac with an empty police car parked in the middle. i looked around for the cop and spotted him a few doors down. at this point, a lot of the wasps were still on me, and quite a few had gotten inside my clothes. i ditched my sweatshirt in the middle of the street, hoping it would distract them as i ran to the cop and explained what was going on. at some point, the officer called for back-up and an ambulance. within moments, there were four police officers surrounding me with credit cards scraping the stingers out of my skin. apparently, yellow jackets sting repeatedly and don’t lose their stingers like bees do. i’m guessing that the stingers were getting stuck in my skin and then being pulled out of the insects by my clothing. i was wearing several layers, but they were stinging through all of them. my body still felt like it was on fire. my skin hurt. people touching my skin hurt. one of the cops undid the bun in my hair and was pulling wasps out of it. another one pulled a stinger out of my lip, and blood came out. i still felt the yellow jackets everywhere, so i stripped my shirt off and tried to lie down, hoping i would pass out from the pain soon. one of the cops gave me a coat to cover myself, but i then started to projectile vomit everywhere. finally, the ambulance showed up, and i was loaded onto a gurney in the back with three paramedics sitting next to me. i’d never ridden in or even been inside an ambulance before. they took my vitals, and again, everything hurt so fucking bad every time someone so much as lightly touched me. the inside of the ambulance was also very stuffy and claustrophobic. i asked if the paramedics would help me take my pants and bra off because it was really hot, and my skin was crawling. they obliged, and when i took my pants off, another wasp came out and was flying around the inside of the ambulance. i freaked out again immediately, and one of the emts smashed it. when i removed my bra, there was a dead wasp crushed between my tits, and i remember i just wanted a shower. i felt disgusting. it seemed like forever until we got to the hospital. i remember seeing us get on the ramp to the route 2 trestle toward everett, but it was rush hour, and people were moving so damned slowly. i begged for pain medicine and/or to be sedated, but the paramedics wouldn’t give me anything. it felt amazing when they got to the hospital and opened the back door of the ambulance. the fresh air felt awesome, and breathing was much easier. i vaguely remember being wheeled into an exam room and a bunch of medical personnel lifting me from the gurney to the hospital bed. the doctor was a younger woman and was really nice to me. the nurse, on the other hand, was a total bitch, but honestly, i couldn’t give a shit at this point. at least she got the iv in on the first try. they pumped me full of a bunch of meds. i asked to use the restroom since i figured i would probably be sedated at some point, and i didn’t want them to put a catheter in. the nurse helped me walk to the bathroom, and i was glad that my urine didn’t appear to have any blood in it. my kidneys weren’t failing, so that was good. my anxiety was through the roof while i was in the hospital, and i found out later that it had taken ativan, toradol, and dilauded to sedate me. my normally low blood pressure was around 180/100 at first but stayed around 140/90 even while i was sedated. during my time in washington, i didn’t have any family living near me, so i called my coworker to come pick me up from the hospital when i woke up. i asked if they could just send me home in a cab, but they refused, saying that someone needed to watch me for the next few hours. when my coworker got there, i started to get dressed, and then i remembered that there might still be wasps in my clothes. my colleague took everything outside the room to shake it out, and sure enough, half a dozen dead yellow jackets fell out of my clothes. i didn’t want to put them back on after that, but i didn’t have any other clothes to wear. the hospital discharged me eventually with an epi-pen and some prescriptions for pain medicine and steroids. i didn’t have an allergic reaction, and there was minimal swelling, but the doctor said she wasn’t sure what would happen if i ever got stung again. there is a distinct possibility that the large amount of toxin will trigger a severe allergic reaction next time. comforting, right? when i got home, i slept almost nonstop for the next few days. the pain eventually wore off, but my body was extremely weak for quite a while after. when i was awake enough, i counted my stings. on the part of my body that was visible, i counted just over 150 stings. this did not include the ones beneath my hair or any that were on the back of my neck. my arms and hands got the worst of it, but there were quite a few on my legs, face, feet, and torso. even now, a bunch of the stings have scarred over and left me with a bunch of ugly splotches on my arms. within a few weeks, i made an almost complete recovery physically. today, the only lasting effects of the ordeal are a decreased sense of smell and some floaters in my eyes. mentally, however, my recovery has been agonizingly slow. i have always been afraid of wasps/bees/hornets, but it has now become a full blown phobia. the nightmares suck, but i’m dealing with them. the worst thing is the flashbacks which happen multiple times a day completely at random. i can’t go outside anymore without watching my every move. i can’t relax. i have to be aware of everything around me. it kills me inside because i loved being outside hiking, swimming, kayaking, etc. i very rarely get to do any of those things anymore because of ptsd. every time i walk outside, i half expect to feel that stabbing pain coming at me out of nowhere, just like it did on that day. it felt really good to put this all into words and get it off my chest. if anyone has any advice on dealing with this whole thing, i would love to hear it. thank you so much for reading. tl/dr: i was geocaching in the woods and got stung over 150 times by yellow jackets leaving me with debilitating ptsd.",ptsd,4

f0dade1f-056f-49b9-abac-f43631881178,a guy who assaulted me five months ago kissed me last night,"i went to a bar with a friend last night. when i soldiered my way toward the front to order drinks, i only had my mind on ordering two bud lites as i chatted with my friend. then, i feel my arm being grabbed as i hear my name shouted. i turn and it's him. we'll call him andy. we had been in his apartment five months ago. he had started kissing me and taking my clothes off and i had froze. when things started getting heavy, i asked him to stop and was met with reassurances that we weren't having sex. when i started crying, his solution was to force me to give him head so hard my throat started bleeding. before i saw him at the bar last night, i didn't really contemplate the physical sensations i would have in seeing one of my attackers in person. i was nauseous to the point of forcing myself not to throw up. i was brain numb. i went through the motions as if we were friends. i introduced him to my friend (whom we'll call john) and he introduced me to his brother. he asked me for my number. i gave it to him. i was so brain dead that i couldn't even come up with a fake one. john and i went downstairs and i thought that was the end of it. i slammed my beer and went to the bar on our floor to order another. i was elbowed pretty hard in the back as they dragged a man out in a chokehold. i vaguely wondered what he'd done before turning to order another beer. there he was again. andy came up to me to talk about the guy who had just gotten kicked out. apparently he had been kicked out once before, earlier in the night. he'd witnessed the guy punch a few women in the face. i got my beer and returned to my friend. john and i left not too long later. i couldn't bring myself to explain to him who andy was to me. before we left, we had to close my tab, with that damned $10 minimum. with only one beer on this tab, john suggested kamikaze shots, which i agreed to. while waiting, andy came up to us again. i was fried at this point and got him and john talking about the guy that had gotten kicked out while i turned to wait on the bartender. eventually andy walked back to his friends. (or were they just girls he was trying to hit on?) making his way back, he said goodbye to me and managed to do that quick and discrete ass tap/grab that guys usually reserve for their sos. i downed my shot and john and i returned to the upstairs portion of the bar where we reconnected with john's friends. at this point, i was thinking john was hitting on me too. when he offered to walk me out, i turned him down. i didn't want to afford him the opportunity to ask me out/kiss me/etc. when i was not mentally capable of handling it. *stupidstupidstupidstupid* i left the bar and rounded the corner, barely holding myself together, when i heard my name again. i looked up and andy was walking toward me on the sidewalk. i said hi, hoping he'd let me pass. he somehow managed to take up the whole sidewalk so as to stop in front of me and place his hands on my hips. i don't even remember what he said to me. usual pleasantries, i assume. i was just trying to find my exit. when he bid me good night, he pulled me in by the back of my head and kissed me. on my end, it was the same non-receptive kiss i'd shared with him last time, a subtlety he didn't seem to understand. he let me go, bid me good night, and carried on. my night ended. i cried and dry heaved and cried some more. i don't understand how he doesn't realize the things he does are wrong. i don't understand why i can't be more assertive toward him (or other guys). i hate... everything. i drank until i passed out last night. i woke up with the same knot of pain and nausea. i *almost* didn't remember what happened last night. then it hit me like a sack of fucking bricks. normally i'd have gone back to sleep (lazy sunday mornings) but i couldn't today. all i can do is wonder whether or not i'll be handle my martial arts class this afternoon, wonder when andy will text me, wonder why this is my life now...",ptsd,4

(she doesn't have ptsd) my mom admitted to me that in their marriage he also raped her several times and since i grew up in a third world country there was no law against intramaritak rape at the time. living in such a shit country the whole criminal justice system is a joke, and my dad bribed judges, never went to prison and still had limited shared custody (supervised visits) and just a restraining order from my mom. (because he broke her arm and leg when she asked for a divorce) my traumatic experience was different from theirs, he touched me innappropiately a couple of times but with clothes on and nothig major. as a kid i was confused and thought it couldn't be bad. my traumatic experience was once when i was alone in the house with him. i was taking a shower and he knocked on the door and asked me to open it. i told him i couldn't because i was showering and he started screaming at me. he started kicking the door and making it feel like he was gonna break it. i threw myself in the floor and covered my head and cried for what felt like hours. idk how long i was there or how long he tried to knock that door down. to this day i am almost certain that if he had been able to open it i would have been raped that day. the uncertainty kills me and i have nightmares about what could have happened. i have flashbacks of being on that floor scared and powerless, with nowhere to run to. however, i feel extremely guilty because my mom and my sister went through something so much more horrible and they don't suffer from ptsd.",ptsd,4

d9c2d3cf-d12a-4751-8982-f0da43274fbe,"girlfriend is a social worker, recently told me i exhibit signs of ptsd","i grew up in the woods with an older brother who is a diagnosed psychopath. physical violence was a problem from the time i was 2 until i was 14. i don't mean normal brother stuff. it was sadistic. i don't remember a lot of it but my parents tell me he would beat me when i was still in my crib, so they had to keep us apart. he broke my ribs a few times jumping on me and cracked my skull twice. i always knew things were dangerous if i sensed he was bored and there was no one around. there was also sexual abuse from age 10 to 12. anyway, i live in a busy city now and i sleep just fine with car noises, sirens, peoples voices just outside, but if a doorknob turns i am instantly awake. he used to sneak in my room and choke me a lot in the night age 5-10 so i guess it's hardwired to sense danger when i hear a doorknob turn. the other day i came out of the bathroom and there was a large man standing in front of my front door, silhouetted since the top part is frosted glass. all i could think about in the moment was if that door is kicked in right now, can i get to my rifle in time? it was just an amazon delivery guy. i relayed this story to my gf, she knows all this stuff about me, but she asked if i had considered ptsd counselling. and i was like no, why? ... i sleep with my rifle almost always close by. it depends on the night. some nights i don't think about it and other nights i can't go to sleep without placing it at hand, doing a full safety check, checking the magazines, maybe even cycle a couple cartridges by hand to check the action and the extractor. edit: i've had no military/combat experience, just grew up in a gun friendly environment. until recently i thought i was just being practical, realistic, and cautious. it's the city, i was raised in the woods where there is no crime because there's no people, certainly home invasions were not a thing that ever happened there but they happen in cities, right? and in some way i think i'm right but maybe she has a point, especially about the doorknob thing. the only reason he ended up ultimately leaving me alone was we got in a fight and i managed to put myself in a position where i could have murdered him and convinced him quite rightly that with what was documented about him no jury would convict me. i will never forget how his face changed when he realized i was serious. and it wouldn't have worked unless i really was. soooo am i screwed up or....?",ptsd,4

1d836d58-6b8e-421b-9833-9c4eb74626d7,"possible trauma from hospitalization, and people think i need to get over it.","i was 21 at the time, now i'm 22. in may of 2017, i got really sick out of no where. in a matter of 3 days, i went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. i didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because i was just starting a new full time job, but i had a feeling that i was going to die. i can't really explain that very well, but i just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. at 4am i took an uber to the hospital and when i got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. at this point, my memory is very groggy but i remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ecg on me. they got an iv into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. i thought that was odd because i didn't feel nauseous at the time. the doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. i just cried and said my head hurt so bad, and he said ""what, you think you have a brain aneurysm?"" i said i didn't know what was wrong. after they took my blood, a few hours they sent me home because the brain ct came out relatively normal. i still felt extremely sick with a feeling of overall dread. i'm going to die. it wasn't anxiety, it was just something i subconsciously knew. they discharge me at 3am and got me an ambulance to take me home. they ruled it as a ""nasty fever"" and told me to rest for a few days. at 6am, i woke up to multiple voicemails from the er doctor telling me that my blood culture came back positive and that i immediately need to go back to the emergency room, or any hospital near by that i can get to. that was the closest one so i took an uber back. an ambulance would cost too much money and i was having issues with my health insurance at the time. positive blood cultures mean that there's bacteria in your blood. i was diagnosed with bacteremia and severe sepsis. i stayed at the hospital for 2 weeks while i received antibiotics and more image screening. being septic eventually gave me a condition called pancytopenia, which is a lack in all blood cells (red, white, and platelets) and the antibiotics i was on (clindamycin) wiped out all the good bugs i had in my stomach so i caught c.diff, which dehydrated me and i had to stay in the hospital longer. i returned to work less than 2 weeks later, 15lbs lost and generally very weak. they understood that i was very sick and didn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (i have a very physical job). now i'm healthier, but i still have a constant fear of getting sick again. i try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think i'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. i don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. i'm constantly scared. i don't have a fear of death, but knowing that i could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that i love behind makes me sad. it makes me sad that people don't understand what i went through. they are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). i really don't talk about it a lot, but when i do, i get eye rolls. it's like people think i enjoyed taking a month off work. i constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where i feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much i can do about that. ativan doesn't help. my body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. thank you for reading, i just had to get this off my chest.",ptsd,4

fuck i dont know i was thinking everything and nothing at once she shoved her hand down my throat, makes a fist in throat so long i vomited (with no where for it to go! fun). she clawed her way up and outta my esophagus then. she punched me in the bottom of my skull where it connects to the neck, behind my ears, dribbled my head off the headboard.. over and over and over. tried to break my face with her fists. i looked like alf after it was done. i blacked out so many times. she strangled me so badly on the outside of my neck as well it looked like i had handshaped hickies for weeks. she also at some point bit a tendon on my right arm so badly that it's permafucked god damn that's why that pic of the bitemark tatt on the trashy sub fucked my head so bad the other day lol i work on an assembly line and my right hand is permanently swollen because of the tendon issues. i don't know how it ended. apparently bf got away from the guy and punched his sister's tooth out to get her off me. i wasn't conscious. thw first thing i rember is coming too under the bed with blood just leaking down my throat and i couldn'tt really see out one my eyes. he's (my boyfriend) yelling at me to get the fuck out of his house, (sis and her accomplice were gone already)meanwhile i desperately try to show him all the blood im coughing up and gagging down. i like to joke that my pollack nose saved me.. ha. ha. ha. to my self. because i can't joke about this shit with people. i feel so stupid even typing this. i feel like an attention whore. i don't know who else to share it with. i want to cry and vomit and smoke a fuckin cig. i'm visiting family in michigan right now and i dont wany to wake my gramps going out to smoke. ive had really bad night terrors the whole time i've been visiting my family. i dont know what it is. i've been here all of four days.. i like to think ive done an ok job trying to get over it. i dont know. i'm not with him anymore. he told me (the assualt) was all my fault and because of my bitch attitude. he was the one person who i thought loved and cared about me and i felt (still feel) so fucking betrayed. his sister really really did try to kill me and nobody wants to act like its true and it fucks me up so bad. it makes me feel like a fraud. everyone supported her. i was too scared to press charges and its too late now. she knows too many scary people. i feel like im just so fucked and worthless at this point who cares lol. i'm not looking for pity, im sorry. im not sure what im looking for. there's so many more layers to this too fuck i can't even begin anyway the whole reason its bothering me so bad is i talked to him (my ex) tonight. i do miss him sometimes. he was so mean and abusive and an alcoholic and so much older than me. i feel like a fucking idiot. so much. i miss him. but i don't too. fuck. im a retard. he's a retard. he's a sad person. he makes me sad. there's a dude at my work i really like and clearly he's got some fucked ptsd issues and i wanted to try to open up to him about it but it makes me feel so nervous, fraudulent and phony as he is a combat vet and i just got beat up. i don't know. plus he's not been at work.. how would you even start that convo anyways?

(and i know- i'm taking sleep meds. it's less because i wouldn't sleep otherwise, and more because i have trouble falling asleep. but maybe in the future i'll be able to get off them. but for now being able to fall asleep around the same time feels important for getting healthier. anyway, wanted to share this feeling with all of you who know what it's like waking every night from nightmares and feeling sick and exhausted. it gets better.",ptsd,4

328646d9-8a32-4826-85df-9e91aff09a9b,if you are recovering from cptsd/childhood interpersonal trauma and substance abuse too,"hello forum, if you are recovering from both cptsd/childhood interpersonal trauma and also substance abuse problems, i highly encourage you to seek help outside of alcoholics anonymous or narcotics anonymous. these two 12-step programs greatly hindered or directly counter-acted my recovery from ptsd stemming from childhood abuse. here is my experience doing the aa/na 12 steps with a sponsor while i was in therapy to recover from childhood abuse trauma. i went to rehab a bit over a year ago, and there i was diagnosed with ptsd stemming from childhood trauma (abusive parents.) my recovery from addiction has necessitated recovery from trauma. professional help has been of vital importance, both individual therapy and group therapy. i did the na/aa programs for a bit, and i found that the 12-steps work greatly reinforced my trauma, and not only was this program ineffective for me, it was detrimental to my recovery from trauma. without successfully navigating my symptoms of trauma and the resultant issues, i would not be able to remain sober. here is how i found the 12-step program of na/aa to actively hinder and directly harm my recovery from trauma: we admitted that we were powerless over our addiction, that our lives had become unmanageable. a.i felt powerless during my child abuse. the overpowering feelings of powerlessness had permeated all other areas of my life. in order to recover from my trauma, i have needed to learn to empower myself, and begin to unravel where all of these feelings of powerlessness in my life stemmed from, and to reclaim my ability to manage my own life in the present. we came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. a.i understood that i was to find a rescuer, in the form of a higher power, to save me. as a child in an abusive home, i spent the first 18 years of my life desperately hoping someone would swoop in and rescue me, though no one did. this dependency on a rescuer remained with me throughout my adult life as well, as i waited and hoped and searched for another person to save me, but that was not possible and it lead to issues of co-dependency and insecure attachments with others. in order to recover from my trauma, i had to stop seeking out rescuers, and start rescuing myself. we made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of god as we understood him. a.i was never given the freedom to be myself and live my own life and be my own person while living with my abusers, as they took everything i did and said as a personal attack on them and, they reacted violently and angrily towards me for that, which led to so much fear in me in living my own life and expressing my own will due to the repercussions my abusers put on me when i did so throughout my young life. i have had to learn how to express my will and how to live my own life without the fears, or despite the fears, instilled in me from my abusers of potentially bad repercussions. this step reinforced the idea that if i expressed my own will and lived my own life as i saw fit, then i would not really recover, and i would need to live in continued fear of the repercussions of relapsing. we made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. a.my sponsor, among others at the meetings, told me to reflect on “the part that i played” in my “dysfunctional family.” i was told to list the ways that i contributed to my abuse; i was asked how i “provoked” my abusers and “instigated” the abuse with my poor behavior. i found this step very victim-blaming, because a large part of my trauma work centered around learning how to stop blaming myself for the abuse, as most adult survivors of child abuse tend to be wrapped up in self-blame and self-loathing over feelings that they caused their abuse. recovery from trauma has required that i learn to stop blaming myself. this step countered that significantly, and was psychologically damaging to me and my recovery. b.i’ve met women in the program who were also told this in terms of how they provoked their abuse, or elicited their assaults by being in the wrong place or being drunk when the assault was committed against them. we admitted to god, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. we were entirely ready to have god remove all these defects of character. a.my abusers taught me, from the time that i was very young, that i was defective. insult after insult at how “selfish, ungrateful, arrogant, and self-centered” i was were hurled in my direction from the time i was old enough to remember. my sponsor, as well as others in the program, told me to list my defects of character. my trauma recovery work, on the other hand, was focused on teaching me to stop believing that i was defective, and to start acknowledging that, contrary to what my abusers had taught me about my inherent defectiveness, i was a good person with maladaptive behaviors. in order to recover from trauma, i have had to acknowledge that i am not suffering from being defective, but rather, from feelings of defectiveness instilled in me by my abusers and their abuse. this step directly countered that work of recovery from my childhood trauma, where the focus was on moving away from shaming myself for my defects, and more on how to correct my maladaptive behaviors. b.though people in recovery often focus on how shame results from addiction, shame is often the cause, the prompter, and the perpetuator behind addictive behaviors. getting at the root cause of that shame has been the focus of my professional help, and the root cause of that shame is not the addiction, but rather, a root cause of my addiction was the shame that resulted from my upbringing. we humbly asked him to remove our shortcomings. we made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all. we made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. a.while the step clearly says “except when to do so would injure them or others” i myself apparently did not constitute “others” in this phrase. i was told that for this step, i would need to write an apology letter to my abusers, apologizing for “my part” in “provoking” their anger. i was told that i would need to forgive my abusers. i was told that i would need to reconcile with my abusers. in trauma recovery, the focus was on removing my self-blame for their abuse, on coming to my own understanding of the abuse and my own acceptance of it – whether or not that included forgiveness – and on self-protection from here and moving forward. i cut my abusers out of my life in order to protect my recovery, as self-protection and learning the skills to implement my self-protection in my current life was a huge focus of my trauma recovery. this step counteracted my trauma recovery in a massive way. i did not follow through with this step, despite receiving constant feedback that i would need to apologize to, forgive, and reconnect with, my abusers, or i would not really recover. b.i have spoken to other women who were told to apologize to their abusers, attackers, or rapists. i have spoken to other women who were told to return to their abusers (abusive spouses sometimes, but more often, abusive parents) and learn to tolerate their abuse more gracefully. c.i was told that i was being “selfish” and “self-centered” for removing my abusers from my life, because my distance from my abusive parents was hurting them, and i needed to consider their feelings and my actions that were hurting them. my trauma work, on the other hand, was focused on me beginning to understand that i have worth as a human being, and i am worthy of being treated better by people than my abusers have ever treated me. as such, the focus on my trauma recovery was for me to respect my needs for protection from damaging people. i found the constant iterations and labels of me as selfish and self-centered for hurting my abusive parents through my distance from them, to be hurtful and harmful to what my trauma therapy was working towards. we continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. a.co-dependency is a massive issue for trauma recovery. i had to learn how to take responsibility for my behavior, but i also had to learn how not to take responsibility for the behavior of others. in trauma recovery, i was most certainly directed away from constantly self-reflecting on myself and finding myself “wrong” and “at fault.” this step, as i saw others apply it, and as i was asked to apply it, focused greatly on putting the responsibility of others’ behaviors onto my own shoulders, and admitting fault when i attempted to erect boundaries to protect myself from emotional harm that others caused me, from time to time. i found that this step greatly reinforced issues of co-dependency. we sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with god as we understood him, praying only for knowledge of his will for us and the power to carry that out. a.while the program preaches “spirituality” instead of religion, i don’t understand why it has become acceptable to push spirituality onto people who may not want spirituality, but rather, recovery. addiction is considered the only “disease” that necessitates spiritual healing; that scientific-based programs and associations, such as the american medical association and various rehabilitation centers, find it acceptable to push spirituality as the cure to issues of mental health, is disconcerting at best. having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to addicts, and to practice these principles in all our affairs. a.i never asked for a spiritual awakening, nor do i want one. i want recovery from my addiction, not a spiritual awakening. in short, if you are recovering from addiction and trauma, please consider professional help of the utmost priority. na/aa are not professional organizations equipped to handle recovery from trauma, and in my experience, participation in that program directly and actively hindered my recovery from trauma. my on-going recovery from trauma has been absolutely necessary to enable me to maintain my sobriety, and my participation in the 12-step programs of aa and na directly contradicted my trauma recovery, and by extension, hindered my chances at addiction recovery as well.",ptsd,4

8f68c867-3573-4c28-836b-677297e0fc3c,"[warning: childhood sexual assault] so, one of my most detrimental symptoms from ptsd is something that none of the therapists/other professionals i’ve met seem to fully comprehend, and i was hoping someone here might know what i’m talking about","in short, it’s perhaps best described as a sort of full\-body existential agony that totally consumes me directly following and sometimes during sex. a simplified overview of my story, for context: i was raped by my father until i was 6, at which point my mother discovered what was happening and took my sibling and i and fled as far away as she could. at this point he had tried to kill her once before and had promised her that if she ever left he would find us and kill us all, and that’s what he did. he stalked us to the other side of the country, found where we lived, and was partway through breaking down the front door when the police showed up and they got into an armed standoff with him, from which he eventually stood down. he was only sentenced to probation, partially due to a lack of ready evidence to substantiate the allegations of abuse, partially due to having a highly respectable military record, but mostly thanks to his almost superhuman ability to manipulate other people to his will. they sentenced us to have to live with him in the place we had tried to escape to, saying that since my parents were not legally divorced he had a right to live with his children. after this all of the physical, emotional, and sexual abuse escalated, of course, until finally one day he tried to beat my mother to death in front of me and she managed to escape through a window and get to help, at which point she finally had the legal ground to force him out of our lives, and that’s more or less where that story ends. i was seriously fucked up by the time we first ran from him, so my mother sought out specialists right away after we moved. at age six i was clinically diagnosed with complex ptsd and chronic suicidal depression. \(they may not have added suicidal to the descriptor until i was older, but it was already the dominant characteristic of my depression even if it would take me a while longer yet before i could properly express it.\) i could not and would not deal with these problems head on; up until about age 16 i had to give 100&amp;#37; of my available energy to fighting against the constant, overwhelming pressure to kill myself, and it took everything i had to make it day to day. by my mid\-early 20s i had been able to start incremental work on learning to recognize and reduce my symptoms and triggers, etc, and since then i have been desperately trying to build myself the foundations of a life that is stable and healthy enough — both internally and socially — to at least survive the hit when another major depressive cycle comes for me. i’m now a very damaged man in his mid\-late 20s, and i am nowhere close to having what anyone could consider a normal, healthy life, but i am doing better now than i would have dreamed could be possible 10 years ago. however, sex is still such a massive problem that i take significant steps to ensure that i do not end up in situations where it might arise unexpectedly and trigger me, and i am careful to not project any sense of sexual availability whenever possible, all of which takes a huge toll on me psychically and socially. and yet it is absolutely crucial, because almost every time i’ve had sex \(all except the first two, both with the woman i, at the time, loved\) the experience has proven so traumatizing and overwhelmingly negative that i’m afraid one day it will prove so powerful that i will simply break under its pressure and completely spiral out, which i cannot permit to happen. so for now i have essentially abandoned sex altogether, until i find some way to temper or prevent my reaction to it. on the rare occasion that i have actually been able to overcome myself enough to have sex, i have discovered almost without exception that directly after i climax \(sometimes before if i am disengaged enough from the sexual process that my mind can wander\) i will get what i can best describe as the physical sensation of a full\-blown existential meltdown. it is, hands down, both the most unbelievably powerful sensation i’ve ever experienced…and the absolute worst. it feels as though both my physical body and my intangible sense of self are both being hollowed out and voided of literally everything, leaving an emptiness so absolute that its absence causes pain, and in fact sometimes when it is especially bad the sensation can become so intense that it manifests as actual physical pain in my body, though that only lasts around 15 minutes top, usually. as i experience it, it is distinctly different from a dissociate experience — in fact, it feels almost opposite to it. it is as though my body is going into a kind of shock at re\-experiencing the physical sensations that are inextricably bound to the existential agony i went through as a child when i felt the deaths of my sense of self, of safety, of rational meaning behind the experiencing of life, of trust and hope and everything else that seems to flood me during this experience. the emotional and mental hangover of the experience usually lasts somewhere between 2\-10 hours, depending on intensity, etc. sometimes i start shaking, sometimes i weep uncontrollably, sometimes i cannot speak and just stare in silence for a while. sometimes it turns into a strange kind of bliss where the sickest impulses inside me tell me it’s a direct answer to the question of why killing myself is the one and only option in the end, because it is what i believe to be true in my heart, if i’m honest with myself. fortunately i also know that i cannot trust my own physiology, and if this particular feeling arises i know if i simply observe it without engaging it for a while it will quiet back down again. anyways, the point of all this is that each one of these experiences is a brutal, crushing experience, and if i allow too many to happen in somewhat quick succession i begin to feel diseased by its influence, and i’m very much afraid if i try to push through it that some day it may prove too much and my mind will just unravel completely, or something worse. if anyone here can relate to this, i’d love to know! i’ve never met any doctors, etc that seem experienced with this problem or were really grasping how intense the whole thing is, or how serious of an obstacle its been towards me feeling like i’m a real human being. thanks for reading.",ptsd,4

52d0183b-345f-43cf-a470-e99b2329f9c1,want to share a bit of my story (tw: sexual abuse),"so right now i'm going through a formal process of bringing ti light some sexual harassment i've suffered, and it's triggered me badly regarding the sexual abuse i endured as a very young adult. i have rarely spoken about it since it happened. i was disssauded from being public about it, and i now realize that those people although well meaning were wrong. because being secret has only added to my shame and has crushed my self esteem. now i'm realizing i want to be more open, but i thought the internet is a good place to start. part of my issue with sharing is that i can't fathom if anyone would have gone through anything equally terrible, although i logically know that of course people have. this story is quite traumatic, so don't read if you're feeling fragile: well i began being groomed by an older man (49) when i was 17. i was (am) autistic and extremely naive and with somewhat neglectful parents so i was the perfect target at age 18 he started with the sexual advances and i was lured into a three year thing you can't even call a relationship because it was so disturbed. he was also married with three kids and the craziest thing was i ended up living under his roof from age 19 to 22 and was sworn to absolute secrecy. his wife didn't have a clue, but later in the piece, he brainwashed her into watching while he had sex with me about once a week, and at the same time, concealing the real 'relationship' he and i had underneath, where he blackmailed me into having sex with him sometimes several times a day. and meantime all this was going on with his children around completely clueless because he was such as clever freakin bastard. then on top of all that, he manipulated (through suggestiveness) his wife into 'having the idea' that the three of us go out and swing, which basically meant that once every few weeks he'd organize for us to meet with a guy or even a guy and his wife, and i would be effectively gang banged (gang raped if you take the level of sheer coercion into account). in the months leading up to my leaving, he started talking about organizing larger and larger gangbangs (gang rapes) and i have no doubt he would have followed through if i'd not been able to leave. he also photographed and videod a lot of our encounters and i have no doubt he's still watching me naked on tape often as there was no law requiring him to get rid of this. there were other elements to this abuse too, such as a high level of emotional abuse, cult like spiritual brainwashing, and even after i managed to leave him, it ended with stalking and so me filing for a protection order and an eight month battle through the legal system to get one. while i was on the cusp of leaving rhe relationship, i became acutely suicidal because it was so damn hard to get away from him and the people at the mental health center said they'd never seen someone so suidical. this man destroyed my life right on the cusp of adulthood. i never got to complete my university degree because i was trapped under him when i should have been there. also the abuse most likely triggered my health genes, because now i have several quite severe chronic health conditions. i completely lost my ability to trust people, and most of my family and friend relationships have failed. because i can't work, i can't afford proper health care or therapy. i have lost my sense of self under his control with the immense psychological brainwashing and i don't think i'll ever completely get it back or even half, especially without the proper help. i don't live with a victim mentality but i think it's fair to say that this man has pretty much destroyed me. thank you for reading my account because i need to get it out.",ptsd,4

575b8503-8418-439c-a780-a27d0b2c3abb,my abusers have contacted me after a decade of no contact,"so my parents (and to a lesser extent my maternal grandmother) abused me. my father physically, psychologically, and emotionally abused me. my mother psychologically and emotionally abused me. i won't get into details to prevent triggering anyone. my mother contacted me on facebook the other day with a phone number to call (she sent me a friend request, and i knew that she probably sent a message which would go to facebook's second inbox for people who aren't your friends, and sure enough, there it was). i've spoken to them over the phone once now, and via online communication a few times. they thought i wanted nothing to do with them, and i thought they wanted nothing to do with me. turns out, another party (a sibling) was intervening in the middle to prevent us from communicating. my therapist was out sick all last week, and he's out sick this week too (don't know for how long). so i didn't have a chance to run it by him before calling. i chose to call, knowing that talking to my mother is like engaging in a complex game of chess. much to my surprise, it was a pleasant conversation. they were informing me that they were moving to virginia, and they wondered why they hadn't heard from me. we put the pieces together about my sibling's interference. i honestly feel like this is a good thing. i no longer hold any animosity towards them. they did the best they could with what they had (financially, they had plenty at the time. emotionally, not so much). they're sick in their way just like i am in mine. that doesn't mean i forget: the flashbacks and nightmares make sure of that. but some connection to them feels good. i can't explain it. i've been disconnected from family for over a decade. i created a new family with my friends. but to have *my* family back, even if it's never face to face feels like i've made progress. talking to them didn't trigger me. i guess i'm rambling, but the reason for the post: has anyone had a similar experience, and if so, do you have any advice for me? i'm proceeding carefully. baby steps. also worried about my therapist. he's been out over a week now. not sure what he has, but it has to be pretty serious to last over a week and be so bad that he didn't come to work.",ptsd,4

(he's since admitted to being a severe alcoholic and has been clean and in aa for 7 months now) so, now i'm left with just myself and my child. crushing anxiety, and an inability to forge any kind of relationship. terrified of having sex, or really even being touched at this point. any help or suggestions would be amazing. what have you done? is there anyway to get past this? will i be sexless forever? will i ever like it? i feel like a fucking rejected piece of society with my son being the only purpose of my life (which i love every single second of being his mother) i need help. i don't know what to do, i've tried therapy and it hasn't helped in the slightest. i honestly can't even afford it anymore. i'm also hesitant to try medication because i'm still nursing. if you've gotten this far into reading...thank you.",ptsd,4

5feff834-c173-4381-9a63-da6e611ad5cf,got triggered by the news and can't stop being depressed since (sexual assault),"not sure this is the right place to talk about this, i've never really used reddit before. hopefully someone can help or at least understand what i'm struggling with. i've been through major trauma 8 years ago, as i was walking home from school a man attacked me. he had a gun, started taking my clothes off and i just couldn't move, it's like i was not even there in control of my body. i just kept thinking he would kill me after he finished what he wanted. he eventually let me go and i called the police as soon as i ran out of sight. they arrested him. what followed was a series of exams, questions by the police, having to identify him, working with a lawyer, going to court and many things that make me understand why so many victims don't even report their abuse to the police. to be fair, they were extremely professional and did their best to not make things worse. i've had to take a lot of medication to prevent stds and they made me throw up twice a day for 6 months. at one point i'd feel sick just by looking at the pills. my family and i have been through so much because of that, it was also right after my grandfather committed suicide (he was schizophrenic). i couldn't stay home anymore, we had to move to my grandpa's apartment for a few months so i could breathe. i kept going to school and trying my best to not let that control my life, and i think on the outside it looked like i was ok, but i just felt like a ghost. i couldn't hold memories for a while and if you ask me about my last year in high school it's pretty confusing, i just remember parts and not in order. depression, anxiety, fear or strangers, panic attacks and dissociation would come and go. sometimes i'd just not feel anything, and sometimes i'd be angry at people for not understanding me. i started doing therapy and slowly healing but still found it hard to deal with my emotions. eventually, i went to this buddhist temple and started meditating, which really helped me and brought me back to reality. i stopped having panick attacks and was able to not think about it so much. going to college also helped, cause it felt like a new stage of life and i quit therapy because i felt no need to keep going. now, i've been doing pretty well in my life and most of the time don't even think about what happened. but the other day i read on the news about a 3 year old who was sexually abused, she was found with her diaper full of blood. just typing this makes my eyes well up. i can't stop thinking about that, about how fucked up the world is, and keep having flashbacks of what happened to me. it's making me depressed, affecting my relationships, my sex life and daily life. i'm living far from my family, and i don't wanna tell them what's going on because they will just feel upset and powerless. i try to forgive myself for not doing anything like running or kicking him, or just paying more attention because i didn't even see him approach me.. i guess now i'm just having a mix of emotions, i don't wanna live in the past but i'm not feeling connected to the present no matter how hard i try. i feel very lonely because the people who love me can't really understand my feelings and i know they hurt too, but in a different way. i feel helpless. i'm not even sure this is just ptsd or something else, if there is anything i can or should do... thank you for reading. any advice, comfort words or even just a ""i understand"" is welcome.",ptsd,4

a7ac8389-980d-453c-ae2b-41d8ef8ce2bc,almost fifteen years later and i'm okay (positive but some tw),"this is my very first reddit post. i've been dealing with my ptsd for almost fifteen years now, and i've been diagnosed for about five. my story might be triggering, and for that i apologize. but my message is one of wellness and hope. i spent the night at my cousin's house approximately a week before my seventh birthday. she had begun abusing me pretty steadily earlier that year, but that's another story entirely. we had eaten our dinner and were trying to get a movie started while my aunt, uncle and older cousins chatted around the dinner table. i don't want to make this story too long, or too triggering, so for what happened next - i'm going to try and just give the details as bluntly and without emotion as possible. six armed gunmen broke in. it was a robbery that somehow just went wrong. maybe they didn't think we would be there, or maybe they didn't care. i'm not sure. my cousins and i fled upstairs while my aunt and uncle tried to fight them off. we barricaded ourselves inside a bedroom. the four of us huddled on the bed, repeatedly calling the police. we could hear muffled shouts and scuffling from downstairs. then we heard a gunshot. my aunt screamed. and everything went silent. in the silence, we could hear a dragging. though we didn't know it at the time, my uncle had been struggling with one of the gunmen when his weapon went off. my uncle was stunned, the shot having gone off right by his ear. though he hadn't been hit, his assailant took the opportunity to beat my uncle unconscious. they tied my aunt up in a room and dragged my uncle in too. then they locked the door, and came upstairs for us. they hadn't been able to find the money or goods they wanted. they started pounding on the door. they were yelling at us, telling us to open the door. my eldest cousin, who was about fourteen at the time, picked me up and took me to the window. there was a tree that grew up beside the roof. he looked me in the eye and told me to crawl across the roof and climb down the tree. sometimes i still hear him telling me it's going to be okay. ""just run, kingofpromise, okay? don't look back. don't wait for us."" when i tried to take my teddy bear with me, he told me that he would bring mr. bear. the banging was getting louder. he pushed me out the window and onto the roof. i was halfway to that tree when i heard the sirens. the gunmen fled into the night. i could see them from the roof. i stayed out on that roof for a long time. my cousin finally lured me back inside with my teddy bear. we kept ourselves barricaded in that room for over an hour. my mom arrived as soon as she heard what happened. she sat outside the door talking to us until we agreed to open the door. they never caught the men who attacked us. i was lucky, everyone survived. i was so young, my parents thought i would be okay. children are resilient, you know? and i was okay, sort of. but as time passed, i grew increasingly anxious and paranoid. i thought every one of my bus drivers was going to kidnap me. i obsessively read about serial killers online, convinced that the more i knew the more educated i would be. by the time i was a junior in high school, i had developed delusions. i became convinced, as the tenth anniversary approached, that i hadn't been meant to survive. i thought i had cheated fate and fate was going to come back for me - and my family. i concluded that suicide was the only option to set things right and save my family. luckily, as it turns out, i am also ocd. and according to my compulsive side, there is no ""right"" way to kill myself. everything was either too public or too bloody, etc. but i had become withdrawn, depressed, i was behaving erratically. one day, as i arrived home from school, my parents confronted me. that was my first episode. i can only vaguely remember it. all of a sudden, it was like i didn't recognize my parents. i was screaming at them (something i had never done). i told them they had ruined everything and now they (the men i thought were going to murder us) would come for us all. i told them they should have just let me ""do it"" so i could save them. my dad was crying. he tried to approach me and something snapped. i didn't recognize him. i collapse, sobbing and begging for my life. i didn't see the dad that had lovingly raised me and given my brothers and i big kid ice cream cones when my mom was out of town. i saw an assailant. i begged my dad not to hurt me, not realizing who he was. my parents sought help for me immediately. i was quickly diagnosed with ptsd, ocd, generalized anxiety and depression. with a name to my condition, it all began to make sense. i had nightmares. i was hyper vigilant. i wouldn't be alone with men. i assessed escape routes wherever i was. i'm sure these are things you all are familiar with. we weren't sure if i would graduate high school, go to college, or ever be able to live alone. a lot has happened in the past five years. for the sake of keeping things short, i'll sum it up like this. i now attend a prestigious university and am preparing to apply to graduate programs so i can earn my phd. i have a wonderful boyfriend who i've been seeing for around a year now. i live alone and fend for myself. i am alive. and most days - i am not afraid. not every day is a good day. sometimes i can't leave my apartment. i can't watch horror movies. i don't like going anywhere alone at night. and loud sounds spook me. but i'm going to be okay. sometimes, i know it doesn't feel like it. no one understands the way we think, the threats we see, the memories that won't die. but we can heal. we can be okay. some days, maybe it's enough to know we aren't alone. so i just wanted to say - here i am. you aren't alone.",ptsd,4
257dad7c-2900-43f8-99f3-3e4535a3683c,i just need to relate my experience [nsfw],"i am in counseling and have been for the last 3 months and was diagnosed with ptsd. the counseling is helping, slowly. i'm meditating, trying to practice more self care and compassion, but letting myself feel my emotions again is... hard. its really hard. i have been numb for the last 1.5 years, because i am really stuck in fight or flight mode. i just need to relate my experience and... i hope this is the right place to do that. right around the beginning of 2017, i got a sore throat. i take immune suppressant drugs to control a chronic illness and my sore throat got so bad that i woke up in the middle of the night because my throat had completely shut closed and i couldn't breath. i ran to the sink, forced down a glass of water and i could breathe maybe 20%. i call 911 and have to shout in short gasps what was happening. i remained conscious for long enough for the emts to make their way into my apartment, but i blacked out after that. the next time i woke up in a *lucid* state was 9 days later in the hospital, incredibly weak. my wrists were completely covered in dark purple/red bruises to the point you might think it was a tattoo. my throat was so sore and i could barely talk. i thought 10 years had passed. when the emts got to me, they had to shove a tube down my throat and knock me out because i was fighting against it. two day after getting to the hospital, they took the tube out and woke me up, but i was still feverish and confused, so apparently i tried to escape. they anesthetized me again before i woke up again, only to start choking to death, my throat closing up again. they put me back into the chemically induced coma, which i was in for 9 days. i lost 30 lbs and couldn't feel the inside of my throat for almost a year afterward. my parents flew from across the country to the hospital because they were told i was going to die. my hallucinations were... vivid. extremely vivid and central to them was that i was being kept in this hell of purgatory, only to be reborn into more and more fucked up lives. i'm not going to go into detail, because i could write a fucking scifi novel that would make philip k dick say 'tone it down.' i remember dying multiple times. i remember what it felt like to be convinced that i was about to die and knowing what it feels like when your body seizes against itself violently thrashing about uncontrollably. i have felt the different ways my body and brain interacted while i was dying. the first time was a rush to survive, executing a plan that would save my life with more focus than i have every mustered in my life. the second time, i was trying to fight off people who i was convinced were trying to keep me in some kind of nightmare prison. the third time... i was already so weak that by the third time it happened, i remember explicitly hearing the last part of me i could experience, this last little whisper of consciousness- ""i am dying, this is it, this is how my life ends, this is what it has been building up to, i am dying, all i can do is witness this, i am disconnecting from my body."" i had to finish getting my masters and writing a thesis, with classes starting a week after i got out of the hospital. there was no time to cope or process what i had been through. i just shut the fuck down. i am genuinely afraid i will never feel human again. i know they were trying to save my life, but it is a horrifying experience to be strapped down to a bed, choking to death and being wrestled down by a bunch of people. i felt violated and totally dehumanized.",ptsd,4

b6ec01ce-7d40-4301-9086-e07b0f8fed3c,"thaaaanks, ptsd, for ruining thanksgiving","my ptsd has been kept in check for a number of years. but, like most people with ptsd with it under control, it *does* crop up from time to time. aaaand, like most people with ptsd with comes with a big, heaping helping of social anxiety. my social anxiety comes with all the [classic last night, i had one of the worst anxiety attacks i have ever experienced. my thanksgiving plan was originally pretty solid. i was flying solo, which didn't bother me. i had planned on cooking dinner for some security guards at a jobsite, then going to a buffet that a five-star hotel was putting on. bring a book, relax, enjoy the excellent fare. braised short ribs, roasted chicken, pan seared trout, prime rib, and of course- turkey. i dropped off the dinner i had cooked for the jobsite to a bunch of very grateful guards, my heart lifted....it went downhill from there. i got to the hotel, which was crammed with people. families, happy couples. then there's lil ole me. i overheard a hostess say, ""wow we are packed, all these people!"" it's an innocuous remark. that's when the intrusive thoughts started. *all of these people here that deserve the food more than you do. it's just you.* *why can't you just take your fat ass home and have some cereal, you selfish bitch?* *you're the reason those facebook memes exist. making people work on thanksgiving. christ you're so selfish.* *everyone here has happy families. and look at you. alone. like always.* i started to hyperventilate and cry. silently, with tears running down my face. the waitresses came around with champagne, and i gripped mine for dear life. i plastered myself against a corner, trying desperately to make myself as small as possible. an older lady came up and wished me a happy thanksgiving, saying i looked like i needed a smile. i understand what she was trying to do, but as we all know...that makes it worse. because now i'm convinced everyone is watching me. looking at me. looking at the freak. i'm supposed to be happy- or at least pretend to be, but i can't even manage that. finally, it's my turn to be seated. thank *god* for small miracles, i'm seated in a corner. i can be out of the way, people won't look at me. i was so, so, *so* wrong. somehow, being in a room full of 100 people, even though they were eating, laughing with their friends &amp; families, amplified the idea that i was on stage. i was expected to perform and be happy, but i couldn't. i was convinced that everyone was looking at me. i was hunched over my plate, hair falling down like a curtain, gripping my fork like a drowning man would a life raft, trying desperately to keep it together. i lost it when the waitress came over to refill my glass and the check, and touched my shoulder. i slapped down my card without a word. the dam...it just broke. i turned towards the wall, so hunched over, my face was practically in my plate. my tears fell into my food. i could feel my shoulders going up and down while i sobbed, and i tried to be as quiet as i could. i guess i wasn't was unobtrusive as i hoped. i woman came over and asked if i was okay. i snapped that i was fine. she asked if i just needed someone to talk to. *yes!* i all but yelled, *no!* how do i explain that i have ptsd and that i'm having one of the worst panic attacks i've ever had, and that despite her wonderful intentions she's made it worse. because now i am even more convinced that everyone is looking at the freak in the corner, and that i'm ruining their thanksgiving. *""oh, honey, look at her. she's crying. that poor girl. god, that is so sad. and on thanksgiving, too. why do you think she's crying?""* now they're thinking about me, instead of having a good time with their families. i just want to be invisible. that's all i wanted. the waitress came back with the check. i hastily scribbled a 40% tip with a note that i'm sorry that i ruined thanksgiving for everyone. i power walked out of the hotel, and once i hit the pavement i literally *ran* to my car. i know i must've looked quite the sight. a sobbing woman with her purse, her hair flying, running through the streets of downtown. i got into my car and when i got home, i wailed for hours, on the couch, under the blanket. i tried to overcome it, i really did. i tried to work through it, and i just couldn't. i don't have any emergency meds that i can take to calm me down, like attivan or diazepam. my new insurance has no mental health coverage. the only place in town that will accept a patient with no insurance will see you...for $500 per visit. so. thank you, ptsd. thank you for ruining not only my thanksgiving; but that of others. (you will never convince me i didn't ruin at least the thanksgiving of the woman who tried to comfort me.) ***if*** by some chance, she is reading this...i know what you were trying to do. thank you, and i'm sorry that i ruined your thanksgiving. i have an illness that i sometimes cannot control. thank you, and i'm sorry.",ptsd,4

(good time to mention the summer job included room and board) both of us didn't have nightmares that night and got a decent nights rest. after the summer job, we continued talking and found that we share a lot of the same interests and sense of humor and ended up going on a few dates before he asked me to be his girlfriend. we currently don't live together (about 45mins apart) but we both help each other with our ptsd. although they both come from different places (mine from severe physical abuse as a child and his from firefighting) we have kinda developed a symbiotic relationship. when we hang out i can tell when he flashes and ether snap him out of it or comfort him through it, and him vice versa. we skype most nights and when one of us has a nightmare or night terror and the other one is awake/wakes up, they will try to wake them up or comfort them through it and help them calm down when they wake up. or when we sleep together in person he holds me when i have a nightmare and strokes my hair while when he does i get on top of him and hug him super tight and whisper ""you're ok, it's just a dream"" in his ear while caressing his face and stroking his hair. we both agree every thing is becoming less frequent and a lot easier to deal with emotionally. it's also nice that we understand each other's triggers and boundaries and know how to properly avoid and respect them. ive had my ptsd for much longer than he has (mine 12 year his a year and a half) and he's glad he has me to help him figure out this thing that is still very new and terrifying to him. it's so hard to explain after so many years of being in fight or flight mode how calming and safe i feel around him. like everything is ok and no one can hurt me. don't get me wrong, it's still in the back of my mind but it's somehow dulled when i'm with him. it's still not perfect tho, especially on nights when he gets toned out for his job and i'm left alone, but i'm glad i can be there for him when he gets back for him to talk through his call and calm his worries. so don't give up, no matter how bad your ptsd might seem, an unexpected solution might be just around the corner.",ptsd,4

be89e8cf-3066-4c16-a676-77ace003a6de,what to do after c2?,"hi everyone! first things first. a bit of background: having been studying english for almost seven years, i passed cae in 2015 and subsequently passed cpe in 2018 (got a). after the proficiency exam, i managed to create some sort of language bubble around me. i have at least six hours of speaking practice weekly. i keep learning some new words and expressions. i read for at least an hour every day. i am an avid writer. i dabble with poetry and short stories (i post some on reddit and elsewhere). perhaps it may sound sacrilegious to some, but i don't really see c2 as some kind of pinnacle. i reached it a while ago. since then, i seem to have somewhat improved my writing (which, in hindsight, was egregiously bad at least insofar as exam tasks are concerned). i wouldn't say that my speaking skills advanced as much as they could, but this gap can be patched up pretty swiftly with enough practice. i feel like my passive knowledge of the language is still up to scratch, but my linguistic output seem to leave a bit to be desired. i feel frustrated and somewhat disoriented. although i am believed to have swallowed a thesaurus by many people over there, there's no ground for complacency. i don't like blowing my own trumpet. furthermore, i still feel that my linguistic output is inadequate at times. c2 is often erroneously believed to be a be-all-and-end-all by many language learners, but that's far from being the truth. i still feel that there are some lacunae in my language. i still feel challenged. besides, not only is it difficult to gauge any kind of progress after c2 has been reached; it also feels like you've reached a plateau and now you're crawling rather than leapfrogging towards some new level. and that's fine. i'm going to retake this exam this year or maybe next year, just to keep my language alive and kicking. i put too much time and effort into it, and it would be too profligate of me to lay it all to waste. what do you think, folks? your opinions are welcome. nb. i am working as a chemical engineer. there's not much opportunity for me to apply my english at work, let alone at a level that high. i participate in and contribute to some local off-line speaking clubs, but, truth be told, they do not really challenge me. and i want something duly challenging.",none,5

(a phrase used in many languages to get someone's name)... so i tought perhaps she forgot my name. so... very timidly with a confused look on my face i replied telling her my name... ""uhm... i'm z..."" of course the entire class started laughing. the point of this whole story is to underline how for us non-native speakers, phrases such as: **are you cold? are you hot? i'm cold. i'm hot...** sound very weird. ***for us***, it would feel more natural for us to ask do you feel cold? is it cold to you? do you feel hot? are you sweating... ? etc... yeah... it would be more natural ***for us***... but for the native english speakers, phrases like **are you cold? are you hot? i'm cold. i'm hot...** \- are perfectly normal, and are actually the default phrases used in that context! so, the next time someone says ""i'm hot!"" don't assume they're bragging about their sexiness! or if they say ""i'm cold"", don't assume they are emotionally distant, or worse, dead. :d",none,5

[schützenzelt at 11 in the **smaller tents** mainly for food and one or two beers. no partying going on there. without a reservation it is very difficult to get in in the evenings. **how to get into tents** * weekdays: if you come before 12 during a weekday it should be possible to get a table. maybe you have to share with others. after 12 during weekdays: if you are a small group ( 5 or less ) it is like you will still find a table. after 3 during weekdays: will be difficult to find a table. you may have to robb one. after 5: could be impossible to get in. ( we will come to not getting in later ) [here is a list on how crowded it will * weekends: finding a table could be a challenge. if you want to have a table be early. very early. just getting in after 12 could be impossible. **what if you don't find a table or don't get in ?** if you don't find a table robb one. 1. find a bunch of very drunk people. a table with no women is the best option. 2. send the girls from your group to the mens only table. they have to ask if there is still place. the guys at the table won't say no. 3. now the males from your group join the table. try to get a seat or stand on the bench. if that's not possible stand next to the table. everytime someone leaves the table you have to take the free seat. congrats you robbed the table. the drunker the original guys are, the faster this whole process will be finished. don't be a cunt. people often leave the tents because they have to work early. if you wait long enough no one will be angry at you for taking over. if you don't get in: 1. wait: once enough people left the tent they will let new ones in. ( don't wait at the main entrance. get to the back of the tent. ) 2. bribe the doorguy. i have never done that because i am going quite early. but apparently 50 euros are safe, 20 should still work. 3. try to sneak in with a group that has reservations. locate the reservation entrance and stick to said groups. if they don't rat you out it sometimes works. it is worth a try. if you fail nothing worse than a ""not you"" will happend. **food** food is great. try the chicken or duck. you don't need to go in a tent to eat, there a lot of smaller places on the oktoberfest grounds to get food. **pricing** beer should be about 10 to 11 euro this year. 1/2 of a duck about 20 euro. 1/2 chicken about 8 to 10 euro. rides vary. between 4 and 10 euro. rides are cheaper for families on tuesday. **songs** learn some song to sing along. that doubles the fun. some examples: * [country * [i will * [all summer * that's at schützen-zelt ( my favourite one ) those are some of the most popular english ones. they play a lot of german songs too. **rides** for some people oktoberfest is not only about drinking. it is also about the rides. * teufelsrad (devils wheel): it is great. probably the greatest ride on the oktoberfest. fun to last girl is a pro), cheap to get in and you can stay as long as you want. * schichtl: fun place (for people 12 years or older). not a real ride. but someone from the crowd gets beheaded. i cried when i went there with my mum at the age of 7. * the ferris wheel: great when it gets dark. the view from the top is amazing. * krioline: oldest ride on the oktoberfest. don't go there when drunk. you will throw up. there are other great rides like olympia looping and höllenblitz. i just pointed out the most interesting ones. **clubs for partying after the tents close at 10** although i think you did it wrong if you still want to go clubbing after drinking in a tent, there are some clubs: * milchbar * p1 * nachtgalerie * kultfabrik * call me drella and many more of course. **sleeping** if you already got a hotel, great. if you are still looking: you are to late. it is impossible to find a place to sleep now. maybe look in the cities of augsburg, ingolstadt or rosenheim. **edit: clothing** i do have a lederhosen but only wear it when it is warm enough. i need to stay fit for at least 14 days of drinking. if you want a lederhosen, buy one. but don't spend more than 150 euro for it. the expensive ones can cost up to a 1000 euro. what you shouldn't do is buy a cheap one for 50 euro or less. they look bad. [cheap also look like shit. if you wear one of those [plastic you scream australien or american. don't get one of those ridiculous hats. just try to fit in. edit: dirndl tips for women and men: ribbon on the left side: single right side: in a relationship. middle: virgin. never seen that before though. back: husband dead. **some more tips:** * know your limit. the doctors located on the oktoberfest grounds are expensive. if you feel like throwing up, leave the tent ( just don't get to that point. ruins the fun for you, your friends and anyone withing a circle of 3 tables if you puke at your place.) you should get shitfaced, but just don't throw up. otherwise you will end up on this website: * don't harass the girls. you will end up at the police station faster than you can chug a beer (the pros chug a beer in ten seconds) * don't make trouble. [here you can see how munich police and securities handles * don't start a fight. get security if there is trouble. * if you want the beers faster tip your waiter. 10 euros for a table should do. 20 if the waiter hates you. * keep your wallet in a safe pocket. leave passports at the hotel. only take a copy of it with you. it is also good if you leave your credit card at the hotel. everything is cash anyways. get some money before you go to the oktoberfest. source: been living in munich since i was born. got drunk at the oktoberfest the first time at the age of 14. went there with my parents since the age of 0. disclaimer. if you don't manage to get in a tent because of my advice, don't blame me. if they let you in and how crowded it gets can be unpredictable. those tips come from my personal experience.",none,5

(protip, should look something like : jobs, internet, freedom), be ready to run a candidate that agrees with 65% of that platform. now, find a capable and charismatic person to run. find more than one? run them at different levels of government. be ready to compromise on some things. now, you need to get the rest of your friends and family involved and people of your generation. you know that thing you keep in your pocket? it has all of their telephone numbers in it. don't get preachy. ask them about their political affiliation. respect their opinions, don't argue, but ask them a couple questions about your platform and their thoughts about that and if they'd like a politician to run on that platform or if they have a prepackaged politician in mind ask them to speak with that politician about that platform. be committed to change. don't be too committed that you can't change. what do i mean by that? the sort of change you are looking for is going to take time. i don't mean like... its going take years and then happen naturally. there is a certain threshold for the number of man hours that this is going to take. if you're pledging 5 hours a week, that is 20 hours a month, and that is 240 hours a year. if you can get one other people do pledge that amount of time with you, that is 480 hours a year. now. if you get 3 people and they each get two people that is a total of 1920 man hours annually. i estimate that it is going to take about 1,900,000,000 man hours to get us close to the point where we need to be (whatever your ideal. i'm not picky. but that time has to be spent correctly for optimal results.) that sounds like a lot? it is. but it is achievable. if you get 2 percent of people under 30 to pledge that 20 hours monthly to the cause that is 235,200,000 annually. more if you can get more people. ""but third parties..."". nobody mentioned anything about third parties in this discussion of political landscaping. if you can get 2% of people under 30 to pledge that sort of time to one of the national parties at the local level then you can pretty much dictate what candidate is going to be run during the primaries. think of it like your generation is odysseus. its going to take you 10 years to get home (wherever you want to go). now if one of your generation has already done some of the work to organize a political platform that amenable to your generation (here's looking at you seattle) then you probably already have somewhere you can report for duty. i'm not saying its all going to be sunshine and rainbows, but the overarching goals that my generation seems to be very vocal about valuing are achievable, you just have to trek uphill a bit to get there. little things like revoking franchise agreements for isp, telcos, and tv companies that provide them support for a regional monopoly. little things like banning isps that are not classified as title ii common carriers at the state level. once you have the base, for the local, municipal, and state levels taken care of then you can essentially make the federal level your bitch. so yea. i don't think my generation (ages 18-30) has the wherewithal to create a political apparatus, to perform that sort of political landscaping, or to get anything done politically. its not a factor of money, its a matter of boots on the ground.",none,5

(what's the matter) to which he says ""tujhe maloom hai kya hua hai bahr nikal"" (you know what it is, step outside). i didn't, so he tried grabbing my car keys by sliding his hands inside the window, which i had opened just enough so i could speak to him. this went on for good 5 minutes and he threatened to take me and her to police station, calling our parents, and so on until i reached my wallet and handed him a rs500 note. he immediately grabbed it but still asked me to step outside and hand him my licence when i again reached out and had to give him another five hundred rupees. only then he told me to flee off. what's the right approach of dealing with such a scenario since i obviously don't want our names in any kind of police records, neither do i want to include our parents into this as her parents still don't know about us! neither do i wana get myself slapped in public for nothing wrong. could they just falsely blame us for anything petty and make a case out of it, as i'm well aware public obscenity is illegal. by the way, this was in delhi.",none,5

0850ff48-f3d0-492b-8080-5e357dad7d3b,gorillas and lava - trip report for 4 days spent in the eastern drc,"hello, as evident from my trip to the congo, virunga national park is catching a lot of people's attention lately as an alternative to rwanda and uganda for gorilla trekking, hopefully this can answer anyone's questions who is considering a similar trip. **border crossing** i flew into kigali and took the bus to gisenyi/rubavu (many places in rwanda have multiple names, people will know what you're talking about regardless of the one you use but busses will list destinations using the official name which in this case is rubavu). getting to the bus park is easy, every moto taxi or regular taxi in the city will know it. i stayed at the discover rwanda youth hostel; i had mototaxis ask anywhere from 500rwf-700rwf (0.60-0.90usd). if you have a bigger backpack then a regular taxi will be a much more comfortable, though less thrilling option, however those used to the mototaxis in uganda will find their rwandan counterparts drive more cautiously and provide helmets for their passengers. i was charged 10usd by the taxi to go from the hostel to the bus park and 4usd to make the return journey. considering gas here is similar to my native canada (1.10usd/l) 4$ for the 10 minute journey seemed rather low. once you enter the bus park, tens of men will approach you asking you where your destination is and take you to their company, they will also carry your bag for a small fee if you'd like. virunga express was reccomended to me and they proved trustworthy. the ride to gisenyi/rubavu takes 3.5 hours and costs 3000rwf (3.75usd). virunga express makes 3 stops along the way and has busses leave on every half hour. once you arrive at the bus station in gisenyi there is a border crossing just down the street, this is *not* the border crossing you want, you will want to head to the grande barrière which is about a 5 minute mototaxi (400rwf/0.50usd) away. once you get there, there is a small building where people are lining up directly opposite the border, line-up under ""departures"" to get your rwandan exit stamp. if you have an east african visa this *is* multi-entry so you will have no problems getting back into rwanda. if not you will need to have a multi-entry rwandan visa, however some citizens (us and uk notably) can purchase single entry visas at the border. after that head across the border on your on the left and then head to the building to the right of the border (facing goma). the yellow fever/health check (they ask you how you're feeling, if you've been to south america in the last two weeks and take your temperature) is on the far right of the building. i applied for my visa with virunga national park which i imagine 99% of people will. i handed over my letter from the park and passport, was told to wait 10 mins and received my visa (a series of stamps) after the wait. i had no problems and was never asked for any bribes. however i have heard stories of people with older yellow fever cards have been forced to purchase and receive a new vaccine at the border. also worth noting, i entered on may 31st however my entry stamp was not very legible and seemed to say, ""may 1st,"" this did not cause me any problems leaving june 3rd, no one accused me of overstaying my, i believe, 14 day visa. **goma** goma is a chaotic city covered in the lava rock left over from the 2002 nyiragongo eruption that wiped out 40% of the city. i just hailed a cab at the border to my hotel, lac kivu lodge, he originally asked for 20usd but i got him down to 10$. lac kivu lodge's economy room (cheapest option) set me back 70usd. i got a small room with a large bed and a large bathroom with hot water. the views over lake kivu are excellent and the restaurant food is good though a tad expensive. the place is very secure with a high wall and 24h armed guards. wanting to see more of goma i paid a mototaxi 3usd to tour me around and to stop at supermarket. everyone i met was very friendly, also note that usd useage is widespread and that you do not need immaculate bills however do make sure they are the new series for 50's and 100's and no older than 2006 for 5, 10's and 20's. also worth noting that the national park will pick you up straight from the border and take you to their bukima camp or mikeno lodge, allow 3 hours of daylight for this. **gorillas** virunga will pick you up between 6 and 6:45 in goma for gorilla trekking which starts at 9am. the drive took us 2 hours and was the only time i felt unsafe during my time in the congo, not because of any imminent threats but because of the risk of losing my breakfast. the rode is in quite some shape and my driver knew only fast and faster. i was forced to slouch down as to avoid concussing myself on the top of the jeep. besides the armed ranger we picked up in goma this was the only time i was alone in a car and the other drivers all went much slower, it's possible me being an early 20's relatively fit looking male played into his decision to go as fast as he did. the gorilla trekking leaves from bukima. there were 8 of us total split into two groups of 4, with 2 park guides and 2 park rangers accompaning us. there are two directions you can go based off which family you are searching for. if you head to the left you will hike through farmland for about an hour before entering the thick jungle. treks can take anywhere from 1 hour to 6 depending on where the gorillas are, we were fortunate that they were quite close. seeing the gorillas was an incredible, magical experience, i cannot properly describe the feeling you get being around them but it is impossible not to recognize the similarities between us and them. you're supposed to stay 7m away and they give you face masks to wear all to minimize the chance of spreading human diseases, of which gorillas are extremely susceptible, however in reality this was quite difficult as the babies were very curiois and playful and move through the rainforest a lot better than we do. i was hit in the face by a tree by a baby gorilla while trying to escape, it was awesome. **lodging** the bukima tented camp is very near the gorilla trekking start area, i did not stay there and can not speak to this. the mikeno lodge is about 45 minutes away right behind the park hq and next to the orphanage so famously depicted in the *virunga* documentary. mikeno lodge is paradise on earth well worth the 316usd price tag coming from someone who usually pays around 10usd for accomodation. you get a small house with a massive bed, bathroom and a fireplace of which the staff will light for you while you're having dinner. it is full board with delicious full 3 course meals provided for lunch and dinner. the service is some of the best i've experienced anywhere in the world and the manager patient will do everything to make sure your stay is extroardinary. they do chimpanzee treks early in the morning, the gorilla orphanage is a 2 minute walk away and if you're lucky you can see the training of the virunga bloodhounds, besides that relax and enjoy the spectacular views. **mount nyiragongo** mount nyiragongo is a volcano with the largest of the worlds 4 active lava lakes (ethiopia, hawaii, antarctica). the trail head is about 30 minutes north of goma in a place called kibati. i've seen some people wonder about using independent transportation instead of the costly park provided jeeps. for the extremely adventurous i would say coming here by moto taxi is plausible, completely out of the question for gorillas though. the climb takes about 6 hours though they go at the pace of the slowest person, refusing to split the group up for security reasons. 8 people climbed it, all of us with at least one porter, a few with multiple, a guide and two rangers. the hike is 8km long gaining 1.5km of elevation. the first half of the hike will not be difficult for anyone in average shape, the second half increases in the slope a bit with the last 300m being a real calf burner. the views from the top of lake kivu and goma are absolutely amazing and the lava lake itself, what you came here for, is indescribeable. we were very fortunate to have 3 hours of clear weather before the clouds rolled in and it was a 3 hours i will never forget. i've been all over the world and can't compare it anything else i've seen or experienced. it is brutally cold but the faint scent of sulphur in the air and the heat coming off the lake below will warm your heart. i was climbing with a missouri couple on their honeymoon who had a kenyan guide, he told me to expect the most incredible night of my life, and that it was. i took the overnight package from the mikeno lodge, they provide you with a cook who will make you a delicious dinner and standard breakfast (egg and sausage) at the top. my entire stay they were very accomodating of my dietary requirements (no dairy) and this was no exception. they give you a massive backpack with fruit, sandwiches, 8 0.5l water bottles, a sleeping bag, a windbreaker, a poncho, a blanket, and a rain cover. i already had a backpack so i shoved all the fruit and water into mine, left everything besides the sleeping bag at mikeno (i was fairly well prepared with the other stuff already) and carried just that up the mountain, leaving my poor porter with the rest. porters are 24usd for the up and down trip plus a tip, i highly reccomend the service if you have all your stuff like me. there is a place to lock you stuff away at the trail head which i only learned of once i got there. no idea of there is a fee. leaving to come down the mountain starts at 7am sharp, i tried to get up at 5:15 for the sunrise but it was much too cloudy. finally there are now permanent ""tents"" made of wood and plastic (? not a materials savvy person) that actually retain your body heat inside quite well. after being freezing when i went to bed i ended up stripping down to just boxers and a t-shirt. **final remarks** expect to pay a lot in tips, how much is completely up to you but the standard seems to be to tip all your drivers, rangers, porters and guides which begins to add up very quickly. the park staff will drop you off at the border after, even making a stop if you want to purchase some local coffee or cheese. i'll make a shout-out to the bread at mikeno lodge as it was simply to die for. be ready to see abject poverty on your drive from goma to bukima/kibati as this is tough for some people, do know though that these are very capable people able to farm and mix their own concrete, what they really need is stability something your visit can hopefully play a small part in. virunga national park is an extroardinarily well run and non corrupt entity opporating in a place famous for the opposite, i would encourage anyone looking to come to stay abreast of the current situation (elections coming up, if happen as scheduled, in november) and to book. finally on costs, this is not a cheap trip, especially if you're on a starbucks or equivalent paycheque like me. i won't go into details too much as it is all on the virunga website but i spent about 2000cad on the days. do not let that put you off too much as it is truly once in a lifetime. here is a very small sample of the pictures i took for those interested. -&gt;",none,5

[atlas user created list of interesting and unique places. zoom in and refresh on each area as it doesn’t show everything whilst zoomed out. for the jura and area. good for ideas of where to go in a less well known area, but it is mostly trying to push money spending experiences, and is absurdly self-promoting even for a tourism website ([i refuse to believe the quote in this was written by anyone but the website of an english writer living in switzerland, with lots of interesting places covered maps and info on a number of hikes webcams from all over the country (and world) help judge the weather and snow levels. just check the date is right, some show views from years ago. fairly high res 360 degree webcams from a number of scenic spots. **time** no city is very big (even zurich the most populous city is in the same municipal population region as cardiff and belfast) and you can see most of the places worth seeing in a city in a single day easily. unless you are a massive fan of museums and architecture then spending days just in a city will get boring fast once you have walked around the old town for the 20th time. depending on how long you have i suggest planning to either keep moving from place to place (not too bad given the short travel times here), base yourself somewhere for longer and do trips out, or a mix of the two. **touristyness** quite a few people seem put off by the popularity and fear they won’t be able to move for tourists. which to a degree is true, but only in a very small number of places and only in small parts of them. just walking a few minutes away from a certain corner of an old town or a cable car station can easily put you alone in a wonderful place. try and walk through the lakeside end of the old town in luzern and you will be fighting for room to move, go to the far end with the real historic bridge and climbable walls and you will have far more space. likewise stand atop rigi (the most visited peak) and you will be surrounded by vast numbers of people. yet walk up from weggis on the mark twain trail and you will only see a few people until you reach the tram stops at the top. head into the jura or quieter parts of the alps and odds are you will only see locals, and often you may hardly see anyone in many areas. **tourist ideals and reality** st bernard dogs. nevermind that they have been bred into a large impractical size since their glory days, and have not been used in mountain rescue for over 60 years. there are stuffed st bernard toys of various sizes in every tourist shop in the country. yet after 6 months of intensive travelling i have yet to see a single real one anywhere. [the original dog ‘barry’ can be seen in the bern natural history if you really want to see one that isn’t filled with stuffing the society for them at martigny or the st bernard hospice in the summer seems to be the only sure-fire way. picture perfect. old towns are everywhere. no (real) wars and more sane (but not always, see the grey box in rigi kaltbad and the metropole hotel in interlaken) town planners mean that pretty much every urban settlement has a nicely preserved old town. there are endless wooden cabins in the alps with mountain backdrops. however there is lots of light industry around so almost everywhere including even the most famous villages have at least one workshop. so it isn’t literally perfect chocolate box (even if it is very close sometimes). hydroelectric power plants and power lines are scattered around many mountain areas which takes away from the ambience a bit sometimes. cow bells. i assumed it was a tourist gimmick these days. nope. almost every cow has them, even on small fields next to or in villages. it is amazing how far the sound carries (which is of course the point of them), it has taken me minutes to realise the clear dings i can hear are from the tiny dots i can barely make out far below. the novelty can wear off sometimes if you are walking and have 5 hours of constant dinging around you. **opening hours** something that catches people off guard is that shops barely stay open. typical shop and supermarket opening hours are 8am-6:30pm on weekdays, possibly closed at 5pm on a saturday, and not open at all on a sunday. on sundays small towns turn into ghost towns, tourist cities feel more like museums, and almost every shop is closed. this is not so bad in tourist towns like interlaken and zermatt where tourist money keeps everything open for longer hours. shops in or next to train stations are a lifesaver and stay open until 10pm everyday. depending on where you are this may be a well stocked coop or migro, or a small and expensive avec. restaurants and bars stay open surprisingly late in many places. sometimes much later than you would expect from even small towns. but not always. religious, national, and canton specific pepper the calendar and can be a real pain as the already barely open shops will shut down some more. these can fall on any day of the week (the swiss pick a date and stick to it), turning a normal day into a sunday which can come as a nasty surprise if you are not planning ahead. and given that each canton is different you are not likely to be doing so. train station shops remain open as do many restaurants and takeaways so you won’t starve at least. tourist shops will almost certainly be open too. this often results in shopping pilgrimages as people use their day off from their catholic canton to head over to the nearest protestant one. transport timetables are almost always the same regardless of day of week or holiday-or-not. **money** needless to say things are bloody expensive. as i work here and have no real expenses other than food, and travel it isn't a problem for me thankfully. but if you are on a budget the food, travel and accommodation prices will hurt. the views are free at least. the coins are among the worst in the world for new users. they are all silver (bar the mostly useless 5 rappen), round and for 1chf or less are essentially the same size. making finding the right change in a hurry an utter pain. i tend to just thrust a note out and end up with a large pile of coins at home. paying for small purchases with large notes is not a big deal. pay for a small item with a 100chf note worth £70 here and they won’t think a thing of it. the biggest 1000chf note is worth an impressive £700, and the one time i used some the cashier barely looked at them (very different to what happens with the rare £50 note in the uk). the notes are decorated with very serious looking people. euros are accepted near the border and at tourist areas, normally at a 1:1 rate, and not always with change given or coins accepted (though the store/stall will make it very clear in the last place). **language** bill bryson said you never know where you are in switzerland with the language jumping back and forth between villages as you go along. this is only really true along the roestigraben or very south east. for most of the rest of the country you are generally firmly in a certain language zone. [language distribution just to make things fun everywhere has a name in each language, and usually a different one in english too (geneva/genève/genf/ginevra/genevra). though this is normally not a problem for the average traveller. trains stick with the same destination name regardless of which language zone you are in so you don’t need to worry about looking for trains to genf at zurich station. though the announcement language for “next stop is"" will change as you cross the border region even if the city name doesn't which can be odd. announcements are often read out in 2-4 languages depending on how big the train is and where you are. regional newspapers and tv will use the local language names for the whole country, though that is unlikely to even be noticed by most people. getting by in english is very easy. many people speak english, and in tourist areas you often get addressed in english right away by staff. the swiss are very tolerant about you not speaking their local language and will generally do their best to help, especially if you make an effort with at least a few words of theirs first. [see this that corrects me a bit below on these matters. [swiss german is a bit of a beast and has variations across the both the words and grammar are confusing. even real germans don’t understand it and give subtitles when swiss speak on tv. the swiss will happily switch to high german if you ask or it is clear you don’t understand (they are especially glad to if you are not a german). swiss french and italian are a little bit different, but not anywhere near as much as german (and also not something i know about really). romansch is a strange language, but nobody speaks it as their only language anymore. i expected everyone would be able to speak at least two of the swiss languages perfectly and most of another, but nope that isn’t common even in the language border regions. **accommodation** expensive. probably the most expensive part of travel here. but some choices are much cheaper than others. and you often get a tourist card giving you discounts and possibly free travel in the local area. i have mostly used a mix of yhas, random hostels, and airbnb. yhas are spread over most of the country everywhere from all the major tourist centers to some very surprising and remote villages. some are even in refurbished castles. they are always very clean and well kept, breakfast is included (standard continental buffet) which is outstanding for the price. very few have kitchens or fridges for guest use, with the official kitchen producing a meal at about 17chf per head (booked ahead). comfy seating is a bit hit and miss, some just have the hard kitchen chairs, others have nice lounges. wifi is included and fast. lockers are always available for a 2chf coin deposit. staff are often not around outside of the morning and late afternoon/evening which can be annoying. during the week they are often partly taken over by school trips, and at the weekend there tend to be lots of families (especially so in the less touristy places), don’t go expecting a giant piss-up. surcharge of 6chf if you are not a yha member. **food and drink** expensive but generally good quality at least. not very exotic though compared to what i am used to in the uk. italian and local tends to dominate restaurants and the supermarkets. in tourist areas and bigger cities you will see more variation at least. supermarkets are the best way to eat for cheap, and are normally very good at promoting and labelling local produce. take-away tends to be basically just doner kebabs in the 10chf+ range. eating out will be 15chf+ for a cheap meal and at least 25chf per head for a meal and drink in most places. some (but not all) typically very swiss things are: rosti. very swiss-german (hence the roestigraben), basically a hash brown. potato, cheese, ham and egg are the basic ingredients. but the contents and their ratios can vary quite a bit with area and restaurant. a rosti in a mountain house can be an utterly epic pile of bacon and cheese in such a quantity as to scare even the most stereotypical of americans. cervelat. ready to eat sausages. makes for convenient and relatively cheap hiking meals. to be truly swiss take some of these hiking and cook them over a fire. biberli. gingerbread cake hailing from appenzell, tasty and travels very well so is great for taking on outings into the mountains. cheese. so much more than just emmental “swiss cheese”. try everything you can find. appenzeller may well be the best. chocolate. sod the lindt and toblerone, you get that all over the world. cailler and frey are more unique. ragusa is a very good nut based chocolate that is very hard to find outside of switzerland. every supermarket has loads of it so no need to pay extra in tourist shops. coop and migro budget ranges are quite good, if not overly fancy with the wrapping. fondue. the classic heavy winter dish. do not eat this on a hot summers afternoon. do not drink anything gassy or heavy with it. drink white wine, black tea, or kirsch. raclette. the other classic cheese dish and i would say it is much better than fondue. rivella. sort of like lemonade mixed with cream soda. but made with milk serum which freaks the non-swiss out (not that you would ever know unless someone told you). basically the national drink, like iron bru is to the scotts. beer. various types of lagers with a number of local brewers scattered around the country. wine. swiss make loads of wine it turns out, but they also drink it all. vineyards can be found all over the country. the main areas are valais (where they are stereotyped as being constantly drunk on it), and the shores of the western lakes. whisky is made in appenzell. pretty good too. **hiking and getting around outdoors** the outdoors are the cheapest (once you get to the spot at least) and best thing about switzerland. the whole country is covered in well marked and maintained trails. getting lost is pretty hard. yellow signs giving directions and rough times are everywhere; from the middle of cities to glaciers 3000m up. the free mobile app maps.me has a good map for most general walking needs (just be sure to download the highest res map for switzerland). fountains are everywhere (the swiss really love their fountains) and unless a sign says otherwise the water is drinkable. this is great for hiking and biking about. though they can be a bit hit or miss; sometimes i have come across one every 5 minutes and other times gone hours without seeing one. some walks are fairly busy, you will probably pass someone every few minutes on the eiger face walk or gemmi pass on a saturday. but away from the best known spots and with places that have less transport up you will have no end of room. mountain houses are everywhere (almost every farmhouse seems to double as one) and offer food, drink and accommodation. higher up alpine club huts are in the mountains all over the country. in the winter there are usually prepared snow paths for easy walking, snow-shoe routes, cross country tracks and sledding tracks at the mountain resorts in addition to the obvious skiing options. a number of via ferrata are spread all over the country, with gear rental being possible in many places. the swiss love paragliding, the sky near any mountain or large hill the sky is full of them during the summer months. popular with tourists too. **trains and getting around** public transport will get you almost everywhere and in a reasonable amount of time. unless you need to get somewhere very obscure or want to go for a night hike deep in a lonely valley then you won’t need a car. transport runs the same timetable everyday, with the ticket costing the same whether it is a busy rush hour on a monday or late on a quiet sunday afternoon, and regardless of whether you bought it a week or a minute ahead of the trip. other than special services like the glacier express no reservation is needed, and you generally just take whatever seat isn't already occupied. services are normally synchronised too, so that when you get off your intercity train the regional train/bus/boat is sat waiting for you. almost all sbb staff speak english to a reasonable level. transport is a little expensive to say the least though. buying tickets online or via the app can let you save a significant amount if you travel on a certain train. for any serious travel [a pass is the best way to mostly you buy a ticket and then just show an inspector on whatever train you take when they come around (no station barriers here which is rather nice). there are some complications with some regional routes giving you 1.5 hours to use any transport in the zones before the ticket expires. some lines have a self check where you must validate your ticket on the platform. this is not as obvious as it should be until you get on the train and see all the yellow stickers with a big 100chf fine warning. the validation boxes are orange and oddly discrete. buses have screens with the next few stops shown, as do many trains. often these will show the connecting trains and platforms as you arrive into stations. connecting trains will be announced as you arrive at major stations on inter-city trains, though not always in every language. trains can be relied on to always go from the same platform too. the swiss sit on trains like electrons filling atomic orbitals. always sit as far away from the nearest person as possible. if you have to sit next to someone or in their 4 seat area a quick ask or questioning glance of is it free is always polite. annoyingly given the high levels of tourism there are almost no big luggage racks on most trains. even the ones that run through both zurich and geneva airports. though you can get medium size bags in the gaps between seats. overhead racks tend to be fairly small, not that the overhead racks get used much anyway, standard swiss protocol is to always put your bag on the seat next to you until someone asks if they can sit there. [see the start of this video for the perfect you shouldn’t even consider moving from your seat until the train is literally stopping. if you jump up as soon as the next stop is announced you will find yourself stood by the doors alone for a few minutes while all the swiss remain sat down. well unless it is a touristy area in which case you and a gaggle or other travellers will be stood up for the amusement of the swiss. it isn’t perfect, delays can happen (often blamed on a deutschbahn train) and it can fully cock up with a loss of power other reasons bringing the whole thing to a halt. but generally it runs very well. **a few random points** fasnacht: happening around the start of february in catholic cantons (and a bit later in basel) this involves costumes, confetti and marching bands. interesting to see the swiss go crazy, but once you have seen 1 hour of fasnacht you have kind of seen most of it really. so unless you are a part of the community and are actively involved it can get old quite fast. especially with the music. smoking pipes: people do it in a serious non-ironic-hipster way. health insurance forms even ask if you smoke 20 cigs or 5 pipes a day. alp means high meadow, not literally just mountain as you might think. which is why many places called blahalp are only half way up the mountain above blah village. in the autumn the flatland tends to be under fog all day everyday. [this is very impressive when seen from but gets rather depressing down below. try and avoid this time of year. switzerland has snakes. poisonous ones too! and they can live up to 2000m up! though seeing one is very rare the swiss love to have little cooking fires when they are walking. fire sites are obvious everywhere and around midday the woods and countryside will often have a smoky smell. the swiss love to swim in rivers and lakes in the summer. even in the cities, like the centre of basel you will see people floating through the city centre and zipping past barges on the rhein. the water is almost always clear and inviting no matter where you are. but do check it is safe first, there are lots of fast flowing and dangerous places. given their famous love of order the swiss don’t really do queuing as you might expect. getting onto buses and trains tends to be a ruly mob rather than proper queues. nobody is going to force you out of the way, but they are unlikely to stop and wave you forward first. gently moving forward without pushing or giving ground too easily seems to be the way to go. **military** it is very strange knowing that conscription is in place for young men (though they can choose to do community service instead of the army, but with more hours to perform). and in some ways just as strange when you realise there are (almost) no war memorials which are an ever-present part of every uk and anzac community. signs of the army are everywhere and it can almost feel a bit like a prosperous happy north korea at times. at weekends it is common to see soldiers heading home on friday evening from military service and returning on a sunday (not normally with guns, i have only seen a few so far on trains), and the odd armoured convoy driving around. bunkers greet you in mountain passes. by far the most impressive is on the top of mt pilatus which looks like a bond villain base. every house or area comes with a nuclear bunker (normally filled with the family ski gear and wine). during military service conscripts have to do a certain amount of target practice so gun ranges are everywhere, straddling fields, and clinging to awkward cliffsides in the mountains. look carefully and you will often see the numbered targets lined up as you move around the country. **entertainment** gigs are rather expensive. twice the price or more of what i would expect for the venue size and band compared to the uk. do not come here just to see a band. films in the german part often have a 10 minute intermission halfway through the screening (i may have been born too late but thanks to switzerland i can still sort of experience life in the 1960s). a surprising amount of swiss music is played on pop stations, in both local and english languages. i only recently realised that loads of songs on the radio that i assumed were american/british worldwide hits were actually local bands singing in english. a few swiss artists are [anna **reading** swiss watching - diccon bewes. switzerland seen through british eyes. an intro to the history, people, politics and areas of the country. ideal reading as a traveller. slow train to switzerland - diccon bewes. the author retraces the first thomas cook tour of switzerland and shows how much has changed since then and by the rise of trains and tourism. interesting read for the history and travel ideas. free [a tramp abroad - mark satirical and absurd account of his travels in europe. the swiss part is often hilarious. as above is interesting to see just how much the country has changed since then. several places such as weggis-rigi and riffleberg have theme walks in the approximate places where he walked himself. a tramp in this sense is to walk, not the homeless person as most people other than the kiwis might assume. la place de la concorde suisse - john mcphee. dated but interesting read looking at swiss military thinking and culture back in the 80s. free [sherlock holmes - the final problem - arthur conan quick and easy read of holmes' ""final"" adventure. he oversells the waterfall somewhat though i must say. bill bryson passes through in his 1991 book “neither here nor there” though while still a good read the info is a bit outdated in parts. not sure how he managed to see sion as being a charmless industrial town. the magic mountain - thomas mann. inspired by and set in a davos mountain health retreat. no comment as have yet to read it. heidi of course for kids, which seems to be something of cliché and sales-device these days. **a few thoughts on places** [see this comment and the ones after it for some, but far from all of the places i have been. i will probably post a more thorough post on this at a later time.](",none,5

'when an impossibility occurs involving powerful people and possible criminality there must be an investigation to end speculation,' green wrote. 'because the public has a right to know, i’m calling for a congressional investigation.' rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., voiced concern about epstein's death. 'we need answers. lots of them,' she wrote on twitter. she then retweeted a post from former federal prosecutor renato mariotti, in which mariotti says that the criminal probe into epstein would conclude because 'no one else was charged in the indictment.' sen. rick scott, r-fla., called on the bureau of prisons to 'provide answers on what systemic failures of the mcc manhattan or criminal acts allowed this coward to deny justice to his victims.' attorney general william barr on saturday decried the death of wealthy financier jeffrey epstein in federal custody while he awaited charges on sex trafficking, saying the apparent suicide 'raises serious questions.' 'i was appalled to learn that jeffrey epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody. mr. epstein’s death raises serious questions that must be answered,' barr said in a statement.

we refuse to take the return if it is done after 9pm. *red flag 6:* it arrives at 8:45pm and to your utter horror, note further dents as seen on the and the [front we decide to accept it since sumaiya had already promised the 4000 for damages noted on june 7, and agreed to compensate for further damages. **june 13** \- we write a detailed email at 9am with all images of dents/damages to sumaiya and seek further compensation. red flag no response. i call customer care at 3:45 pm and ask for her, they say she will call me in 2 hours. no call until 6:15pm so i call again and this time demand to speak. her colleague jennifer zabral comes on line and says we will definitely get the 4000 but she does not commit to a time line or anything more. i ask her to make a confirmation of this payment at least by eod, as well as ask sumaiya to call me before eod. **june 14 (today)** \- no response, as expected from sumaiya or any other quikr rep. i have posted ads on other websites/facebook and contacted local people to buy the fridge now in its present condition, and i am not getting offers for anything more than 8\-9k. **next step** \- we are pursuing legal action. my wife is luckily a lawyer who knows a thing or two about consumer protection and has got friends who can help. **request** \- i would really appreciate it if you guys could tweet this at quikr, other social media influencers and increase visibility for me. **warning** \- if you are considering quikr doorstep, reconsider. if you are considering selling a product on an online marketplace, reconsider. never let your product leave your door without cash in hand or money in the bank. it's not your responsibility what happens to it after it leaves your door, but in this case, as we learnt it the hard, way the burden is all back on us. **final word** \- they run their scam at the mercy of unsuspecting customer, and it is no wonder that their ceo pranay chulet is inactive on twitter or other social media since 2012. they've made it extremely hard to find email ids of their top leadership so all our communication has been with a lowly social media executive. they are a shady, shady business that i hope soon goes bust. eat shit, you guys. **tldr:** quikr took our fridge for delivery on 31 may, did not deliver on time so buyer refused, damaged it in the process, agreed a compensation, delayed the return to me, damaged it further, finally returned, now they are dragging their feet on the compensation. our fridge has gone through incredible torment in quikr's hands for 14 days, and we have gone through no less on an emotional/financial basis. quikr's business is reliant on deceit and lies, shoddy delivery practices, and complete miscommunication between their own teams. dishonesty in indian e\-commerce is not too uncommon, but this is a level that takes the fucking cake.",none,5

b70ea5b9-3233-4b19-b396-72b8342b7990,"work exchange (wwoof, helpx, workaway) faq / guide [x-post r/solotravel]","i've decided to write this short guide to help exchanges as people keep contacting me for advice. if anybody has a question or concern that hasn't been answered, then feel free to message me or post it in the comments. if anybody wants more info about my travels see my previously submitted posts / *1. what is a help exchange?* in basic terms a help exchange is where you work for somebody and instead of being paid in currency, you're paid in accommodation, meals or both. *2. why do a help exchange?* the most immediate answer is because it can keep your travel budget down. accommodation and food are two things that are often pretty high when travelling. by working for both, you don't need to spend as much money on your travels. this is especially useful in more expensive countries. the downside is that you need to work. the average amount is 4-5 hours per day, but many hosts are more liberal or conservative with work hours. i've done help exchanges where i've barely done anything and been treated like a king. i've also done some where i've worked my arse off for very little in return. aside from budget, a help exchange can be a great way to see a country. it allows you to interact with locals and see the reality of a place. you'll experience life as a part of the population, more or less. rather than being stuck on a beaten tourist path. this can open doorways into experiences and places you'd never usually see or even know about. the work can also be enriching and interesting. if you're travelling long term, it can really be quite boring and draining to move from place to place sightseeing all the time. it's nice to stay in the same place and do something other than look at things for a bit! *3a. what type of work do you do?* the number and variety of help exchanges available are almost limitless. i'm not sure which help exchange website started first, but i think it was wwoofing. wwoofing started as a help exchange for organic farms. so the types of tasks were pretty much limited to farming. that is to say, weeding (lots of weeding), planting, digging, making fences, milking cows, feeding chickens etc. general farm labour. because organic farming is pretty much synonymous with alternative lifestyles, a lot of help exchanges have popped up connected to this. so now there's more than just farms, there are communes, hotels, hostels, campgrounds, and any number of other places. each place would have the tasks associated with that place, i wont bother writing them as they're numerous. basically though, due to the non use of chemicals in organic farming you can expect that a lot of wwoofing will entail you do some weeding at some point! (weeding = pulling bad plants from the soil.) helpx and workaway came later. these offer help exchanges at places that aren't necessarily connected to organic farming. many of the places are still farms though, just not specifically organic. but there are also things like families looking for childcare, retirees looking for somebody to do their gardening, motels or backpackers wanting people to clean rooms. (brief aside - i've noticed that backpackers / motels often only exchange accommodation for work. no food.) both websites seem to have a good degree of every day people that just want something done or want to meet travellers. in terms of hours worked, this also usually differs although 4-5 hours is usually average. (work in the morning and chill out in the afternoon / evening.) *3b how long do you stay with a host?* there is no minimum or maximum limit for how long you stay with a host, this is upto you and the host to agree. in the past i've generally just stuck to 1-2 weeks as i find this is a good enough amount of time to get to know the host but also long enough that i don't get bored. it's also a bearable amount of time, so if you hate the project you know it will end soon. many hosts will mention that they prefer workers to stay for at least a week if they're in rural areas, usually because it's a lot of work for them to pick you up from town and it's useless to do all that for just 2 days. if you do plan to stay at a place for a few months, it's worth talking to the host about a trial period for the first week. that way if you hate it after a week you can leave without any hurt feelings. likewise if they hate you, they can ask you to go. *4a. which website is best to use?* this obviously depends on what you want. i'm not too interested in organic living or alternative lifestyles so i've never bothered with wwoof. as far as i know there is no global wwoof website, instead every country in the world has its own website. meaning if you plan to travel across multiple countries you'll have to get memberships for each. i've tried workaway but when i used it i found i didn't like the website and the amount of hosts (where i was travelling at the time) wasn't as much as on helpx. workaway has global listings. helpx is my preferred website because i like the way you can navigate it and it's easy to use, plus there are always plenty of hosts. however this is completely subjective. helpx is also global. for either site you can look at the listings without buying a membership, so it's worth doing that first so you can choose a membership for the site you prefer. i've had some luck using google and facebook too. usually every country has a facebook group dedicated to wwoofing and / or help exchanges, and hosts post that they need help on them. so you can find people on there. *4b. do i need to pay?* unfortunately in order to contact hosts you need to pay for a membership to one of the websites. without a membership you can only view hosts but not their contact details (which is a bit pointless!) however if they mention personal information in their profile you may be able to track them down with google. the fees are as follows: helpx: 20 euros (roughly 24 us dollars at the mo) for 2 years workaway: 29 us dollars for a single person / 38 us dollars for a couple for 2 years wwoof usa: 40 us dollars. wwoof has a site in every country and 30-40 dollars seems the average. this seems like a lot for an online directory, but bear in mind that 30 dollars is nothing in comparison to what you'd save by doing a help exchange. 30 dollars is comparable to one night in a european hostel (if you're lucky!) so even if you spend one night doing a help exchange the membership was worth it. *5. what is the accommodation / food like?* this is another one of those things that differs between projects. i've done some where i've had to stay in a tent, some where i've had my own room, others where i've had my own guesthouse. in terms of food, this also depends on the host. a couple of times i've had to buy my own food (but this was agreed beforehand) and other times i've eaten so much good food that i've gone to bed in pain each night. one thing to note is that due to many hosts having alternative lifestyles, they sometimes have alternative diets (vegan, vegetarian etc) my advice for both accommodation and food is to make sure that both are to your standards before you go on the project. if you're not comfortable sleeping in a tent, make sure that's not what you'll be doing. if you live to eat bacon, make sure your host doesn't mind you eating it. many problems in help exchange happen when the volunteers expectations differ from the reality. to stop this from happening, make sure your expectations will be met. *6. which host should i choose?* pick something that interests you or that you at least wont mind doing. if you read in the hosts description that you'll be shovelling horse shit all day and you know you'll hate it, don't do it! again this is much like the last question in that you should ensure your expectations are correct for your project. to do this its best to find out what you'll be doing beforehand. it also helps to be a little open minded about getting dirty and doing hard work. if you're against the idea of getting dirty, don't contact a farming host! farming is dirty. this doesn't mean help exchanges aren't for you. i think there's a great one for everybody out there. just maybe you'd prefer to change beds in a motel or bake cakes for a bed and breakfast? ask yourself how you'd handle manual labour if you plan to do it! i'm pretty easy to please so i usually just choose my host based on geography. if i'm planning to travel to a certain area, i'll look at hosts in that area. that way i can travel around a country between hosts, rather than having a bunch within the same place. *7. what do i put on my profile?* for a start a photo that makes you look personable. despite the saying, people always judge a book by its cover. if you have a nice profile picture, you're more likely to get hosted. it's like online dating. remember, many of these hosts are inviting you into their home, so they want somebody that looks trustworthy. similarly they want to see somebody that doesn't look like a generic blob. so it's good to mention what interests you on your profile and also when you'll be travelling. it's also good to mention any skills you have as it may help you stand out. *8. when to send a message to a host and what to write?* i would say the best time to look for a host is 1-6 weeks before arrival. it completely depends on the host and how they do things. you'd expect that you'd want to do this way beforehand, but i don't think many of us know what will be happening in 2 months time, so it's a bit hard for a host to say too. many hosts have busy lives, so it can be hard for them to schedule things too far in the future. for this reason i've often found some success sending a message to a host a week or so in advance of being in their area, i think this makes them more likely to make a concrete decision. because hosts are often busy, it's also good to make your message short and sweet. just my opinion. say hello, say you're going to visit their area soon, tell them to look at your profile if they want to know more about you. if you write a 5 thousand word essay they'll not even bother to reply. if you get rejections back or no reply at all, don't be demoralised. it's probably nothing personal, they might just already have helpers coming or they don't need help at the time you're arriving. that or like most of us, they read your email and said they'll reply later but never got around to it. if you don't get a reply it doesn't hurt to send another email again after a short time. *9. how much will i spend?* as mentioned in the 2nd question, help exchanges are a great way to cut down on expenses. the question is an impossible one to answer though as we're all different. if you spend all your time at your help exchange, eating nothing but the free food given to you, you're basically going to spend nothing. if you go into town after work every day and buy lots of luxuries then you'll spend more money (duh!). it all depends on your self-control and the lifestyle you like. town is the devil when it comes to money. if you're looking to save money, avoid it at all costs as it's really hard to avoid spending! (who can resist luxury ice cream and candy? not i!) *10. how do i get to my help exchange?* many hosts will pick you up from the nearest town or bus stop. you should arrange this with them beforehand to ensure that it's ok for them to do so. from there it's up to you how to get to that town, but usually bus is the cheapest way, no matter where you are in the world. trains are great too in certain areas, or even hitchhiking! *11. can you do a help exchange as a couple?* if you have a partner (or friend) and you want to travel with them, it's just as easy to do a help exchange as a couple. actually helpx and workaway have couples memberships so that hosts can see you're a couple. i've travelled with my girlfriend and done a bunch of help exchanges with her and we've often had hosts looking us up on the site and inviting us to stay with them. a lot of hosts seem to prefer couples because it is more convenient for them. they get double the labour but only have to put in the same amount of effort as they would for one person. (eg. if they took on two separate people, this would mean sending two lots of emails, going to the bus station twice, setting up two different beds in their house etc. where as for a couple they only need to do all of this once.) *12. do i need a work visa to do a work exchange?* since you aren't getting paid for your work exchange, a work visa is unnecessary. however, in some countries a work exchange is a grey area. i've read stories of people being denied entry to countries when they reveal they're coming to do a work exchange. probably because customs just hear the word ""work"". the best thing to do in this situation is to say you're entering a country to travel around or to go sightseeing. don't give customs an excuse! if you don't want to lie, just say you're volunteering which doesn't have the same connotations. for more info check out [this ) *13. i've never done anything like this before. i'm a useless shlub, why would anybody want to host me etc?* most hosts are patient enough to show you what to do, so no matter how useless you think you are it doesn't really matter. the most important thing is to go with the flow and not be against the idea of learning something new. as long as you are willing to work hard you'll do fine at most help exchanges. a lot of help exchange tasks are easy to learn and quite menial. i've never mowed a lawn before and at my last help exchange i had to do it. my host showed me how to turn on the lawnmower and use it, then set me to work on his lawn. (ok, his lawn looked like shit afterwards, but i tried my best!) anyway, one thing i always keep in mind on my help exchanges is that in terms of labour it is incredibly cheap for the host. sometimes when i'm eating amazing meals the hosts have cooked, i think to myself “shit, i just did 4 hours of gardening and i'm having this tasty meal. i should have worked for 8 hours.” but it's always good to remember that if the host had paid a professional gardener for 4 hours of work it'd cost a hell of a lot more than one meal would. just by providing yourself as labour you're saving your host a ton of money so they're eager to have you. although most work can be manual, it is not tough. i am a complete weakling and i have managed pretty much every task i've been given, including sawing down trees with a handsaw. help exchanges are a great way to challenge yourself and prove you can do these things, which is one of the many reasons i enjoy doing them.",none,5
