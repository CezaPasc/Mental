34db02f0-82ed-43e9-ac8b-65db8ba55a95,do others feel like they have a warped sense of time passage across days/weeks/years?,"i have read others talking about how add/adhd affects their sense of time passage. however, it is usually in relation to periods of hyperfocus leading to lost hours. i definitely experience that, but also feel like i have a weird sense of time passage across larger units of time. for example, i was chatting with a former roommate of mine, and realized it has been seven years since we lived together. logically, i guess that is correct, but it felt so bizarre that seven years had passed, like i was floating in what i thought was a slow-moving river, only to look around and realize i have actually been carried miles. one of the biggest consequences is that months may pass when i don't call certain people, but i never realize it. i still feel like it has been a normal amount of time between visits or talks, until i actually stop and do the math. i end up feeling like a terrible friend/relative. maybe it's just part of getting older. i know years have sped by more and more. however, i can't help but feel like i have this problem more than others around me. does anyone else experience this?",adhd,0
f515fc3a-0f62-4203-bfc8-53a8252a8fc1,do you ever feel like one small failure can derail your whole day and maybe even subsequent days?,"last night, i thought i had enough time to finish a homework assignment before it was due at midnight, but i didnt read it all the way through and, it turns out, there was an entire second section that was way too long for me to finish before the deadline. i went to bed feeling so guilty (about such a minor 5% late penalty, mind you). today, i slept through my first class and don't feel like doing anything and it all stems back to that one small failure, i think. i feel like i've had entire weeks that feel this way, too. i've made so much progress since my diagnosis, but i still feel totally powerless to my impulses and that really scares me.",adhd,0

(if you deal with this too i'd love to know!) it's as if i'm in a coma. i can set 5 alarms, all with different ring tones, and hit snooze for three more hours. i've missed appointments, classes, work, etc. and it's a terrible feeling getting up at noon and feeling like i've already failed at life. anyway, a coworker told me about an app called kiwake. it's $2.99 and has been a game changer for me the last few days. it makes you take a picture before you go to bed of something really far away from your bedroom. in the morning, the alarm will not shut off until you take the exact same picture, and then there are a few brain teaser games that you have to pass. there's no snooze button. the fact that i actually made it to an appointment today is huge for me. hope this helps someone else!",adhd,0

316224c9-3102-492f-b585-e6aaeeed90ea,i’m tired of being too functional for people to give a shit,"today, i forgot how to use my words. i sat on the couch trying to speak and i couldn’t find the words to express myself. it was like i lost my language. i feel so much pain in my heart some days and today it’s gotten to be a bit too much and i’m worried about crumbling. context: i’m a 20 yr old full time student studying psych and music and working part time. i do well in school and am good at my job. i live on my own and provide my own meals. my parents live a few hours away and check in on me once in a while but don’t really understand adhd and i don’t feel comfortable letting them see me like this as they have a history of being verbally abusive when it comes to my mental health. otherwise i love them. how i’ve been feeling: i’ve become comfortable in a state of constant stress and it’s affecting my physical health and my mental health. some nights i come home and curl up into a ball crying without fully understanding why. i’ve had the same common cold for 5 weeks and am just starting to get over it now. i can’t tell if i’m feeling something because i have adhd or if i’m feeling something because it’s normal to feel things. i feel like i’m on a thin rope when it comes to my day to day life. i’m able to get things done and do well in school but when i look within myself i know that there’s pain that i don’t fully understand and it’s preventing me from being happy. i wonder if that feeling will ever go away. i dropped in at a counselling office at my school and my usual counsellor said she’d be with me in 20 minutes. drop ins are supposed to be a max of 20 minutes so i didn’t mind that there was someone before me. my class was in an hour but i thought a short session is better than no session. i waited. she didn’t come. 40 minutes pass. 45 and i need to start making my way to class. i didn’t get to see her. i felt like because of my typically calm demeanour i use in presenting around adults even when i’m struggling made it seem like my problems weren’t as worthy as whoever was with her. i cried after class. i’ve cried everyday since. i’m tired and trying to be my best and i have a paper and 2 midterms this week and i’m so worried i’m about to breakdown. today on the couch i couldn’t comprehend anything that was occurring to my body. i was speaking gibberish, i had chills, i tried meditating and playing music, talking about it. nothing worked. i had no control. i feel like something big is about to happen and i don’t know what i can do to prevent it from affecting my schoolwork and my everyday life that i try very hard to keep afloat. please send me your advice. please tell me i’ll be okay.",adhd,0

a13584b1-faf9-4e14-ad91-108210106fbc,i can't stick to any sort of diet or force myself to go to the gym.,"i've tried meal prep. i've tried keto. i've tried cico. i've tried all kinds of stuff to make going to the gym interesting for me. but i always, *always* fall off the wagon. most of the time, my meals consist of whatever's around that will make me not hungry. which obviously leads to a poor diet. i'll get a list together for the grocery store, but then i'll get home and not eat half of what i bought because i'll either forget to cook that night or be too tired/unmotivated to cook and end up grabbing takeout. most of the time, i would rather not have to eat - and being on vyvanse, of course, i have no appetite for most of the day, but i still get extremely hungry. it's....really difficult to explain my relationship with food. on the one hand, i hate having to eat when i would much rather just....not. on the other hand, i do enjoy eating my favorite foods. (i told you it'd be hard to explain.) it's just extremely aggravating for me to have to eat just so i don't get hangry/ravenous and then end up just devouring 3,000 calories worth of something to sate that hunger. i do have a slow cooker as well as a fast cooker that i can nuke frozen meat in, which does help, to a point. i gave meal prepping a try, but got tired of the food very quickly, to the point where after maybe three days of eating my meal prepped lunch, i will grab something from chik fil a or another place on the way home from work. or just come home, throw an egg on some bread, and eat that. it's extremely difficult for me to just sit down and come up with different meals that all have veggies, proteins, fats, and carbs - usually, i'll gravitate towards the easiest thing to make. i don't get how people are able to just....cook something delicious and healthy every single night or every other night. frequently, i come home, feed my pets, clean them up, and then immediately either shower and collapse into bed (where i then wake up hungry at 12am) or flop down to play a video game because *one of those things is likely all i've been thinking about all day*. gym....i get tired and frustrated just thinking about going to the gym. i've gone before, but never consistently. never did find a routine that wouldn't leave me completely bored to tears. there's nothing fun for me about it and i just get irritated while i'm there even if i have netflix and headphones. the longest i've managed to stay was about 45 minutes. just can't shake the feeling of ""i could be doing literally anything else right now and it's not going to matter anyway because i'm just going to stuff my face later because i'm starving."" i'm so tired. maybe half of what i'm writing today is because i'm so damn tired. if anyone has any ideas of how to actually lose weight while at the same time not even having the motivation/energy to fucking cook myself a meal, i'd be forever in your debt.",adhd,0

3d4ce261-4292-44da-80d6-9e953fcee3f3,i asked my mom about adhd medication,"tl;dr: asked my mom about trying meds- she hates the idea and made it thoroughly clear that she doesn’t support me taking medication, but is willing to let me do it anyways before covid, i (i’m 16) was planning on asking my parents about trying medication this summer for my adhd. i know they aren’t huge fans, because of the side effects, sometimes it can mess with your personality, blah blah... i know it does this stuff, and i don’t know why they think they know everything about it considering we’ve never tried, but i digress. now, with the quarantine and online school, i’m struggling more than ever. we went on a walk with our dog today, me and my mom, and she asked me how the focusing was going (i had expressed to her before that i’m having trouble) and i said it’s alright, and we started talking. she recommended a change in location. i informed her that, within the bounds of what we can currently access, that isn’t going to work. there is no location in the house that won’t present more distractions for me. i’m already used to sometimes focusing in my room, so i might as well stay there. she kept suggesting various places in the house, the dining room (which is open to the rest of the downstairs- not going to work at all) and my parents bedroom (i’m not used to focusing in there, i’m used to relaxing in there. again, not going to work) i said that the only possible place that could work would be my car. she ignored that and she started basically yelling at me for shooting down all of her ideas and not coming up with any. i told her that my idea was my car. she said “well you know what? it’s in the garage. i have no complaints, go ahead and do that.” or something. she kept suggesting that i needed to stick with something like this for four or five days to see if it will work, which is my main problem, because after four or five days, if i’m right and it doesn’t work (one would expect me to be right about how i will react to things) then i’ll be four or five days *more* behind, and i can’t handle that. i told her that before the quarantine i was already planning to ask about medication over the summer. she shot down the idea, saying it’s going to mess with my personality and she doesn’t want to lose me. i told her i’ve thought this through extensively, and that’s why i was waiting until summer, so that we can try it and if it doesn’t work we can stop. we kept going, and she makes her final decision about five sentences into the conversation that she doesn’t like the idea of medication, but once this is over, if i want to, we can try it. this is hard for me, naturally, because she always supports me, and if i do this, it would pretty much be without her support. this is really important to me, so i kept trying to convince her, tell her about the things i’m feeling and the research i’ve done and what my ideas and decisions are, but she was closed off. the only thing i got from her was “do you want me to lie? do you want me to say i support this even though i dont? i’m not going to do that. i’m not going to change my opinion just because you want this.” and she refused to listen to me any further. she even mentioned that i “don’t want to be taking medication for the rest of my life,” as if she knows what i want better than i do. this is going to be incredibly, *incredibly* difficult for me to do without her support. i will, because i genuinely need to see if this helps me, and it’s going to be more than worth it if it does, but it’s hard. i hate not having her on my side. she tends to assume that she knows me better than she does. *no, mom, if this works, i would love to take medication for the rest of my life. that’s fine by me.* i don’t even want to imagine what my dad will say- probably something very similar. he and i always seem to clash. i just feel very alone right now and she isn’t helping, she’s just making it worse. i know my family is there for me but i don’t feel like i can properly express how i feel, so i don’t try. but hey, risk vs reward, right? little risk, high reward... the math supports it. i’m going to do this, and i’m going to be strong. i’m going to be my hero now, even if it takes a lot of crying. thanks and sorry.",adhd,0

50951466-42e0-4304-9bf2-7557d18f9c6b,i am crying reading this sub,"i’m 34. i’m a lawyer. and i have adhd, inattentive type. looking back on my life, it’s so clear. i’ve always been so disorganized, forgotten things, been messy, wandered around aimlessly, etc. but i always made excellent grades and performed well on standardized tests, so i never realized i had an issue. i used to fail projects in school because i would only sporadically remember that i needed to do them, and never at a time when i could actually do anything about it...but my high iq (i sound like a jerk, i know) and great test performance usually saved me. i always juggled the balls successfully, using various strategies - aggressive calendaring, list making, just do it ism, panicked last-minute hyper focus. i survived by sheer force of will and the skin of my teeth (what in the world kind of expression is that? but i digress...because i always digress). in november 2016, i had my third child and it all fell apart. i had so much to do that i couldn’t focus on any one task. y’all should see me in the mornings. making breakfast for the kids turns into me taking a shower somehow. i forget to send another pack of diapers to daycare. i forget to pay bills. i forget deadlines. i forget everything. last week, y’all, i lost my phone. not uncommon at all for me, unfortunately. looked everywhere for it. i was late (i’m always late, to everything), so i used find my iphone. cue my 6 year old in the kitchen: “mommy, why is the freezer beeping?” 🤦🏻‍♀️ i’ve needed new glasses for 6 months but i keep forgetting to make the appointment. anyway, i contacted a friend who is also my endocrinologist, and after listening to me describe things, she prescribed strattera. i took the first dose yesterday and i felt slightly more calm and focused, but who knows if that’s a real effect or just placebo? i’m sure time will tell. i haven’t told my husband about the rx yet because i’m afraid of what he’ll think. that’s probably completely unwarranted but whatever. reading this sub makes cry because what everyone is describing is my life. the things y’all describe are things i’ve been dealing with for at least 30 years and not attributing them to anything other than me being a lazy procrastinator who forgets things. in hindsight, okay, duh...but i’m stunned to find at 34 years old that this has been the issue all along. i thought everyone’s brain and life were like this and i couldn’t figure out why i was so unable to keep it together. i’m smart. i love my job and my family. why do i suck at memory and priorities and actually getting things done? i even bought a book called getting things done (didn’t work) and a book about organization for adhd people (didn’t actually read the book...because adhd). i’d like to get some input on what to expect with strattera, but the main reason for posting this, i guess, is my absolute relief that i am not a bad person and i’m not alone in the world, or lazy or insane. if you got this far, thanks for reading. even if you hadn’t gotten this far, i would still have wanted to thank you, but of course you would never have seen it if you didn’t get this far to read the thanks. 😉",adhd,0

4ea4a6b7-b7d2-4a31-947f-baf8e2cf1aba,the difference between lazy procrastination and adhd procrastination,"i posted this in a comment and a lot of people seemed to find it helpful, so i thought i’d report here. editing the wording a bit to make it more readable! **how can you tell the difference between laziness and adhd?** do you *want* to do it? do you find yourself starting, and then stopping, over and over again? do you find yourself getting all your materials out, only to spend an hour dicking around? do you find yourself getting up constantly to start other tasks while you’re in the middle of working? do you spend all day anxiously thinking about the task, avoiding any “fun” activities, and instead spending the day in an anxious paralysis? if yes, it’s procrastination due to adhd. non-adhd procrastination (laziness) is me saying “i’m just not doing it (right now).” it means i’m out enjoying my life. i’m putting off my work until the last minute because i just don’t care about it. i’ll spend my night playing video games or spending time with my so, and then wake up early to do my homework. the work is not a stressor. it’s not a priority. with adhd procrastination (“i *keep-not-doing* it”) is when i spend all day thinking about the task. i’ll get all my stuff out and then get distracted with other things. i’ll sit at my kitchen table for hours, doing nothing (or un-fun things), avoiding the work. i’ll forgo fun activities (turn down invitations, not go out with friends, not spend time with my so) because i “need to get some work done,” only to find i’ve done nothing all day. i’ll start and then stop and then start and then stop my work over and over. the house will be scattered with unfinished homework, projects, and tasks i’ve forgotten about or accidentally abandoned, saying “oh, i’ll get back to that right after i do this...” adhd procrastination a cycle of me not doing my work despite my best efforts to do so. it feels guilty. it’s frustrating. i’ll have spent all day thinking about my work and trying to do it, not having any fun, and ending up with no progress. i’ll turn down invitations to hang out with friends. when they ask me how the project is going, i feel humiliated admitting that i’ve gotten nothing done, even though i said i was going to work on it while they went out without me. laziness does not feel guilty. i just don’t care about the task. i go out and enjoy my life and barely think about the task beyond a passing thought of “i should probably get started on that...” when i was in high school, this is what my adhd procrastination looked like: i’d spend all saturday doing homework on and off, feeling anxious and paralyzed, and stay inside all day while my friends were out having fun. i was not having fun. i felt like a prisoner to my own homework. i kept sitting down to do my homework but always got distracted. my mind kept wandering off during the reading. it would take me 2-3 hours to read one history chapter, and i knew i’d go into class and fail the quiz (yet again). when my parents got home and asked you about my homework, i’d have to admit i didn’t get much done. then i’d hear what i’d heard a million times before: “but you had all day!” sometimes it even meant i couldn’t go to the party with my friends like i wanted to. then the cycle continues, weekend after weekend, and i felt like i was drowning in work other people got done in 1/4th the time. it didn’t get easier as an adult, either. i spent years feeling like a faker, i got good grades and people would tell me i’m smart. if they only knew how much i struggled, they’d take it back immediately. graduation and receiving awards made me feel sick to my stomach. it felt like i was lying to these people. **tl;dr:** adhd procrastination is a cycle of anxious, frustrating, hugely effortful attempts and failures to begin and finish work that is important to you. laziness is putting off unwanted tasks and enjoying life in the meantime. i hope this helps people figure out the difference :)",adhd,0

201ccb7a-b8ca-4bab-8312-e0a79b993b47,hello reddit. here is a tool for resetting your mindset.,"hello reddit, i'd just like to share with you a tool that has helped me develop new healthy habits, and fight procrastination. i read in some book (forgot the name) about a edit : i found the book - it's mini habits by stephen guise. this is what started the habit for me. --- 1% rule. ---- this is a method used to create new habits, but it can be applied to almost any situation. it functions off the perception that accomplishing something so small can add up. say you want to make writing a habit, but cant get around to it. so you write one word. there, you're done. it's silly isn't it? but strangely you've accomplished your goal, and here you are either laughing about how stupid what you're doing is or feeling hopeful for a breakthrough. regardless, that is apparently how neural pathways work. you need to reinforce them. there is no easier way to break down successes into miniscule chunks until they become large enough to have an impact on your life. chances are if you're a hard working adhd'er, you'll try to push more than 1% or one word. you'll write two. then three. then ten. until you feel ""accomplished"". then before long, it's become second nature. i can confirm this works for physical exercise / gym. i started by lifting my arm from the bed. seriously. now i go almost every day and row 5km on the rowing machine. not impressive, but beats lying in bed being depressed right? this also works for any negative behavior you want to stop to. 1% less of that behavior could be one less pint. one less foul mouthed word. whatever. use your imagination. hope this helps! tldr; if you want to do something, try starting by doing 1% of it then build from there. until you feel happy with the session results.",adhd,0

dating almost ten years, married for three, one dog and no kids (yet). - ‎he was diagnosed maybe 7ish years ago after some prompting from me, has been taking ritalin since, but no other formal treatment. **key relationship issues *possibly* linked to adhd** here are some of patterns that are/were present in our relationship that i have often seen listed as symptoms of adhd (note: does not mean they are all necessarily symptoms) and how i/we initially responded: - hyperfocus on early stages of relationship: our first two years of dating was amazing and intense, but at some stage, it was like someone had flicked a switch and he had lost interest → that was a super painful process for me and i was left wondering if he was no longer interested in me. - ‎forgetfulness: he can have a terrible memory for stuff like chores and appointments→ i found myself getting frustrated and picking up an unfair share of the housework, developing a parent-child dynamic. - poor attention span: he can't really do much of low-stimulation activities like watching tv or just sitting and talking, but could easily play computer games by himself for hours on end→ i felt like he didn't enjoy spending time with me and it was difficult to find stuff to do together that he would enjoy. - ‎lack of intimacy: he is often hypersensitive to touch, e.g. can be averse to kisses or even light touches, or just rarely in the mood→ it became a vicious cycle where i would initiate intimacy, he would reject me, i would feel upset and my self-esteem would take a dive, and he would further avoid intimacy in future. - ‎quick temper: when trying to address the issues, he would often get defensive and quick to anger→ he'd get angry, i'd get upset, we wouldn't resolve anything and would both dread future interactions. **things that have worked well for us** over the years, through plenty of tears, talks and trial + error, here are some things that we've incorporated into our lives that have worked quite well for us: - shared calendars and task lists: we use shared google calendars, which means i don't have to remind him of events, he doesn't have to remember events, and he can also take more ownership of our scheduling appointments (less of the parent-child dynamic). he has also started settting himself reminders for regular activities so i don't have to nag him about it. - ‎read ""the adhd effect on marriage"" together: [this is one of the best adhd relationship resources i have come across. the examples throughout the book are so relatable, to the point where i was moved to tears, but most importantly, it stresses that there are behaviours and patterns in both partners (i.e also the non-adhd partner) that need to be addressed. as with most self-help books, know to take the advice with a grain of salt, but there is some good stuff in there. my husband and i would set aside one night per week where we would sit down and read a chapter of the book together, then take 10mins afterwards to discuss what we felt was accurate, and how we could implement this in our own relationship. - ‎scheduling intimacy: while scheduling intimacy can be really unsexy, we're in the process of rebuilding that healthy level for us both, so starting with small steps. setting aside some time for intimacy means that he can always anticipate it, allows him to occasionally initiate, and it ensures it doesn't get completely forgotten about. - ‎housework routines that work for him: my husband is the champion of folding clothes and ironing, as long as he can put his headphones on and listen to a show/audiobook while he's doing it. i've learnt to exercise more flexibility with when and how housework gets done, and he's learnt to develop regular housework habits that fit in his routine. - clear plan of action when having serious chats: these can be high risk events for us, so whenever we need to sit down to talk about relationship issues, we put a time limit on it (if it can't be resolved in that time, we just continue the discussion another day), agree to let him leave the room for a breather if the conversation escalates too much, and to always end the conversation with hugs and our trademark exchange of silly faces. **key takeaways** good things to keep in mind if you're in a similar situation: - (for the non-adhd partner) not taking everything personally: it can be tricky, but try not to take everything they do (or don't do) as a direct reflection of how they felt about you. because it's probably not about you. - (for the adhd partner) reassure your partner: on the above point, help your partner understand that it's *not* them. remind them that you love them whenever you can. - it's not a blame game: it's so easy to start blaming one another for your behaviours and making it you vs them, but remember that you're tackling this as a team. try to see the other person's perspective and how they are being affected, and discuss things that you could both do to work on things. and try to have a laugh about it every now and then. - celebrate even small successes: even with the best of intentions, progress can often be slow, sometimes you might even take a step backwards, and you may be left feeling hopeless. make sure to acknowledge any progress, however small. a simple ""yay us, that was a really positive, productive discussion"" or ""hey, i really appreciate that you unloaded the dishwasher"" can go a long way. - be patient: across all aspects of the relationship. be patient when having to tell them something twice. be patient when waiting for their train of thought to drift back to the conversation. be patient because sometimes it just takes a while to override the bad habits and sucky feelings associated with past negative interactions. always be patient. our relationship is not perfect. i'll be the first to admit that at times we can reeeally frustrate one another, but we love each other to bits and are open to continuing to discussing things and trying new techniques together. its a constant learning curve. i'd definitely welcome anyone else's tips if you're willing to share! good luck to all you adhders with your current/future relationships and also to any fellow non-adhd partners out there :) be nice to one another &lt;3 tl;dr: adhd guy and his non-adhd wife sometimes drive each other crazy, but their crazy love for each other and their crazy persistence delivers crazy good results.",adhd,0

9293bcfd-ff84-44aa-bdce-262bafaf6831,"despite being diagnosed with adhd for 18 years, yesterday i learned what adhd was","i was diagnosed in 2nd grade and adhd was described to me as the reason why i couldn’t stop moving and wouldn’t pay attention in class. i have been on and off medication for treating those symptoms for most of my life. some medications allow me to sit still and to focus on things (typically the wrong thing to be focusing on like youtube or video games). all of this time i thought that if the medication made me stop moving and allowed me to focus, then it “relieved” my adhd and my inability to now go and do what i needed to do was my fault, and that i wasn’t disciplined enough, or i was lazy. because i had adhd for so long, i never really looked into literature about it, because i thought i knew what it was and that the symptoms weren’t that bad. i thought to myself, “moving around all the time and jumping from idea to idea isn’t so bad, my real problem is i can’t get the things i need to do done”, which i thought was separate from the adhd. last night, during an extended roaming quest around the internet, i made the impulsive purchase of a book (which i do all the time) on adhd (which i have never done before). in the book (the adult adhd tool kit), it described adhd being a disorder characterized by an impairment of the executive thought system causing a reduction in the ability to motivate yourself to do things that do not result in short term gain. this caused me to go completely nuts, because this describes me perfectly, i am an addict of short term rewards over long term benefits. i, and my parents, and my teachers, always attributed this to some character flaw in myself whereas i accepted my hyperactivity and attention problems as a characteristic of my disorder. this completely changes how i view my actions, as well as my treatment of those i know with adhd, and feels very life changing for me as i can actually seek out treatment options to help the executive system problems rather than the hyperactivity and in attention. i feel stupid for not finding this out sooner and like i was overly proud for so long (i felt i didn’t need to read someone else’s definition of adhd, i “know what it is, i have it”) thanks for reading my rant.",adhd,0

0aa88344-1875-4969-922d-73bdc283827e,"[1 year update] diagnosed at 32, finally medicated and cleaned my appartment for the first time in two years","***tl;dr*** *one year ago, i posted about finally getting diagnosed and medicated at 32. this is an update to that post. no miracles happened, but progress is steady and i'm doing well thanks to meds, psychotherapy and coping strategies! if you only want to look at pictures, click the imgur link. bonus adhd poem at the end. you're all super cool.* --- since i love update posts and my [original (about finally getting diagnosed, medicated and ""the big cleanup"" afterwards) got some attention, i feel obligated to give you an update on my situation. let's start with **the progress pictures: as you see, the apartment is in relatively good shape. nowhere near where i want to end up, but a lot has changed for the good in the past year. just three examples: * still not as tidy and clean as i'd like to, but instead of waiting 2 *years*, i get to it within 2 *days* (or, on occasion, 2 weeks) now. * learned to accept that ""[some level of clutter is (shameless plug for ""howtoadhd"". love you, jessica!) and to take it step by step. * new lamp in the kitchen! new art and a new tv (still need to get rid of the old one, though) in the living room! yay! as some people warned me, the effect of the medication and the novelty feeling of motivation wore off quite rapidly. but i worked with my psychiatrist to gradually balance the dose over the course of a couple of months and formed some healthy new habits in the meantime. --- in the hope that some of you might profit from it, here's an incomplete **list of things that helped me**: * taking my meds consistently * psychotherapy * mindfulness-based stress reduction (mbsr, jon kabat-zinn) *that lead to being more honest with myself, taking better care of myself, learning to say no, and so many more other amazing things.* * limiting my social circle and interactions *1.) to avoid a crowded schedule and reducing the amount of ""shit, that was today?"" moments 2.) to make the remaining connections/interactions more meaningful and important* * talking openly and extensively about adhd with people. *trying to educate the ""ignorant"".* * asking for help unashamedly. * creating extrinsic motivation, tricking myself into doing things. *for example: inviting a friend over to make ""tyding up"" the top priority with a clear deadline* * finding ""adhd-buddies"", even better: some sort of support group *i can't stress this enough! it feels sooo good talking to someone who knows exactly how you feel!* * telling myself (out loud) to ""stop!"", if i catch my thoughts drifting off. *then concentrating on finding out what i was doing before drifting off. rinse and repeat.* * trying to consciously hpyerfocus on creative endeavours instead of benign stuff and negative thoughts there are some **strategies that didn't work for me**, such as * any type of paper-based, long-term organisation system. *short-term: absolutely, yes! long-term: just look at my stacks of lists* * the pomodoro technique. *i don't know why, it just won't work for me.* i could write a whole post on each of the bullet points, hundreds of little anecdotes about how life became better in (almost) every sense, and maybe i will (but probably not). however, this post is already waaay longer than planned, so i'll leave you with a **summary: meds help, therapy helps, talking helps. check out mbsr! consistency is key, but it's okay to fuck up. simplify your life, use tools that work for you. ask for help when needed.** --- there were **good moments**, like the time when my dad and i visited an adhd lecture by some renowned psychiatrists. one of the speakers talked about adhd being hereditary and sometimes skipping generations. i'll never forget the moment when my overly pragmatic, seemingly emtionless dad realized, that his own father had probably suffered from undiagnosed adhd. at that moment, he internally resolved their complicated relationship, more than 40 years after my grandpas death. i saw him cry for the very first time in my life and we had the first *real* talk in a long, long time on the train ride home. i'm so much closer to him now and feel that he understands me better than ever before. there were some **really bad moments** and days, like when my grandmother died, but those were rare and i managed to get through them quite well, thanks to the coping strategies i managed to develop in the meantime. --- since you stuck with me through that wall of text and you're so [super here's **a short poem i wrote for you**: shit! once again, i fucked up and forgot about one of the things i'm required to... hold that thought! - daaamn, but that person is hot! never mind, there's already another great view. but now, let me check out fresh memes and whatnot. just a handful of blue links?

dbcadeaa-915b-4899-9cc0-9ddd8e62c3c6,"i've started thinking why adhd is so awesome and not how disruptive it can be, and it's made a huge difference in my life.","i really wanted to avoid a wall of text but now that i'm at the bottom, i realize that i've written this post and that's exactly what it is. i hope you stick with me through the whole thing! for some backstory, i was diagnosed with adhd 6 months ago at age 26 at the end of a very serious depression that occurred after college. i've read a similar story on this subreddit a few times now, and i'm among that group as well of individuals who had symptoms, might have joked about having adhd with my friends, but never was tested because i didn't have any seemingly noticeable/disruptive symptoms and my grades were fine so my parents were happy. honestly i think it was a combination of me just being interested in a lot of learning material taught at school (read: i'm a nerd) and being a 4 season athlete (cross country, indoor track, outdoor track, off-season training). arbitrary bonus points that don't give you anything if you know why i mentioned specifically those two things! we all have experienced how hard it can be to have an adhd brain in a world that is predominantly run by people without an adhd brain and they have created systems that work best for them. consequently, sometimes they don't work very well for us. i won't try to tell you in this post that i found this ""1 trick to *defeat* adhd. doctors hate him!"" that's not true, nor is adhd something that i want to live without anymore. learning about adhd can be an empowering and extremely stimulating topic and the science behind it makes me go ""wow... that makes so much sense, i didn't know that is associated with adhd."" while trying to learn about adhd, just a reminder that a best practice is to use multiple reputable sources to form your knowledge base. even doctors and experts have opinions, since they're people too. i won't lecture you though, because i'm not qualified, nor is my level of understanding to the point where i feel confident that i can explain all of it without making any small mistakes, and i don't want to misguide anyone. here are some questions to get you started! do you know what adhd is? do you know what neurotransmitter ""deficiencies,"" it's commonly associated with? do you know what the primary impact that those neurotransmitters have on your ability to function? do you know the difference between ritalin based medications and adderall based medications? do you know how your medication is ""supposed,"" to work (at a chemical level)? do you know what common ways, without medicine, you can influence the neurotransmitter levels associated with adhd? do you know the common ""super powers"" that adhd brains have over non-adhd brains? do you know how to use them to your advantage? do you know the common weaknesses? do you know if there are jobs that might be better suited for an adhd brain? if there are what might they be? do you know how others cope with adhd? with that, i hope that you take some time to learn more about this wonderful little thing that we have! sure it might have it's daily frustrations, but it adds a depth to my life that i wouldn't want to live without. plus, i love trying to figure out how i can better improve my ability to tap into my adhd superpowers.",adhd,0

0b38f33e-784e-4977-ac2d-9cfe6c691a4d,a word on adhd meds and non adhders,"obligatory rant. i was diagnosed with adhd in my second semester of my freshman year in college, and it was a blessing to have that kind of clarity a proper diagnosis can bring. what i was not prepared for was the struggle of finding the right medication. i had preconceptions of the prescription of pharmaceuticals to be a very linear, cut and dry process. i didn't realize that as good as doctors can be, there aren't really tests or procedures for calculating what drug in what dosage is going to work for you. i know now what i'm sure many here have experienced, that it is more of a trial and error process in which you are constantly weighing the risks and side effects against the benefits adhd meds provide. i struggled to find the right balance, switching from adderall ir (instant release) 10mg, then to 20mg, then adderall xr (extended release) in 25mg and 30mg, before finally arriving at vyvanse, starting with 40mg, going to 50mg, back to 40mg and then back to 50mg. all of which had different side effects that affected me physically, mentally, and emotionally and sometimes in ways that i didn't notice until pointed out by close friends or family. i struggled with lack of appetite, emotional supession, anxiety, exhaustion, sleep problems and maybe some slight depression. some of the side effects were more profound than others, and there was a dark period with me and adderall xr when i was taking 30mg with a 10mg ir booster. i became a different person in a sense and i didn't even notice until months of being a shut in and anxious. i'm finally at my sweet spot with vyvanse 50mg and it's working great for me, despite some side effects of decreased appetite and a crash at the end of the day. i go through all this because when i hear non adhd people who talk about adhd meds, i know they really have no idea what it really is. i see alot of people abuse it in college and i've had to deny friends trying to buy my medication off of me. adderall is kind of a meme at this point with so many people who think of them as smart pills. as someone who has been dealing with these medications and the mental health system, i would want to let people know that these drugs aren't something to fuck with. they're powerful medications that can have serious side effects. you have to be extremely aware of your body and your mind because the side effects can sometimes be very subtle and you can be totally unaware that you're becoming slowly more irritated, anxious, and depressed. that can destroy you if it gets too far. i'm not trying to give a 'drugs are bad' speech. i'm saying that this shit is potent and if you don't give it the respect it deserves, it will bite you. if you think you might have adhd, don't self medicate. a dose good for one person could be way too much for another. talk to a doctor you can trust and get a proper diagnosis. adhd is often comorbid and can look very similar to bipolar disorder. adhd meds and bipolar disorder do not go well together. just talk with an expert and do your research. if you're just trying to cram for finals, stick to coffee. adderall can take a little anxiety and make it a mountain of anxiety. plus, the science isn't exactly clear if it truly helps those without adhd with learning. it's not worth the risk of making a habit out of taking these pills when you don't know what you're doing. if you're just starting down the pharmaceutical journey with your doctor, be patient and alert. take note of how you feel and make sure you have a support group, whether it's friends or family, to give you objective data about how your medicine affects you. you might be surprised by what they notice. take it slow, you're going to get there eventually, and it's not going to help racing up your dosage too quick because you want results now. i just wanted to share my experiences with you all and see if you felt the same. i also wanted to give some insight to people who are just beginning their journey with a diagnosis or who are unfamiliar with the complexities of adhd. vyvanse has made my life significantly better and i have no plans of stopping my prescriptions with my current side effects at this time. i don't want to scare anyone away from taking medicine. i just want to make sure people treat this process with respect and care to make sure they stay safe. sorry this is so damn long. tl;dr adhd meds are potent and can fuck you over. treat them with respect and you won't get bit.",adhd,0

[tl;dr version article],"## the toll of attention deficit disorder in adults, tl;dr version [the harvard article called the toll of attention deficit disorder in adults should be a must read for the people here.]( but because it is 2 pages long people probably won’t. so here is a tl;dr ## social problems. adults with adhd are at greater risk for mental health issues, **81%** of us that had it as a child will have at least one psychiatric disorder as adult. adults with add are **3x** more likely to suffer stress, depression, or other emotional problems that may cause them to miss work. **24%** of adults with add say they are prevented from participating in normal activities such as work as a result of poor physical or mental health. this is **2.5x** times higher than normal. in 10 years **43%** with add lost or left a job in part as a result of difficulties related to their symptoms. adults with add are **2x** as likely to divorce or separate than adults without the disorder. of those in relationships, **&lt;50%** say they are satisfied with those relationships. **&gt;60%** smoke cigarettes and **52%** report using drugs recreationally. adults with add are also **2x** as likely as their non–add peers to be arrested. ## medical. adults with adhd suffer from behavioral problems related to the processing of information by the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which governs executive function, **including our ability to plan and organize**. **adults with add tend to avoid tasks that require concentration, have poor time management skills, and are plagued by indecision and doubt.** they are also more likely to be easily bored, inpatient, and intolerant. in adults diagnosed with add, the attention-control regions of the brain used less glucose than those regions did in participants without add. this lower level of activity in certain parts of the brain **may contribute to inattention.** dopamin deficits in the brain’s reward pathway lead to the **inattention and lack of motivation** that often characterizes the behavior of adults with add. ## end quote from article. &gt;the more these interventions succeed [meds, therapy etc.] in controlling adhd behaviors in children before they reach their adult years, the better the outlook for these children as they age. that’s important, says kessler **because the implications of add on adult function are indeed dire.**",adhd,0

b35d9807-e158-46ca-80aa-883054d28351,feeling like you can't articulate or self-express coherently.,"so ever since i was formally diagnosed with adhd at around age 4-5, i was always a little chatterbox. the problem at the time was that it was mostly me talking about the things that interested me, which ended up being whatever i happened to be watching on tv or a toy i was obsessed with or something like that. as i got older, this led to me getting bullied a lot and so i ended up retreating into myself and not really putting a lot of focus into speaking. that, and not having too many friends probably made the issue worse. when i went into college i was pretty much a stuttery wreck that could barely edge out a sentence that sounded remotely mature and/or constructive. i could never really do ""small talk"" at an adult level very well, but the bigger issue that concerns me is how this makes me come off to other people. i'm currently 25, and communication is an extremely vital part of our lives, especially in a professional context. if i had a ton of prep time and a topic i was particularly versed in, then yeah, sure, i could probably hold a somewhat decent conversation. the problem is that casual conversation regarding anything that i don't really care too much about is daunting. i used to sort of just skid by as a kid by repeating one-liners from shows and other stuff i found funny, but other than that, i don't really have too much to talk about. i don't know if this an issue inherent with adhd sufferers, but it seems to pop up in discussions rather frequently. another issue is being unable to really ""think on the fly"" when it comes to being witty or responding with an appropriate answer. in work/school related settings, i usually let others take charge and if my input was needed, i'd default to just agreeing with whoever spoke prior. i feel like this makes me come off as intellectually slow and someone not suited for projects that require some measure of commanding presence. when i'm on my meds (i currently take 10 mg of adderall xr), then yes, i usually feel like the ""restraining bolt"" in my cerebral cortex has been wedged off, and i can easily hold and even lead a conversation while keeping people engaged. it's also easier to let ideas and thoughts come to my brain. i always assumed that most people didn't have this sort of smooth thought flow on a stimulant as it's meant to increase focus. yet when i'm on my meds, it's like a combination of focus and relaxation that allows me to be less stressed about figuring out what to say. i don't know if it's just me that has this problem so intensely, but another non-adhd friend said ""well, talking with others and being social in any environment is like a muscle; you need to do it more and then you'll get better at it."", so i'm not entirely sure if this is an adhd-exclusive issue or just a part of my general feelings of anxiety. tl;dr pretty shit at conversation off meds, not-as-shit when on meds.",adhd,0

(my previous record was, at most, two days. this is for all 41 years of my life. not just at my current job.) my vast sea of laundry has been whittled down to what i need. everything is hanging in an orderly fashion in my closet or is neatly folded into a few shelved in a dresser. nothing is scattered across multiple bedrooms or hampers or floors. i am all caught up with my mba homework after i fell far behind. i still need to get caught up for a class i am teaching, but i will do that this weekend. i also learned that it's okay to say ""no"" to opportunities. i can only pick and choose so much. once this semester ends, i'll make a rational decision of what i want to do in terms of my education. i am not sure what my employer thinks, but i believe my production and output at work has improved dramatically over the course of this month. i have been listening better. i'm more attentive when talking and listening to my wife. i get tasks accomplished. i put things away. we have actual conversations. my brother and i have had a bunch of great talks where i actually don't drift off as to what he is saying. i have been a better friend. i have been treated for bipolar for 10-plus years. the initial diagnosis and treatment for that felt like it worked. but there were still just the routine complaints about a lack of detail and the constant distractions and noise in my head from the 20,000 things i was focusing on all at once. everything in my brain slowed down about one hour after i took that pill. it has remained at that speed ever since. reading up on adhd, i realize i spent an entire life without any executive brain function at all. i won't pretend to understand the chemistry. but all i know is that there was a lock on my brain that kept me from living up to my potential for my entire life. i found the key. now it's a matter of managing what comes next. every day brings with it another joy. to most people, being able to successfully navigate calling a plumber, dealing with a dog that recently had surgery, having a friend from out-of-town stay over, work, a little bit of laundry and a homework assignment in the course of one day is not a big deal. but to me? this is a parade. i would not be able to handle this over a month ago. i am so optimistic. let's support each other.",adhd,0

it is factually correct to say that dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are the same molecule, because they share the same atoms in the same structure. **but since they do not share the same molecular shape, they produce different therapeutic and physiological effects.** from the (well-cited) [wikipedia (emphasis added): &gt; dextroamphetamine (the dextrorotary enantiomer) and levoamphetamine (the levorotary enantiomer) have identical pharmacodynamics, but their binding affinities to their biomolecular targets vary. dextroamphetamine is a more potent agonist of taar1 than levoamphetamine. consequently, **dextroamphetamine produces roughly three to four times more central nervous system (cns) stimulation than levoamphetamine; however, levoamphetamine has slightly greater cardiovascular and peripheral effects.**^^ a bit [further &gt; the half-life of amphetamine enantiomers differ and vary with urine ph. at normal urine ph, the half-lives of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are 9–11 hours and 11–14 hours, respectively. highly acidic urine will reduce the enantiomer half-lives to 7 hours; highly alkaline urine will increase the half-lives up to 34 hours. **what have we learned so far?** * amphetamine comes in two mirror-image ""versions"" * adderall combines both versions in a 3:1 ratio * dextroamphetamine is more potent but has a shorter half-life than levoamphetamine (""active lifespan"" in your body) * levoamphetamine is less potent but last longer, and has a different overall effect profile than dextroamphetamine ## vyvanse **vyvanse is an inactive prodrug called [lisdexamfetamine it contains 100% dextroamphetamine and 0% levoamphetamine.** vyvanse takes a dextroamphetamine molecule and attaches an l-lysine molecule, which makes it totally inactive at first. as vyvanse is absorbed into your bloodstream, your cells ""break off"" the l-lysine from the dextroamphetamine molecule, which ""activates"" it. **this process of breaking off the l-lysine takes time, which is what gives vyvanse its unique time-release property.** from what i can tell, this is the *only* unique thing about vyvanse: it uses on our bodies' natural metabolism to trickle in active dextroamphetamine over time. this is helpful to prevent abuse, because vyvanse's effects are not dependent on the means of administration. put another way, vyvanse will trickle into your bloodstream at the same rate, no matter how it first gets into your body. ## other formulations of amphetamine see a [table comparing the various formulations of * adderall / mydayis / adzenys / dyanavel: 75% dextroamphetamine; 25% levoamphetamine (3:1) * evekeo: 50% dextroamphetamine and 50% levoamphetamine (1:1) * dexedrine / procentra / zenzedi / vyvanse: 100% dextroamphetamine; 0% levoamphetamine (1:0) **if you do well on vyvanse but poorly on adderall, and you can't afford vyvanse, ask your provider about generic dexedrine instead. they contain the exact same active ingredient.** ## about me i'm a guy with adhd working through my treatment plan, and i want to help others do the same. i'm a nerd on the internet doing research. i'm not a doctor, pharmacist, or psychiatrist. if you can offer factual corrections to any of the above, please let me know. **don't trust anything i say outright.** follow the links and do your own research. read the entire fold-out sheet of prescribing information for whatever medications you take (for adhd or otherwise!). i wish you all the very best!",adhd,0

i know i'm an intelligent person, but i just. can't. accomplish. anything."" so i did some research on adhd because i remembered being diagnosed with it by a child psychiatrist when i was a kid and my dad saying how much i improved after getting medicated. at that point, my dad and myself kind of just thought that adhd was something you ""grew out of"" after a certain age. you get older, you stop bouncing off the walls at every given moment and kind of just figure it went away. i then started posting on this sub and talking to you guys. i read a ton of the posts and posted [this text and got an extraordinary response from a ton of people who related to me and had such nice words of encouragement for me. i read another post from a fellow adhder and saw someone recommend reading the book *delivered from distraction* in the comments. i got it for myself, started reading it, and didn't put it down until it was finished. every damn page of that book felt like it was written for me. i couldn't believe how relative it was to my daily struggles from short attention span to my short fuse to my habit of getting totally overwhelmed from life's small obstacles. i felt like i was discovering something about myself that, for some reason, i just never acknowledged. i finally had an understanding of what was causing so much struggle in my life. i went to my doctor, explained to him what was going on with me, and took a diagnosis test after talking to him and was diagnosed with adhd and started medication. that was probably 5 or 6 months ago. fast forward to me now: i'm back in school, getting mostly as in all of my subjects, pursuing a career in advertising, got my driver's license back (it was suspended forever and severely held me back in terms of job hunting), have a job that allows me to work on school work all day, and have the best outlook on life that i've ever had. i'm by no means perfect; i still have a short temper, i still get overwhelmed from time to time and have a hard time efficiently communicating (aka: ""getting to the point""), but i'd still take this over my previous life any day of the week. i feel so accomplished and couldn't even imagine going back to where i was 6 months ago. i've been so swamped with everything that comes with being a full-time student and employee, but i don't even care. life is good now. i've found my potential and it's all good from here on out. **thanks to all who read this (or tried). i really hope more people like myself get the treatment they deserve.**",adhd,0

i just don't suicide because i love my mother so much that i don't want her to feel guilty and sad for the rest of her days i know im broken, and i want to keep going cause i want to think that there is happiness in the future, but i dont know what to think anymore, i dated 5 other girls after the one i loved cheated on me, i ended it all with each one by one ""just dont talk to me anymore"", that happened everytime, these girls, they made me feel like i was doing wrong by being with them, like they could do something better, and at the same time i didnt feel something at all now i don't know what to do, i feel like my life is in danger, i don't know if im even going to make it to tomorrow, the feeling of sadness and remorse immerse my body everytime i think about ending it all, but at the same time, i don't see any light at the end of this tunnel, it is just an empty void, endless void thanks for reading, this is a throwaway account so don't worry if i don't reply or post anymore, i'll not commit suicide, i kept that promise since the first time i tried. have a good day and remember, you worth something, even if you feel just as bad or worse than me, you can do it, they'll be happiness for you in the end.",depression,3

c4c501f0-5ecd-433f-8a0e-3e4a5ef756a0,"i'm fighting depression, and i will win.","kind of a long one but here goes. i am depressed, probably for about 6 years now. i came to terms with having it in the last year or so, and i've been getting better since then. i still have such a long way to go, but seeking help for mental health issues does not always go over well in the military. so instead, i'm going to tell my story. feel free to make whatever comments you will. i'm pretty thick skinned and will honestly just ignore any comments i deem negative, while taking in the positive. at the beginning of my senior year of high school, my life was going amazingly. i was spending all my time making music in bands i'd formed with my best friends, and dating a girl i'd liked for years, despite having much stronger feelings for her best friend. i was close with my family, and it felt like nothing was ever going to bring me down. fast forward to the new year, and both of my bands fell apart. seeing as how it was something i had worked on night and day for 5 years, it was especially crushing. i graduated at the end of the semester, still dating aforementioned girl. two months later, i turned 18 and a week after that, my girlfriend took my virginity which was amazing. a month later, the biggest change of my life happened when my mother came to me at 1 am and asked me if i could come into the living room and stay there all night to keep an eye out for my stepfather. (he had played the role of father for me since i was 3 and even adopted me, so by all rights, i considered him my bona fide father.) i was obviously confused, and my mother explained, too mortified to show emotion, that she discovered videos of my sister and her friend bathing and dressing/undressing on his phone. he had been taking them for months by hiding his phone at planned times. she confronted him, and he left without much argument, but took his handgun with him. i laid awake all night, with just a baseball bat to try and use should the need arise. to make an attempt at brevity, what followed over the next year was a series of every member of my family (my mother, brother, sister, and myself) being both stalked and periodically confronting him while waiting for the law to do something. after a few months of that, i knew i had to leave my hometown and preferably take the girlfriend who had stood by me through all of this with me. i enlisted, and left for basic a little less than a year after everything transpired. i left behind friends that cared for me, and a family that was fighting an insurmountable battle, and still regret that to this day. i thought i would find solace and structure in the military, but the stress that it puts the average member through only compounded my emotional situation. i married that girl sometime later after learning at the end of basic that her best friend, who i never stopped caring for, was pregnant and going to get married to her boyfriend. as a caveat, i did feel like i loved her more than her friend, but at this point in time i'm not certain if that was ever true. about a year after that, my stepfather finally got his sentencing. 23 years on 12 counts of sexual misconduct with a minor/possession of child pornography. the next few years were relatively uneventful. i drifted further apart from friends, of course and have had a lot of trouble making new ones in the military (my career field is very dog-eat-dog.) my wife and i finally had a child together, who has honestly been my greatest source of happiness ever since. my marriage is great now, but i still feel deeply for the other woman, despite never acting on it. to make matters worse, i learned recently that my stepfather won an appeals case, and is due to be released from prison this december, and is basically free to stalk my family again, and i'm too far away from home to be there to support them. he's significantly bigger than me, and i always felt intimidated by him, and have recurring nightmares of him which take a great toll on my mental health. that's basically it. i'll answer any questions, but i'm really looking for some support or advice about what to do with any of these situations.",depression,3

9ecbba07-9212-4285-a661-c2277df54dbb,"""people with depression don't know how to be sad""","hi. long time battler with depression and psychotherapist here. i just thought i would offer something from my own personal struggle with depression that may or may not help others. the topic quote ""people with depression don't know how to be sad"" came from a non-psychological book i read recently (shantaram by gregory david roberts). at first i recoiled from this as quite the oversimplification, as i'm sure many of you have - but the more i think about it, the more it feels true to me. depression literally comes from the word ""depress"", as in push down. the more i work with my own depression, and the more i work with clients with depression, the more i see that often people who suffer with depression were taught to depress ""negative"" emotions from a very young age, usually grief and sadness, but also subsequent anger. when one doesn't feel entitled to one's natural emotions, they are ""depressed"" and turned inwards. the biggest thing that has helped my depression has been learning how to grieve. it is like a river that must flow. and for me, depression comes when that river is blocked by a self-inflicted dam. when i shut myself down, numb out, run away from feelings, that is when the depression comes on. i have had to learn, and teach myself, how to sit with my emotions, my feelings, moment by moment. how to cry. how to let my anger out, and neither suppress it nor let it burn others, but sit with it like a warm fire, and let others warm themselves by it as well. i can watch the process happen in me. negative input --&gt; escape/suppression --&gt; depression. but, if negative input --&gt; release --&gt; lightness. learning how to grieve took a few years of therapy and a healing intimate relationship. that relationship is now over, and i am having to really up the ante as far as consciously grieving goes. i literally have to make myself cry sometimes so that i don't shove it down. a huge revelation around my depression is that so much of it has, and continues, to stem from loneliness. so that, too, must be sat with, grieved, processed. and only then do i feel able to actually reach out to others and let others in, as opposed to isolate and ""hibernate"" alone. it's freaking hard. especially when you are taught as a child that you are not entitled to your feelings. just some food for thought.",depression,3

2c325446-ca82-41f8-bf4b-172085af6f19,part of my reasoning for not wanting kids is so they won't have to deal with their father's depression.,"over the past few years, i feel as if i've come to conclusion that i'm going to be child-free in my life. unlike most of the people over at /r/childfree, though, i don't dislike children. i actually think children are pretty awesome, and i'd love to be a father one day. but every time i think about that, i just think of how irresponsible that would be. i haven't done nearly enough research into the subject as i'd like, but from what i've read, at least some cases of depression are hereditary in nature. there are other mental illnesses that my family has a history of, and thankfully i haven't shown any symptoms of them, but this one is the big one. i don't want to subject anyone else to this suffering. i don't want to bring someone onto this earth who's going to be stuck with this terrible disease that just eats away at you. i don't want my child's mind to be their own worst enemy. i don't want anyone to suffer like that. and beyond that, how can i know that i'll be responsible enough to take care of this kid? what if dad has one of his days where he can't get out of bed and function? what will my kids think about me? will they be ashamed of me, their own father, because he can't care for them? provide for them? love them? i don't want my kids to have to deal with my bullshit. they shouldn't have to suffer because of me. i don't dream very often anymore because i smoke a fair amount of marijuana, but one of the most recent dreams i've had (maybe a month or two ago) just kind of wrecked me emotionally. i was older, a man in a house with a wife and kids. and i was packing my things to go off to a mental hospital. i don't remember the faces of my wife or my kids, but i remember their voices. and i remember that at some point, my wife and i were sitting down with our kids while she explained to the kids why their daddy had to go away for a little while. i distinctly remembering one of the kids saying ""oh, he's going to the hospital because he's sick? and he's going to get cured?"" and then sometimes when i'm awake i'll think of that kid speaking and just feel awful. yes, son, daddy is sick. daddy's going to the hospital to get better, because that's where sick people go. no, i don't know if the hospital is going to cure me, but maybe they can help me. and the thought of all this happening just makes me sick. i don't want my kids to risk experiencing this because their dad's head isn't right. i don't want them to suffer through this disease how i've suffered. i've promised myself that i'd only have a kid if i knew that i could provide the right environment for them, but i don't know if i can ever provide that.",depression,3

7f7150f4-778d-4669-861e-e2a9c7338a4a,i just made a plan for my future...,"so i’ve been extremely suicidal for the last few weeks. i get depressive episodes (bipolar) and this particular one was triggered by losing my job. i have a week left at work before i leave and i was adamant that i’d kill myself on that date. the future was foggy and dark. i saw no hope. i couldn’t see past this pain. i still can’t, really. but i called my mental health team and got put on some medication last week. they have been challenging my black and white thinking when i say that i have no choice but to die. they said that if i have no hope, that’s okay because they have hope for me. this morning when i woke up, i felt... different. i got out of bed with more energy than usual and i finally did a load of washing. i went for a walk and i considered where i currently am, and where i want to be in my ‘ideal world’. i came home and actually cooked. a meal with protein and vegetables instead of bland toast without butter. i made my first cup of tea in weeks. i sat down, with a pen and paper, and listed my options from now, including ones i may not like as much, and suicide, with pros and cons for each. once i listed them, i wrote the process i would need to follow to access that option, and process-mapped where doors to that option may be closed, and where the option may become reality (e.g i attend interview, if successful, i proceed down that path, if not then that particular door is closed). i then organised my options into four ordered sections: best for mental health, best for future career, desire/enjoyment and ease of access. i now feel like i have a clear picture of possible options and outcomes, as well as the processes i need to follow to achieve particular options. i have more of an idea of what i want. i feel more in control, and positive about the future. suicide now seems a last resort option. i am optimistic that i can start the process to rebuild my life. it doesn’t need to be ‘this or suicide’. there are always other options. delve deeper and you can start to uncover them. hope this provides some inspiration to someone.",depression,3

(hint to dumbass senior mangement: don't write down the evidence of screwing someone over in an official document that has to be handled by the person the document is about. like i said, *dumbasses*). i did the analysis, and on financial and economic terms, i am not making the same level of income i did in 1989 in terms of real dollars. so i haven't even managed to break goddamn even. i've gone fucking backwards. so when that fucking douchebag doctor making his millions every fucking year, more in one year than my entire goddamn lifetime, says stupid shit like the usual hollow, positive things ""it gets better"", ""hang in there"", ""don't give up"", ""pray (&lt;--the worst and most useless)"", it makes me just want to shit fire. that asswipe, and all of them like him, don't have a goddamn clue what it's like. on their worse day ever, they've still done more than i ever will. i mean, when a homeless guy has a girlfriend or wife, and i couldn't get laid in a whorehouse with a fistfull of $100 bills and pot, i'd say the contest is clearly callable. no, i don't need goddamn therapy. therapy is nothing more than some overpaid fuck taking shitloads of money for the sole right to try and mind fuck me into believing shit isn't shit. well, shit is always shit. rolling shit in powdered sugar doesn't make shit a jelly fucking donut. i'm not depressed for depressed's sake. i don't have a gorgeous wife of 30+ years, or anything close. i don't have kids. i don't have any family. i don't have success, money, or possessions or anything like that. i don't have friends, i don't have things to do or enjoy (they all take money). i just wake up, shower, work for nothing, shit, sleep, and permanently repeat. i'm mad as fucking white hell and i have been for a long time. here's the therapy i need: a rewind on life, with things that work out and not emotionally crush my spirit and will. enough money to be able to be a viable option for someone that isn't a coke-riddled road whore. enough accomplishment to give myself a sense of pride instead of failure to stoke shame and embarrassment. and given that the rewind on life isn't possible, and at my age, even if someone got knocked up by me (ha-right), i'd likely croak before the thing was born. so i'd take even just the last one. so i told the asswipe: ""y'know what'd make me have a better disposition? elizabeth hurley pulling up the driveway in a new ferrari to take me on vacation in monaco"". but as the old saying goes, ""shit on one hand, wish in the other, and watch which one fills up first"". thus endeth the rant.",depression,3

73f7fcd2-f97f-4378-ae43-b0a1601bd66b,21 yr f tried to hang myself,"look i understand a couple of things. 1. that most likely no one will read this. 2. that i am going to sound either crazy or stupid. i am going to say this here anyways. i have not had anyone that i feel comfortable telling this too because of the guilt i selfishly do not want to feel. i have been dealing with depression much of my life and the other night i felt so numb. i had felt like all of the emotion was drained out of my body. for some reason hanging myself felt like something i wanted to do. i had no great master plan, but i was genuinely feeling motivated to see what it felt like to hang myself and actually do it. i went to my shower door and tried a couple of jackets (they were all that i had that could work) and ended up finding this pink jacket that used to be my mom's and tightly double knoted it around my neck. i had multiple attempts cause the jacket was too stretchy, but was able to make it work. for some reason it felt right to be doing this. i stepped off the shower seat and felt the relief of the breath being taken out of me. i was easily able to stop the process and go back up on the step because it was not a far drop. i kind of wish i went through with it. at the same time i don't really want to go to hell if that's a thing. my whole life i have been chubby. ok maybe not to everyone's standards, but for mine. i have never liked my body and it only got worse as i got older. i eventually resorted to throwing up and bingeing. i am 21 now and had stopped for a while after high school, but ended up doing it again. i am fatter than ever and really do not like any part of how i look. i feel like i should just end it. i have a hard time seeing how i am suppose to live if i cannot even feel comfortable in this fucking skin suit i have to wear all the time. i got botched back when i was 18 and find that my body feels less like mine than it has ever felt. after three surgeries and 30,000 i still look fucked up. i hate being ugly, but have already drained the accounts of any money left to fix the issue. i feel like i am already too old and that my body is already ruined. i have scars where i thought i would never have them. i have always been obsessed with romance novels. ever since i was 13 they were my escape. those books and life in general taught me that romantic love will make a person happy. i have never had that. i am fearful that i never will. i feel like the people i liked always had someone prettier and less complicated to be with. it is never me. i think back to high school when i felt like i met the man of my dreams. he had a wonderful aura. he was tall and funny and nice and had the prettiest brown eyes that i had ever seen. his music taste was even more alternative like mine. he even loved the outdoors like me. i remember at the beginning of the semester we were texting until i heard two other girls in my grade liked him. once i heard this i stopped texting him. i knew that one of these two girls was the epitome of the perfect girl. she had the long blonde hair, was smart, and was skinny. i could never compete with her. i wished so bad to have been his date to prom. i know it may sound so childish to other people, but all i can think was that i was too stupid and too damn ugly to get the man i wanted. i still think about him sometimes to this day. i feel like i missed my shot. every other date i've been on since high school has not even come close to this dude. i even considered trying to go ""play for the other team,"" but i know that's not my real issue. i can't seem to feel that i do not have an other half and that someone already took him. ever since my parents divorced my senior year it feels like everything went down hill. i miss my old home. i miss having a home. now both my parents are remarried and happy and i cannot seem to get myself together. i feel that they will be sad if i left, but fine without me. i am just a waste of money for them. all i have done is spend all this money on surgery and health care to try and fix something that most likely can't be fixed anyways. i feel like all i do is take from them and am not even helpful in the slightest. i miss my old home. i miss my dog who passed away. i miss seeing her play in the yard. i miss having my family together. i miss my cat that passed away. i wish i would have spend more time with her and my dog. i feel that my family is gone. both my parents and even my brother have changed so much. i feel that i am the only one that has not changed. maybe i haven't had a boyfriend because i am meant to die a virgin. maybe i am just possessed or something. sometimes i blame it on being an aquarius, but i think we all know its not that. maybe all of the things i've lost over these couple of years was meant to happen so i could just go too. i needed to get this all out. it has all been weighing on me ever since i attempted to hang myself. i do not know the exact thing that came over me that night, but it scares me. i feel like it could happen again. what is the point of continuing on if it does happen again? i could not bear the idea of leaving a kid or even pet behind if i were to go through with suicide in the future. i feel like i have no real shot at life. to me this is all because i am just not pretty. i am sick of being fat. i am sick of feeling my inner thighs touch and my double chin. i honestly do not know where to go from here. i am still going to try to survive and do my fucking homework, but i am not sure when the

""i promise you i don't have any cash, you can have my cards, you can take whatever you want, just please don't do anything to me. my daughter is right here. please don't do anything to me."" and by this point, i was bawling. the entire time during the conversation he stayed behind the wall but had his head peeked into the doorway. he paused as if he was thinking of what to do next and said: ""i won't do anything to you, but i have to take something."" and just proceeded back into my living room where i could hear him rustling again. i assumed he took one of my boyfriend’s consoles (all of our electronics were sitting there in the living room) i was so frozen i didn't want to move or make any sudden movements in case he came back to her door. i just simply wanted him gone. i immediately started texting my boyfriend to call the cops because we were getting broken into. after a minute i called myself. i didn't want to risk him not getting my texts in time, and i just knew i had to get someone there as soon as i could. i have no idea when he actually left but i know he couldn't have been there any longer than a minute or so, because i waited till i didn't hear any more noise from the living room before i called 911. all i could hear was the crickets from outside (assuming he just left my door open) cops arrived and we looked through the living room, but nothing seemed touched, my purse was even sitting in the same place on the couch, in plain sight (granted all the lights stayed off during the incident, i have a bright basketball court across the street that illuminates the room and nightlights around the house). i simply figured he would've gone for way more things and it was surreal how nothing was moved. after about 5-10 minutes that's when the cops asked about my missing desktop from our desk and it clicked for me, he took my laptop and a/c adapter off the couch. i didn’t get to see his face due to the darkness, and he was wearing a ski-mask. he had on a hoody and jeans which i could at least see from his silhouette/night light in the hall next to where he was standing. i mentioned, in the beginning, i think it was one of our maintenance guys only because two of them were in my house not even 5 hours prior and knew my front door was extremely flimsy/not secured. the one maintenance guy i think it is had the exact same stature as the burglar, was the one banging on my flimsy door hours earlier and since then has not been able to look me in my eye the two times i've made it a point to say hi and ask how his day was (to get a feel of him). when he was in my house helping the other guy with the work order he was very quiet, only said two things during the 30 minute visit, while the other guy was very chatty/shared his experience and what his goals were for the complex (we just literally got new management two days prior to the break-in) at the time i thought he was just shy or a quiet person (i can empathize) but now that this happened i feel like he was scoping out my apartment and had a sketchy/odd demeanor. i am trying to give him the benefit of the doubt and just not be in my head, but it’s the only thing that logically makes sense right now. i live on the 3rd floor and don't really know anyone out here like that, plus i've lived here for 3 years and nothing like this has ever happened. the cops suspect i was targeted, and although i live right in the front of the complex, across from the leasing office, i'm on the 3rd floor, that seems out of the way for a random break-in. the biggest thing that’s holding me back from being at peace and not so anxious to be in my home alone is what was his motive (besides the obvious)? why me, of all people? why didn’t he just grab the shit he wanted from the living room and leave, why did he creep down my hall? i’m glad he didn’t hurt us and just stole a laptop, but what do i do if it happens again, may it be him or someone else? what if we don’t get so lucky next time? the office replaced my door frame (since he broke in using his shoulder, the cops suspect) and i now have three new locks and will be buying a reasonably priced alarm i can put on my door. should i just go to the guy i suspect it is and let him know i know and demand he give me back my laptop or i’ll turn him in? what should i do, if you were me?",anxiety,1

bdb552df-e1c6-4389-9a42-16ba5b919af0,just a little something for those having a rough day/week/month/year. . .,"hello, reddit! if it's not too much to ask, i'd like to please have just a little bit of your time, especially if you are someone who is going through a rough patch right now. thank you! here's a little background: i am feeling so down right now. i had never in my life before felt pain this intense, and it hit me like a train. i feel so broken. it has been a while since the incident happened, but i am still grieving. i haven't--and i couldn't--stop crying at night. but then i thought about you guys. and i couldn't help but empathize with the people out there in this world who feel the same way as i do right now, especially those who are going through so much more. it's unfair that a person should feel this way. *now, i don't know a lot of things, and i do not claim to. we all come from different walks of life. but here is just a little something for each and every one of you who are down in the dumps.* whatever it is that you're going through right now, i know it hurts. *you* know it hurts. you feel it. people will tell you that your problem is far too minuscule (or at least compared to theirs), but it doesn't matter--it still hurts, and it's still crushing you inside. don't listen to them. we all take pain differently, and your problem isn't any less real than theirs. know that it's okay to acknowledge the pain. take some time to grieve. sit with your feelings and just let it hurt. but, also, please know that you are capable. you have the power to get through this. you *will* be okay. you can get yourself back out there and live your life. there is a whole world out there. . . it's just unfortunate that you're trapped in *this* particular hellhole that's tricking you into thinking you're just another brainless gear in this big machine. it's not your fault; society just works that way. but you could promise yourself--right here and right now--that you'll try to break free from it, and strive for the kind of life that you want to live. you *are* capable. you *will* be okay. maybe you made a mistake. maybe it was a huge mistake. learn to forgive yourself first. only then can you move on and start anew. if you're feeling trapped in your routine, try to break from it by switching things up. it could be the smallest things--maybe you could sleep on the other side of your bed. maybe you could try rearranging the furniture in your room, and make it feel like a completely different place. maybe you could *decorate* your room. maybe, instead of eating cereal every morning, you could treat yourself to a nice chocolate muffin twice a week. maybe you could take a different route to work/school, preferably one with a nice scenery. it all sounds silly, but i assure you that there is joy to be found in small things like that. if it's not working, try experimenting some more! please know that you matter. your life is valuable. remember that time an acquaintance said something nice that brightened up your day? or that one time a waiter gave you an extra drink free of charge? or that one time a stranger did nothing more than flash a warm smile, but it still made you feel good inside? could you imagine a world without people like them? well, these are common people. and *you* are one of these people. you may never realize it, but you've *definitely* had a positive impact on this world, just by existing alone. . . and you have more to contribute. in one way or another, we are interconnected. and your existence is important. please understand that. i have to admit, these are things i don't *always* realize, so the fact that i'm giving out these pieces of advice may come off pretentious and hypocritical. i am also aware that others may disagree. but please understand that i have nothing but the best intentions. what i want is for you all to take care of yourselves and be well, because i, too, am in pain and feel that no one deserves to be in this position. now, if this post isn't quite helping, i hope you find whatever works for you. regardless, i wish you guys the best. i say all of this from the bottom of my heart. i may not personally know you, reader, but i will be sending my love out to you. know that you are loved. i wish i could do more, but this is all i have to offer. we will get by, no matter what.

( this was a huge step) 2. hang out with friends and do this a lot ( if you don't have any just go to the nearest coffee shop drink your lemonade and watch people passing by 3. eat mostly clean but if you crave something just do it once or twice a week. 4. meditate at least 15 minutes a day ( especially when times are bad is when you need it. ) 5. go exercise. i can't stress this enough it has helped boosting my mood and my self - esteem a lot 6. sauna, jacuzzi, massage . do those, sometimes the tension we feel is trapped inside of our bodies and we really need someone to get it out 7. force yourself to go outside the house everyday even walking 5 minutes. 8. rest and do this a lot, don't find this as an excuse to proscastinate but really take a break you might be doing too much and some things people do efforless we put to much energy and struggle to do it and that burns as off. just rest. play your favorite video game, have a beer if you like, talk to someone just take a break. 9. talk to people: just say hi and contunue your day, this will help you understand that people are not monsters and they won't bite you. 10. always remember that you are awesome and your life it's the most precious and important thing you have and at the end it's you vs you, bad times maybe here and you think now that they won't surpass but do remember and believe that it will get better and it **will** you just have to help yourself. edit: i hope this helps, take care guys please! edit 2: oh oh oh and don't forget to be patient!! that's really really important.",anxiety,1

i read everything i could, how to win friends and influence people etc.. i became better with girls quite a lot but i still am awkward in person a lot of the time, they just dont percieve me as an awkward guy because of how i look. i just come across as someone who is a bit full of himself or something. i've been called an asshole quite a few times for that. sophomore year i became better, i began to realise weed was no good for me, i realised that my friends liked me for who i was, and that the silliness i had from highschool, was still there, i began to study more and showed my intelligent side (i go to a highly ranked university). i began to smile, appreciate others, care to make good friends. the fear of people no liking me based on how i look is going. i am still pretty self conscious which is something i need to erradicate as soon as possible. i'm entering my junior year at college, with set goals. i need to 1) lose my virginity 2) get a beautiful girl as my girlfriend. i've never had a girlfriend, the thought of rejection would have buried me with my low self esteem and extreme boughts of anxiety. the anxiety tells me i am worthless, that i will never get a girlfriend, that such things are not for people like me, its terrible, i can often not sleep and toss and turn a lot. im still very insecure about my looks, i look in the mirror a lot to check if i look half decent. many people think i am a narcissist or something because of it. i wish i could download all the experiences other guys had during highschool, and college, and be able to feel that different mental/frame outlook. it must feel so great to believe so many girls are into you, to have that mental outlook of confidence, to know u can always do and achieve, and get beautiful girlfriends. i know this is impossible, and i will have to have these experiences. wisdom/experience cannot be derived from books, and only experience. i know i must fail a bunch more times with girls quickly before i succeed. the anxiety bouts i have at times are severe. i don't take any medications tho nor do i want to ever. i get depressed and look around my room or wherever i am to things i can use or where i can hang myself. end my poor little life. i have to convince myself i am good looking again, i am worth a lot, its my own mental frame that is fucking me over, crippling me, that i have so many friends who are very cool at university who i could be even better friends with, i could play less games with girls and be open/honest and genuine with them. i just fucked it up with a girl i had a huuuge crush on and that is killing me rn, and has been for the last few days. i feel so shit, the anxiety is ruining me. i have a shredded/muscluar body, i'm a pretty short guy at 5'8 but i've learned that is inconsequential as it is the confidence that comes with height that is so attractive (tho i know height is much sexier). i have a face like a less hot more cute version of zayn malik. but this past month i stopped working out, began smoking a lot when the anxiety trips were high. my diet got shit. i still look the same, i haven't lost any of my gains/look very fit, but i am weaker. i've stopped smoking so much now only like a cigarette a day and i'll get over this girl soon. junior year is where i want to come in strong, use all my wisdom from the last 2 years and realise my potential. to make all the moves i can with girls, be fun, be genuine, accept myself for whatever i am, be happy, smile, show interest in others, and accept that i am a good looking guy, i am very very lucky to look and have the life that i do, and if my mental frame is gonna keep fucking me, its not acceptable. i am still a slave to my anxiety but i am fighting, each day i tell myself don't just don't start the thought cycle where i am useless etc.. sorry for this long essay to those of you who stuck around to read my life story.",anxiety,1

685f14a3-921f-4aa2-9743-62c2ff52b221,"i'm going to try vitamin supplements to aid anxiety relief, and update here with my results.","hi guys. going to try some vitamin supplements to see what improvements may occur. specifically for anxiety i'm going to try a magnesium supplement. it will be the floradix liquid magnesium because i hate tablets personally. i will try different times to take it, as i hear magnesium before bed helps sleep, though taking in the morning/day might help me feel the benefits throughout the day. i will also be trying floradix liquid iron and vitamin formula; in the hopes to aid my issues with fatigue. i think most of my fatigue comes because of anxiety, as it can really tire you out. it contains iron, vitamin b2,b6, b12, and c which are all supposed to aid reduction of fatigue. i'm going to make this a semi experiment and will update here as i progress - maybe it will help others! supplements arriving today, will let you know my first thoughts soon. **edit** *results* day 1 magnesium 250mg - took before getting into bed, fell asleep within half an hour (usually 1+), though highly likely influenced by poor sleep the night previous and busy day) the morning after i felt pretty refreshed, but quite dopey and have felt this way the day so far. again it may be tiredness generally, but anxious? barely at all today, except right now a tad, no matter where my thoughts go my anxiety level is normal. [floradix liquid iron &amp; vit formula; c, thiamin, riboflavin, b6, b12, - taken my am dosage, haven't yet noticed much change but may take a few days doses to see difference. after saying this my stomach got really painful and irritated, i think because of the iron, so the pain invoked anxiety massively. maybe just need to be smarter with taking it closer to eating times. day 2 after yesterdays stomach cramps from the iron supplement, i decided to stop taking it, just couldn't handle it yesterday. also, after taking magnesium for the second day in a row, this brought on some horrible side effects which invoked my anxiety massively and gave me serious worrying problems in my stomach, chest, and brain fog, etc etc. so unfortunately i went to the a&amp;e/er after speaking on the phone to a health line that advised me to do so. i had an ecg and a blood test. i had an electrolyte spike in my heart rate because of the unnecessary magnesium in my system, but the bloods came back fine so i was safe to go home and just rest it off. i feel much better today after a day of resting and its pretty much out of my system now. but **lesson learnt: consult your gp/doctor before attempting supplements, you might just end up overtaking what you do not need and causing yourself more problems.** soon i will go to my doctor to get the ok to take vitamin d, which is something i have had bloods for as being deficient in. i am only just discovering its connection with anxiety/depression and other similar issues i have had. i am *no longer* going to start trying different supplements to see what works unless its naturally through my foods, which greatly dilutes the effects and side effects. end of thread. until i begin vit d supplement.",anxiety,1

5515f31f-f804-4f06-bc03-5081cbc40294,update: has anyone ever walked out on a job because of their anxiety?,"so earlier today (8/30) i posted this: i have gad and i have been contemplating this for a while now with my current job. it is insanely stressful because of my chaotic micromanaging supervisor who is clueless to what is going on with her team. i also feel overwhelmed because this job is putting my husband through his graduate degree and i have been having panic attacks more and more lately. he has four more months until he is finished with his degree. this job is a contract position and the contract ends in three weeks. i do not want to extend it. i even want to quit today. just walk out and be done with it so i could free myself and have time to look for a job that i really want. i know that is very risky financially, but finances don't seem to create as much anxiety for me as workplace stressors do. maybe i am lying to myself about that, i don't know. so i'm wondering if anyone else has had this sort of experience. victories? regrets? any sort of empowerment that came from saying enough is enough and making a drastic change even if it was risky? it's a complex set of feelings - the anxiety, coupled with the drive to not let it define me, but also knowing that i may be, in some ways, running away from my problems if i quit. i just don't know what to do. update #1 (8/30): i did inform my supervisor that i did not intend to extend my contract. she promptly told me she wanted today to be my last day. that was it. so i'm out of a job two and half weeks earlier than i expected to be. i feel mostly in shock and a bit numb. in general not good. no panic attacks yet. we will see what the next few days bring. hopefully many job interviews. update #2 (8/31): been off the job less than a day and already have a phone interview scheduled for next tuesday for a project manager role that is a step up in responsibility and pay! prayers and positive thoughts appreciated! i also plan to start looking for something part time soon and maybe will even look into working for and/or creating my own start up. i do find that i may not be right for the corporate grind sort of jobs. but for now i just need to find a way to pay the bills so i have to keep my options open. i will definitely be more careful about which offer i accept next though!",anxiety,1

a5556e8f-981d-4479-90bc-3120d6c8c510,experienced my first panic attack yesterday,"i've had anxiety for as long as i can remember but never experienced a truly crippling panic attack until yesterday. i have an interview for my dream job on tuesday and while interviews always make me anxious, i've been feeling pretty confident this time around. yesterday i spent some time preparing answers to potential interview questions and after an hour or two of productive work i decided to take a break. i was feeling excited and hopeful, confident that i had done more than enough to prepare. no more than 5 minutes later my chest tightened up, my heart started racing and i felt chills all over my body. initially my mind was free of anxious thoughts, however, physically i felt as though i was no longer in control of my body. the feeling of no control eventually lead my mind into its own state of panic. i took a klonopin and went to lie down to try some breathing exercises and relax. usually when i'm feeling anxious, lying in bed is the only thing that makes me feel ""safe"" and relaxed. unfortunately, it backfired this time. lying motionless made my rapid heart rate much more noticeable and only added to my panic. at the height of my attack i recalled someone mentioning that coloring was the only thing to bring them peace. lacking any supplies, i thought about walking to cvs to buy an ""adult"" coloring book and pack of colored pencils. i don't know how i managed to get myself out of the house, but once i stepped outside into the fresh air and sunshine, i began feeling a small sense of relief. i don't know if it came from the fresh air or the fact that i somehow regained control of my body, but the ounce of relief i felt was undeniable. as i made my way to cvs, my mindset slowly began changing from its state of overwhelming panic to a state of comfort. i didn't feel quite like i could see the light at the end of the tunnel, but i knew it was there and slowly approaching. recognizing the difference helped ease my mind and slow my rapid heartbeat. i walked into cvs and made my way to the school supply section. the shelves were completely ransacked and mostly empty and my panic began creeping back as i realized back to school is upon us. i scoured through the disarray of what was left and managed to find the last coloring book (lucky for me it came with a pack of colored pencils). i went straight to checkout and headed home, protecting my coloring book as if it was a winning lottery ticket. when i got home i plugged in my noise-cancelling headphones and turned on some therapy music and got right to work on a heart-shaped bouquet of filling in the last flower made me feel as though i had left all of my anxious thoughts and feelings on the paper and replaced them with a colorful bouquet of happiness. at first i was skeptical that coloring of all things would help, but it did! it was incredibly helpful in changing my focus from my anxious thoughts to careful concentration of coloring. i would absolutely recommend it to anyone who needs to distract themselves from their anxious thoughts. even writing this post a day later has been therapeutic and has made me realize that things do get better. i will definitely be keeping a coloring book and pencils handy in case of another emergency! update: thank you everyone for all of your support! just had the interview and i think it went well! the questions were surprisingly difficult but i think i answered them to the best of my knowledge and handled it with grace. at the end, before i could ask about ""next steps"" the interviewer said they would let the team know about our call and she would contact me later this week with next steps. i'm hoping this is a good sign, but i will keep you posted! thanks again for your support, /r/anxiety! &lt;3",anxiety,1

a97dcd6b-4e5d-455a-9548-e3aca87c4bab,a tip from my therapist: “it’s not your anxiety. it’s the anxiety.”,"like many of you, i’ve been pretty much crying myself to sleep every night. sometimes i don’t even know why. hell, most of the time i don’t even know why. i feel like i destroy relationships around me. a few moments ago i frantically went through my contacts to see if there was someone who i could call, and i didn’t know who. so i sat there at work and just found a moment to turn around after smiling all day, and just burst out into tears mumbling “i want to go home”. i don’t even know what that meant. even if i went to my house, it’s not like it would go away. my boyfriend is in japan for a while, which is dangerous because if i get a bad episode, it’s really easy to mass text (via “line”) my problem. and i don’t even know what my “problem” is. it’s even worse being raised a christian, and being one by choice, because most of the christian advice is to just “let go and let god”. then i beat myself up and feel like a failure, because i can’t “let go and let god”. my closest childhood friend in the world who’s like a brother to me is soon to die from cancer. you know what’s fucked up? anxiety feels worse than my sadness for my dying brother. 10x worse. i would constantly make it a part of me. my anxiety is tearing my relationships apart. my anxiety is causing me to lose my mind. my anxiety sometimes makes me want to kill myself. it’s all my fault. my therapist taught me to say *the* anxiety. it’s not my anxiety. anxiety does not define who i am. anxiety is not the first thing everyone notices about me, even if i’m convinced it is. i am actually a very strong, sassy, stubborn person. *the* anxiety is a clinical condition that simply comes in and tries to take over who i already am. *the* anxiety is more manageable than i think, because one of my more defining qualities is strength. it doesn’t belong to me. some days it feels stronger than other days, but it’s not mine and i refuse to let it linger. you have anxiety. but it’s not yours.",anxiety,1

ec6b263f-2139-4dd6-bfa5-38981568186b,tools and strategies i've learned in therapy to handle anxiety,"hi everyone! i just want to share some strategies that i learned from my therapist. i’m diagnosed with aspergers, and my therapist think that i have either general anxiety disorder or ocd. i’m also pretty sure i suffer from depersonalization. going in therapy has helped me a lot. i was a wreck when i started seeing my therapist 6 months ago but now i’m much more stable. i still suffer from anxiety regularly and the purpose of these tools is to handle anxiety – not to remove it from your life which i believe is impossible. everyone on this earth deals with anxiety at some level. # important the strategies and tips below is my interpretation from the talks with my therapist. this has helped me – it doesn't necessarily mean that it will help everyone since all of you probably have different types of problem. **i want everyone who reads this not to takes these tips not as absolute facts that will work for everyone**. as i said, this is my interpretation and not necessarily the words by professionals. i wont include a tl;dr because it's important to read everything to get the full context. \--------------------- • first and foremost, **take help from a professional if you have the opportunity**. i can’t stress this enough. for many years i’ve tried to ”solve” and analyze my problems in my head. trying to understand why i feel this way and how i can battle it. but this is hard to do by yourself, at least for me – although some work by your own could be helpful. i’m not saying you should stop reflecting or problem-solving, i’m just saying it will be a lot easier if you have a coach along the way. • acceptance. this is important. for the last 15 years i’ve not felt ”like myself” in my head. but worrying about it or trying to get rid of the feeling only makes it worse. try to live with it, play along and do the best out of the situation. don’t try too hard to ruminate about going back to ”your old, happy and real self”. this is the new you at the moment and you have to make the best out of it. anxiety is like tinnitus or a headache: annoying and unpleasant as hell, and for some present all the time, but focusing on it constantly doesn't help. my therapist said i should think the following when i'm unease or worried: ""i feel as i feel now, and it will we as it will be"". the point is not to do things with the intent of removing anxiety or any doubt, because then the body/mind think anxiety is dangerous which is not. but don't take this advice too hard – if you really need to calm yourself down, do it. this advice is, like all the others, not carved in stone. • do the things you would do if you didn’t suffer from anxiety. this is really hard to do for some, but my therapist also said to me: ”what would you have done know if these recurring and intrusive thoughts or feeling/state wasn’t a problem for you?” • **exercise! this is crucial.** you don’t have to run for 1 hour every day, take small steps. start by walking for 15 minutes a couple of days if that is what you can manage. i try to run 30-60 minutes 3-4 days a week and it has done wonders for me. i hated running but signed up for a 21 km run and therefore i had to exercise so i would be able to participate. since then i loved running! exercise is proven again and again to give your brain enormous benefits. • challenge your fears. this tips should be taken with some caution: take really small steps. people with a phobia for spiders doesn’t start with petting a spider, they start by maybe just thinking of spiders. i was really worried about mental health issues, but i went to see the joker movie at the cinema (with my dad) and while it was hard to watch, i felt much better afterwords. also, i’m afraid that everyone who reads this post will misinterpret my advices and, as a result of this, will start to feel even worse. but that’s why i’m should do this: exposure is the key. • don’t argue with your negative thoughts. i don’t know if this is backed up scientifically, but my therapist advised me to do this. example: i’ve always worried that i might be homosexual (although nothing wrong with that, i'm just worried about how people would react). i often make up arguments for/against that possibility. if i see a man that i think is handsome, a thought might pop up that says *”this must mean that i’m gay”*. instead of responding with *”it doesn't have to mean i’m gay, it's normal to think that people of the same sex look good”*, which is the most logical thought, i now try to think *”yeah, maybe it means that i’m gay, future will tell!”*. i’ve had these thoughts for 15 years and i’m still not sure of my sexuality – the point is that thinking about it and looking for proofs hasn’t helped me, so it make no sense anymore to counter the negative thoughts. the point is to not feed the troll which is anxiety. try to treat your anxious thoughts like a bully: fighting it only makes it worse, try to become friend with it instead. according to a book i read during therapy, a theory (not necessarily true) says that the anxious thoughts keep coming back because you get so relieved when you counter them with more logical and positive thoughts. the author described it as if you would wearing shoes that are too small, just for the feeling of relief when you take the shoes off. this was and is extremely hard to do for me. at the beginning, i was overanalyzing this exercise to the extreme, so if you to find it too hard to understand i would recommend you to stop it, if it makes you feel better. but with some practice you can learn it too. **the key here is to accept uncertainty**. • everything will go soooo much easier as you get better. i started therapy when i had hit rock bottom, and it felt completely impossible at the beginning. i saw everything as danger – [i got a book from my therapist that would help but i was afraid that it would only make me feel worse, so i googled and googled for negative reviews of the book/therapy. but, as i felt better, these kind of exercises almost became child play. when i feel good, the negative thoughts either don’t pop up or bother me at all, but when i’m down, they feel like the indisputable truths or things that had to be solved. my therapist said to me that the negative thoughts feel so true because of the anxiety it gives me. • anxiety is a false alarm, a feeling that something ”must be wrong”. as someone on reddit wrote: ”having anxiety is like having a broken spider-sense that is constantly warning you of non-existent danger”. every time i feel unease, i try to just say to myself that this feeling is anxiety, instead of overthinking and analyzing it. • patience! you may have heard that word so many times in this context, but it's for a reason. it could take years to feel better, but if that's the case, it will be worth it. don't give up if you doesn't feel improvements after two months for example. **finally, some encouraging words for you all:** • i don’t know how many times i thought that ”this feeling/state will last forever. i can’t ever go back to normal”. but i was wrong everytime. maybe you feel pessimistic about yourself and your future, and find it hard to believe that there is a better tomorrow, but it is possible. • think of those youtube-videos of stray dogs being rescued. the dogs are in a complete mess, afraid of everything and maybe has given up on life. but they get rescued, and later in the videos you can see them extremely happy, jumping around and playing with humans. see that journey as a goal if that helps you. **it is possible to feel good again.** • remember how many times your heroes in movies was at a point of no return? when they were surrounded by enemies and an escape seemed impossible? but they always find a way to escape and win. i hope this applies to you too,, **even if you are suicidal with no support from family, friends or a therapist.** i wont say that everything always works out in the end for everyone (because life isn't a fairytale), but i think it's important to have that mindset when you feel like shit. [you may feel like the captain america who thought he would face thanos army by himself in but we all know how it played out. \-------------- if you have questions or criticism i will try to respond. you might find contradictions or even factual errors in this guide, as i said i'm not a professional and i'm still trying to handle my anxiety. but hopefully this will help someone at some degree.",anxiety,1

5db9f72f-0a98-4085-8d8d-0d83049259ac,my therapist had me try brainspotting on friday. holy shit.,"i've had anxiety ever since i can remember. the past couple years it's gotten to a point where it was getting so bad that i was developing depression, ruining relationships with friends and family, not leaving my apartment, etc. it was causing a lot of strain on my relationship as well. so after years of saying i'd go see someone.. i finally started seeing someone about a month ago. last week she wanted to do a brainspotting session with me to see what kinds of mid-brain emotions and feelings we could uncover and release. and see how my anxiety manifests, and where, as we learn to identify my thoughts and find potential triggers. it was intense. i remember when she first explained it to me, i was skeptical. i didn't understand how that could possibly do me any good or even get a reaction. but it did. we did that for my entire session. i thought about memories i had long forgotten about. felt my arms get painfully hot, then go numb. my temple throbbed where i get migraines. i cried - a lot. i found it hard to swallow and breathe. and then with i'd say about 10 minutes left, i felt relief. not just from those things, but actual mental relief. i felt it leave through my fingertips. i smiled. i still was having thoughts of these people and events, but then went from being negative and hopeless to appreciative and grateful. my anxiety over the weekend was basically non-existant. i actaully made an effort to see friends. i felt energy. i felt like a literal weight was lifted off of my shoulders. i'm not sure anyone else has done this yet, or what their experience has been with it. but i'm interested to hear if you have. and i know it's a fairly new practice, but it's one i'm excited to explore further to see what else can be uncovered and hopefully let go of.",anxiety,1
f33104a6-e639-4d17-b667-d0a1082104a2,"i need to share this, because i feel that you will all understand.","on july 2nd i left my long time so. the main factor, or rather the straw that broke the camel's back was the fact he didn't understand my anxiety and would worsen it with thinhs like his idea that holding me down during panic attacks was brilliant. i told him time and time again that it would only make things worse. but he refused to listen. he had been doing this for about 6 months, but it got to a point where he was causing them out of nowhere. i started medication 3 months ago and hadn't had an attack, aside from when being held down, in weeks. but that night he insisted i be held down. i immediately went into full panic, and tried pulling myself out of it. but he wouldn't let go, and he kept yelling and pulling harder. i was struggling as he progressed things, which only made me pull harder. he slammed my head into the ground and held me down until my arms were covered in bruises. [my eyes were and [my forehead had a huge goose-egg to go with my bruised he spent years convincing me i was broken. that he was helping me by doing the things he did. he convinced me that my anxiety made me crazy. that he didn't have to answer to me about anything. if he disappeared for 4 hours longer than he said i was insane for checking up on him. i was so convinced i was in the wrong. that he really did have my interests in mind, and i was too far for help. since leaving him i've never felt better. i realized just how much anxiety he caused, and that anxiety doesn't mean i'm crazy. it means i care more, i'm more cautious, that i think before i act. it means i will listen to you, and validate your feelings. although i'm anxious about all of the court things, and feeling like he's going to come for me, or that my career will be ruined before it even begins, i'm able to recognize that they may not happen instead of being bombarded and told i'm insane. i have someone who listens to my thoughts and talks me through them instead of calling me stupid. it's so freeing to be anxious, because i don't feel like i have to hide it until i explode. edit: thank you all for the kind words of support. it's been a rough time, but i feel so much happier in general. i reconnected with a guy friend of mine, m, and we've begun a semi-relationship. he's much more understanding, and tries to help me cope with my anxiety instead of ignore it. he finds my neurotic habits endearing, and he's been around to listen to my stresses with this situation. i showed up at court today only to find my request for a deferred prosecution was granted. with this he will be unable to contact me or get in any legal trouble for a year. if he gets so much as a speeding ticket he will be back to court for this. essentially i just wanted to let this die for now. i have my junior year of college coming up, not to mention many other stressors and truthfully i just want to move on with my life. i'm ready to progress my relationship with m, to make new friends, and to live my life for myself. i will likely be posting more, as i'd like to speak to others about my anxiety when i have a much better hold on it. lately i've been able to see the build up and slow it down as opposed to being pushed into an attack. so i will likely chronicle it. :) thanks again all!",anxiety,1
3a4467bf-58da-4b39-b254-9fd9e26f9ead,nobody can beat your anxiety for you,"one thing i've learnt over the years of trying to fight my anxiety, is that no matter how many times you think or say to yourself ""this isn't fair!"" ""why should i have to beat this?"" ""why me?"", it doesn't change the fact that you have anxiety. your anxiety will be as bad as it is and won't get better unless you do something about it. now don't get me wrong, i'm not going to say ""just get over it"" because believe me i understand just how hard it can get. the panic attacks, the nausea or being sick, the fear. constant headaches, stomach aches, muscle pain, insomnia, paranoia, depressive thoughts, self harm and so on and so forth. i get it, i really do. for over a year i spent most of my time in my bedroom, i'd go to the doctors, i'd go to therapy, i'd take meds. but nothing would help. i thought i was an exception to rule, i thought i would never get better. well let me tell you now, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. but you have to get there, you have to push yourself every single day to get things done. yes, you will have panic attacks. yes, you will fail a lot at the beginning. yes, it is going to be really hard and unfair. but, you can do it. you have to do it. take a walk everyday, longer and longer each time to get used to being outside. meet up with a safe friend and ask them to help you in uncomfortable situations. talk to your doctor about medication, even if you're scared of taking it. they will understand and will know how to help you. medication can be rough, but once it kicks in it can really help. exercise. i know everyone says it, but it really does work. even just walking everyday is going to make you feel and look better, and it does wonders for health. don't drink or smoke, or take illegal drugs. they're not helping long term and could very well be the cause of your anxiety. give therapy a try, be it talking therapy or cbt. and actually follow their instructions and suggestions. if you don't try, you won't know if it will work or not. if you do try, at least you're doing something. my last tip, never give up. never let the anxiety keep you at square one. because you are literally the only person that can get you off that square. there will be bad days, there will be good days. but hold onto your progress, nurture it, be proud of it. good luck and much love to all! edit: with some feedback from people feeling like i'm generalising or offering my advice as fact, this isn't a post for everyone with anxiety. this is a post that i am hoping will help some who are struggling to accept their anxiety, or who are apprehensive to try and change their lifestyle around anxiety. not everyone will benefit from this, and i appreciate that. take this post with a pinch of salt and apply to your own situation. anxiety isn't forever, but be prepared to change to make it that way.",anxiety,1

a2bd644e-d510-49df-8703-99b0ea984e57,my neurofeedback experience- my anxiety and depression is basically gone,"i thought i would post about my experience with neurofeedback in treating depression and anxiety. a little background, i've always had underlying depression and anxiety, but didn't start dealing with it until about 4 years ago when i kept having issues getting to work and having panic attacks. my social life suffered too, pushed away a lot of friends in that time, wanted to be alone yet i was lonely. i've done therapy (still do), tried several different medications, and had my ups and downs with my symptoms, but earlier this year, things got bad. i missed work several times, was very hopeless about the future. i even looked into going on disability just to not have to deal with anything anymore. at least that's the short story. my therapist had just hired a person that specialized in neurofeedback treatment and she recommended i try it since i was struggling so much. i got more information on it and decided give it a try, i was desperate. the way i understand it, they match these sound waves to match the frequencies of your brain, then they adjust the frequencies to ""calm"" your mind. overtime, your brain responds to this and changes. i would ruminate a lot, and get emotional about it, panic...well this like slows down the rumination. this treatment is used for other mental conditions like adhd and addiction (which i also have issues with). i can't remember the exact type i did, but i believe it is a slow wave form, perhaps infra-low frequency neurofeedback. at the beginning of each session, not sure if this common though, i would do some slow breathing first and practice breathing deep. then, she (my specialist) connected these electrodes to my head, and she put a movie on and played these sound waves that respond to your brain patterns. the movie is just to occupy your time, each session was 30 min. my specialists would ask me questions about how i was feeling and adjusted some things (the frequencies?) to tailor it to my needs. i had some weird effects early on, like i would feel itchy sometimes, or i could feel pressure in my head. but after a couple of weeks i was starting to feel better. like, while i still wasn't happy with some things in my life, my anxiety decreased drastically. i started it in february and by may my outlook on life was changing, i was more optimistic and didn't dread the future as much. i have concluded my treatment for now (august), but i am a changed person. i haven't had a panic attack in a long time. i am more social, and i am actually looking forward to work. if i do get down or worried it usually has to do with my missing a dose of my medication (viibryd). i haven't even taken a xanax in months. i wanted to post this as a recommendation for those who are struggling. if i could be a commercial for this i would lol. i can't believe that it worked for me. your brain can change! with anxiety and depression it's like the wiring in your head is just messed up, this like tunes it back up. i see a lot of posts that remind me of myself on here (or perhaps my ""old self"") and wanted to share this in case it could help anyone out there. of course, naturally i do worry that it won't ""stick"", but according to the research, it should, but i can go in for a ""booster"" if i need to. my insurance covered it, i had to do it twice a week at first, then dropped to once towards the end. talk to your therapist or doctor and see if you can find a specialist in your area. tl/dr- neurofeedback saved me from the grips of depression and anxiety, it ""calms"" your brain down. i hope it can help you too. talk to your doc or therapist about it. if you have questions, i'll try my best to answer them. take care everyone!",anxiety,1
93f456ef-d572-4f5d-80d0-07d0b5ddabf3,replacing your distorted thoughts,"the first step towards managing your anxiety is to be able to identify your anxious thoughts. to help you do this, please read the linked post about identifying problematic thinking patterns: [be aware of your distorted keep a journal to help you identify what types of anxious thinking you engage in. think about which types of negative thought patterns interfere with your life the most and focus on those. **have realistic expectations.** the goal is not to completely eradicate your anxiety. the goal is to manage it. expecting to get to a place where anxiety is no longer a problem for you is setting yourself up for failure and a form of perfectionistic thinking. remember that even though you struggle with anxiety, you can still be happy. you can still live an interesting, pleasurable and rewarding life. your life doesn’t need to be perfect in order for you to be happy. once you have good idea about what types of anxious thinking you engage in, you will need to generate new thoughts that will eventually replace the old, anxious, thoughts. the goal is to use your conscious mind to beat the new thoughts into your stubborn subconscious using repetition, practice, and effort. this will take a lot of work and time, but that’s ok. 5 tools to help you generate new thoughts: **1) generate new thoughts ahead of time:** write down what your anxious thoughts are, and then beside them write down what you *wish* your brain would automatically think instead. next time you are in the situation that makes you anxious and your subconscious starts being a dick; use your conscious mind to repeat the new, positive, thoughts, which you generated earlier, over and over again. (obviously just do this in your head, don’t do it out loud or you will look insane) **2) probability flow chart:** think the situation through by making a probability flow chart about your anxious predictions. more often than not, we underestimate our ability to cope with “bad situations” and we overestimate the likelihood that these situations will actually happen. make a flow chart: identify your anxious thought. what is your anxiety telling you about the probability that your prediction will actually come true (probably 100%)? what is the objective probability that it will actually come true (probably &lt;5%)? really focus on how the objective probability of this “bad” thing happening is much lower than what your anxiety is telling you. ok now lets say your anxious prediction actually does come true. continue the flow chart. what is your anxious prediction about the situation that would follow? assign objective and anxious probabilities to the new prediction. now what if this one comes true? continue on the flow chart assigning anxious and realistic/objective probabilities to each new link in the predicted chain of events. continue on to show your mind that is it overestimating the likelihood of these anxious predictions. since these are dependent events, the probability of the very worst thing possible actually happening, (the prediction at the bottom of your flow chart), actually coming true is next to zero. this tool is slightly abstract so here is an example: [probability flow chart (math geeks: for fun, determine the final probabilities using the rules of dependent events for both the realistic probabilities and the anxious probabilities. notice that the final probabilities are incredibly lower than you would think! even for the “anxious” predictions) pro tip: really think about the “so what if this does happen” before you move on to the next prediction. you’ll often realize that very few things are as important as your anxiety makes them out to be. **3) method of extremes:** generate new thoughts by asking yourself and writing out answers the following three questions: 1) what is the worst possible outcome of (the thing i am anxious about)? 2) what is the best possible outcome of (the thing i am anxious about)? 3) ok, what is the most likely outcome? this one is a nice quick way to get your mind thinking more rationally by looking at positive extremes for balance. often us anxiety-ridden folks focus on the first question (the negative extreme) without giving any thought to the other two. get yourself thinking about the other two. make conscious efforts to answer the 2nd and 3rd questions. the more conscious thought you spend on alternative views, the more your subconscious will begin to accept these views. the brain is an incredibly malleable organ. **4) three method:** recognize that what you are anxious about doesn’t really matter in the greater scheme of life by asking yourself: will this matter to me 3 minuets after the situation is over? will this matter to me 3 weeks from now? will this matter to me 3 months from now? will this matter to me 3 years from now? very few things effect people’s happiness for longer than 3 months. here’s a ted talk about it: [science of personally, three minuets after the situation i was anxious about is over, i don’t think about it at all anymore. while you’re in the situation focus on the fact that in 3 minuets (or hours or weeks or whatever) this won’t matter at all to you. **5) change your ideas about the anxious situation.** instead of looking at the situation that makes you anxious as something to be feared and dreaded, look at it as an opportunity to practice dealing with your anxiety. decide that it is an opportunity for you to conquer your fears. we all know that exposure to something leads to desensitization. *remember:* changes do not happen over night, but if you are persistent and make a significant effort to change your conscious thinking, your subconscious will follow. more tips: avoid caffeine, exercise vigorously, and don’t fall into the trap of numbing your anxiety with alcohol.",anxiety,1

d809cdfa-66fc-4898-9314-cb6f722829ab,i took a shower and it was glorious,"since the beginning of december i've been struggling with a couple of manic episodes. as the month went on i noticed a spike in my anxiety, but it was around the holidays and i was able to get a handle on it for the most part with my xanax prescription. after a negative experience with my father during the holidays, my anxiety only increased until by january i couldn't get a handle on it. it developed in to full blown paranoia. i was (and still somewhat am) convinced i was being watched, especially from the strip of woods behind my house. every time my german shepherd would let out a guard dog bark at the back door i would lose my shit. if i needed to go to the grocery store i would go either very early in the morning or very late at night when there would be virtually no one there. if i turned to go down and aisle and saw another person there, i was overcome with a sense of uncomfortable dread and would wait in hiding until i saw them leave the aisle and go elsewhere. this lasted me all of january and i shamefully only showered maybe two or three times from the beginning of december to the end of january. i kept my hair tied up and didn't brush it unless i was going to shower. my first shower since maybe all of january or at least the middle of it, and when i went to take my hair tie out it just kept getting more tangled. i had to have my fiancé cut it out of my hair, and when i tried to unwrap the bun it wasn't unwinding. i asked him to look at it and he was shocked and told me my hair was completely knotted together. luckily he was able to untangle it without having to take scissors to it. and let me tell you, even with a detangler brush the layer of knots on top and underneath my hair were ruthless. my hand cramped up during it and my eyes may have teared up a couple times but i got through it. unfortunately, for the past week and a half i did not shower and did not brush my hair. same results as far as my fiancé having to cut out another hair tie and unknot my hair, but that shower was heavenly! i got the shampoo super lathery and just scrubbed every inch of my scalp. then i let a deep conditioner sit while i washed my body and was able to do a second wash after i rinsed the conditioner and used my medicated body wash for my body acne (chest, back, and even upper arms!) i put all my products in my hair- about 8 totally i believe- and exfoliated my face and neck and put on a super moisturizing mask before doing my normal skincare routine. i'm going through a manic episode now, and was up all night but i was able to take a shower and get ready early enough to actually be on time for once since my best friend/maid of honor was coming over so we could go to my mom's and get my save the dates addressed and ready to finally send out, seeing as they were supposed to be done end of december/early january. i also did 4 hours worth of much needed cleaning and decluttering. i feel very accomplished and refreshed but at the same time a little invalidated because most of this most likely wouldn't have gotten done if i wasn't manic. still, my hair is soft, my skin is glowing, and my save the dates are finally done! hopefully after my appointment with my psychiatrist on tuesday, i can get on the road to getting my moods and emotions to a manageable level. if you read this, i hope you are having a wonderful day, and know this illness doesn't own you!",bipolar,2

""hello this is 9-11 whats your emergency?"" ""i dunno i just dont feel right, wait you know what never mind"" *click* oh shit oh shit now they are coming oh no? what do i do? pace around this apartment doing laps...pull that picture frame off the wall i know this place is bugged... they have been listing to my dad and i's conversations..they are onto me. i then look down from my 5th story loft window and see two sheriff's pull up. fuck fuck they sent sheriff's...not a fucking ambulance... they are here to take me away... i'm not going away. at this point i take the elevator up-to the roof top 14 stories high. receiving multiple phone calls, all ignored now....wait what the fuck are you doing...well i'm going to step over the railing and just see. i stood there for a good ten minutes until the security guard of my building tried to grab me, i was moving around the side of that building so quick, i dunno how i didn't fall. i back into a corner. once a cop comes through that door i'm going! i'm fucking going! 6 cops come through and i jumped. i must have hesitated because one cop hand turned to 15 cop hands as i'm dangling over the edge. fuck this they are not getting me...let me go..struggle.. then i bit a cops hand to let me go pushing my legs against the building away from them. but you know what they got me, they fucking did. and i am grateful for that. they reserved a room for me at the hospital first on a 3 day hold (5150), then on a 14 day hold (5250). day 11 they released me to my father. toxicity report negative, had been sober 3 months before that because things didn't feel right. losing you memory is a hell of a thing, i hope it never happens to me again.",bipolar,2

72f1a7a1-126e-40e4-9dbb-0fb6a6f84708,"athena, ancient greek goddess of... bipolar-hypomania? apparently so!","i have long held a fascination for how ancient cultures tried to describe concepts they couldn’t yet scientifically grasp through myth and how those mythos affected the development of human culture. hellenism (ancient greek religion, actually still practiced btw) in particular has held a special place in my heart since i was very little. recently i was looking more into athena. most commonly known as the goddess of war, specifically the wisdom of battle strategy and taking up arms in defense of one’s home, unlike ares who loved bloody war for wars sake. she was also however the patron deity of “arts and crafts”. one of her most famous myths is the one where the skilled but vain human weaver arachne dared say she could out weave the wise athena, who (in the myths) was the one who invented weaving in the first place and *gifted* that knowledge to mankind. of course for this arachne was turned into a spider and forced to “weave” silk webs forever. we must remember that in ancient times, arts and crafts weren’t a childhood pastime but entire professions providing vital necessities to society like clothing and kitchenware. so being the patron of such important activities made her patron of entire wealthy city-states like athens, overflowing with some of the most brilliant minds in history. while reading several of the classic epic poems written by ancient greek scholars, (and translated by modern british ones) there was one that finally talked more about that artisan side of her than her prowess in battle and the wording of it really struck me. “and on my dark’ned mind pour thy pure light in measure unconfin’d, that sacred light which beams eternal from thy face serene, inspire my soul with thy own blessed and impulsive fire, invigorated hence by thee we find a demiurgic impulse in the mind” i cropped a few lines out as the epic poems are peppered with constant flowery-nicknames for the gods, i just cropped those bits to leave the important parts. “demiurgic” basically means; possessed by a deity to fulfill a task for them, btw. so, is it just me, or does that sound like they were describing the hypomanic creative spark?! “and on my darkened mind” depressed maybe? at least without a “lightbulb” idea spark for sure. “pour thy light in measure unconfined” that means infinite clearly, like when an entire project concept just *hits you*. “blessed and impulsive fire” sounds manic to me, impulsive? yet somehow “blessed”? manic. then the whole “demiurgic impulse” is quite literal once you know the words meaning. and as someone who crafts and makes art while hypomanic (and often *only* while hypomanic) i have often described it as the project “not letting me rest until i’ve brought it fully into this world”, i can see how someone 2,000 years ago might think they had been possessed to create something. then take that train of thought farther, they probably explained the depressive slump after a manic high as “athena no longer being with them” and i can totally see how they thought that. looking back at my episodes, i can 100% see how they thought the hypomanic energy was bestowed by a god, and how the emptiness of a following depressive episode would feel like the god left you a hollow husk. how they also describe her as an intense fire throughout the poem marks how manic episodes can go too far, being too filled with “the divine” logically drives mortals insane. how many of the most prolific ancient greek artisans were really bipolar? was athens an ancient hub of bipolar’s coming together to essentially worship hypomania? i’m thinking, quite probably.

0f16be25-4723-4d9c-81af-df3f0b0f8dc8,i have a question about drinking... advice?,"i'm bipolar and add, and have been receiving treatment for a whole two years now. yay. still working on finding that magical treatment that will make me a normal functioning human being, but for now, i'm mostly able to do life things. mostly. anyway, i'm on lamictal, just got bumped up to 250mg, and i take 30 mg of prozac, as well as 10-30 mg of ritalin, depending on the day. i'm turning 21 this month, and decided it would probably be prudent to ask my psychiatrist whether it would be safe to mix alcohol with my medication. wouldn't want to have any weird side effects while drinking, right? she essentially went off on this weird sort of doomsday rant that because i was on lamictal, an anti-seizure medication, i would most likely have a seizure if i drank. she kept saying a lot about how bad it was, and how it wasn't worth the risk at all, and i'd be much better just never touching alcohol, ever, because i'd probably most likely definitely would have a seizure. it was all very doom and gloom. now, i've never had a seizure in my life, and have done many stupid things around lamictal before. i had a bad doctor about a year and a half ago who refused to return my calls and emails, leaving me without lamictal for a good two months, and i had to cold turkey it once my medication ran out. i was told later by a different doctor that that was one of the worst things to do, because i could have gotten the stevens-johnson syndrome and died. she was pretty doom and gloom, too, about lamictal. this summer, i visited a different country that had lower age restrictions on alcohol, and i did in fact drink one night and get drunk the next, just for fun. i had no ill effects, that i could tell, though i did apparently wake back up and go do some weird blackout drunk shit (i said something weird to my mother, like ""i have to feed the dog,"" while fiddling with my luggage). i don't remember that part, which is a little frightening for me. lesson learned, don't get blackout drunk. i told my doctor about this, and she said that i got lucky, and that it was an exception, like i shouldn't even look at it as lowering my chances for this seizure i'm obviously going to have if i sniff a margarita. however, i see a lot of you mentioning drinking, while not always in the healthiest sense, and i never really hear much about seizures on this subreddit. my question is, do you think that i'm like, a super-seizure danger if alcohol and i are in the same room? i honestly don't think so, but if i talk to my therapist about it, she'll go talk to my psychiatrist, and then i get another doom and gloom lecture. i'm not planning on going on a bender as soon as i turn 21, but it'd be nice to be able to go and get a drink or two on friday nights. if i'm basing off of that one night i actually got drunk, and the night before, when i also drank, i have a relatively high alcohol tolerance that will keep me from getting too drunk off of one or two shots. anyway, thank you for reading this far through my ranting and sidetracking, i really appreciate any advice. i don't want to have to turn into some sort of anti-alcohol gal, but i'm not exactly intending to go off getting wasted every night. tldr: can you drink while on lamictal, and not have seizures?",bipolar,2

0322993b-0281-461b-9e8d-fe04bf0b550a,"""i am one of the lithium generation.""","the phrase comes from the deceased zoë schwartz, 27 years old, who committed suicide by train rather than consent to treatment for her manic depression, or bipolar disorder as it's now known. i learned about her in stephen fry's ""the secret life of the manic depressive,"" and it's not an exaggeration to say that this docuseries has had an indelible mark on my life. here is the section where zoë is discussed: according to her parents, she was vivacious, full of life, with a master's degree in economics, a talented musician,...and as we know from her journals and those that survived her, deathly afraid of accepting her illness. she devoted ten years of her life trying to hide the symptoms of her disease, most of all from herself, afraid of admitting that she had this disorder. according to her mother, her pride kept her from accepting proper treatment. she wrote in her journal ""i don't want to be one of the lithium generation."" i empathize with her fear. when, last october, i realized that i have something more serious going on than just anxiety, one of my first concerns was ""how is medication going to affect my mind and my personality?"" knowing that proper medical treatment, almost always including a regimen of medication, is absolutely crucial for bipolar disorder, i was terrified. i have family that has been diagnosed as bipolar, and i've grown up with them in the throes of their illness. looking back, i've suffered symptoms all my life, including a brief break from reality as a kid, and i believe i should have been hospitalized. i wasn't. instead i was diagnosed with adhd and depression and given snris, which i believe contributed to a manic episode that scarred me as a child. her parent's wish, in the documentary i linked, is that stephen fry would be able to do something about the fear, the stigma that killed zoë, that kept her from accepting lithium in this eminently treatable disorder. i was profoundly touched by her story, her fear of medication, her fear of losing her personality, of having it change...and deeply saddened by her senseless death. though she did not live through her illness, though it claimed her life, she is kept alive by her story and her impact on my life and on the lives of the 225,384 individuals who have watched this program. in writing this i hope to carry on her parent's wish, to bring purpose and meaning to her death, and to directly attack the stigma that i carried so strongly prior to my diagnosis that kept me from seeking treatment all through college and into my adult years. i started lithium today. i am part of the lithium generation. i am taking action and taking steps to ensure my health, protect my finances, my sexual health, my sanity, my life. this is a disease that i am determined not to succumb to, and i have zoë to thank, in part, for her story. though her life was tragically cut short, i believe her death was not in vain, because it's inspired me to raise my voice and fight the stigma surrounding mental health, with the voices of those that have reached out to me that are also struggling with this illness or a variant of it. this is the next step on a journey that began in october 2017. november 15 i was given a provisional diagnosis. january 15 my diagnosis was confirmed, and i started lamictal. and today i started lithium. because i believe that my life is worth fighting for and preserving.",bipolar,2

df91a66d-9cbd-4eb1-9e8c-248495329eaa,update from the girl who couldn't sleep.,"i felt afraid of myself while i was manic or depressed and blacked out so i went to my local hospital. they said even though i was there voluntarily the only way i could get treatment is if they baker acted me. it took them four hours to clear me medically and get me over to the facility. i then waited three hours to give them my insurance card, seven hours to see a councilor. the councilor i saw didn't help, just apparently wanted to admit me even though he didn't tell me at the time. i was then told i had to spend the night because it was late and the doctor couldn't see me until the morning. keep in mind i got to the hospital at nine, got to this facility at one. i was sat in a room with everybody else waiting to see someone. one guy was schizophrenic and just kept yelling to himself. another couldn't keep his hands to himself. lots of yelling. they took all my belongings including my bra due to the underwire and gave me a gown to cover up with. i got my period midway and just had to sit in it because i had nothing else to change into. they made us sleep on plastic bunks on the floor. no pillows, only a blanket and it was freezing. i waited until the morning without sleeping at all and waited and waited and waited. i went 24 hours without seeing a doctor at all. i starting asking if i could speak to someone because i just needed my medication so i could get cleared to go home. i knew if i just talked to the doctor and explained my situation they would write me a script and send me on my way. after the third person telling me they had no idea about any kind of timeframe of seeing a doctor and 'they'll call you when they call you' and nobody else in the room getting seen, i finally had someone look it up and tell me the councilor recommended i be admitted and they were waiting on a bed. been there 30 hours at that point. i asked to speak to a councilor or a doctor or a supervisor or anyone and they got very frustrated with me telling me that they already told me what was going on and that i just didn't like their answer. i went to just go sit back down but some guy passed out in my seat with my blanket so i just sat in the corner and cried for an hour. finally a nurse got me a supervisor and i explained that i had been there 32 hours at that point without seeing any doctor. i told her what was going on and that i really did not think there was any reason to admit me and that i really just needed to see a doctor. she told me that she would check and see what was going on and that i would definitely see a doctor soon and that she couldn't guarantee i wouldn't be admitted but if the doctor said i didn't need it they would write my scripts and let me go and hook me up with consistent out patient psychiatry. i saw the doctor within twenty minutes. she asked me to list the reasons that i didn't want to kill myself and i did. i explained what happened with not having a good psych, the rape, and trying to get good medication, the panic attacks and blacking out. she ended up prescribing me an anti-depressant, mood stabilizer, something to help me sleep, a three time a day preventative anti-anxiety, and something as needed for my anxiety. i don't remember any of them except the trazodone to sleep, but i'm really hoping this works. i've never been on this much medication before but i'll try whatever helps at this point. i'm resting now after a long shower. i'm trying to make myself wait until at least 9 or 10 to take my night time meds so that i can sleep through the night for the first time in months. i'm happy i got medication, and i'm glad i can now hope to get better, but that facility was a piece of shit. i waited 32 hours to see a doctor. they left me in that room with a tv, hard chairs, a blanket, without most of my clothes in a robe, surrounded by other patients who just kept yelling and fighting. i had to fight for a cup of water and ask to use the bathroom. basically sleep on the floor. they held me for a good day and a half without giving me help. i was so tired and stressed out by the time i got home i was so out of breath. i'm so glad to be home and i never, ever want to go back to one of those places. it was so miserable. anyway, just wanted to share my experience. really glad to be home.",bipolar,2

2ec81eea-04b2-4d53-a843-8887480df26c,another lithium post,"i was formally diagnosed in january of 2018 and began the arduous journey of trial and error with medication(s). i was actually symptomatic/crazy for at least a year before that (bp2). so it's been an awful couple of years. the illness, and the ups and downs of trying different meds and combinations, has cost me more than one job. and going through all of this has virtually destroyed my confidence in multiple areas of my life including my social life. my doctor has a very conservative approach (not necessarily a bad thing). so we tried multiple other medications in different combinations, month after month. but nothing was the breakout drug or combination of drugs that made light miraculously appear at the end of the tunnel. finally i guess he got to a point where it was time to at least try lithium. and i am so thankful. now, i'm not arguing that people who are struggling should demand treatment with lithium. and i've only been on it for a month. but so far i've felt a significantly positive change. i'm still on another drug as well and we probably don't have the lithium perfectly dialed in. but, again, i am so thankful for this stuff and how (so far) my body has tolerated it with little to no side effects (again, so far). it can be scary to read about the potential issues and side effects associated with lithium. i'm definitely having to drink more water and be a lot more careful in the sun and the heat. and i *hate* having blood drawn. but so far it's all worth it.",bipolar,2

bffe1914-9055-4e10-a11f-05c1b054989f,the hell that is bipolar disorder from both sides,"i was first acclimated to this disease through my mother. i did not understand it at the time, but i lived alone with her as she went through her first psychosis. i learned all about evil spirits and witches, and was traumatized--eventually hallucinating the evilness she talked about. she eventually went away for a long time, and i lived with my dad. we didn't talk about it. she came back months later, depressed, and was diagnosed. she went through psychosis again when i was 18. i became: caretaker, responsible. i felt love for my mother like i never had before. i became close to god, began biking everywhere, became a vegan. life was perfect, life was good, i was on top of the world. i didn't know it at the time but the stress and fear that she would eventually die sent me into my first hypomania. i always thought that it had been the catalyst that taught me to be a good human being. i went from flunking out of college to become an a student, transferring to a prestigious school, running 5 miles a day, becoming a yogi. i was ontop of the world. i come home from college and she goes into psychosis again. now i give up, all the love and closeness i felt to god disappears. how could he do this to me? how could he make me go through this again after i had been so good? after i had done everything right?! a long episode of depression follow. binge drinking. misery. i lose friends. i spend 5 years trying to get back what i had lost. i did not recognize that i have the same disease as my mother, just to a lesser extent. i was diagnosed earlier this year. the world no longer makes sense. the narratives i had formed aren't real. they are all chemical misfirings, and my life has no meaning. god was a figment of my manic mind. hallucinations of demons and floating hands were a figment of my manic mind. the positivity i felt wasn't real, nor the bone crushing depression. my mother was with me on my journey, for the past four months, as i decide if i want meds or not, what meds to take. she has been worried sick as i can't get out of bed from depression. and now i think it's my turn to trigger her. she is becoming psychotic again. and it never ends. a constant replay of my childhood traumas coming back to haunt me, and now it is inside of me as well and i can never escape from it. thinking hallucinations are real is less scary than knowing they are not. and now they've stuck me in the middle of a story that i had no chance to write, because i've never been in charge. and i watch my mother get washed away again, wondering if she'll ever come back. this disease is devastating. it is devastating and it isn't fair. i can't see a way out anymore. i thought i had been navigating my way though this impossible storm but the whole time i never realized that i was carrying a cargo of magnets that yields my compass totally useless. i've only gone farther out to sea and i have no way to make it back.",bipolar,2

1740ad5d-df56-4c90-a2d7-f4849be2ff02,"donnie darko, bipolarity, and time travel","donnie darko is one of my favorite films of all time. if you haven't seen it, stop reading this, go watch it. it's on netflix. significant spoilers follow. also: i will be using ""manic"" interchangeably to mean hypomanic or manic, for brevity's sake. donnie is a dissatisfied, schizophrenic teenager in sleepy middlesex, anystate usa. up until a giant bunny rabbit named frank warns him that the world is going to end in just over 28 days. this prophecy seems to inspire donnie into taking actions that, he believes, will save the universe as it should exist, with him at the center of everything that transpires. until this happens, though, donnie's disillusionment with the simplistic schemas of life that are presented to him deepen, and his frustration grows. an outlet for this is his english teacher's class. ms. pomeroy, the teacher, assigned graham greene's ""the destructors"" to the class to read. in offering his thoughts, donnie says that, ""destruction is a form of creation... they just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart. they want to change things."" from being challenged with what is arguably difficult literature, from a thematic point of view, donnie is subsequently subjected by another teacher, kitty farmer, to a self-help guru's model of life, based on two things: fear and love. because, you know, 10 year old boys wet the bed out of fear, but stop because of love. /s when asked to rate a moral dilemma on this incredibly narrow scale, donnie objects. i think the entire exchange is worth reproducing below: &gt;donnie: well, life isn't that simple. i mean, who cares if ling ling returns the wallet and keeps the money? it has nothing to do with either fear or love. &gt;kitty farmer: fear and love are the deepest of human emotions. &gt;donnie: okay. but you're not listening to me. there are other things that need to be taken into account here, like the whole spectrum of human emotion. you can't just lump everything into these two categories and then just deny everything else. woah. stop the presses. this really hit me hard. i've seen this movie several times, but this is my first time watching it since being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. and this really jumped out at me: **""you can't just lump everything into these two categories and then just deny everything else.""** early in my diagnosis, and even to a degree now, i tried to identify my bipolarity in everything i could. i'm feeling energetic, am i hypo? i'm feeling sad, am i depressed? i had an impulsive thought! is that a sign that things are developing? i feel energetic after drinking coffee! shit, i'm definitely hypo. and on and on. i've also seen this overidentification, this overanalyzing of what can be, and often are, normal human emotions and behaviors on the bipolar subreddits. and that makes sense why we would be so introspective: bipolar disorder is insidious, and it affects almost every aspect of our lives. but we are not manic or depressed. we are not euthymic or manic. we are not depressed or euthymic. it's just not that simple. it's unfair to us individually to ascribe every feeling or thought we have as due to bipolar disorder. it is, in a word, damning, and denies us our right to claim our own feelings and experiences as uniquely ours. the way i think about my mood swings is they're like a funhouse mirror: they take what i normally feel and experience and blow it up, distort it in a hundred different ways. but it's transient. it always is. that's the nature of bipolar disorder. doesn't it make sense, then, that emotions and feelings and thoughts that we have before an episode, that we may also have in an episode, and after, could just be us, and not influenced from the disorder? it is also damaging, i think, to try to define ourselves in terms of manic, depressed, or euthymic. ""i'm manic so i am doing..."" as opposed to ""i am in a manic state of mind."" defining ourselves, thinking of ourselves, as manifesting all of what our mood state outlines, or believing that because we are in a particular state of mind that we must behave manic or depressed, is another form of overidentification that is, i think, worse than overattributing our own experiences to the disorder. i've done this before, unfortunately, with more than just this. when i came out as gay, for a while i thought, ""well, i'm gay so i should be having sex with other men all the time, otherwise i won't be gay."" illogical and stupid, but that's where i was at that time. and i had a brief moment of that same kind of thinking when i was newly diagnosed bipolar, as well. i tried to identify exactly where i was and what i was feeling, and what was thus incumbent upon me to do or act because of my mood state. it's just not that simple. we crave order and structure. we need things to make sense, to know the rules, to understand them. however, when we receive our diagnosis and in every moment of self reflection afterwards, we are applying destruction as a form of creation to our previous way of thinking and seeing the world, seeing ourselves, seeing our illness...and trying to find a way to make it better. ultimately, defining ourselves **in terms of** our disorder is unhelpful and possibly ruinous, while defining ourselves...and understanding that we have an illness, and that it affects our behavior, thinking, and a whole host of other things, empowers us with the knowledge and understanding of what is going on when we are in the midst of an episode. most importantly, allowing ourselves the room to feel normal emotions, and **not** immediately ascribe them to bipolar disorder, is one of the kindest things we can do for ourselves. a major theme of donnie darko is time travel. i've often thought about my disorder, and my personal history. how it might have been different if i had been hospitalized as a kid (as i should have been), if i had been on the proper medication (or at least not on welbutrin), if i had been undergoing treatment in college, if if if... while donnie does manage to perform an act of time travel, saving the parallel universe and dooming his own, that is not possible for us. surely things would have been different if we knew of our disorder earlier and were receiving treatment sooner. our attitudes, our experiences, our perceptions, everything might have been different. but every day we travel in time--forward. and while we can't change the past, we can learn from it, our bipolar past experiences and our normal, human past experiences, and use them to tear the world apart...so we can build it better than it ever was before.",bipolar,2
7aec4993-533b-4226-925d-a16161641e48,"it’s time for change - if you’re in california, please read.","i want to lobby the state legislature to reform welfare and institutions code §§ 5150, et seq (involuntary holds- “et seq” basically means “and the statutes that follow”) i know, i know. hypomanic goals. hear me out. i have three primary reasons for this: 1) inadequate care of the actual acute psychiatric emergencies of patients— which i have heard plenty of anecdotal tales in addition to personal experience 2) the lantermam petris short act which created 5150, et seq was great for its time. it made it so that people could not be institutionalized against their will and there was a “due process” in place limiting holds to 3, 14, and 30 days and only under specified conditions. however, over 50 years later, these holds can be practically if not absolutely punitive or punishment. once you’re in, you can’t get out, and the more you plead your sanity, the more insane you are treated. “5150” is used nationally as a slur against mental illness. the entire statutory scheme perpetuates stigma while providing little to no valuable care to those who are subjected to the holds. 3) corporate greed and laziness. because hospitals can easily bill for involuntary holds, why try any harder to improve acute mental health care? patients are often put on 5250 holds (14 additional days) on these extended holds, we are entitled to a hearing within a certain time frame. hospitals will often hold a patient as long as possible and release them right before the hearing. (again, anecdotal stories and personal experience.) 5150, et seq needs to be shaken up so that these corporations can no longer rely so readily on the easy income of an involuntary hold. the law needs to be reformed to both hold them accountable and force them to change and adapt their business models to provide alternative services that give us patients dignity and agency. yes, i have thought this through a lot. i have been thinking about this since i was first hospitalized in 2009. then i finished my psychology degree. went to law school. became a lawyer. and i spend my days researching and using and criticizing all kinds of california law. 👏🏽👏🏽 i’m ready. so if you live in california, this is my request: if you are comfortable, please share your experiences, negative and positive, with involuntary holds. if you have been lucky enough to avoid involuntary holds with an alternative intensive therapy, you can share that, too. also i welcome any legal or policy insights whether you’re a lawyer or in the mental health field or just finished high school. bring them all at me. (anecdotes outside of california are appreciated too, but since it’s a state issue, it’s more effective to appeal to legislators with state stories. but feel free to share!) if this reads as a bit hypomanic, you’re probably right. i’ve considered spending an entire weekend just redlining all the statutes and shooting off packet of proposed law to every other assemblyperson in the state. (i had a great aunt i never met who apparently did virtually the same thing with state developmental disability law... successfully. so i guess i inherited a very specific kind of bipolar.) but i’m posting this because i told myself to slow down and get more input. i do have my own frameworks for changing the law in mind but i wanted to pause and try to see if i could get some open forum response on this. either post replies or pm’s are fine. if there’s a character limit issue, feel free to ask me for my email address in pm. thank you all for reading",bipolar,2

no friends, no family, just my boss. of all the people that know that i’m crashing and burning because i’ve reached out for help, he’s the only one that even concerns himself with me. he has been my boss for almost 6 years and i can honestly say he is more like a father to me than my own father ever was. i love that man to the moon and back for everything that he’s ever done for me. a week ago i attempted suicide. i just don’t have the ability to fix myself anymore, and i’m at a point now where i can’t see a reason to try. the harder i work at making a better life the more i lose. i’m so tired of living with the clusterfuck inside of my head and i can’t find anything to make me want to keep going. i got my deceased fathers gun and found the courage to pull the trigger but since i keep it loaded a certain way (that i’d forgotten about), it didn’t go as planned. maybe that was a blessing or maybe not. i don’t really know. it wasn’t just because of the boyfriend but a combination of everything in my life going to shit in a high speed downward spiral. i don’t have the will or the strength to fight this hard all of the time for nothing at all. today was my first visit with my therapist since october. i was barely there five minutes when i completely broke down and told her everything. ugly crying, shaking, hysterical breakdown. we discussed a few options and plan to get me medicated (she and my pcp do that as a team) then came the crisis watch safety form. it’s a list of things that i have to do like check in with her office at random intervals as well as respond to emails or phone calls from her also at random intervals. all of my prescription medication, over-the-counter medication, knives and guns, scissors, razors, or anything that i could harm myself with has to be given to someone preferably in my household so it can be locked up. i have to have supervision if i’m eating a meal that needs to be cut with a knife. no drinking or drugs which is fine because i do neither except my prescription medications, and i also have to give to people emergency contact information for suicide lines as well as the crisis lines for emergency mental help in my area. if my pcp calls me and to bring my prescriptions so that she can count my medications to make sure that i’m not abusing them i have to oblige. i have to keep all of my appointments with my primary care doctor as well as my therapist for exactly one month before this agreement expires. failure to comply with any of these things will allow her to request a temporary detention order for immediate involuntary psychiatric hospitalization for me. she still on the fence about putting me into an inpatient situation right now but she will make that decision when i go back to see her at the end of the week. the messed up part to me is that involuntary hospitalization scares me more than the fact that i tried to kill myself. it upsets me to know how far i’ve fallen from the days where i didn’t need to be medicated for my bipolar because i was able to take care of myself to keep it fairly well controlled. and now i can’t tell the difference between the bipolar and the real me. everything in me still wants to stop existing but i feel like if i could just keep going a little longer maybe it will get better. and then the realization hits me that i have nothing to go forward to nothing that means anything to me to drive me to go forward. i’m so overwhelmed that my ability to process anything logically has just stopped working. the last few weeks everything has been so emotionally charged that my rapid cycling is that an extreme high and i just want it to stop. i don’t even know what i am other than a mental illness because that is all that defines me anymore. i just want to be who i was before everything destroyed me but i don’t think i can find my way back to anything good.",bipolar,2

2b60c03c-8ca6-4026-b4ca-7b097ef13730,"hormones - cleaning, ocd and hypomania","a few days every month i get really into cleaning. for example, last night i checked the time at 3am and realised i'd been washing my mattress for four solid hours. the mattress was new last october. i have a mattress protector though there was stain from spilling tea and a few really minor marks from chocolate. i cleaned it all two months ago. it looked fine. i again cleaned it last night. today i decided that even though it looks fine i'll go buy spray bleach after the gym and get it really white. unlike my old ocd and hypomanic episodes there's no agitation, racing thoughts or irrational negative consequence if i don't act. instead it's relaxing and i listen to the tv in the background. at the same time nothing is ever clean enough. in the mindfulness audiobook i've been listening to the psychologist says that perfectionists can never be happy because perfection isn't possible. i know in the grand scheme of things extreme cleaning doesn't matter, though it's a passing fixation. i tried to sleep for half an hour and ended up making vegan caramel sauce for the first at 5am on a whim. normally i've been going to bed around midnight. anyway, i read this article about cleaning and pms that was interesting: ""the answer lies in the way estrogen and progesterone levels affect your brain. before our periods, our estrogen levels drop — causing serotonin levels to drop right along with it. as you probably know, low serotonin levels are behind a host of issues like depression, anxiety, and ocd, which is why those illnesses are often treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), drugs that try to get those serotonin levels higher. this hormonally-induced serotonin dip before our periods can leave those of us who are already prone to depression feeling extra sad, or even particularly negative about our bodies when we're pmsing. but that drop in serotonin can also make you feel a little obsessive and compulsive before your period."" ""but the drops in estrogen and serotonin aren't the only things that spur the desire to clean up. before your period, your progesterone levels also drop, which combines the impulse to clean with an instinct to ""nest."" we see this tendency manifest itself more dramatically in pregnant women, who in their later months of pregnancy have low progesterone levels — which often lead them to go into a frenzy of cleaning house and nesting in order to prepare for the baby. the pms-related drop in progesterone is a less-intense version of the same phenomenon. in her fascinating book, moody bitches, dr. julie holland explains why this happens: ""every month, when your body prepares for a possible embryo implantation, progesterone levels are building and causing a smaller form of nesting,"" she writes. ""toward the end of the cycle, a woman might become dissatisfied with her environment and obsessive about making changes in order to make sure the setting is appropriate next month for the burrowing of the embryo into the uterine lining.""",bipolar,2

(i mean, then it gets worse, then better, then worse than before, but then better again.) so last year i got hit by a worst episode of depression so far. i dropped out of university, i quit my job (it was shitty anyway), i stopped leaving the house. after a few months i was getting up just once a week to go to therapy and the therapy wasn't helping one bit. by the end of the year i was suicidal. it just seemed like a logical next step. but i am a single parent of a 4-year old malinois and i wanted him taken care of, so i decided to stage an accident. the money from my life insurance would be more than enough to rehome him and keep him well-fed for the rest of his life. so i told my family i'm going camping as usual, waited for the worst snowstorm to hit and then went to the woods. when the temperature dropped to -20 c, in the middle of the night i tucked my dog in and went out to lie down on the snow. but my dog didn't want to stay in the tent by himself. he kept whining, barking, scratching, finally got out and laid down next to me. him surviving was the hole point of this undertaking, so i kept dragging him back into the tent, wrapping him in a sleeping bag and getting back to dying, but he's a stubborn little shit. i didn't die that night. i tried again on the following night with the same outcome. i was too resigned to keep trying. it took all the energy i had to get back home, then go to therapy as usual because i still intended to die accidentally as soon as possible. when my therapist saw me, she called the psychiatrist in and i was put on a massive dose of antidepressants and mood stabilizers immiedately. within few weeks i felt a little better, enough to put off my death until spring. i don't know how i made it to today, but i did. i cleaned myself up. i cleaned the house. i started leaving my bed again. i threw out the 'depression sweatpants'. i got a haircut. i met a boy. i fell in love. i got a great job offer. then i got the job. i moved to the new city. i fixed my diet. i fixed my sleep. i moved in with the boy. i'm here now. and i'm really fucking glad i'm still here. i'm gonna enjoy the shit out of it while it lasts.",bipolar,2

[anyway, check this (it's a pdf, so if you're not able to download/read it, i'll give you a summary.) for those unfamiliar - there's medicaid, and medicare. medicare is *usually* only for people who are retired - but as i was considered a ""disabled adult child"", i am a dependent on my father's medicare. this covers most of my health expenses, but not all of them. only 80 percent of doctors' visits are covered - this is what they call part b. there's part a covers hospital visits. these two things are pretty standard across the states. part d covers prescription drugs. (there's also a part c, but i'm not quite sure what it is.) so if you're on a federal program like medicare, no matter where you are in the states, you need to have some kind of backup insurance in order for doctors' visits to be fully covered. medicaid is a little different. it's basically ""health insurance for poor people"". the names for each service varies from state to state (for example, in massachusetts it's masshealth.) within those states, there are health plans that are subsidiaries, which you can choose depending on your specific healthcare needs (the one i had for a while was called ""neighborhood health plan"", though i just found out in doing research here they've ""temporarily"" stopped taking new members. wonderful.) since i don't have many other health problems, i would want something that covers mental health first and foremost. so as of 2014, the affordable care act (which is totally not the same thing as obamacare, obviously) now requires medicaid to insurance to cover what they call ""essential health benefits"". now, this does include what they call ""behavioral health"" (with a disorder like bipolar that's so organic, i really do find this name inaccurate and kind of offensive.) i forget what led up to it, but i remember a while ago being told on the phone with a masshealth representative that ""behavioral health"" wasn't covered. what i know now is that there are many subsidiaries within masshealth (all of which falls under the realm of medicare) and that my however limited my options were, my mental health care could be covered. basically, it requires a little asking around, but even if you get shut down at first... the law says you are legally entitled to coverage. this is a federal law that applies to the entire country, not a state law. remember that. a lot of you were concerned about my move, in large part because of my health care situation. i just wanted to reiterate that this isn't going to be much of a problem for me as i had originally thought. what is going to be a problem is if the tiny-handed jack-o-lantern goes forth and tries to dismantle the aca (despite that being ruled unconstitutional several times by the supreme court.) i haven't looked into the details of what he wants to do yet, but i am very afraid of these benefits being lost. anything that serves as a safety net for the underclass in the us is pretty much in danger - and since i don't see myself moving back to the middle class i once belonged to anytime within the next four (please not eight) years, i'll just say it... yeah, i'm afraid. if anyone else would be interested in discussing this further, since i'll admit i'm still learning about the situation and there are parts i don't fully understand... i'd really like that. whatever your politics are (and really, i try to be sympathetic to everyone, even in the us we all come from different places/cultures) there's no real way to treat our disorder without a full understanding of this.",bipolar,2

if you're manic you lose control over your decisions. personality and upbringing explanations of mental illness assume always having the mental capacity for full agency over our lives and decisions. as bipolars we don't always have full agency, and stopping moments of uncontrolled destructive behavior is important for us. there can be aspects of choice but that is often not the full picture. we bought a car we couldn't afford because we thought it was a good idea and saw no downsides and couldn't remember or even think of long-term consequences. we think we're gonna get rich tomorrow because we have a *brilliant* idea that's gonna pay off the car. we become manic when we take stimulants because they're affecting our moods in ways that are beyond how they affect other people's moods. when someone having a midlife crisis buys a car they can't afford they know damn well they shouldn't but feel they need it to happily enjoy the rest of their lives and wanna live in the moment. when a teenager does this they're acting from inexperience and being impulsive because they are young. when non-bipolar people take stimulants they don't stay up up for days and destroy their relationships etc and only come down with the help of sedatives or antipsychotics. this is a medical condition and you aren't gonna will it away. if your medical symptoms are controlled enough you can will much more of it away with coping strategies, self care, learning to love yourself again after destructive episodes, finding who you are without bipolar, childhood problems, unhealthy thinking patterns, etc. i am pro-meds and have good reason to be: i have felt them help me. i know they do. why the fuck would doctors approve them and write diagnostic criteria if they weren't. how tf does the fact that they work better than the placebo not prove that they work. i think meds **suck** a lot of the time, aren't well researched enough, often have shitty side effects and some people really struggle with finding ones that help...but that's where medicine for us is right now and the fact that there isn't something better isn't a reason to reject that option entirely and let yourself suffer and destroy your life while having a counselor blame you for actions outside of your control, feel guilted about how you're acting because you are told it's totally in your control, try so hard at something you may not be able to manage, etc. or feeling that all by yourself! to be fair, forms of bipolar (often not 1 or 2 but potentially cyclothymia) and euthymic periods may be just fine dealt with on their own with or without therapy and depending on the individual. i totally think med doses need to be adjusted as moods change. i totally think some psychiatrists have a tendency to over-prescribe and under-trust your own judgment and reporting of symptoms. **but there's almost always another one out there or there will be in the near future and just because it's difficult doesn't mean it's not worth the trouble.** **some counselors are bad counselors. fire them and get a new one!! you deserve better!** thank you for reading &lt;3 edit: paragraphs exist now edit 2: grammar and formatting",bipolar,2

(she has 24/7 migraines, goes to children's hospital, has a psychiatrist, goes to another big hospital for her medical issues, so she's covered there). this past thursday, i went with her to her college (she graduated early. she was on independent study due to her med issues). we were waiting in a room, and she turned to me and said ""i don't feel safe. we have to go. i have to go..we have to go..i don't feel safe! we have to go!!"" on our way home, i asked her if that happens often. she said every time she leaves the house. omg. every time she's in class, every time she goes to the store, every time she leaves the house, she has a panic attack and doesn't feel safe. (i don't leave often- i am disabled). she has a psychologist appointment this thursday and i am going with her. she's a suffer in silence type, because she's trained that way due to growing up with 24/7 pain. i can't believe she's been struggling this whole time. it got triggered more, i suppose, by a dog attack,a month or so after the shooting. she was babysitting a 4 year old, and a pit bull attacked the little girl. it lunged at her, and bit her on the neck. my daughter scooped her up and ran away as the dog let go to get a better bite. she said since then it got worse. this poor kid. she's been dealt such a shitty hand. she just want's to go to college and get her phd in psychology. i told he she sure will have a lot of experience and empathy with the people she will be helping due to her experiences, but that doesn't help in the moment",ptsd,4

for individuals who dealt with high levels of trauma such as sexual abuse, war, murder, etc. because he's my friend and i felt like i've told him enough about my abusive life, i didn't want to get into the deeper details because i felt it might ruin our friendship, so i am asking you guys. i know you're not in any position to give a professional diagnosis but...i just want to know if it's possible. i just need someone to listen and know. something. i was also told growing up, ""this is how chinese parents teach their kids, because chinese parents love them unlike your white friends whom their parents let them do whatever they want, because they don't care."" a brief overview of me and notable events (usually occurring more than once)in my life that i can still remember to this day * male, asian descent * was physically/emotionally abused as a child by mother, father, aunt and grandmother * beaten with belts and several household items * was stripped naked and forced to stand outside my house for two hours when i did poorly in school. * accidentally fell down the stairs and when i cried for my mom expecting hugs, she beat me relentlessly saying that it was my fault. * being told to stand for 10 hours with both my arms up and being whipped by sticks on my sides when they lower below my shoulders. my dad would sit in a chair next to me and because i was crying i couldn't tell if he had his eyes open or not, so sometimes being whipped could suddenly happen * getting a bad report card from school and while taking the bus home i would feel faint, vision changes/blackening because i was anticipating being beaten that night * being suddenly yanked out of bed in the middle of the night and getting yelled at and beaten because my parents found my report card (or even a failed test from three years ago). i recall being pulled by my hair down the stairs. * being told to stick out both hands and my dad would hold a bamboo stick over them; he'd hover over each hand and move between them while saying stuff like ""what did you do wrong?"" and then smack the palm of my hand, depending on whether i answered properly or just smack them and then expect me to give the proper answer. sometimes the proper answer would still mean getting hit and i'd have to repeat it to ensure that it drills into my head. sometimes he could force me to count each time my palms was hit. * hiding under the kitchen table to isolate certain parts of my body from being hit that were incredibly sensitive. so if my dad kept hitting my shoulder, i would position myself and also put all my focus into ensuring and expecting that my shoulder was hit. if i did this, it almost created a numbing effect. however, my dad would make sure to hit other parts of my body, like my ears or my feet. this caused immense pain and i can recall how it would cause me to spasm and scream and break me out of the ""focus"" * being chased and beaten by my dad and running towards my mom for protection while she was washing dishes : i recall her kicking me away from her. that hurt me so much. * being deprived of sleep by not allowing me to go to bed and instead, sit in my knees and pray to a statue of buddha and repeatedly say things like ""i will do well in school"", ""i will be a good son"", ""i will not lie"" * being forced to recite books in french for hours. my dad would sleep on the chair and if he noticed i stopped or slept, he would hit me. if i finished the book he'd tell me ""read it again from the beginning"". he would place the bamboo stick in front of me. * falling into a puddle in public and as i would get up, my mom would smack me behind the head saying ""you made me lose face"" and literally wanting to die from everyone staring at me * in kindergarten, we had to change our pants for gym class and teacher saw my bruising/whip marks on my legs. i was brought into the office by my teacher and i felt like i did something wrong. my parents would tell me about how because of me being bad and getting the whip marks, the government is going to take me away and i'm never going to see them nor my sisters even again. * being hit by a broom on the top of my head that caused an open wound. because i had hair it was easily hidden, so during the weekend it closed up and i constantly picked it when i was stressed. teachers at school thought i had lice. i still have this habit today. * occasionally when i was a kid, i would wake up in the middle of the night crying because i had intense difficulty breathing. i was diagnosed as having asthma....but the strange thing is that i can't recall this feeling during the day nor during gym class. it was only at night and sometimes i would find myself pulling my favorite blanket in front of my parents' door crying myself to sleep while struggling to breathe. * my mom would invite her friend and her son (whom we were around the same age) but because i failed an exam that day, i couldn't play with him and instead my mom would force me to stand in the living room with both my arms up and hit me if my arms dropped. she would shame/complain about me to her friend while doing so, and then say ""look at your friend. why aren't you more like him? he's a good son unlike you."" - i just avoided eye contact with my friend and his mom and basically just phased out while crying. * coming back from every parent teacher interview and while driving back in the car my dad would say things like ""i'm going to beat you until you die"" and me sitting in the back crying and just hoping that it's going to be over and i'm going to wake up tomorrow because it was a bad dream, waking up and realizing i'm still in the car and we are heading closer to home and my dad was going to take the clothes hanger and beat me. * ""tutoring"" me in chinese spelling involved my mom saying ""i'm giving three hours to study. i'm going to test you later after."" and involved me standing next to to a blackboard while she was holding a feather duster. * the worst nightmare i had was something i just couldn't put my finger on - i cannot visually describe the details but it was the feeling of having all of my blood drained from my limbs, the incoming feeling of about to vomit and having something stuck in my throat, combined with the feeling of having to run because i feel i'm being chased. this same feeling would occasionally occur irl during periods of high stress. i could recall some periods in my childhood where i was beaten 3-4 days in a row. could any of these actually ptsd or am i just over thinking it? i am a first generation asian born in canada and because of that i felt that because of the cultural differences this isn't something that could cause ptsd to me specifically . i've spoken to other chinese kids growing up and they all tell me ""yeah my parents have beaten me"", so because of that i've always thought it was a ""normal"" thing and that non chinese kids i could never relate to them. i just feel alone most of the time and i feel because of these experiences, i could never tell potential partners. at the same times i would feel so much guilt because i'm hiding this away from them. this feeling of ""wanting to vomit"", blood draining from limbs, similar to my nightmare, happens when i'm in social situations....especially where there's validation involved.",ptsd,4

68a911f6-98a9-46d7-8102-575b7bb4c58f,"i am looking for anyone whose trauma story is similar to mine, because therapists tell me they shouldn’t have to deal with it.","i am looking for anyone whose trauma story is similar to mine, because therapists tell me they shouldn’t have to deal with it. a small part of my trauma is that, for my earliest two years of grade school, i was sent to a private school which assigned specific types of homework/participation/class work that my parents forbade me to do because they didn’t believe that the homeworks (or the subjects) were real. (details on request.) for this, i was severely punished both at school and at home. some other complicating issues include some then-undiagnosed “invisible disabilities,” as well as equally large and unusual (but very different) types of abuses at the next school i attended. therapists have been hard to convince that this was all real (“i can’t believe that any conceivable set of parents would pick out a school for you and then forbid you to do half of the work, while still insisting you must get perfect grades”) — and, once i do convince them (paying for the privilege meanwhile), they basically say that my case isn’t the kind of thing that they know about or can confidently make referrals for. (one therapist said: “i should probably refer you to a colleague, but frankly i don’t have any colleagues whom i hate enough to dump your problems onto them.” another said: “we don’t yet know nearly enough about combinations of issues like yours. you need to come back on about 50 years or so, when more will be known.” i pointed out that i was already in my 40s [i’m now 57], so wouldn’t be scheduling 50 years ahead. she just sighed and told me that this would therefore be my last session.) so i will continue to look for therapists (a few already turned me down when i searched for video therapy a bit earlier this year), but i think it might help if i could find anyone who has, or might have, problems like me: because maybe i could get better ideas about how to find the right therapist. please get back to me if you have any ideas or just want to talk.",ptsd,4
892ef3a8-4faa-4b77-8b09-224601815540,it’s been over year since my parent’s murder suicide.,"to give some context, the event happened on may 20, 2018. we had just moved into a nice apartment after living in extended stays for the past couple of years. i got my own bedroom and the complex had a small pool i could swim at during the summer, which was really exciting for me since i was so used to sleeping on air mattresses. it was around 10:00am. my mom went to pick up a dog that my dad was supposedly going to give me as a gift. me and my stepdad expected the trade would take only a few minutes, as they were meeting at a gas station across the street from the complex building. an hour later, she didn’t show up. my stepdad tried to call her over and over again, but she wouldn’t pick up. i didn’t worry that much as i thought that the trade was taking longer than expected. a little later, we hear a knock on our door. it was the police who told us that my dad shot my mom, than shot himself. everyone was in absolute shock when they heard the news. they were crying and screaming with grief while i just stood there trying to comfort anyone i could. it didn’t set in with me that this was actually happening. a lot happened during that year. i’m leaving out a lot of details, but i ended up being put in a mental ward for a week after threatening to commit suicide. after the event, i bottled up so much emotions that it got to the point where i just snapped. in that instance, i wanted to kill myself. i wanted to kill other people. i wanted everything to just stop existing for as long as i wanted it to. needless to say, i didn’t feel so good for the next few months. i still struggle with the grief but i try to manage it as best i can. it’s the middle of the night as i’m writing this. it keeps on playing in the back of my mind so i can’t fall asleep. i felt like i needed to get this out there so i would stop destroying myself over something that wasn’t my fault. i was 14 when it happened. i’m 15 now. i can’t see myself the way my peers do anymore. i feel like my childhood was taken away from me. tl:dr the murder suicide fucked me up big time, and i’m trying to get over it the best i can. sorry for the long post. i just felt like i needed to get this out there.",ptsd,4

d85f16c3-0638-471d-809b-6f3db4d21b29,do you ever wish you could erase certain memories?,"i get it, i already know what some of you might say, the memories make you who you are. unfortunately, i don't think this is the case for me. i have complex ptsd stemming from multiple childhood traumas and a few adulthood traumas. i'm 25. if i put my back ground story on here, it would have to be a book so i'm not going into it. repeated abandonment from both parents both in childhood and in adulthood. i recently, this year, with my therapist backing up my decision, had to finally sever ties for good with them both for different reasons. neither of them were ever truly in my life aside from a year after my grandma died, i tried to let my biological mother into me and my sons life because i promised my dear grammie i would try. it didn't work out. i might still run into my biological mother at school because we attend the same college for the same degree (i very much dislike this, i was already halfway through my degree when she started) so there's always a chance i will run into her at school (already happened once, she tried to talk to me and i threatened a restraining order), there's always a chance i'll even be scheduled a class with her. my father popped back up creeping on my facebook and ""liked"" something i made public for professional networking purposes and brought a whole wave of panic and anxiety crashing down on me. after publicly denouncing him, he finally conceded and said that i wouldn't hear from him again. i hate that i had to make the decision to end whatever half ass (or lack of) relationship i had with either of them. many times, i can push it to the back of my mind but unexpectedly it comes back up, and it just rips right through me. i love my life right now. i've never had it better than i do now. i've been through divorce, failed relationships, a lot of moving, and making sure i don't fail a college class in between it all, all with zero family support (i haven't failed a class btw, which i'm very proud of, 36 credits in despite the chaos). after a stint of being single/dating non exclusively and figuring out the kind of man who i truly want, i'm finally where i want to be in life and i finally feel like i'm on the right track. my kindergartener goes to a blue ribbon school, i live in a nice area with my boyfriend who treats me with love and respect. he's given me the gift of time by not needing me to work so i can finish school faster and he has faith in me. my son is tested gifted and is excelling in school, getting involved in sports. i have cats that i adore and a king size bed. i feel stable in my life. so why can't i completely be happy? why is my happiness sometimes hiding behind a dark cloud? because of memories of my parents. even the rare good memories are painful because the bad memories greatly outweigh the good. i don't want to erase my whole past, being abused in foster care, etc. just of my parents. it crushes me that they both ended up living off of the same main road 30 mins from me and also happen to live in the same area my long time best friend lives in. they are so close but they can't be a part of mine or my sons life for so many reasons i don't even want to get into. i'm starting to feel a bit of that panic just writing this out. i just don't think i can ever be truly happy because of them. today was the worst episode yet. my sons dad picked him up and my boyfriend went to work. as soon as i was alone, i started pacing the condo and ended up sitting in my sons super cool batman bedroom. i looked around and just broke down. i screamed out loud to them, why couldn't at least one of you have done this for me? i never give up, why did you have to give up on me over and over again? i just completely broke down sobbing into one of my sons stuffed animals and just crying why over and over again. i felt really tired afterwards and took a nap. after that (and taking my anxiety meds) i've felt a lot better. but that pain....it's so sudden. it's so intense, it just rips me apart until i feel absolutely helpless to it. i don't want to erase all my bad memories....just the memory of my parents.",ptsd,4

(putting it on skin would make skin soak it up, which means the scent lasts less long). it calms me when i have panic symptoms. note that some fragrance oils can stain clothing to a pale yellow, so i recommend doing it on dark colored clothing or on clothes you don't care too much about. 3). stress ball/toys/towels. squeeze away your fight-or-flight response. 4). **physical exercise. this is most important and helpful. this can help the more primitive parts of your brain. cognitive therapy will help more cognitive parts of your brain. you need the combination of both** eta: i finally found the link to the study i saw last year, which convinced me that vanilla fragrance oil is the best for ptsd (do not eat).",ptsd,4

caa71704-8f68-40d2-b49f-277a4fb63e75,calling all opinions!! (ptsd service dog non-profit concept),"hi everyone, so to give a little background i was diagnosed with severe ptsd almost two years ago and heavily recommended a service dog (not a therapy dog, a service dog *see google for difference*) to help assist with my daily functioning, being that i was not functioning nor able to function normally at that time. my options were to shell out upwards to $20,000 for a service dog (if i could find one,) go thru an organization (non-profit that trains ptsd service dogs), or obtain my own dog and train it myself in hopes that it is well-tempered, intelligent, and driven to work as an adult dog. i did not have $8,000, nonetheless $20,000 at that time, nor was i able to hold a job or receiving any sort of financial assistance (even from family.) so i then went ahead and filled out numerous applications to various organizations in hopes to be approved and then put on a waitlist for a service dog. unfortunately i was turned down by every single organization because they only catered to veterans. this was extremely defeating being how severe my trauma was and how much i was struggling to even attempt to function at this point. so i spent months looking for the right dog/breed/temperament/circumstance/etc... and i finally found the right little man last october. i have been training him with the help of private trainers and obedience classes, and let me tell you this is hard work. but without him i don't even know if i would still be around- he has changed my life in ways that i wasn't even able to consider or imagine 8 months ago. everyone who is struggling with debilitating ptsd, i strongly encourage to get a ptsd service dog. so here is where i need advice: (if you are still reading- thank you!..) i still am unable to work, however i hope it is not like this forever. since having gone through being turned down by so many organizations to the point that i have almost given up, and then to have experienced the incredible benefits first-hand of having a service dog i have been wanting to do something... i have had this idea in the works for almost 9 months now. i want to start an organization that provides service dogs (not therapy dogs) to those diagnosed with severe ptsd dealing with severe domestic and sexual violence that has left them unable to function normally as a young woman/man or adult. i have tossed the idea around to a few peers but i think their obliged to support me on any goal i have being that i have barely been able to think about the week ahead- nonetheless long-term goals. the organization would be fronted by a business (potentially an online clothing/apparel store) that the revenue goes toward funding this organization (along with donations) so that the service dogs can be offered free of charge to these victims. i went from taking 4-6 medications/day (8mg of xanax, 2mg ambien, trazadone, celexa, 50mg seroquel...etc...) to now only having xanax with me as a back-up that i use maybe once or twice a week as needed. that may seem like a drastic change but it totally happened organically. the incredible safety, love, and support (emotional and physical) that my service dog has and continues to give me has surpassed any medication or therapy i have been able to find or try. i want young women/men to be able to feel, see, and experience that hope again the way i have. although my life and ptsd is something i continue to struggle with daily, my sd has made it so i can at least manage my symptoms constructively and i am able to channel my energy and love toward him and his training. i really feel passionate about this and.. i want you to tell me what you think! i can take constructive criticism, so please voice pros and cons of this concept, and how/if you think it would be beneficial for our fellow souls suffering from this debilitating illness. thank you so much!",ptsd,4
0da99174-a62b-4f4d-86aa-f6cab7f211ee,it’s been a year and i’ve still never received the help i was promised; any tips?,"tw for sexual assault and suicide attempt about a year ago a friend sexually assaulted me whilst i was drunk and asleep. because i was drunk, i repeatedly phased in and out of consciousness, making it awful to know what was happening, and not be able to move. i filed a police report the next day and all that can be done legally has been. for other reasons i’ve been in councilling for the past 5 years, so i had some vague notions of support, though no one was trained specifically. it took a while to get a diagnosis and i’m the meantime well meaning comments ended up hurting me more. as a result of my trauma i had a suicide attempt, and also avoided beds for the better part of 8 months. i’ve managed to repeat basic exposure therapy i was taught for anxiety help when i was younger to overcome that one. i struggle with flashbacks, dissociation, panic attacks, nightmares, and insomnia of sorts. i’m terrifyed of sleeping. my brain goes into flashback mode and then i’m spinning out of control. my current clinical psychologist has been trying to set me up with several people trained in various trauma based therapy such as emdr and cpt. unfortunately no one anywhere close to me has free spaces. i know i’ve coped kind of okay so far considering where i started. how can i help myself in the meantime? i’m depressed and scared most days, barely sleeping, paranoid about anyone i meet, struggle to trust, i honestly can’t even imagine anything sexual currently.",ptsd,4
d2b9f8df-545c-4042-9cb2-cc60683d256d,i’m so afraid that i’m choosing to be like this.,"i guess i’ve been told by my family and stuff that people with issues like mine are “wallowing in self pity”, being dramatic, and that happiness is a choice. i’m so afraid i’m choosing to be like this. i’m even more afraid that there will be some easy fix and then that will prove to my parents that i was just being dramatic all along. for example, if my ptsd suddenly starts getting better then i feel like everyone will be like “oh she was just being dramatic like we thought.” it makes me feel like shying away from potential treatments because what if all this time i’ve been making all this up? what kind of person would i be if all this time i was just “milking it”? i am being active in treatment, and i’m even trying a emdr if i can get an appointment with the place closest to me. i’m going to continue doing therapy, but that doesn’t change that my brain tells me “you’re just faking it.” i’m not sure if that makes sense but i hope it does. does anyone else have this? i could use some words of encouragement",ptsd,4

84b8dae5-3392-49d8-b09c-15afc0f1309b,irritated by people saying ptsd or triggered for bs,"i cannot be the only one who cringes everytime someone in the media spotlight (news, facebook, twitter etc) says something stupid like "" it gave me temporary ptsd"", ""saying my gender triggered me"" or something equally stupid! very few people know i have the diagnosis (non combat), they just think i am a jumpy insomniac that prefers to be home. those who do know are understanding, but i don't even want to use the word ""triggered"" any more to explain why i reacted this way- or please don't do/say this around me because i feel like one of those celebrity twits begging for attention. i spent many years avoiding the doctor to get any type of diagnosis ( i thought it was just life and maybe a touch of depression) because of the way mental illness is portrayed as a weak attention seeker. ending up in a coma from a failed suicide attempt did nothing for my self esteem, but i did get a diagnosis from people who didn't treat it as something a weak person has. it is something a strong person has, and to fight everyday with is strength! not the weakness that these people are using it for likes, retweets or safe spaces (some even with ball pits). they don't understand the concept of a ""safe space"" for someone who is truly ""triggered"" because when that happens nothing feels safe! i realize this is a rant and the political season is bringing more of this to the headlines...but enough already! those who truly have problems are not taken seriously because of this crap. and those who need help, don't seek it because they feel like they are being whiney ass cry babies like those who say seeing the name ""trump"" in chalk ""triggered"" them. they could say it ""pissed them off"", ""irritated them"", ""worried them about the election"" or some other vernacular than to further degrade a true illness and problem those fighting ptsd every single day. it is hard enough for people to realize and accept ptsd as a real and growing problem with out this. for me, i know it makes it less likely to let anyone else know my struggles. that in itself is a catch-22 as ptsd has already contributed to me being very withdrawn from the outside world.",ptsd,4

&amp;nbsp; &gt;brian here. yesterday’s era of reporters would never have put this garbage out there to begin with. that’s regardless of the topic. in the day when there was the noon hour news, and the six o clock news from 2 or 3 different station editors… well you know….. edited. they threw out crap. multiple instances of crap would result in a firing. now, editors largely scan the article just to make sure it’s a little different from what the other outfits who broke the story are already running. we need to understand that, so we can put a juvenile and unsupported piece of writing where it belongs. &amp;nbsp; are they clueless? &amp;nbsp; no, not clueless, perhaps actually uncaring is closer to the truth. &amp;nbsp; i have found a remarkable and disturbing lack of empathy amongst media folk. there is a distinct sense of superiority in their attitudes, both written and spoken. those who have walked the walk, who have been a cop or a serving soldier and now a journalist are the exception, even their politics are bit wonky but i put that down to the tbis (smile). as are those who openly admit that they too fight depression, anxiety or have a loved one who does. with suffering comes humility. &amp;nbsp; brian here: i’ve done a bit of media in recent years. they are not the enemy. but they do use us as a tool to do their job, so we have to be more savvy and use them just as shrewdly. when they want to entice you to do their piece, they want to hear everything you have to say. and during the interview, very personable. but after that last question is answered, they often bolt without saying goodbye and sprint to the shop to put together whatever it is they wanted to say anyhow, just with snippets and soundbites cut out of your interview to look like you said it. it’s a game. you don’t play unless you know how to play. &amp;nbsp; weaponizing mental health and addictions appears to be par for the course in north american media. the recent election of doug ford to leader of the progressive conservative party of ontario has seen a great wave of weaponized addiction posts. his brother who was famously addicted to cocaine, and doug who used to deal drugs are lampooned by media who in the next breath (i kid you not) say things like, “addicts are people too” and “addiction doesn’t lessen somebody’s humanity”. i honestly laugh out loud at the pomposity and hypocrisy displayed by these moronic pseudo intellectuals. &amp;nbsp; &gt;brian here: very true. if there’s a way to portray the government as not doing enough, or the evil policeman not caring about the downtrodden, trust me you’ll see a piece that is 100% about the trials and tribulations of being an addict. but if the media wants to take you down, suddenly they need to know if back in the sixties, you inhaled when someone passed you a joint. &amp;nbsp; what damage did the awful colby cosh and his witch of an editor, anne marie owens, do to those bravely stumbling towards a decision to ask for a ptsd service dog to get them back to living? how many lives will we lose as a direct result of that asinine piece of shyte? i will tell you because i will be watching and i will be researching, i’ve had enough of this idea that people sit behind their desks and throw darts at those surviving mental health and addictions are easy pickings, because like any bully they go for the weakest and less able to defend themselves. &amp;nbsp; what benefit was there to national post, editor anne marie owens and scribbler colby cosh to not only publishing but then defending that post on ptsd service dogs? the title of which was incendiary, which as they all know creates reactions thus achieving “engagement maximization”. in other words, they used a small group of ptsd service dog owners to drive social media traffic to their media outlet and accounts. modern media seeks to entrap you in a closed-loop and unless you become aware of it, fight it you will succumb. those of you fighting mental health issues need to be aware of this and stop it from drawing you in. &amp;nbsp; &gt;brian here: i have a service dog. i’ve helped others get service dogs. i’m at this very time talking to two individuals who are considering it. they are considering it because they know, for one, that the dog will get them back up off the couch and living again to some degree. and for the other, she routinely sees her attacker and wants to live life again. i’ll help them both. i think they can be put on a better path than they are currently on, with a dog. i can assure you that the dog is not a fashion accessory. it’s not a social conversation instigator but rather leaves you excluded from certain social events. it’s hard. dogs fail. as their handler it feels like you failed. and when they pass, it’s the result of hundreds of dog hours, people hours, trainer hours and many thousands of dollars of donations. i received a donation for 200$ from an old lady at the pentiction anavets club a few years ago, which i of course gave straight to a dog placement foundation that deals with service dogs. this shit article attacks her too, not just me. it calls her foolish for spending money on some veterans fashion accessory. &amp;nbsp; let’s focus on my point on the use by national post of the veteran community to drive traffic to their media accounts: specially, targeting a vulnerable subset of those veterans, veterans with an all too visible symbol of their injury. the first time brian took his ptsd service dog, sasha, out was extremely difficult. now he was visibly broken. i have been enraged by the ignorance and rudeness he has faced with a smile when in public, i am far less polite and unlike sasha, i bite. the damage done by the national post’s cheap and dirty post is incalculable. &amp;nbsp; opening minds was an initiative of the mental health commission of canada to combat the damage being done by media outlets like the national post in their stigmatizing portrayals of those fighting mental health issues. studies were clear from the early 2000s, media had to be educated. a best practice guideline was produced to help journalists better report on mental health issues, known as “mindset” with other 4,000 distributed across canada. it would appear that colby cosh, anne marie owens and the editing team at national post never read. &amp;nbsp; the impact that they have had on the perception of ptsd service dogs? that could be defeated by national post printing a rebuttal, strongly worded and well researched (the antithesis of the illiterate vendetta piece cosh wrote and owens supported) explaining the science behind ptsd service dogs: science that has been peer reviewed and minutely studied since 2002. but sadly, as of now the national post refuses to stand by the oath of all journalists that speaks to integrity and education. &amp;nbsp; &gt;brian here: if a politician said something this stupid, they’d be sent for a sensitivity class and left off the nomination papers next election. a team player would be fined. a business executive would be relieved of duties. a professor would find a pink slip. there is currently no recourse for reporters who publish unresearched, unreferenced and un-cited pieces. they can literally publish something they wrote on the toilet, and perhaps should have gone in it. &amp;nbsp; brian smith wrote a study which i have included below on the impact of media on mental health stigma. it is a great shame the findings in this study are not more widely understood by professionals in the media world in addition to reading the publication produced by the mental health commission of canada (mindset). &amp;nbsp; [mental illness stigma in the media &amp;nbsp; brian and i remain extremely angry with the damage that has been done to efforts painstakingly taken to reduce the stigma around ptsd and ptsd service dogs by the national post’s ignorance. when i first started this journey i wished i could give some individuals a window into my world if only for a few minutes, knowing that they’d never be the same arrogant, pompous twat again but a humble, empathetic human would emerge who understood that there is a great deal going on behind silent, calm eyes and that they don’t get to judge us, or others. sadly, that’s not an option.",ptsd,4

""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem!"" 10 years. i'm just done. i see no hope. i was once bright, hopeful, loving, excitable, etc what the fuck ever else was great in life then, and now its all gone. i don't even have a personality. just pain and sorrow. i can't handle it anymore. i don't want to die. i would not kill myself on my own, for many reasons, but fuck i can't live like this anymore, and years of effort isn't seeming as if it'll pay off anytime soon. i absolutely want to have a doctor help with assisted suicide. i do, i do, i do. 10 years is about to be 11, 12, 13...? more? i'm not doing that. no more. i don't know what to do in the mean time, though. i just had to let some of it out.",ptsd,4

(csa tw begin) when i was 3, i was subject to months of prolonged csa by the hands of a family friend, and many times while my parents were still in the house. i remember it happening, and despite being 3 years old, thinking ""if i call out for my parents for help, he is going to go into the kitchen, grab a knife, and stab me and kill me."" so i never called out for help, and i didn't tell anyone, because i was terrified of him killing me. it took another survivor, who was a few years older than me, telling her mom and starting an entire investigation for my secret to come to light. i certainly wasn't allowed to watch gruesome material at that age, and i also strictly remember that was my own independent thought and not something he said to me. i worry that it has ingrained a weird response to death in me, though. (cw parent death begin) my stepmom of 10 years died when i was 16, and not once did i cry or even feel remorse. granted, she was also an abuser and my dad had been divorced from her a few years prior to her death, but she was also the only mother figure i had for a very long time. i didn't really think twice. death in the media doesn't really shock me, unless it's mass murder/a mass shooting. relatives have died, although none immediate family, and i havent been bothered. (cw animal death) some lifelong pets have died, and i didnt bat an eye (although my closest animal friend is getting old, and i have no idea how i'll react to that.) is this common?? how could i have conceptualozed death at 3? how do i get better ? what if i always shrug it off?? i dont want to be a coldhearted monster for this but i just dont know how, or if i even can, process it. thank you for reading. i really dont know where to go with this.",ptsd,4

9008244d-9003-48c8-aa18-a913e3b76697,my story and an update on my recovery (nsfw),"i want to tell you all my story. i haven't been able to tell anyone but my husband and therapist, yet, but i lurk here and you all have helped me without realizing it. i want you to know the difference this support group makes. my story (again tw, nsfw) i had just graduated college with my masters degree. my husband decided that he was going to enlist in the military (he had worked a series of dead end jobs since finishing high school, and said my success made him want to change). i didn't want him to join, but he was adamant. he left five months later for basic training. i didn't see or hear from him for three months. then he went to tech school. another seven months with only limited contact. finally, he got posted. i quit my job that i loved and moved to be with him. he was a stranger to me. not only that, but he told me after i arrived to our apartment that he was working nights. i settled into a routine of job hunting and taking care of the apartment. i realized some homeless men hung around the apartment, but thought little of it. it turns out, i was being stalked. one of the men saw me exit my home to toss out some old food, and took his chance. he followed behind me quietly and once on the threshold, covered my mouth, shoved me in, and closed the door. he raped me until i bled. he held a knife to my throat and told me he'd kill me if i screamed. i screamed anyway. he cut me. he stabbed me. over and over. i couldn't breathe or see through the tears and pain. my neighbor started making banging noises (i think he had a guest...) and the man hurting me got nervous. he beat me in the head three times with something heavy i couldn't see. when i woke up, hours had passed. i texted my husband and tried to call the police, but i couldn't speak. husband showed up with a coworker and police five minutes later. a few days in the hospital and i was back in my feet. i blame my husband, even though i know i shouldn't. he was the catalyst to us moving there and me being alone with no family nearby. i go in for ptsd treatment and people assume it's for him because he's the secicemember...it feels dismissive... i am now recovered enough to be around people and function well at my job. the anger is still there. the scars are starting to fade, and i'm considering getting a tattoo over them. life continues.",ptsd,4
bc067c26-f96f-4c20-8614-8ffbc5b7c98d,my child is my trigger...,"when i was a child, i was sexually assaulted on multiple occasions by multiple people. when i was in the military, i was sexually assaulted and sexually harassed throughout my time there. i thought i was fine except for a few nightmares here and there and a fear of being alone with men. i became pregnant when i was 22 and had my daughter at 23. i read every book imaginable about babies and motherhood. i felt prepared...what i wasn't told was that the sound of my baby crying would trigger my ptsd and i would be reliving my past again. my daughter was a loud crier and would cry bloody murder, so whenever she would cry, all i could imagine and see was me being assaulted again. the only thing i could do was check out mentally and pass my daughter onto my fiance. i only just recently started seeing a shrink about this but she's 2 now and this has been going on a lot more frequently. i don't know what to do or even how to bring up to my dr. that my own daughter is triggering my memories and sending me into a full blown panic attack when she merely cries. i feel like a monster of a mother. i do not at all resent her but i constantly feel like i cannot be her mom. i don't even want to post this but i'm at my wits end with this. i love my baby. but the thought of being alone with her scares me.",ptsd,4

a50c63d7-7bfa-4979-ba96-31940e733555,"i had a ""breakthrough"" in therapy and its ruining my life. i feel like i need to share it? i talk about sex in here.","my ptsd is a result of being trafficked as a child. my mom sold me and i was brought from my country to the us when i was about 2 years old. i was used for sex stuff there until i got out when i was about 16. the whole experience was pretty horrific and still can't/won't talk about like 90% of the time i spent there. i'm 24 now, and i've worked really, really hard to try and build a life that kind of looks normal from the outside. i studied super hard and learned english well enough to get my ged and enter college at 18. i got my 4 year degree. i'm relatively successful and super happy at my job. i've really been doing the best i possibly can. but, i still struggle with a lot of things. i have an eating disorder that has gotten progressively worse over the years. when i was in college, i picked up the habit of having a lot of casual sex with people i picked up at bars. i honestly have no idea why i even want to do this. i don't enjoy sex and i dissociate through almost all of my encounters, but for some reason i'm totally drawn to it. i can't stop. its like, my body feels like its made to do this. its weird. i just recently left an inpatient treatment facility for my eating disorder, and while i was there i had to see a therapist very frequently. he was horrible! the worst. he made me talk about a lot of things from my childhood that i really, really didn't want to discuss. i felt like i had to. it's hard to explain i guess. but one of the things he was super fixated on was the casual sex situation. he kept on and on about how there is no way that all of that sex had been consensual on my end. and at first, i was like 'that's absolutely ridiculous. i went out looking for sex and got it and so it's obviously consensual' but the more we unpacked it, the more it became unclear to me. there's this one time, specifically, that i think i might have changed my mind on. so, i went to this frat party my freshman year (i had just turned 19) and i started drinking. i blacked out very early into the party and woke up about 14 hours later on the floor in the living room of a different frat house missing a few items of clothing and covered in bunches of bruises. honestly not that unusual for me at that time. but when i got up, i realized that something was seriously wrong with my hip. i had 9 surgeries to replace my hips and pin my pelvis and stuff back together right after i escaped my traffickers, so i've had tons of problems with them since. i knew i probably broke a pin or something, so i immediately went to the hospital to have it replaced. at the hospital, they immediately told me that i had been drugged and assaulted by numerous people and they urged me to press charges against the fraternity, but i told them i definitely wasn't assaulted and that it was chill. they put another pin in and i was on my merry way and found myself in a ton of similar situations in the years to follow. i never thought about this incident again and it never bothered me, until this therapist uncovered it again. whenever i start to feel overwhelmed or when i see someone that looked like one of my abusers i always tell myself ""you've been safe for 8 years. nothing bad is going to happen to you."" apparently that phrase bothered my therapist because he was very set on explaining to me all the ways i've most definitely not been safe in the past 8 years since i've been out. he told me i was ""very likely"" to be forced into prostitution again if i didn't stop having reckless sex and that i ""had been assaulted"" more times than he can count in the last 8 years. i feel devastated and overwhelmed. before this, i felt like i had been doing a really good job of taking care of myself and trying to get it together, but now i feel like i'm starting from square 1 and i haven't done anything. like i just got out of my trafficking situation and have to learn how to be a normal person all over again. i feel like 16 year old me all over again and its horrible. i'm overwhelmed and i wish i could go back to believing that all those things were consensual. my brain is real upset with this new information. i don't know why i felt the need to share this stuff with yall. has anyone gone through anything similar?",ptsd,4

""living the dream"" they called it. then i go to the pysch-o (pysch officer) because my wife convinced me that i needed to talk to someone. i didn't want to be seen going into the psycho's office, which by the way should not be located directly next to your work space. the intentional design to have medical and psychological lines in walk ways right next to your work space is a complete violation of all hepa rights. out of fear of someone i worked with noticing me talking to the pyscho's office i tried to ask him to meet with me regularly in private someplace that wasn't labled ""pysch officer's office"". again, the stigma of sadding out is real and strong. the pyscho doesn't want to prescribe anything or help me in any way. no follow up, just tells me to go talk to an e-5 in a closet of an office directly connected through the pyscho's office. he began teaching me ""breathing exercizes to use"" while i was experiencing a panic attack. i remember this experience well because we were in very close quarters and his breath stunk. i decided at that point that this was not going to help and i wanted nothing more to do with this. so i just started bottling everything up as best i could. the bottling up was working for a while but i had a kid on the way, was getting out of the navy, applying for jobs like it was my job, and interviewing, moving, work repeat. no time for relaxation, that will happen after the kid gets here. i start scaring myself while driving because i would space out for long periods and just end up on the other side of town or have to pull over because i was having a panic attack or i would be falling alseep at the wheel from pure physical exhaustion. i was driving my kid home from day care after getting off work and i late breaked almost ran into the car in front of me because i was so mentally checked out. i decided i wouldn't drive anymore. i immediately sought help from a private doctor while on terminal leave and went to the military docs to make sure it was documented on my medical record including a trip to the er about panic attacks i was having. i was placed on a ssri (lexapro) with the initial diagnosis of a ""chronic adjustment disorder"" basically meaning i didn't handle the change of getting out well. then i started to get really depressed, bored and avoided doing about everything i enjoyed. i shut down. i believe my wife noticed and had me moved to a new city where she could make more money, where pot is legal, and i could stay at home to avoid driving, going to work, or basically interacting with the rest of the world. i have been concerned about the sexual side effects of the meds i had been on because my wife wanted to have another kid. i went 2 weeks of no panic attacks for the first time since the whistle blowing/miscarriage/dog bite/boss fired from job for fucking his boss/emminent war/etc deployment. i then decided it was best to decrease my meds to a lower dose. ""not being productive because it takes 2 hours to ejaculate is causing my problems"", i thought. these are side effects of my medications. this is where things went bad... i started to get depressed but was personally unaware. my wife started to notice that i wasn't eating, was moody, not sleeping, and laying in bed all day. she asked me if i was ok and i... broke down. all emotions came to a tipping point and i started whaling in tears. i told her i had been thinking about suicide. i told her that i didn't feel like life was worth living. she made me go to the va and talk to a doc. i think they are evaluating me for ptsd. they have yet to give me a diagnosis but were pretty dead set on asking me questions about my upbringing. i feel like the va treatment plans are designed to make it sound like the things you are experiencing were caused by something in your childhood so they don't have to compensate you or something. i don't care about compensations but i cant hold a job for health care so i go to the va. like, ""we are here to make sure the military is not blamed for what ever is wrong with you"" kind of thing in my opinion. anyways, i felt i should share some of the basic symptoms i have struggled with and the only treatment i have found that really worked is smoking indica strain cannibis at night when the child is asleep and having some relaxing time with my pets. here are my symptoms: panic attacks severe avoidance confusion when trying to get off medication, confusion when going on medication stuttering / stammering with increased frequency and severity. episodes of extreme emotion (getting upset about the small things, irratablility) night sweats (bed stinks so bad and i have to wash the sheets daily and my bedroom is 68 degrees and i only sleep with sheets.) night terrors (re-occuring dream: waking up with the feeling that i am supposed to tell someone something to prevent an awful occurrence from happening but unable to say the words. the words just won't come out) wife scared to wake me up because i am fearfully jumpy and suffer from panic attacks upon awaking. depression",ptsd,4

(school was where the trauma originated). i have a loving boyfriend who i've been with for nearly two years, and from the outside, i have a picture perfect life. however, lately i've begun having intense depersonalizations episodes. it's like i become aware during a dissociative state, but i feel like i'm in a dream state. i can feel that my brain isn't functioning properly, but i can't do anything about it. i can't seem to make decisions, and i feel like i'm floating just a few inches outside of my body and experiencing everything in a dream state. it's incredibly scary and very isolating and traumatizing in itself. at the worst of it, i've convinced myself that the world is just a figment of my imagination and that i made it all up. i've tried cutting to make myself feel something, and at the absolute worst of it, i've contemplated suicide in the hopes that if i kill myself, i'll feel ""normal"" in the afterlife. i'm a generally happy person, and this isn't a cry for help. i love my life and my family, i'm just so terrified by what's happening to me and i can't get it to stop. i carry a lighter with me that i'll hold the flame as long as i can and then press the hot metal into my skin to feel something. not enough to burn myself, just enough to ground me. it works, but i know it's probably not healthy. tl;dr - i'm terrified of depersonalization episodes i keep having, and don't know how to get it to stop. i'm really good at pulling myself out of a panic attack, but can't seem to do the same here. help?",ptsd,4

(not the best choice of words, but it was not a cry for help, i was all in.) my wife forced me to get help. i took time off work, rushed the process because i did not want to seem ""weak"" to my peers and after being back at work, i collapsed psychologically. i was about to eat my gun one night. after being forced open up to a doctor (trust issues) i was put on meds upon meds that seemed to make the darkness worse. for some they do wonders, for me not so much. to this day i am visited by that night. it forces it's way into my daily life. i lost my job as a result and now i am kind of a rudderless vessel. the saving grace for me has been a wife that kept me alive when shit was dicey and my dog for being there when i was alone. my family did not want to hear anything about it. my brother turned his back on me, my father had that ""that never happened to me"" reaction and my mother would die of a broken if she ever knew i was hurting that bad at one time. the depression and anxiety killed dozens of friendships and has turned me into kind of a narcissist at times. i am up and down, mostly up lately. i don't want to go into my meds or other self treatments now because some would not agree and i don't want people stray from theirs. two things that i can recommend: 1. don't ever drink. (i was always a normal drinker, but the incident turned me into a reactionary heavy boozer.) once my roller coaster was manageable, i gave up all drinking just because i examined life before the heavy drinking and wanted some of my shine back. 2. find a way to forgive yourself for whatever fault you think you carry in your incidents. that makes more difference than you can imagine. sorry for the long ass post. it's 3:30am and i was starting to slide sideways into the darkness again and for some reason ended up here reading your posts. thanks for staying in the fight folks. be safe and never quit on yourself.",ptsd,4

36a2b01c-9a10-42ff-ab2b-1f50b03057e6,trauma from witnessing siblings death,"my father worked for one of the largest beer distributors, we weren’t rich, but quite well off. my mother stayed at home, and went to school. i was never close with my mom, i didn’t see her much, and she never left her bedroom. id knock on her door, only to be answered with i’m changing, or using the restroom. my mom has bipolar type one, and used cocaine heavily. she cut herself a lot, and attempted suicide many times. there was more than one instance where i found her bleeding out on her bathroom floor. i was just a child; i didn’t understand what was happening. even as a teenager, i believed her excuses for the mass amount of cuts on her arms, and needing to change clothes five times a day. i was definitely a lot closer with my father then, but i was also terrified of him. the moment i heard his harley davidson coming down our street, i’d book it for my room, and hope the house was cleaned to his liking. it wasn’t until i was much older, when i discovered his stash of needles and, steroids, that i understood his rage. even as a child, i’ve always been very oblivious, naïve, and reserved. i was quiet, and spent most of my time day dreaming. i had/have dyslexia (also left-handed), which not only caused me to struggle in school, but contributed to me wetting the bed almost every night until i was 13. my mother was well aware of this, but still drove me to school every morning covered in pee. as a result i was bullied harshly, not only by my peers, but even my own parents. after my own attempted suicide, i was diagnosed with gad and severe depression. my parents divorced when i was 15, my mom has been clean since (almost 10 years). my mom moved me and my sisters out of the house, and into an apartment. after about a year, i moved in with my father, step mother, and 9 month old half-brother in 2009 when i was 16. i wanted to go back to the school with all my old friends i had before my parents’ divorce. i wasn’t allowed to leave the house to go on walks, or to go anywhere really. i had to take care of my infant brother every day, if i wanted to hang out with friends; they had to come over to my house. in september of 2009, my father had just left home for a month + to work his new job traveling. he left my step mother to take care of me, my brother, as well as both of my bedridden grandparents. this was very overwhelming for my step mother; it would have been for anyone. having a father whose hobby, as well as job revolved around beer, i was used to it; beer was all i knew at home. so when my step mother’s drinking increased, i didn’t even bat an eye; it was normal for me, i even participated with her. the first two days he was gone, she drank every night, and would have me drive her to the store to get more alcohol when she ran out. one morning, after staying up too late with my step mother, i slept in, and missed the bus, not a big deal. i sat in the back seat of the van feeding my brother his bottle on the way to school while my step mother drove me, that’s the last time i ever saw him again. after school, i had to go to a classmates house to work on a chemistry project, i went home first to let my step mom know. when i found her she was sprawled out on the couch passed out, i felt really awkward seeing her like that, i never had before. instead of waking her, i just wrote her a note letting her know what i was doing. checking on my brother didn’t even cross my mind. his bedroom door was shut, all was quiet, and so i assumed he was napping. i left, and walked to my friend’s house, which was about twenty minutes away. after working on the project for about an hour or so, i get a call from my father. he couldn’t get ahold of my step mother, and was worried about the baby. he asked me to walk home to check on him, and i did. i had an uneasy feeling, but i wasn’t really worried. when i arrived home, my step mother was no longer on the couch, but in the bathroom. it was freakishly quiet, i can’t explain it, but it was unordinary, i even had the thought that she might have been drowning him in the bathtub. i told her to call dad, i let her know that he was worried. i didn’t get much of a response, maybe an “okay”, but that was all i needed, and i rushed out the door without so much as peeking into my brother’s room. i should have, i don’t know why i didn’t, i guess i just wanted to get out of the house. another hour or so at my friend’s house passes, and my father calls me again. he hadn’t heard from her, and wanted me to go back home and make sure everything was alright. i kid you not, on the walk back home, i was texting my friends that my brother was dead, i was so sure of it. i got home as it was getting dark; and all the lights were off in the house, which freaked me out even more. i sat outside smoking my step mothers cigarettes on the driveway, i couldn’t escape the thought that my she had murdered my brother, my grandparents, and she was waiting inside for me. i don’t know where these thoughts came from, my stepmother and i were very close at the time, and i had no reason to suspect this. when i finally worked up the courage to go inside, i checked my brother’s room first, it was empty. i found my step mother in bed once again passed out. i woke her up, and asked her where the baby was; she had no idea. we searched the house, called family friends, we couldn’t find him anywhere. eventually she made her way out the front door, next thing i know; i see the van pull out, and speed away. i was left at home, alone, wondering what the fuck was going on, until police showed up at the door. they wouldn’t tell me anything, and i wasn’t allowed to use my phone to reach out to friends, so i fell asleep on the couch. i woke up after 3am to a homicide detective introducing himself to me, with my house full of police, and photographers. the detective took me outside to his car, sat me down in the front passenger seat with him next to me in the driver seat. the first thing he said to me was “could you describe the events of this afternoon leading up to your brother’s death.” i didn’t even know he had died. my brother was left in his car seat for 9 hours after i was dropped off for school; i lived in houston, texas at the time, so the temperature was still in the high 90’s even at the end of september. he was cold by the time he was found, covered in blisters, with nothing but a diaper on. seven years later and it still haunts me, i know it wasn’t my fault, or responsibility, but he would have never been in the car had i not missed the bus. when my step mother came home from the hospital/questioning that morning, the first thing i said to her was i forgave her. the hardest part was having to explain to my two younger sisters what had happened. though deemed a homicide, my step mother didn’t spend a day in jail; it was wiped off her record after a year of probation. other than my initial testimony, i wasn’t brought in to testify in court; i wish i had been, my brother might have received justice then. my father didn’t actually marry my step mother until 2 months after his death. their response to his death was to abuse me and my sisters, so i moved out on my own before i graduated high school, they kicked my sisters out one after the other not long after. my father hasn’t spoken to me in years, yet he married the woman who killed his only son, i feel like he blames me. i’ve been dealing with this on my own for seven years, all the guilt i feel with no release. i never got counseling, i was isolated, and that’s how i’ve learned to deal with all that i have experienced. i’ve dealt with severe depression and anxiety since childhood, but now death is all i think about it seems. i have obsessive thoughts that my sisters, friends, and other loved ones are going to die, especially in a car. i don’t see myself living past my thirties, no future, just constant thoughts of impending doom. so much stress, and worry that a year after the incident, i grew a large solid white forelock in the front of my hair. i’m filled with so much fear, sorrow, and pain; i feel as though, that is all life has to offer me. i often wish that i wasn’t alive anymore, i wish my mother had aborted me, like she told me she had intended to. i don’t often show this sadness to others, i’m heavily introverted and reserved. at the same time, i’m a huge goober, who just wants to laugh and be happy, while making others happy; that’s all i ever strived for. i grew as a person through all of the trauma. i’ve always been very empathetic, i can connect with anyone. i’m the person people reveal their deepest darkest secrets to; go to for comfort, etc. i only have love to give, i can’t bear for others to suffer, especially alone, because i know what that feels like. i’ve been through a lot, but it’s made me into the great person i am today. i don’t really know why i’m posting this, i just needed to get it out i guess. tldr; when i was 16, my step mother left (her child) my half brother in the car for 9 hours after dropping me off at school, when i missed the bus. 7 years later and the guilt still eats away at me.",ptsd,4

in particular there are a lot of nice campsites in europe just outside major tourist centers. even in latin america it's often cheaper to camp than to stay in a hostel. - sometimes not booking ahead pays off. often the cheapest lodging (especially in southeast asia) can be found on the ground once you arrive. - similarly, you can save another $5-10 dollars a night if you forgo air conditioning. you'd be surprised how little you miss it when you have a powerful fan right above you. **transport** - [rome 2 rio]( is fucking amazing. - take the subway and don’t be intimidated by the public bus system. buses are for losers who can’t afford to buy a car…if they can figure it out…you can figure it out. or walk, you lazy bastard. - for low-budget travelers, the old “take a night bus/train to save a night’s lodging” still works wonders…bonus points if you’re a normal sized human and can actually sleep in a chair. - rent a bike. - carpooling: - hitchhiking: **food** - follow the 6-block rule: never eat within 6 blocks of a major tourist site. - you’ve been buying food from the supermarket your whole life. it won’t kill you to eat a peanut butter &amp; jelly sandwich in berlin. - eat local: take a chance and wander into neighborhood joints where you have no idea what’s going on. make the “i’m hungry” hand-to-mouth gesture to the wait staff and they’ll figure out that you’d like to exchange money for food. - along the same lines…ask locals, even the staff at your hostel/hotel, where you can find good cheap eats. - pack imodium and eat street food. - go full cliché! ooh—la—la, baguette and brie on the green. voila! déjeuner bon marché! **activities** - research museum pricing policies and free nights: many major museums/sites offer free entrance once a month or once a week. if you’re willing to wait in line you can schedule your visits accordingly. feel free to use this wait time to whinge to fellow queue mates about your crippling student loans. - most cities will have a “what’s happening” site online or a free newspaper version around town…find free festivals, free exhibits and free whatevers. - into art? skip museums and browse galleries…just shave and take a shower first…don’t make it obvious that you can’t afford a goddamn thing in there. - learn to explore aimlessly…some of the most interesting cultural differences can be found wandering the aisles of a hardware store. - don’t be afraid to skip big name sites if they don’t interest you. **other** - follow your favorite airlines, hotels &amp; travel sites on social media for first crack at specials. - [research destinations with this travel calculator]( it could be that there’s another trip just as interesting as the one you’ve got planned for half the cost. - don’t stress balls over it…but if possible, find a bank card with zero to no international withdrawal fees. the yankee doodles use charles schwab. (i use the same bank i always have and just pay 5 bucks because i am old and lazy.) if you do simply pay the fee (like me), take out the max with every withdrawal to limit the damage. - some people like to do backbreaking farm work in exchange for lentils and man bun tying tips: - and here’s a pseudo-legal way to find odd jobs to offset travel costs: - slow travel: you’ll never see it all. don’t try to. spend more time in fewer places and you’ll save a bundle…my recommendation is to blow all those savings at the pub. - search google for promotional codes…you know that little box at checkout? promo/coupon? you’d be amazed how often you can find a code to slap in there for an additional discount. - don’t buy a backpack full of garbage…it’s one thing to bring home a super cool keepsake or two but 90% of the shit i used to buy in the name of *souvenir!* is now collecting dust on a family member’s curio shelf. - skype is a dirt cheap way to stay in touch and is easier than typing out messages on your phone or finding a computer. you can call any phone in the world so cheaply it's practically free. - a big part of saving money is to avoid losing money to scammers -- check out travelscams.org - got an early flight and don't want to pay for a taxi when public transport isn't running? arrive the night before and sleep in the airport...some airports are better than others but here's a site that tells you which are the best/worst for camping out: **stuff not to do** - don’t buy one of those stupid lifestraws as if you’re living in a post-apocalyptic video game – just by bottled water like the rest of us…most places sell 5 liter jugs so the true penny pinchers can top up in the hostel. - i personally refuse to support hidden ticket travel but [here are the bozos behind the madness.]( - above i said, “don’t be afraid to skip big name sites if they don’t interest you.” don’t confuse this with “skip sites that do interest you over a few bucks.” don’t be that guy who went to rome and was edgy enough to only see the coliseum from the outside. - don’t be a fucking mooch. don’t be “that guy” who fills his backpack with the free hostel breakfast, ensuring hostel goers with a hangover are left to starve because all the toast is in some hippie’s jansport. similarly, don’t whine and cry and bitch and moan and wail on to your new travel buds about how “poor” you are so they’ll buy you drinks or what have you…you’re not poor. poor people don’t go on vacation. i repeat. poor people don’t vagabond across the globe in search of machu picchus, foreign poontang and spiritual enlightenment. poor people don’t own 200 euro backpacks with camelbak pouches. **addendum** if you’ve got tips you’d like added to the list, just send me a pm and i’ll cut &amp; paste them in: - time can be just as valuable as money. with short trips, if there's only a small difference, a 4 hour flight is more cost effective than than a 12 hour bus or train ride. (hell, i once came across two flights, one was 36 hours long, cost $600, the other was 16 hours long and cost $650. is $50 worth 20 less hours, probably.) europe is lucky to have all of those budget airlines, but while they can be sweet, they will nickel and dime you for everything. they'd charge you for air if they could. - booking hostels directly is nearly always 10-15% cheaper than the booking sites out there, and they will price match. also makes problems infinitely easier to fix. the one downside is you're open to foreign transaction fees, which leads into my next point, which you briefly touched on. - if you're from the united states i highly suggest looking into a charles schwab checking account. makes life easier, and safer so you don't have to pull out the max and walk around with a lot of cash. they will refund you all atm fees and there are no transaction fees for foreign purchases. when you open one they give you a brokerage account, which you don't have to use, and there are no yearly fees on either account.",none,5

don't tell me my flight has been delayed 7 hours. i get to the desk and ask, and they say to me: &amp;nbsp; ""hello mr. wang, the flight has been delayed because the flight crew has not shown up. additionally, since you are on an award ticket, i cannot place you on the 17:40 flight, and [will have to put you on the flight for the next :| fine. my sleep deprivation and less than stellar chinese skills cause me to just accept my fate. i go to the hilton @ beijing airport and stay the entire day and night. i'm able to board my flight the next morning without a hitch. &amp;nbsp; *march 23rd, 2:00am utc. 10:00am cst.* *25.5 hours.* &amp;nbsp; i somehow got stuck with the middle seat in economy on this flight. i find my left hand seat mate is a [rather large no worries, he's nice and i am a pretty skinny guy myself so i don't mind too much, as long as the guy to my right isn't taking up too much space. as soon as i think this, almost on cue, another gentleman who was at least 30% larger than the one on my left starts walking down the aisle. i thought to myself, ""wow, wouldn't that suck if he sat next to me?"" at this point, i was still brave enough to tempt fate. &amp;nbsp; turns out, the fellow walking down and the man to my left know each other. the man walking down is scanning the row numbers, until his eyes narrow on… &amp;nbsp; my row. &amp;nbsp; as he squeezes in to his seat, i am faced with a dilemma, i try to squeeze my shoulders in, but i am stuck between these two men and i have no space to myself, literally touching their shoulders, no matter how i contort myself. i contemplate crying, or asking to switch seats, or both. as i’m trying to decide the best way to hide my tears, an angel with blonde hair and a blue aa uniform walks down and asks the man to my right if he would like to move to a more comfortable seat, as, she says, “it looks a bit cramped in here.” she must have sensed the desperation in my eyes - either that or the nervous sweat that was now accumulating in my armpits. &amp;nbsp; he moved, i sat on the other aisle seat, and the rest of the flight was uneventful. little did i know that this was an omen, a sign of worse to come. &amp;nbsp; *march 23rd, 3:30pm utc. 10:30am est.* *39 hours.* &amp;nbsp; we land in chicago and i run to catch my flight to miami. &amp;nbsp; i get to the gate, it’s a long process to board the plane since the overhead compartments are smaller than normal and people are struggling to fit their luggage in. as soon as everyone is done and settled in, we hear an announcement. &amp;nbsp; “sorry folks, it turns out that the lavatories on board this aircraft are not functional. due to faa regulations, this plane cannot fly. we apologize for the inconvenience. everyone must now deboard.” &amp;nbsp; cries of anger are heard throughout the plane. why did they wait until everyone was on board and settled? the plane had been sitting at the gate for an hour, had no one gone and checked? why do airlines suck? of course, asking these questions is futile. &amp;nbsp; the plane ends up taking off two hours later. &amp;nbsp; we land at mia at around 5:15pm. my flight to barbados takes off at 6pm so i'm not too worried. we hear the captain: “sorry folks all the gates are full, we're currently trying to get you all an open spot. should be about five minutes.” no problem, i still have plenty of time to catch my flight. &amp;nbsp; five minutes go by. &amp;nbsp; ten minutes go by. &amp;nbsp; it's 20 minutes until we hear the captain again. &amp;nbsp; “sorry folks, the plane just left the gate. should be another three to four minutes.” &amp;nbsp; i know this game. we are the proverbial children on the car ride, asking “are we there yet? are we there yet?” and the captains, just to appease us, keep saying “just five more minutes. no, i know it’s been five minutes - i meant five minutes from *now.*” &amp;nbsp; of course, the “three to four minutes” takes another 20 minutes. we finally start going to the gate. it’s too late, i’ve already accepted my fate - my plane takes off at 6pm, i get out of the plane at 6:10pm. i go to the ticket counter to get a new ticket, and the man tells me that the barbados flight is actually right next door - and to run, since the plane is still there. &amp;nbsp; it takes me ten seconds to run there. i get there and i see. this is my plane. they refuse to let me on because the door has closed. i don't even try to fight it since i know that there is no way they will let me on board. i am so close, yet so far. fate had dangled a carrot in front of my nose, then pushed me down into the dirt, ate the carrot itself, and gave me a voucher to a shitty hotel along with its “sincere apologies”. &amp;nbsp; i use my meal voucher to order a chicken sandwich from burger king. she rings it up and i am actually 30 cents short. i had to pay 30 cents for my crappy airport chicken sandwich. &amp;nbsp; i get on a shuttle to my hotel and open up the reese’s pie i had also ordered. [it turns out it was a this is the cherry on the shit pie - i wanted some god damn peanut butter, and i can’t even have that. i turn on transformers 2 on the hotel tv so that i feel marginally less alone. i pretend shia labeouf is my friend, but like everything else good in my life, we both know that he’ll entertain me for two hours and get up and leave without saying goodbye. &amp;nbsp; i wake up, eat the hotel breakfast, get on my shuttle, and get to the airport. i am 2 hours early, so i hit up the centurion lounge. [i get a rum and - even though it’s 7am here, it’s 6pm in thailand, so technically i’m not an alcoholic. &amp;nbsp; *march 24th, 12:00 noon utc. 7:00am est.* *59.5 hours.* &amp;nbsp; i finish up my meal and head to my flight. we board without incident. i am on edge, knowing something is going to be wrong. and, if you've read this far into my story, you can probably guess what's going to happen. &amp;nbsp; we are informed by the captain that... ... the air traffic control in barbados is having a strike, and they have closed down the whole airport. &amp;nbsp; he does not know how long we are going to be stuck. after half an hour of waiting, he tells us: &amp;nbsp; ""uhh, folks, looks like we'll be departing a bit later than we planned. at least **four hours later.**"" &amp;nbsp; he gives us permission to leave this aa metal prison. i leave, go back to the lounge again, grab some lunch then proceed to get a free massage and very, very drunk. &amp;nbsp; i was supposed to make it to barbados at 9pm on march 22nd. it is now, if everything goes well, supposed to be 6pm on march 24th. &amp;nbsp; i have been defeated by aa. &amp;nbsp; *march 24th, 5:30pm utc. 12:30pm est.* *65 hours.* &amp;nbsp; and, as you probably can guess, everything did not go well. the flight went from showing up as a boarding time of 2:30pm to being showed as ""cancelled"". i stood in line at rebooking for half an hour and turns out all flights are canceled because the airport in barbados is still closed. i managed to be one of the very few people from the original 10am flight to get on the 10am flight for tomorrow, march 25th. the agent felt bad for me so she booked me, while there were 60 people on standby on that flight. the family next to me had their flight rebooked to saturday - a full two days after. unbelievable. this will add 21 hours to my ordeal, and i will be up to 86 hours in this cluster fuck. and yes, i'm staying another night in the same hotel. &amp;nbsp; i realize that this is not all aa's fault. they couldn't have seen the barbados strike coming, and it was procedure that i am not allowed on a plane that closed its doors. i have no problems with that. and to be fair, they did give me vouchers for food and a hotel. but i believe that should be the bare minimum. the two instances where i believe aa was at fault was in beijing, where the airline staff just didn't show up and because i booked an award ticket they pushed my flight a day back, and in chicago, where they didn't have mechanics check to make sure the bathrooms were working. the plane had been sitting on the tarmac for an hour and no one bothered to check, causing us to be very late.",none,5

ceab6daf-0706-41cd-b295-bdd96dcbae51,a friend i made in el salvador was murdered; when travel brings you closer to the world's suffering,"this summer i went on a four month solo backpacking trip through central america, which included two weeks in el salvador. in the small surf town of el tunco, i met a group of salvadoran hippies, who i hung out with for a few days before hitchhiking across the country with them to attend a music festival in the mountains. i had an amazing time and became facebook friends with some of them before we parted ways. this week via facebook, i learned that one of them, enrique, was murdered. enrique was a charming, funny, talented tattoo artist and drummer. [here’s a i took of him juggling fire while riding a 6 foot tall unicycle. he was the youngest of my salvadoran friends - just 21. i don't know any details on who killed him or why, only that his was one of four bodies found face down in a ditch with their hands and feet bound. i only knew enrique for a week and i never expected to see him again, but i sobbed when i read the news. three days later, my heart still aches each time i think about it. i saw his mother’s post on his facebook page after his death. how terrible this must be for his family. i realized i wouldn’t be experiencing this sadness right now if i hadn’t gone to el salvador. violent crime (mostly gang related) is a serious problem there, and like most people, i feel sad when i read about it - and then i close my browser and go about my day. but this news wasn’t about faceless victims, it was about enrique, who i danced with and joked with, who was going to give me a tattoo if only his shop hadn’t been too far out of my way. oddly perhaps, i think this an argument in favor of travel; traveling makes you more empathetic to the world’s pain, and more empathy in the world can only be a good thing. i’m grateful i had the chance to meet enrique during his short life, and that i experienced his country’s positive qualities (world class surfing, a thriving ska music scene, and some of the best food i’ve had in my life.) i’m also grateful that “gang violence in el salvador” isn’t completely abstract to me. but goddamn does it hurt right now. edit: thanks to those who have offered condolences and shared their own stories.",none,5

(i believe that in nuclear power with stringent safeguards, the pros far outweigh the cons) i would say that the only thing missing is the advent of electric cars (tesla comes to mind, of course), but didn't we already have the reva car for a long time? i know that a lot of people say that india gets the short end of the stick and it's hypocrisy on the part of the western nations to expect us to live up to their stringent environmental standards (even though we are a developing nation) but our adherence to the same shows great magnanimity on our part. edit: an extra ""the"" edit 2: to all of my brethren stating the current pathetic situation on the ground in our country, yes, there's no denying that things are bad. this is why i'm thankful and appreciate the stance and say ""moving in the right direction"". we are not there yet, not even close. we have a long way to go and whatever push we get only turns the creaky wheels towards the sustainable light at the end of the dark tunnel.",none,5

(it was around this time that drake released his sophomore album *take care* and accusations came out that he bit the weeknd's signature sound, but that's a story for another time.) cut to 2014 and we have a new weeknd with *beauty behind the madness* and a new audience that will automatically associate him with ""can't feel my face."" what at first sounds like a simple, catchy pop track is actually a little darker. in fact, it may be the first song about doing cocaine that ever won a teens choice award (he would end up [talking about in a song on *starboy*.). and [in the - another song with a catchy pop beat - is about a stripper who is forced to dance to the song that played when she was raped as a child. the weeknd performed this song at the grammys to no controversy. however, there were songs on the album like and [the which are clear examples of his original sound that made him, well, him. which brings me to my point: what separates the weeknd from other acts is his lyricism. he is able to translate ideas that would be considered too dark or too sexual for the mainstream and mask them using entendres and metaphors over friendlier beats that have larger appeal. *starboy* is the pinnacle of this. it is completely new sound for him, and yet he's still sings about getting road head and doing coke with hookers. and he gets away with it, too, because he's not saying these things outright. so if you're unfamiliar with the weeknd's older work i've included some of my favorite tracks, because it's just as important to watch an artist grow as it is to listen to their music.

5675a334-8a98-44c5-96af-702c6b539b36,"a writeup on what to pack when you travel (mostly first-world, but some advice pertains to the developing world travel, too)","i posted this as a reply in a thread in /r/malefashionadvice where someone was wondering what clothes to pack for a trip to europe, and even though i was a bit late to the thread, i got quite a few pms asking me to elaborate or thanking me for this, so i figured i'd post it here, too, in hopes that it may help fellow travelers. if you have any questions or need any clarification, please don't hesitate to ask. i'm a former travel photographer who is forever plagued by wanderlust. i've gone on trips ranging from a yearlong trip through south and southeast asia to 3 trips to europe over the past 5 months. i've been to 40+ countries, and i'm sharing what i've learned during my journeys. this is general advice, but moreso for 1st world travel. i've spent significant amounts of time in the developing world, so if you have any questions pertaining to that, i'm happy to help. i certainly don't claim to know it all, and packing is a very personal thing, so apologies in advance for anyone who disagrees with my advice, but i'm hoping this will be helpful to some. **layer.** rather than carrying one giant coat that will only work when it gets truly cold, bring a few warm layers that can all be layered together. an apolis chore coat and a good shell works great together (insulated and weatherproof), but both serve their own purposes when worn separately. **wool.** it doesn't stink, doesn't get too wrinkly, wicks sweat, insulates when cold, and insulates well in general. icebreaker makes great merino wool t-shirts that can work as a general tee (even in the summer) as well as a base layer when hiking away from cities. a wool sweater is as insulating as a hooded sweatshirt, but can also work in a more formal environment. wool socks, too. you can wear them day after day, and they'll resist being smelly and will do a better job at mitigating foot sweat than virtually anything else. costco's quasi-smartwool (kirkland branded) hiking socks are cheap and good. **2 pairs of pants.** 1 pair of dark slim-fitting denim and 1 pair of chinos. chinos will get you through museums and fancy restaurants (they may not be suit-pants like the locals, but you're still showing respect, even at a michelin-starred restaurant). i recommend grey, as it's about the most versatile color out there. the [outlier is a great option for these (albeit expensive), as they can work for when you're hiking if you plan on getting out there, as well as dining at a fancier restaurant. the nice denim works everywhere else, as the entire world wears denim (from the hottest states in india to paris or milan during fashion week), and it can take a beating and tends to hide stains. in warmer weather, bring a pair of shorts...the more versatile the better. rather than bringing a separate swimsuit, just bring a pair of outlier shorts, as they're dual purpose. **ocbds.** virtually the entire world wears collared shirts, and they can work in warm or cold climates (roll up the sleeves in the summer). bring one more than you think you'll need, as you'll likely end up staining one. (ocbd stands for ""oxford cloth button down"" and is formal enough for a night out but relaxed enough for a safari). you can get one made out of a more technical fabric or made of wool if you want to spend extra money, but i tend to stain shirts more than any other piece of clothing, so i generally go for cheaper shirts. **airism undershirts.** wicking, lightweight, and they pack small. cheaper than the fancier stuff, but still work really well. deep v-neck to prevent your undershirt from showing through on collared shirts. they also work wonderfully when hiking in warm clients or going for a run. [i like these **comfortable shoes.** a good pair of properly broken-in boots with a reasonable sole (i prefer the vibram 430) can work anywhere (nice restaurant to trails) and is my ideal, as they're classic and versatile, as well as being dual-purpose (hiking and dining). i generally recommend bringing a second option, both for the longevity of the shoes and to prevent blistering on consecutive long days with extensive walking. some people like a comfortable running shoe, but no matter what, make sure they're comfortable. **ex-officio underwear.** they don't stink, dry super quickly (shower in them at night, hang them up, and they'll be dry in the morning), and breathe well. a few pairs should be enough. are what i wear. **dark colors.** it hides sweat well, hides dirt well, and is generally considered a bit classier. textured fabrics can further help to hide stains, as they'll blend in with the mottled colors in the clothing. if you plan on hiking in warmer climates, bring one lighter colored shirt for that, to reflect sun rather than attract it. white is the enemy, as it will undoubtedly get stained...and unless you bring everything in white, dealing with bleach is just a pain in the ass. **bandanas.** not to be seen by the general public, but they work well as a handkerchief/sweat-rag, as well as sun protection when away from the city/people. **duffle bag.** half-full, and it can be used as a carryon bag even if the full bag would be way over carryon size. this gives you room to expand (buying things). i prefer [filson as they're classic, rugged, have a lifetime guarantee, and fit in at a campsite as well as a nice hotel. obviously, if you're planning to hike for days on end and are bringing everything, a true backpack makes sense...but barring that, a nice classic duffle looks better, functions better, and helps prevent you from sticking out like a sore thumb. certain trips call for a traditional backpack (if so, the only thing that matters is that it fits you well and has good accessibility to your stuff), but for everything else, i recommend a duffle. there are ""travel bags"" made by eagle creek that have certain features that can be ingenious, but i find those still make you stick out from the crowd. the less black nylon, the better. **female specific:** in many parts of the world, it will help you greatly to bring a long skirt or two, even if you're hiking or doing other physical exercise. if you have to, wear it over your pants, but you'll find that locals will be much more welcoming and open if you're wearing a skirt that covers your knees in an area where every woman where a skirt or dress than you would if you wear pants. my wife found this especially true while hiking in rural himalayan village in nepal and rural india and indonesia. this isn't about women's rights or anything like that, it's purely showing respect for the locals and being seen as one of them. making locals uncomfortable is rarely helpful for anyone involved, both at that moment and for years down the road for future travelers. **roll, don't fold.** roll your clothes. you'll save space, things will be less wrinkled, and it'll be easier to go through your bag. there are youtube videos on this to see more, and to each his/her own, but i have found this works best for me. **fit in.** it's not to be cool, it's so you're not targeted. targeted by thieves, targeted by touts, targeted by front desk staff who can see your desperation at the end of the day from a mile away. hotel fees will go up, you'll get the dreaded tourist menu (with double the rates as the regular menu), etc. the more you look like a local, the more you'll have a locals experience, which imho, is the reason to travel. to see the country the way their own people see it. you're also an ambassador of your country when you travel, so the less loud and obnoxious you can be, the better that will reflect on your country and everyone in it. this also means that you should dress like those around you, not the caricature of that (i.e. no mexican sombreros with dangling balls/fringe), as that can be seen as making fun of the culture and people of the country in which you're traveling. **relax.** generally speaking, you can buy whatever you need while you're abroad. people wear clothes all over the world, and while it may not be your absolute favorite shirt, if you're in need of a new shirt (yours is lost or ruined), you can find one wherever you are. sure, if you're 6'2"" and in japan that might be difficult, but it's still doable. relax and enjoy yourself...there's always a solution, and you're surrounded by people who will be happy to help. *clothing aside, here's a few other thoughts:* **usb drive.** always bring a large usb drive, to backup your photos as you take them, to transfer files from one computer to another, to store movies on an already full hard drive, etc. **unlocked phone.** relying on your home country's data/phone plan will cost you a small fortune, will often be unreliable, and will make you generally unreachable (locals won't want to call internationally to get a hold of you) and stick out (their caller id will be confusing when they get a call from an int'l number). ideally it will also have user replaceable batteries that will allow you to go without power for days on end. buy a local sim card (prepaid) and use all the damn data you want for a reasonable rate. **int'l travel adapter w/ replaceable fuses, plus extra fuses.** you want things to work everywhere/anywhere, and int'l power is often unreliable and can be tempermental (hence the add'l fuses). i recommend [this **surge protector/splitter.** rather than bringing 3 bulky travel adapters, bring one splitter. i recommend [this as it packs small and offers 4 outlets. **incognito passport wallet.** i carry a leather journal cover that fits a fieldnotes journal, and tuck my passport behind the fieldnotes journal when not going through customs. that way, when i leave my passport in my hotel or airbnb, if someone finds it, they think they just found a boring journal. i also keep one credit card here in case my daily wallet is stolen or lost. is the one that i use. i also use two of [these business card stuck to the backside of my field notes journal that's tucked into the pocket, one to hold a hidden credit card and the other to hold some hidden cash, both are separate from my regular wallet and are a just-in-case kinda thing. more on that in a moment. **us dollars.** i usually carry two $100 bills, just in case. i keep these hidden in my passport wallet/journal cover. us dollars are recognized everywhere, and can help to get you out of any jam. (crooked cops, declined debit card, etc) **photocopy of passport in wallet.** in case you're asked to show a passport while out and about and your passport is in your room, this is immensely helpful. scan of passport in email/on phone in case you lose that, or are robbed of everything you own. backups of backups here, as you really just don't want to be without it. **sort credit/debit cards before you leave.** make them aware of when/where you're leaving and which countries you're going to...and pad it with a few days at the end in case you get stuck. don't forget the countries that you have a layover in, as you could get stuck there, too. also, email yourself the international numbers for all your cards, both in case they're declined and in case you're robbed. if you're robbed and the only way to access the number for theft is on the back of the stolen credit card, you're going to have a heck of a time canceling it before the thieves start emptying your accounts. **zip ties and an itinerary (with email address) at the top of your bag.** write a note asking them to use a zip tie to ""lock"" the bag back up if they cut your locks to search your bag. this will help prevent others who aren't involved in security (usually monitored to prevent theft) from rifling through your bag and taking what you want. the itinerary with your email will help a lot more than a generic luggage tag with a phone number that won't reach you while you're abroad. your email won't change no matter where you are. the more info the better...hotel address, local contact/friend's phone number, dates, flight numbers, etc. **no nerdy neck wallet.** you'll be targeted by thieves from a mile away, is incredibly obvious under a shirt, and if someone tries to get it off you, it could potentially involve a knife near your throat when they try to cut the strap. if you want to do something like this, use one of the [small money pouches that has two belt that can be tucked inside of your pants. it's borderline invisible, and won't attract attention. do *not* carry all of your money in there, as it makes a lot more sense to keep it in your normal wallet, as it won't alert thieves to the possibility of a honeypot and you won't look as touristy. **international driver's license.** if you're planning on renting (even something as ""silly"" as an atv), you'll generally have a much easier time and it'll often be much cheaper. you can get one at your local aaa office with $15, a couple passport photos, and showing your state driver's license. you should also figure out international car insurance, as most domestic policies (i have state farm) won't cover you internationally. some credit cards, however, will have this insurance included for free (my barclays card will). bringing a few extra passport photos never hurts, either (worked for my scuba license). *note: this really is aimed at travel to a place where it might matter where you look. when traveling to the developing world, one can often get by with one pair of shorts, a pair of flip flops, and 2 t-shirts, so i understand that one's packing needs can vary greatly based on destination and itinerary. you may find this advice is worth what you paid for it (nothing).* i hope this helps. happy trails.",none,5

""no,"" i said, ""we do."" she cooed again and kissed my knee. ""tom. can you give me a kiss? just one kiss."" this was the weirdest thing that's happened to me since getting here. ""erm,"" i said, ""yes."" she leant in, her mouth wide open and i was officially scared. then her tongue came out, and it sort of bashed against my lips the way you'd imagine the alien from alien to kiss you. it was awful. she leant back, looked me in the eye and collapsed onto my chest. she leant back up. ""tom, me...i am very lonely. i do not like here in america. in new york. but i like london."" she kissed me again, and by kiss, i mean she smashed her tongue against me. she kept going on and on about how she doesn't feel pretty to london people, and when she asked how far away from london do i live, i said 2 hours, she got very excited. she points up to the other bunk, where the other guy is. ""him, erm. him is from messico, and he want to date. he want me girlfriend. buuuuuut, i don't like. i like london people."" she smashed her tongue against me once more, and said, ""tom, today. tomorrow and tomorrow. you my boyfriend? i be your girlfriend."" oh shit. ""i very lonely in new york."" i said, ""yes, okay."" ""are you single? you have girlfriend?"" ""yes, i'm single."" at that she got very excited and reiterated that we were a couple for the next two days. i think she'd been eating tuna, or something because that's all i can taste. for the last time, she smashed her tongue against me, said goodnight, and slunk off back up the ladder. that's it. i think she's asleep now, and i'm too afraid to sleep. thanks for reading **edit**; okay, today hasn't gone down half as creepy as last night. although, this morning to wake me up, she tapped me on the shoulder and when i woke up and turned round to see, she was smiling at me and saying good morning. lovely couple. **edit**; for those who wanted to keep updated with this, i was out all day (not with her) and returned to the hostel at maybe 11pm, this was when i saw her in the bar stroking the leg of another guy. they then got up and walked up the stairs. my first thought was that i would find them screwing in my bed, but when i got up there, she wasn't there, and i didn't see her all night. when i woke up this morning, she was gone, along with her stuff. i assume she's left.",none,5

4958f5ae-67fd-46a6-831c-5841a3ca2ffe,"how to discover new places, including ""off-the-beaten-path"" spots, and making the most of your trip","travelling off-the-beaten-path can be good for many reasons; “unspoiled” nature or charm, peace and quiet, photo opportunities without people getting in the way, more chances to talk to locals instead of staying within foreigner circles, cheaper entrance fees or restaurants, less touristy souvenirs and junk shops… but i’ll start off by saying that **this is not an “attack” on the-beaten-path travel**. there's a reason why there’s a beaten path, maybe because those monuments or sites have a lot of history and were important before international tourism was a thing, sometimes a place is simply very cool and everyone wants to go there, sometimes because it’s easy to access from the capital or along the way between sites, and it can be very good to visit the known places because it has signs in your language if the language barrier is something that makes you nervous, you don’t have to worry about getting lost, it’s your first time abroad or in that country and you aren’t ready to go off-the-beaten-path yet… and many of us just want to see machu picchu and the eiffel tower regardless of crowds or how “typical” it is. **there is no one right way of travelling**. my reason for making this post is simply because many times it can feel like we’ll be spending our time surrounded by crowds, or we’re questioning whether that cultural theme park is really our best option to get to know a country’s culture, or the sites just seem really expensive and there *has* to be a cheaper option, and sometimes it can be hard to know where to look to find these alternatives. here are some ideas on how to find some new spots: ## **discovering new places** **1. use google maps** i use google maps for everything. when i say “use google maps”, i mean this in many different ways: - **create a world map** and continuously add places to it, regardless of whether you’re planning a trip there. for example, i see a photo of the [csav in chile and i think “i’d like to see that!”. but by the time i actually go to chile, possibly many years from now, i’ll have forgotten the csav even exists. this is why, when i hear or see something i like, i put it on the map and it makes sure i remember them when the time comes to visit that area. [this is my current world - if you’ve already started planning a trip, **know where the places you’ll be visiting are**. “i was thinking of sleeping in tokyo and doing day trips to kyoto and nara from there”, as a japan travel consultant i hear things like this all the time, it’s because people haven’t really looked at a map. this can be helpful not only for understanding the geography and locations of the sites you’ll be going to, grouping sites together by areas so it’ll be easier and quicker to move around between them, but also to find other places along the way. say you’re going from beijing to shanghai, they’re far away, there’s probably something interesting to do along the way! what other stops does the bullet train do? do any names stand out on the map? is there a strange colour or water formation that looks interesting? sometimes you can simply ask someone who knows the country well: “hey, are there any worthwhile stops between shanghai and beijing?” - **look at the icons on google maps**. i was adding the notre dame in paris to my map and i realised there are so many things to do in the area, just by [looking at the i hadn’t heard of le palais du luxembourg, place dauphine, institut du monde arabe, musée carnavalet… these may not be off-the-beaten-path, but it’s still a quick and easy way to discover things. &amp;nbsp; **2. let images guide you** - the first thing i always do when starting to plan a trip to a new destination is open google images and type in “(country) tourism”. so if i’m planning a trip to slovenia, is what’ll come out. lake bled, piran, skocjan caves, ljubljana, styria’s wine fields, postojna cave and kamnik are places that i hear about first of all. now that i know something about the country, i can add these to my map if the photos look interesting (i don’t research anything about them yet, i’ll do that later, this is purely judging from an image search) and i’ll have enough for the next steps. - look up the places individually. often when you google a place, other suggestions will come up. for example, [here i am searching for the viti and, as you can see, at the top there are other recommendations: hrossaborg horse city, hverarönd namafjall […], myvatn nature baths… these are sometimes things that others have searched for when looking up the viti crater, sometimes they can be nearby spots, sometimes it’s places that aren’t even in the same country but are similar… open them all! [the can be used similarly. - related to above is another google images feature, [“related when you click on an image. make sure to look at the different images featured and often the title or description will have the name of the other place. it’s a good way to find similar places often at the other side of the country or simply cheaper / lesser known. after about an hour of doing these two things, is what my map of iceland looked like, pink the places i thought were really cool, they’ll be my must-sees, and brown the regular-cool places to visit if i have spare time. - **search for abstract places**. “vietnam waterfall”, “algeria caves”, “germany modern statues”… whatever! you know what you like, so search for that thing specifically. i always search for ruins and caves and history museums. many of these sites may not appear in guide books but they are often worth a visit because you’ve searched for that thing knowing it was something you’d enjoy. - not just sites, but **restaurants and/or hotels too**! just search “tanzania restaurants” and you can find some amazing for foodies especially, sometimes making a visit to a town or city especially so you can eat at that specific place can make the trip much more worthwhile than if you’re simply going with what you find next to the museum. - **use the local language**! if you’re going to france you can search for “cave”, but searching for “grotte” may give you some different options. - **get lost in pinterest**. once you’ve found a cool image on pinterest about the country you’re going to, just let yourself wander around looking at the other images and places you’ll find there. i especially like pinterest because they are images posted by people who have no clue about the place (and i say this with all the respect in the world, it’s an advantage!). even though pinterest is full of this image, nobody who goes to japan would actually go to the [spiral simply because it’s in the middle of *nowhere* and many people (who don’t use pinterest) don’t know it exists. because people of pinterest haven’t been to the places they post, they are not suggestions “tainted” by how easy or difficult it is to visit them, how close or far away they are, how expensive it is, etc. they are purely suggestions based on how good they look. if that’s what you’re looking for, not biased opinions but simply *places*, then this is one of the best options to look. &amp;nbsp; **3. just ask people!** this may seem very obvious, but i think sometimes many of us forget to do this, simply ask people who know the place well or live there what their favourite places are. i live in barcelona and every autumn i make a trip to i also really like [la fageda d'en i don’t know if foreign visitors go there often, but i really think they should if they like nature. people who know the country will know about places that tourists don’t. &amp;nbsp; ## **making the most of your trip** **1. determining your must-sees** what i like: traditional architecture and history (especially prehistory), volcanoes, caves and rocks, temples (bonus points if secluded), ruins and castles, listening to people speak other languages (actual interaction not required). some will think that once you visit one castle then you’ve kind of seen them all; some will visit some ruins and stay there for under an hour because “there wasn’t much to see”; some will prefer to simply read the pamphlet at the entrance instead of building family trees and timelines before their trip; some will get frustrated about the lack of communication and signs they don’t understand or not having anyone to talk to when they travel alone to a foreign country where nobody speaks your language. i don’t like bars and pubs because i don’t drink, amusement parks are terrible because they’re expensive and i’m scared of heights. i don’t want to waste my time at beaches abroad considering i’m from spain and spend almost half the year at the beach anyway. that’s okay! other people’s tastes will be different, that’s the whole point, *people’s tastes are different*. don’t be afraid or embarrassed to say “nah, i’ll pass and do something cooler for me”. **you have limited time on your trip** and you should spend that time doing something you really enjoy. don’t add places that people say are “must-sees” to your list simply because they’re *supposed* to be really good, go to that place that you thought was interesting, even if others will shrug at it. i think this is the most important thing about travelling: **do what you love above anything else**. i made this mistake many times on my first solo trip, and sometimes i still think “well, it’s really famous, so i should go there”, but i can confidently say that my favourite places are the ones that i went out of my way to see simply because *i* was excited about them. this doesn’t mean going off the beaten track is best, sometimes what you’ll want to do is visit a very common place, and that’s a good option too, just make sure you’re visiting that place because *you* want to, and not because other people say it’s really good. **there are no universal must-sees, only personal ones**, you can’t do everything so choose what you love. somewhat related to this is another point: **people have different budgets when travelling**. i’m a backpacker. i’m not going to pay 29,000 yen for a jr pass to ride the bullet train up and down in japan, that’s about the amount of money i spend for 11-12 nights in a hostel. i’ll use the night bus and arrive to kyoto at 5am with a crick in my neck but *for me* it will be worth it, what a bargain! others wouldn’t dream of travelling like this. it all boils down to **people having different priorities**. think about what your priorities are. &amp;nbsp; **2. avoiding crowds** people-watching can be entertaining, but sometimes we just really want a place to ourselves. there are many ways to go about this, even for the most famous sites. - the easiest way is simply to **wake up early**. if it’s a museum, residence, castle or any other place with an opening time, you’ll want to be there as soon as it opens. if it doesn’t have an opening time because it’s outside, it’s a building, observation decks and scenic views, etc., go even earlier. many people don’t like waking up early when they’re on holiday and tour buses tend to arrive around 10-11am. sometimes this will work and sometimes it won’t, but i’ve found that it is generally the most successful way. - **go when nobody else wants to go**. is it raining? fantastic! few tourists go outside in the rain, make the most of it and go to all the outdoor sites then. - **backstreets exist too, go for a walk!** i often walk to a site if it’s around or under 30min instead of taking the bus, sometimes that’s more interesting than the actual site itself. - **the closer to the capital, the more popular it will be**. i say capital, but really any popular destination city works. for example, everyone goes to the blue lagoon in iceland, but there are similar alternatives for hot spring bathing around the country. if that’s an option for you, perhaps simply go out a bit further. &amp;nbsp; **3. travel isn’t only about which places you want to see, but also about experiences** do you have a bucket list? perhaps you should. many people don’t like them, but i personally do, this is just a suggestion. a bucket list isn’t supposed to be a checklist, it’s a reminder. it doesn’t even have to be in the form of a list, it can be a folder on your computer full of images or ideas, it can be a folder of newspaper cutouts, a blog where you repost interesting things you want to do, etc. i mean things such as “use a pottery wheel; learn how to snowboard; meet a nun”. something i’ve always wanted to do is throw a message in a bottle into the sea. i took the ferry from italy back home and i realised later on that it would’ve been a perfect opportunity to try it out, but i didn’t remember at the time! doing these things in a different country can be more exciting than doing them at home, because it’s a moment in which you have the time to try new things. when you travel, think of things you want to try and do, not just see. &amp;nbsp; **4. travel ethically** i won’t get into this too much because everyone draws the line in different places when it comes to morality, this isn’t supposed to be a controversial post. but i want to at least mention it because i think it’s quite important. nothing is going to ruin your trip more than coming to spain to see bullfighting and ending up upset because you didn’t know exactly what bullfighting in spain is like, or riding an elephant in thailand and later learning about what happens behind-the-scenes. are you buying your souvenirs from someone who is harming the local community or economy by importing products or underpaying their workers? are you visiting an aquarium that gets its dolphins from the same people who kill and eat dolphins? are you going to shifen in taiwan to release paper lanterns without having in mind the serious environmental problems that these lanterns suppose? it’s impossible to know about everything, many times you have to look this up yourself because nobody is going to tell you, but especially when it comes to animals; try to know before you go. &amp;nbsp; well then, this is where i end my monologue. i hope this has helped any of you who may have been having trouble planning a trip, or at the very least start an interesting discussion in the comments. if you feel i missed anything important, feel free to add below!",none,5

92947e28-d779-44bb-9ef9-dbdf4c8ef58a,the piratebay press release concerning sopa... -and the mass media in general. you've got to give it to them : they couldnt be more right on this one.,"i put the original text here below since its blocked in most countries (and also since it's under (k)-license...). [original] ___________________________________________________________ internets, 18th of january 2012. press release, for immediate release. over a century ago thomas edison got the patent for a device which would ""do for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear"". he called it the kinetoscope. he was not only amongst the first to record video, he was also the first person to own the copyright to a motion picture. because of edisons patents for the motion pictures it was close to financially impossible to create motion pictures in the north american east coast. the movie studios therefor relocated to california, and founded what we today call hollywood. the reason was mostly because there was no patent. there was also no copyright to speak of, so the studios could copy old stories and make movies out of them - like fantasia, one of disneys biggest hits ever. so, the whole basis of this industry, that today is screaming about losing control over immaterial rights, is that they circumvented immaterial rights. they copied (or put in their terminology: ""stole"") other peoples creative works, without paying for it. they did it in order to make a huge profit. today, they're all successful and most of the studios are on the fortune 500 list of the richest companies in the world. congratulations - it's all based on being able to re-use other peoples creative works. and today they hold the rights to what other people create. if you want to get something released, you have to abide to their rules. the ones they created after circumventing other peoples rules. the reason they are always complainting about ""pirates"" today is simple. we've done what they did. we circumvented the rules they created and created our own. we crushed their monopoly by giving people something more efficient. we allow people to have direct communication between eachother, circumventing the profitable middle man, that in some cases take over 107% of the profits (yes, you pay to work for them). it's all based on the fact that we're competition. we've proven that their existance in their current form is no longer needed. we're just better than they are. and the funny part is that our rules are very similar to the founding ideas of the usa. we fight for freedom of speech. we see all people as equal. we believe that the public, not the elite, should rule the nation. we believe that laws should be created to serve the public, not the rich corporations. the pirate bay is truly an international community. the team is spread all over the globe - but we've stayed out of the usa. we have swedish roots and a swedish friend said this: the word sopa means ""trash"" in swedish. the word pipa means ""a pipe"" in swedish. this is of course not a coincidence. they want to make the internet inte a one way pipe, with them at the top, shoving trash through the pipe down to the rest of us obedient consumers. the public opinion on this matter is clear. ask anyone on the street and you'll learn that noone wants to be fed with trash. why the us government want the american people to be fed with trash is beyond our imagination but we hope that you will stop them, before we all drown. sopa can't do anything to stop tpb. worst case we'll change top level domain from our current .org to one of the hundreds of other names that we already also use. in countries where tpb is blocked, china and saudi arabia springs to mind, they block hundreds of our domain names. and did it work? not really. to fix the ""problem of piracy"" one should go to the source of the problem. the entertainment industry say they're creating ""culture"" but what they really do is stuff like selling overpriced plushy dolls and making 11 year old girls become anorexic. either from working in the factories that creates the dolls for basically no salary or by watching movies and tv shows that make them think that they're fat. in the great sid meiers computer game civilization you can build wonders of the world. one of the most powerful ones is hollywood. with that you control all culture and media in the world. rupert murdoch was happy with myspace and had no problems with their own piracy until it failed. now he's complainting that google is the biggest source of piracy in the world - because he's jealous. he wants to retain his mind control over people and clearly you'd get a more honest view of things on wikipedia and google than on fox news. some facts (years, dates) are probably wrong in this press release. the reason is that we can't access this information when wikipedia is blacked out. because of pressure from our failing competitors. we're sorry for that. the pirate bay, (k)2012",none,5

225e2ef0-32d2-4e08-bfc7-b8fe591e334c,unveiling a pyramid scheme,"a family member has had a long history being drawn to pyramid schemes. this is the latest iteration. because math sadly isn’t quite my forte, i thought it might be interesting to offer it up to reddit and see what other people’s take is on it. i guess i’m curious to see the scheme unveiled a little more thoroughly than i could unveil it on my own. it’s called ‘the triangle’. *chuckles* here’s how it works: x xx xxxx xxxxxxxx let’s call each x an investor. there are four levels and 15 investors in total. let’s refer to the topmost level as level one, and the bottom as level four. the theory is that all of the money contained within this pyramid is gifted to the investor who has reached level one. that is 75k (5k x 15). alternately, if the investor reaching level one does not contribute, which makes more sense, that total comes down to 70k (5k x 14). therefore, 70k is the total contained within the pyramid every time a payout is granted. so let’s take that as our total moving forward; 70k is paid out to the investor at level one. upon reaching level one, every investor will have been in the pyramid 4 times. each will have contributed 3 times; once for each of levels four, three, and two. each investor contributes 15k (5k x 3) and walk away with a 55k gain after reaching level one (70k - 15k). sounds pretty good, right? in order for the pyramid to keep its shape, for there to be only 1 benefactor at level one, 2 at level two, and 4 at level three, this pyramid must help build more pyramids. so how does that work? let’s call them turns. each turn (each time people move up the pyramid), 1 of the 2 investors at level two reaches level one in a different pyramid, 2 of the investors at level three join a different pyramid (reaching level two), and 4 of the investors at level four join a different pyramid (reaching level three). this means that every turn, 7 people move to a new pyramid. and that’s ok, so long as every empty spot is filled, the pyramid keeps its shape and always holds 70k. so that is our final number: 55k (70k - 15k). that is the maximum gain one can make. that’s if the investor walks away; if they decide to no longer partake in the pyramid (the idea, though, is that they’d ideally like to see you invest anew). given that it takes 14 investors in order for 1 to get the jackpot, it naturally follows that it takes 210 investors in order for all 15 investors present in the first pyramid to get the same. and in the midst of this process, some 14 more pyramids have been created, 8 new investors walking in each time at level four. so by the time each of the 15 souls in the first pyramid has won its share, 112 more (8 x 14) are hoping for the same, and because it takes 14 investors in order for 1 to see that dream come true, it’ll take 1568 investors (112 x 14) for them to ever reach the top. and on and on, forever. so aside from the obvious (that the only way to sustain these pyramids is by constantly dragging more people into the fold), i’m curious to see if any of you can shine a light on other potential problems with this pyramid scheme.",none,5

""is $200 too much?"" nope. $200 is fine. shut up and take my money... i was now the proud owner of a [1969 volkswagen fast forward again.... after a new $300 vw engine and some misc used interior parts i got from a vw scrap yard, i was on my way. my girlfriend at the time and i had planned to take the bus to colorado to go and see the avett brothers at red rocks. well, she broke up with me the week before... and i was pretty bummed as we had been dating for awhile... i considered not going to the concert, and just moping around at home. but, i already had the tickets and the time off from work, so i decided to say ""screw it, i'm going alone."" so i left... i got in my bus, grabbed my tickets, and got on the road. i had no idea that this trip would help me grow as a person so much. a three day trip would turn into a two week trip that i would never forget. the concert was great! i met a girl from the netherlands on couchsurfing and we went together! she was a foreign exchange student exploring the states before she had to fly back. she was traveling all across the country alone...hitchhiking! i am still amazed by that. well, at red rocks, i treated her to her first [philly cheese steak we parted ways after the show.. she had actually randomly found some friends that she had gone to school with in canada at the concert and took off with them! so i was on my own.. i drove up to the colorado rocky mountains and made camp in the first place i found. my adventure would really begin the next day. i awoke to the fresh mountain air and to a very cold vw bus... if you're at all familiar with vws, you'll know they don't offer much in the way of heat. i decided to go to one of my favorite places in the world, boulder, colorado. i spent the afternoon exploring pearl street, and i [made a new i decided to go and explore boulder canyon... i drove up the steep winding road, and came upon a town called nederland! i was searching for an alleged camp spot that i had heard about, that was supposedly nestled on the other side of the flatirons and offered a really amazing view. i continued driving through nederland. i visited the [worlds largest operational steam [found more and on the outside of this tiny town i picked up two hitchhikers. their names were carlos, and juan carlos, and they were just traveling around from mexico! i gave them a lift, about two miles up the road to where they were camping. they asked me if i wanted to make camp with them, but i was still in search of the famed camp spot i had heard of. they told me if i changed my mind that they would be down the road. well, i consulted my map, i ended up getting lost, and taking a pretty rough dirt road all the way back around the mountain and down into boulder... so, i went back up the road to nederland, realizing i wouldn't find my spot, and i decided to go camp with the mexicans. this is where it gets interesting.....i arrived at the road where i dropped them off, and just started to drive.. i followed the road for several miles, signs promising campsites ahead. i took a gamble and turned at a side road, and man oh man, i had no idea what i had just gotten myself into... a hippie camp, and i was in a hippie van... several hippies ran towards me, yelling ""bus driver, bus driver, pull over!"" i stopped... their leader, a man who called himself ""spongey,"" who lived in a school bus that he had named sparky and ate only grilled cheese sandwiches, approached me and asked if i needed a place to make camp... [i accepted, and pulled up and parked next to the old short several other travelers had made camp there, and later, a kid about my age who was traveling around the country in his mitsubishi evo pulled up to camp and joined us... this was the most interesting night of my life. we were sitting around a camp fire, late at night, singing songs around the fire, and being a typical hippie commune. a sheriff approached us. now the first thing that freaked me out was the sheriff's accent. he was irish... an irish sheriff in colorado!? he asked us if we had seen a woman named samantha walking around with her german shepard... it was the middle of the night, she was not all there (mentally), and had run off into the middle of the woods, and they were worried for her safety. we said we would keep an eye out and he left. at that point, i was slightly sketched out (crazy lady running around in the woods with a killer dog? yeah, no thanks) i retired to my bus, locked the doors, folded out the bed and fell asleep. i woke up pretty early, made some breakfast, and said goodbye to my friends. for the next few days, i explored the wonderful mountains and camped in solitude. i became really self reliant, and it was really really awesome to be out of service and totally disconnected for a few days. [this was my home during that i decided it was time to go back to civilization (i was also out of pancake mix and had to restock... pancakes were a staple in my diet... you'd be surprised how many different ways you can eat pancakes.) i headed back down, and decided i should probably start making my way back north, towards home... now, i could of just gone straight home, and been there that evening, but i felt that my adventure was not ready to be over. i took an old highway and headed to the famous teton mountains in wyoming. it was a grueling 11 hour drive, and i got to jackson around 11pm. i spent another few hours driving to different campsites seeing if there was any open spots.. nope, things were looking pretty bleak. this is where my bus saved me. my vw has grateful dead paint all over it, as her previous owner had followed the dead in her pretty much all throughout the 70s and early 80s. i lucked out, because this dude who was a huge dead fan saw me driving around. it just so happened he worked with the student conservation organization, and he was due to have a ton of campers show up tomorrow to do trail maintenance around the national parks, and he had 3 reserved camp spots that were currently vacant. he was nice enough to let me stay as long as i would be gone in the morning. i traded him some bratwursts that we cooked over the fire, and two peacock feathers (my trade item of choice...you can get anything you want with peacock feathers). we talked for a good hour, took my bus for a drive around the campground (he really wanted to drive it so, we went for a short cruise!), and then we went to bed. i got up pretty early the next morning, packed up, and headed back to jackson. i had heard that there was a place that you could get a $5 shower, so i decided to pay them a visit. i took my shower, parked in the parking lot to cook breakfast (pancakes of course), and then it happened. [my volkswagen fell in sadly, i had to yank her away from her new boyfriend, and we continued on the road. [we stopped to see the drove through yellowstone, and finally headed towards our native big horn mountains to get to home. this final day was my favorite day. although it was not filled with much more than driving, there was a lot of time to think, and to be alive.
